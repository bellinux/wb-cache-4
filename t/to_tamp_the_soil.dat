50|$|Earthbag {{construction}} uses {{very little}} energy {{compared to other}} durable construction methods. Unlike concrete, brick or wood, no energy is needed to produce the earthen fill other than gathering soil. If on-site soil is used, little energy is needed for transportation. Unlike rammed earth construction, only human labor energy is required <b>to</b> <b>tamp</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> lightly. The energy-intensive materials that are used — plastic (for bags & twine), steel wire, and perhaps the outer shell of plaster or stucco — are used in relatively small quantities compared to other types of construction, often totaling less than 5% of the building materials. Buildings {{last a long time}} when maintained. However, if 'raw' or unstabilized soil is used as fill, when the building is no longer useful the earthen fill can be recycled into either garden areas, backfill, or new earthen buildings.|$|E

50|$|The upper cup {{is loaded}} with freshly ground coffee. The grounds are then {{compressed}} (i.e., <b>tamped)</b> with <b>the</b> stemmed disc into a uniform layer across the cup's pierced bottom. The coarser the coffee grinds, the more one has <b>to</b> <b>tamp</b> <b>the</b> coffee <b>to</b> retain the same extraction. With the press disc left in place, the upper cup is nested {{into the top of}} the tumbler and boiling water is poured inside. The lid is placed on top, and the device is left to slowly drip the brewed coffee into the bottom. The chicory holds on to the hot water a little longer, letting the water dissolve and extract more of the coffee grinds.|$|R
50|$|The female begins nesting five to {{six weeks}} after mating. Digging the nests is often {{difficult}} in hard <b>soil.</b> <b>The</b> female may urinate to soften <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> before using her hind legs to dig a chamber about 10 by 20 cm in about {{three and a half}} hours. Inexperienced females often dig several partial nests, and even experienced females may abandon a nest they are working on and start another. When the nest is ready, she lowers her tail as deep into the nest as she can and deposits an egg every 30 to 120 seconds. She recovers <b>the</b> nest and <b>tamps</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> down. Females get better at digging, covering, and camouflaging nests over time. After it is covered and hidden, she often gets a long drink of water, then finds a shelter and rest. Very rarely, a red-footed tortoise lays eggs on the surface, or within a patch of cacti.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} few {{remarkable}} incidents involving the guns over the centuries.

One day in June 1895, the gun fired at 10:30 rather than 12:00 when a spider interfered with the relay used to remotely fire the gun. On Friday 7 January 2005, both the main gun and backup gun failed to fire owing to a technical difficulty. This {{was the first time in}} 200 years that the noon gun had not fired as scheduled.|$|R
30|$|When {{the fresh}} {{pervious}} concrete was moulded, both <b>the</b> <b>tamping</b> and vibrating methods {{were used in}} <b>the</b> study. <b>The</b> <b>tamping</b> rod was utilized <b>to</b> <b>tamp</b> <b>the</b> fresh pervious concrete for 3 times in the procedure when the material reached 1 / 3, 2 / 3 {{and all of the}} mould volume. Then the mould was put onto the vibrating table for 5  s of vibration, after which the surface was carefully smoothed by a steel disc. When the moulding process was finished, all the specimens were immediately coated with a plastic membrane which had been brushed with oil to minimize the influence of water evaporation on cement hydration and strength growth. Demoulding started as soon as the specimens were cured in the curing room for 24  h, and then the specimens were cured by the method of sprinkling water until the 28  days age was reached.|$|R
40|$|One- and {{two-dimensional}} multigroup radiation hydrodynamics simulations {{have been}} performed to investigate {{the motion of the}} gold plasma generated at the surface of the embedded gold cone in a re-entrant cone-guided inertial confinement fusion capsule. The effect of deuterium-tritium (DT) ice layers, and other possible tampers, of varying thickness, upon the motion of the gold cone plasma has been investigated. The effect of the x-ray drive spectrum incident upon the ice layer is also explored. Ice is shown <b>to</b> <b>tamp</b> <b>the</b> expansion of the gold cone, and whilst denser materials are shown to be more effective in this role, ice does not pollute the ignition region with intermediate- Z ions, which, though preferable to gold contamination, also tend to inhibit the attainment of high fuel-ion temperatures. © 2007 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

30|$|The mining {{technology}} {{is the same as}} the traditional mining. Backfilling and mining work in parallel. Backfill proceeds from the tail to the head of the backfilling conveyor. After the material is accumulated to a certain height the next unloading hole is open and a machine rammer presses a <b>tamping</b> slab <b>to</b> <b>tamp</b> <b>the</b> material. This process would be repeated until the material has been sufficiently tamped and in general, it takes two or three cycles. The first round of backfilling would pause after the face has been fully filled. The backfilling conveyor then moves forward toward the head of the back beam and the compactor pushes all of the material that remains under the backfilling conveyor back and above till solid material reaches the roof. In this way, the material is being pushed toward the roof and compacted. Finally, close the unloading holes to back fill the space below the conveyor headpiece. After the first back filling cycle is completed, the conveyor would be pushed to the end of the back beam to start another cycle.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Damping ditch was dug {{beside the}} {{underground}} pipeline {{so as to}} prevent housing from damage and reduce displacement of underground pipelines caused by dynamic vibration. Different damping ditches were simulated and field measurement was tested. Research shows that vibration and squeezing effect cannot be neglected, and damping ditch can decrease the vibration and squeezing effect. The deeper and nearer to the housing the damping ditch is, the better the damping effect is. The underground pipelines displacement is slight, when the damping ditch is between underground pipelines and tamping points and {{much closer to the}} former. Otherwise, if the damping ditch is considerably closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tamping</b> points, <b>the</b> displacement is comparatively large...|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} that seizures cease spontaneously, but {{it is much more}} probable that some changes in the brain create inhibitory signals that serve <b>to</b> <b>tamp</b> down <b>the</b> overactive neurons and effectively end the seizure. Opioid peptides {{have been shown to be}} involved in the postictal state and are at times anticonvulsive, and adenosine has also been implicated as a molecule potentially involved in terminating seizures. Evidence for the theory of active inhibition lies in the postictal refractory period, a period of weeks or even months following a series of seizures in which seizures cannot be induced (using animal models and a technique called kindling, in which seizures are induced with repeated electrical stimulation).|$|R
50|$|In northwestern Europe, spiders of {{the family}} Lycosidae are the most {{frequent}} prey for P. cinereus, spiders of the families Gnaphosidae, Zoridae, Clubionidae, Pisauridae, and Thomisidae have also been recorded as prey, albeit with much less frequency than Lycosidae. P. cinereus locates in the sand or encounters on the surface a prey individual which is stung into immobility. The prey is then transported by the wasp, which holds the prey in its mandibles and walks forwards. Most frequently, the prey is temporarily interred whilst a suitable nest site is sought and a burrow excavated. Significant time and effort may be spent on trial burrows before a site is finally selected. When the nest is complete, the prey may {{be taken to the}} entrance and carried in. The prey spider is carried into a terminal cell big enough to accommodate both wasp and prey. The egg is laid on the upper forward part the prey's abdomen. The wasp then closes the burrow, pulling in the walls and roof with its mandibles and then <b>tamping</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> with <b>the</b> tip of the abdomen. The spider in the cell recovers from paralysis some time between 3 and 6 hours after being stung and begins to walk aimlessly about the cell, spinning silk continuously resulting in a silk-lined cell of considerable structural integrity. After three days, the small larva emerges from the egg and begins to consume the trapped spider, killing it by consuming its abdomen.|$|R

The wasps hunted by actively walking {{on the surface of the}} vegetation, intermittently flicking their wings but stayed in the outer layers of leaves and did not enter into deeper cover. The only prey observed as an adult female Eriophora ravilla which the wasp had placed in vegetation 8cm above the ground, while the wasp excavated a burrow 1.2m away. The burrow was excavated in bare sand among dried pine needles, the wasp used her mandibles to break the crust on the surface of the sand, and then used her forelimbs to excavate the looser sand, which was removed by the wasp backing out to a distance of 10-13cm. Her digging activities got faster as she neared completion of the burrow, occasionally interrupting her efforts to inspect and move the prey. To move the prey it was dragged backwards over the ground and under the vegetation while the wasp held it by the base of the hind femur. before placing the spider in the nest she carried out further excavation and appeared to line the nest with dried pine needles which she carried into the burrow, then the spider was grabbed by its chelicerae and dragged into the burrow.
