5|$|Silent Hill 3 {{received}} positive reviews, garnering an 85/100 rating at Metacritic for the PlayStation 2 version, and a 72/100 {{rating for}} <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> version. <b>The</b> <b>PC</b> version fared less well, with some reviewers drawing unfavourable comparisons to other combat-based games found on <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> platform, while others highlighted some technical issues, such as poor gamepad controller support.|$|E
5|$|The game's ending {{depends on}} the PC's choice. If <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> chooses to become a vampire, former allies turn against <b>the</b> <b>PC.</b> Once they are defeated, Orbakh sends <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> to destroy the Ebon Claws. If <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> instead decides to keep the mask, Orbakh attacks; after his defeat, {{the leader of the}} Ebon Claws arrives with a group of {{followers}} and attacks the party. After the party is victorious, they kill the last of the Night Masks and free the player character from the cursed mask.|$|E
50|$|Most polls from 2011 onward showed <b>the</b> <b>PCs</b> losing {{badly to}} the Wildrose.

On June 18, 2013, <b>the</b> Alberta <b>PCs</b> passed their Ontario counterparts as the second-longest running provincial government in Canadian history; <b>the</b> Ontario <b>PCs</b> spent 42 consecutive years in office from 1943 to 1985.|$|R
25|$|As well, for {{the first}} time since <b>the</b> 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>PCs</b> faced a {{challenge}} from the right wing, the upstart Wildrose Alliance Party. A November 2009 poll said the new party had 28% support, just 6 points behind <b>the</b> governing <b>PCs.</b> In polls, <b>the</b> Wildrose Party had a double digit lead over <b>the</b> <b>PCs</b> in December 2009, with 39% versus 25% each for <b>the</b> <b>PCs</b> and Alberta Liberals.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} adventures for {{characters}} of various experience point levels.

5|$|During her premiership {{support for}} Dunderdale, her {{government}} and <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> Party saw a steady decline. A Corporate Research Associates (CRA) poll released days after Dunderdale became premier, and conducted before she took office, showed that 90 per {{cent of the}} population were satisfied with <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> government. 75 per cent would vote for the Progressive Conservative Party in an election and 76 percent chose Williams as the best leader to be premier. A CRA poll conducted throughout February 2011, showed that support for Dunderdale, her government and <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> Party remained high. Satisfaction with government was at 82 per cent, while 73 per cent {{of respondents said they}} would vote for <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> Party in an election. 64 per cent of respondents stated Dunderdale was the best choice for premier, compared to 18 per cent for Liberal leader Yvonne Jones and 5 per cent for Lorraine Michael. An Angus Reid Public Opinion (Angus Reid) poll conducted around the same time listed Dunderdale as the second most popular premier in Canada with a 55 percent approval rating. 10 percent of respondents disapproved of her performance while 35 percent were not sure if they approved or disapproved of her performance.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>PC</b> port was {{outsourced}} by Eidos Montréal by Nixxes Software, {{who also}} worked with Eidos on multiple projects including <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> port of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. The decision to outsource <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> port was made because the team {{wanted to make a}} quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a deep understanding of the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> and console versions were as close as possible in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a DirectX 11 that <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra anti-aliasing options. The controls and HUD were customized to work with a computer keyboard. The initial response to the announcement of <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by Advanced Micro Devices. The game was also ported to Apple Inc.'s OS X platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the porting was handled by Feral Interactive, who had made a name for themselves porting titles such as Bioshock and Max Payne to the platform.|$|E

The party eventually learns that the Night Masks are led by vampires, and additional clues lead them to the vampires' catacombs. After defeating the vampire Latasha, <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> travels through a portal to reach the chamber of the Night Masks' leader, Orbakh. Orbakh gives <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> the choice to either become a vampire or keep the cursed mask.|$|E
5|$|To {{maximize}} {{their chances of}} success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> version. Eidos Interactive, whose release of Tomb Raider had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port. The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time. To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a triangular shape for the cover and box. They agreed on a contract price of $1.8 million, making initial sales forecasts of 100,000 units based on that outlay. <b>The</b> <b>PC</b> version was released in North America and Europe on June 25, 1998; the port was not released in Japan.

30|$|Principal {{component}} analysis {{is a well-known}} multivariate analysis used to summarize multidimensional correlated data. The analysis finds principal components (PC) from several explanatory variables. <b>The</b> <b>PCs</b> are created such that <b>the</b> first <b>PC</b> accounts for <b>the</b> maximum variation, <b>the</b> second <b>PC</b> accounts for {{as much of the}} remaining variation as possible, and so forth. Since <b>the</b> <b>PCs</b> are not correlated with each other, irrelevant and unstable information is discarded. Only the most relevant and stable part of the variation is used. Standardized climate factors were analyzed using principal {{component analysis}} (Excel Tokei 2008, Social Survey Research Information Co., Ltd.).|$|R
