She called it [...] "dangerous to say that biologists should have a monopoly on truth and ethics." ...|$|E

According to Rimmer, games were not competitive there, and everyone won a [...] "you're really special" [...] trophy on sports day.

The remix featured new rhythm tracks recorded by bassist Arthur Barrow and drummer Chad Wackerman, {{much as the}} 1984 remix of We're Only in It for the Money had featured. Zappa stated [...] "The master tapes for Ruben and the Jets were in better shape, but since I liked the results on We're Only in it For the Money, I {{decided to do it}} on Ruben too. But those are the only two albums on which the original performances were replaced. I thought the important <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> material itself." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{combination}} of size, weight, range and agility {{was a source}} of amazement to Callas's own contemporaries. One of the choristers present at her La Scala debut in I vespri siciliani recalled, [...] "My God! She came on stage sounding like our deepest contralto, Cloe Elmo. And before the evening was over, she took a high E-flat. And it was twice as strong as Toti Dal Monte's!" [...] In the same vein, mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato said: [...] "The first time we sang together was in Mexico in 1950, where she sang the top E-flat in the second-act finale of Aida. I can still remember the effect of that note in the opera house—it was like a star!" [...] For Italian soprano Renata Tebaldi, [...] "the most fantastic <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> possibility for her to sing the soprano coloratura with this [...] voice! This was something really special. [...] absolutely!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1777-78, the {{conflict}} with her ruling son erupted {{and she was a}} central figure in the great succession scandal regarding the legitimacy of the crown prince. In 1777, her two younger sons, Charles and Frederick Adolf, visited her. They claimed all women at court had lovers, and that with the exception of their mother, they could not think of even one who did not. Louisa Ulrika suggested that surely the queen must also be an exception. In reply, her sons laughed and asked her if she had not heard of the rumors that Sophia Magdalena had an affair with Fredrik Munck. She became very upset and ordered prince Charles to investigate if this were true, as his inheritance to the throne would be endangered by [...] "the common offspred of a common nobleman". Charles talked to Munck, Munck talked to king Gustav, Gustav talked to Charles who claimed the whole <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fault of the queen dowager, which resulted in a great conflict between mother and son. When the son of the king was born in 1778, rumours pointed out him as the son of Munck. Louisa Ulrika accused the king of having another man father his child. A great scandal erupted, during which the king even threatened to exile her to Pomerania. In the following conflict, her youngest children, Sofia Albertina and Frederick, who had always been her favourites, took her side against the king. Louisa Ulrika was forced to make a formal statement, during which she withdrew her accusation. The statement was signed by the entire adult royal family except the royal couple; two princes, the princess, the Duchess, and six members of parliament. The relationship with Gustav was not repaired until she was on her deathbed. She died in Svartsjö.|$|E
