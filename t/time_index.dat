2500|$|Note {{that there}} is no {{definitive}} agreement in the literature on the use of some of the terms that signify special cases of Markov processes. Usually the term [...] "Markov chain" [...] is reserved for a process with a discrete set of times, i.e. a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), but a few authors use the term [...] "Markov process" [...] to refer to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) without explicit mention. In addition, there are other extensions of Markov processes that are referred to as such but do not necessarily fall within any of these four categories (see Markov model). Moreover, the <b>time</b> <b>index</b> need not necessarily be real-valued; like with the state space, there are conceivable processes that move through index sets with other mathematical constructs. Notice that the general state space continuous-time Markov chain is general {{to such a degree that}} it has no designated term.|$|E

40|$|A big bucket <b>time</b> <b>indexed</b> mixed integer linear {{programming}} formulation for nonpreemptive single machine scheduling problems {{is presented in}} which the length of each period can be {{as large as the}} processing time of the shortest job. The model generalises the classical <b>time</b> <b>indexed</b> model to one in which at most two jobs can be processing in each period. The two models are equivalent in the case that the shortest job has unit processing time. For larger minimum processing times the big bucket model can have significantly fewer variables and nonzeros than the <b>time</b> <b>indexed</b> model at the expense of a greater number of constraints. Facet-inducing inequalities for the convex hull of the set of feasible partial schedules, that is, schedules in which not all jobs have to be started, are derived from facet-inducing inequalities for the <b>time</b> <b>indexed</b> model. A computational study using weighted tardiness instances reveals the big bucket model significantly outperforms the <b>time</b> <b>indexed</b> model on instances where the mean processing time of the jobs is large and the range of processing times is small, that is, the processing times are clustered rather than dispersed...|$|R

The transmission of <b>time</b> <b>indices</b> of the data, apart from the actual data values, is necessary in most situations where conventional data synchronization is needed, i. e., when the encoded bit stream may be corrupted by insertions, deletions or substitution 1 errors. An idea of the importance of timing information can be obtained from the JPEG/MPEG image/video coding standards. While these standards were designed to be robust, they do not incorporate channel codes, source-channel codes or channel-optimized quantizers. Indeed, the only check incorporated [...] ...|$|R
