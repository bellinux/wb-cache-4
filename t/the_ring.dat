Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside.

5|$|The first WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next, as Lex Luger {{challenged}} Yokozuna.

After a verbal confrontation between Luger and Yokozuna, Luger gained the early advantage by knocking Yokozuna out of <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> After getting back into <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> Yokozuna removed the turnbuckle padding from a corner of <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> Yokozuna used a nerve hold and a belly to belly suplex to wear down Luger. As he tried to throw Luger's head into the exposed turnbuckle, however, Luger blocked him and hit Yokozuna's head into the turnbuckle. Luger then performed clotheslines and a powerslam on Yokozuna before knocking Yokozuna kayfabe unconscious with a running forearm smash. Yokozuna's managers, Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette jumped onto <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> apron to distract Luger, and Luger pulled them into <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> and attacked them.

While Savage was returning to <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> with two seconds remaining, so the match continued.

5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes an element of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> and {{an element of the}} module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> in ways that are not apparent from <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E
