5|$|Despite {{subsequent}} setbacks {{in their}} relationship, such as Jac briefly deceiving Joseph {{into believing that}} she is pregnant with his child, Faye and Joseph marry. On {{the day of the}} ceremony, Linden confesses to Faye that he is in love with her, and they kiss. She instantly regrets it, however, and tells him that she loves Joseph. When Archie's nurse Lauren later accidentally administers him the wrong drug, he dies. Faye and Joseph grow apart in the aftermath and she develops romantic feelings for Linden. She and Joseph separate, but after she begins a relationship with Linden, she discovers that she is pregnant with Joseph's baby. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their relationship. Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when Linden attempts to defend her, he is hit {{in the head with a}} glass bottle and dies. Faye suffers a breakdown in the aftermath, and is admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harms, and refuses to leave the unit when she goes into labour, until Jac assures her that Joseph does not intend to take their child away from her. Faye delivers a boy by Caesarean. She initially fails to bond with him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased brother. Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit. Jac's support during this time results in a renewal of their relationship, and when Faye secretly makes plans to leave the country with Harry, Jac helps convince her to leave <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>with</b> Joseph. Joseph struggles as a working father, and accepts a job as a GP in Penrith. Jac declines his offer to accompany him, so he departs with Harry, leaving her in tears.|$|E

25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>with</b> an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.|$|E

With Tom's encouragement, Mary assumes {{a more active role in}} running Downton. Two new suitors — Lord Gillingham and Charles Blake — arrive at Downton, though Mary, still grieving, is not interested. Middle daughter Lady Edith, who has begun writing a weekly newspaper column, and Michael Gregson, her editor, fall in love. Due to British law, he is unable to divorce his wife, who is mentally ill and in an asylum. Gregson travels to Germany to seek citizenship there, enabling him to divorce, but is killed by Hitler's Brownshirts during riots. Edith is left pregnant and with help from her paternal aunt, Lady Rosamund, secretly gives birth to a daughter.

500|$|Off the Deep End was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews and peaked at number seventeen on the Billboard 200. The album also [...] produced one of Yankovic's most famous singles, [...] "Smells Like Nirvana," [...] a parody of Nirvana's major rock hit [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit," [...] which peaked at number thirty-five on the Billboard Hot 100. This song was Yankovic's second-highest charting single, after [...] "Eat It," [...] which was released in 1984. The cover also parodies the cover of Nirvana's album, Nevermind. The original had a naked baby in {{the water with a}} dollar bill cast by a fishing rod, Yankovic's replaced <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>with</b> himself, and the dollar bill by a doughnut. Off the Deep End was Yankovic's fourth Gold record, and went on to be certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the United States.

500|$|Whales {{are fully}} aquatic creatures, {{which means that}} birth and {{courtship}} behaviours {{are very different from}} terrestrial and semi-aquatic creatures. Since they are unable to go onto land to calve, they deliver <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>with</b> the [...] fetus positioned for tail-first delivery. This prevents the baby from drowning either upon or during delivery. To feed the new-born, whales, being aquatic, must squirt the milk into the mouth of the calf. Being mammals, they have mammary glands used for nursing calves; they are weaned off at about 11 months of age. This milk contains high amounts of fat which is meant to hasten the development of blubber; it contains so much fat that it has the consistency of toothpaste. Females deliver a single calf with gestation lasting about a year, dependency until one to two years, and maturity around seven to ten years, all varying between the species. This mode of reproduction produces few offspring, but increases the survival probability of each one. Females, referred to as [...] "cows", carry the responsibility of childcare as males, referred to as [...] "bulls", play no part in raising calves.|$|E

500|$|Deciding {{to revisit}} the rape storyline in 2007, Carlivati wrote a story in which Marty is thrown from a van during a car crash later that year. The van explodes, and she is presumed dead. [...] In June 2008, Todd discovers her alive, and finds that she is afflicted with amnesia and has been {{crippled}} since the crash. He starts to nurse her back to health, lying to her about her identity and her importance to the people she loves, and he starts to develop romantic feelings for her. [...] ABC promoted the storyline by airing ads that called it, [...] "The story you thought you'd never see". Carlivati defended the storyline by assuring the audience, who was concerned about and resisted the storyline, {{that it would not}} have been written if Marty had not lost her memories. He stated that he was aware of how serious it was pairing the characters romantically, but did not feel like they were damaging Marty's character. [...] Carlivati was committed to having the storyline progress slowly, and to using the actors' and characters' chemistry. Eventually, Todd and Marty have sex; Todd insists that he has always been in love with Marty and plots to steal his daughter's baby (who is also Marty's grandchild), run off with Marty and the baby, and raise <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>with</b> her.|$|E
500|$|Allegra was {{the product}} of a {{short-lived}} affair between the Romantic poet and her starstruck teenage mother, who was living in reduced circumstances in the household of her stepsister and brother-in-law. Clairmont wrote to Byron during the pregnancy begging him to write back and promise {{to take care of her}} and the baby; however, Byron ignored her pleas. After her birth, she was initially taken into the household of Leigh Hunt as the child of a cousin. A few months later the Shelleys and Clairmont took the baby back as an [...] "adopted" [...] child. Clairmont bonded with her baby daughter and wrote in her journal with delight about her close, physical connection with little Allegra, but she was also dealing with emotional and financial pressures from the Shelleys that made it difficult for her to keep <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>with</b> her. The Shelleys were fond of Allegra, but Mary Shelley feared that neighbours would believe Percy Bysshe Shelley had fathered her as the truth about her relationship to Clairmont leaked out. William Godwin, Mary's father and Clairmont's stepfather, had immediately leaped to that conclusion when he learned of Allegra's birth. In an October 1817 letter to Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley remarked that their toddler son William disliked Allegra, but was fond of his baby sister Clara. She saw her son's reaction to Allegra, who was no blood relation to him, as [...] "an argument in favor of those who advocate instinctive natural affection". In addition, the Shelleys were constantly in debt and Mary Shelley wanted the baby to be sent to Byron and wanted her difficult and temperamental stepsister, who had too close a relationship with her husband, to leave her house.|$|E

2500|$|Kangaroo care is {{different}} from the practice of babywearing. In kangaroo care, the adult and the baby are skin-to-skin and chest-to-chest, securing the position of <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>with</b> a stretchy wrap, and it is practiced to provide developmental care to premature babies for 6 months and full-term newborns for 3 months.

40|$|Twenty-five {{infants with}} {{transient}} tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) were examined by serial echocardiography {{during the first}} 4 days of life.

Apart from amount of oxygen these two groups differed in that those with severe TTN had lower Apgar scores and arterial pH soon after birth. Echocardiography showed that <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> classical TTN had increased left ventricular pre-ejection period to ejection times (LPEP/LVET) during {{the first day of}} life.
