5|$|In 1981, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Owen Beattie, a professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta, began a series of scientific studies of the graves, bodies, and other physical evidence left by Franklin's men on Beechey Island and King William Island. They concluded that the men buried on Beechey Island most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, and that lead poisoning may have worsened their health, owing to badly soldered cans held in the ships' food stores. However, it was later suggested that the source of this lead may not have been <b>tinned</b> <b>food,</b> but the distilled water systems fitted to the ships. Cut marks on human bones found on King William Island were seen as signs of cannibalism. The combined evidence of all studies suggested that the crewmen did not all die quickly. Hypothermia, starvation, lead poisoning and diseases including scurvy, along with general exposure to a hostile environment whilst lacking adequate clothing and nutrition, killed everyone on the expedition in the years following its last sighting by Europeans in 1845.|$|E

Of the survivors, most were from the auxiliaries.|$|E

Where some high street shops reported a downturn in profits during the financial struggle, Poundland experienced growth attributed to rapid price inflation of numerous household necessities, including increased sales of toothpaste and <b>tinned</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{syndrome}} often occurs once {{children have}} moved away, {{and a partner}} has died. An elderly person with nobody left to cook for, or without the skills to cook will revert to a diet of simple foods such as bread, cheese and crackers, and <b>tinned</b> <b>foods.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today, many {{families}} of Manua rely on income {{from family members}} working in Tutuila and in the United States. The local diet is generally healthier than in Tutuila, with less reliance on imported American and New Zealand <b>tinned</b> <b>foods,</b> and a greater reliance on local fishing and farming.|$|R
50|$|While Tabua, Yaqona and Mats {{are crucial}} items in {{ceremony}} and social gatherings, many other items are included, such as various root crops and now flour, bread, <b>tinned</b> <b>foods,</b> kerosene, soaps {{and the like}} for rural and distant areas. These help to meet physical needs whereas Tabua and Yaqona are items of respect and hold a spiritual significance.|$|R
25|$|The {{manufacturing}} sector in Barbados {{has yet to}} recover from the recession of the late 1980s when bankruptcies occurred and almost one-third of the workforce lost their jobs. Today, approximately 10,000 Barbadians work in manufacturing. The electronics sector in particular was badly hit when the U.S. semi-conductor company, Intel, closed its factory in 1986. Leaving aside traditional manufacturing, such as sugar refining and rum distilling, Barbados's industrial activity is partly aimed at the local market which produces goods such as <b>tinned</b> <b>food,</b> drinks, and cigarettes. Many industrial estates are located throughout the island. A cement factory is located in St.Lucy.|$|E
25|$|The {{man in the}} {{wheelchair}} says he too once {{had the support of}} a woman “to get me out of the chair in the evening and back into it again in the morning and to push me as far as the corner when I went out of my mind.” He also had a son, Billy, and begins calling the blind man by that name. He proposes the two of them join forces to unite sight and mobility in the interests of survival. The blind man is tempted by the other’s offer to locate some <b>tinned</b> <b>food.</b> The prospect of chancing across some “baked beans” especially excites him.|$|E
500|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} another potential source for the lead may have been the ships' fresh-water systems rather than the <b>tinned</b> <b>food.</b> K.T.H. Farrer argued that [...] "it is impossible to see how one could ingest from the canned food the amount of lead, 3.3mg per day over eight months, required to raise the PbB to the level 80μg/dL at which symptoms of lead poisoning begin to appear in adults and the suggestion that bone lead in adults could be 'swamped' by lead ingested from food over a period of a few months, or even three years, seems scarcely tenable." [...] In addition, <b>tinned</b> <b>food</b> was in widespread use within the Royal Navy at that time and its use did not lead to any significant increase in lead poisoning elsewhere. However, and uniquely for this expedition only, the ships were fitted with converted railway locomotive engines for auxiliary propulsion which required an estimated one tonne of fresh water per hour when steaming. It is highly probable that it was for this reason that the ships were fitted with a unique water distillation system which, given the materials in use at the time, would have produced large quantities of water with a very high lead content. William Battersby has argued that this is a much more likely source for the high levels of lead observed in the remains of expedition members than the <b>tinned</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E

60|$|That {{evening when}} the baggage had been {{disposed}} of and {{locked up in}} my little stable and arrangements were made for the delivery of some cases containing <b>tinned</b> <b>foods,</b> etc., which had proved too heavy for the Scotch cart, Lord Ragnall and I continued our conversation. First, however, we unpacked the guns and checked the ammunition, of which {{there was a large}} supply, with more to follow.|$|R
50|$|From the 1770s to the 1880s Moravian missionaries, Hudson's Bay Company agents, {{and other}} pioneer {{settlers}} along central Labrador's coastline learned {{to adapt to}} its rocky terrain, brutal winters, and its thin soil and scant sunshine. To maintain good health, to avoid the monotony of dried, salted, and <b>tinned</b> <b>foods,</b> and to reduce reliance on expensive imported food, they created gardens, and succeeded after much experimentation in growing hardy vegetables and even some fragile crops.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the end of}} July, the German defence {{north of}} the Somme had reached a point of almost {{permanent}} collapse; on 23 July, the defence of Guillemont, Delville Wood and Longueval almost failed and from [...] contact with the defenders of the wood was lost; on 30 July another crisis occurred between Guillemont and Longueval. Inside the flanks of the German first position, troops occupied shell-holes to evade bombardment by the British artillery, which vastly increased the strain on the health and morale of the troops, isolated them from command, {{made it difficult to}} provide supplies and to remove wounded.

60|$|It was, as {{they had}} expected, a long and {{troublesome}} business to get the horses into the trucks, but at last this was managed. Nose-bags were put on, with a few double-handfuls of grain, then one trooper was left to each two horses, while the rest saw to their bundles of blankets, their stores of tea, sugar, and flour, preserved milk, cocoa, bacon, and <b>tinned</b> <b>food.</b> A couple of frying-pans, and a canteen of tin cups and plates, a knife, fork, and spoon each, and two kettles, completed their outfit. They had put their soft felt hats in their valises, and were all in their flat fatigue caps.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, we stopped, and, having {{tied the}} camels {{to each other}} to prevent their straying, took shelter from the rain under the tower or {{whatever}} it might be. To pass away the time and keep life in us, for we were almost frozen with the wet and cold, we ate some <b>tinned</b> <b>food</b> and biscuits that we carried in our saddle-bags, and drank a dram of brandy from Quick's flask. This warmed us a little, though I {{do not think that}} a bottleful would have raised our spirits. Higgs, whom we all loved, was gone, dead, probably, by that time; the Abati had lost or deserted us, and we three white men appeared to have wandered into a savage stronghold, where, as soon as we were seen, we should be trapped like birds in a net, and butchered at our captor's will. Certainly the position was not cheerful.|$|E

60|$|The ceaseless marching and {{fighting}} had worn out {{the clothes and}} boots of the army, and {{a certain number of}} the guns of the field artillery were unserviceable through constant firing. The troops, besides clothes, needed fresh meat, an exclusive diet of <b>tinned</b> <b>food</b> being unwholesome if unduly prolonged. Sir Redvers Buller's estimate that a week's rest was needed does not seem excessive by the light of such facts, but still one more effort might have saved much trouble later on. On March 3 the relieving army made its triumphal entry into Ladysmith, and passing through the town camped on the plain beyond. The scene was solemn and stirring, and only the most phlegmatic were able to conceal their emotions. The streets were lined with the brave defenders, looking very smart and clean in their best clothes, but pale, thin, and wasp-waisted--their belts several holes tighter than was satisfactory.|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} {{the remains of}} the Star of the South we set to work to take stock of what was left to us. Fortunately it proved to be a very great deal. As I think I mentioned, all the passenger part of the yacht lay forward of the bridge, just in front of which the vessel had been broken in two, almost as cleanly as though she were severed by a gigantic knife. Further our stores were forward and practically everything else that belonged to us, even down to Bickley's instruments and medicines and Bastin's religious works, to say nothing of a great quantity of <b>tinned</b> <b>food</b> and groceries. Lastly on the deck above the saloon had stood two large lifeboats. Although these were amply secured at the commencement of the gale one of them, that on the port side, was smashed to smithers; probably some spar had fallen upon it. The starboard boat, however, remained intact and so far as we could judge, seaworthy, although the bulwarks were broken by the waves.|$|E
60|$|The Boers' defences {{were now}} examined, and {{proved to be}} of a most {{formidable}} nature. On the south face of the hill the trenches were in tiers, line behind line. Most of them were fully six feet deep, {{and in many cases}} provided with shelter from the weather by sheets of corrugated iron, taken from the roofs of the houses in Colenso. In some cases these were supported by props, and covered with six feet of earth. These had evidently been used for sleeping and living places. The ground was strewn with straw, empty tins, fragments of food, bones, cartridge- cases, old bandoliers, and large quantities of unopened <b>tinned</b> <b>food</b> and sacks of mealie flour. Here and there were patches of dried blood, showing where the wounded by our shell had been brought in, and laid down until they could be removed to the hospital under cover of night. On the plateau the scene was similar. Here every irregularity of ground had been utilized, and long lines of trenches intersected it, showing that the Boers had intended to make a desperate resistance even after we had won our way up the hill. These were in a similar state of litter and disorder.|$|E
50|$|Kane's {{ability to}} {{periodically}} obtain fresh meat, primarily in summer hunts with the Inuit, held off {{the most severe}} symptoms of scurvy. Franklin's expedition relied on the <b>tinned</b> <b>foods</b> (prepared in haste by Goldner), the poor soldering of which resulted in consistently high lead levels in the remains found to date. Lead poisoning would be a significant factor standing against their survival. While Kane's smaller party made hunting more practical, this difference was key to the respective outcomes of both expeditions.|$|R
50|$|New Victualling Yards {{were still}} being {{established}} in the early 20th century, both at home (e.g. the Royal Elizabeth Yard, Dalmeny: a minor yard built to serve the new Dockyard at Rosyth) and abroad (e.g. the Royal Edward Yard, Darling Island, Sydney Harbour, Australia: built by the Government of New South Wales). Indeed, provisioning methods remained substantially unchanged until more widespread use of <b>tinned</b> <b>foods,</b> and then refrigeration, were adopted later in the century. At Gosport, the cooperage remained operational until 1970, when its work ceased along with the rum ration.|$|R

So large was the supply of things {{that a number of}} trips would be necessary to carry them to the refuge.|$|R
