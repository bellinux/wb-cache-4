5|$|Since the 5.7×28mm SS190 {{projectile}} {{does not}} rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow-point bullet, <b>the</b> <b>cartridge</b> (and 5.7×28mm firearms) are considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare.|$|E
5|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of <b>the</b> <b>cartridge</b> relies on the unique tool marks left by the {{various parts of the}} weapon including the firing pin and the ejector in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. The examination of the marks left on <b>the</b> <b>cartridge</b> is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.|$|E
5|$|Adventure {{was named}} after Colossal Cave Adventure. Robinett began {{designing}} the graphics-based game, loosely based on the text game, on a Hewlett-Packard 1611A microprocessor computer around May to June 1978. Robinett was aware early on that memory use {{was going to be}} critical: Atari 2600 cartridges had room for only 4096 bytes (4 KB) on <b>the</b> <b>cartridge</b> ROM, and 128 bytes for program variables in the 2600's RAM; in contrast, Colossal Cave Adventure took hundreds of kilobytes of memory. The final game used nearly all of the available memory (including 5% of <b>the</b> <b>cartridge</b> storage for Robinett's Easter egg), with 15 unused bytes from the ROM capacity. Robinett credits Ken Thompson, his professor at University of California Berkeley, with teaching him the skills needed to use the limited memory efficiently. Thompson had required his students to learn the C programming language; Robinett carried techniques from that language into his programming of Adventure.|$|E
50|$|The {{stripper}} clip (capacity five rounds) {{is inserted}} in the clip guide of the receiver and <b>the</b> <b>cartridges</b> are pressed into <b>the</b> magazine. <b>The</b> <b>cartridges</b> are stripped off the clip and pressed into the magazine-well {{in the body of}} the pistol, compressing the spiral magazine-spring.

50|$|The modern {{revolver}} circular speedloader holds a full cylinder {{complement of}} cartridges in a secure fashion, spaced {{in a circular}} configuration so as to allow <b>the</b> <b>cartridges</b> to drop simultaneously into the cylinder easily (although non-circular types such as half-moon clips are very common as well). A mechanism is provided that allows <b>the</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{to be released from}} the speedloader when loaded, so that when it is removed, <b>the</b> <b>cartridges</b> remain in <b>the</b> cylinder. The most common type of speedloader uses a rotating latch. Another type slides <b>the</b> <b>cartridges</b> out an open side; and a third type has a latch that releases when pressed.|$|R

5|$|In 1998, {{a version}} of the completed, {{original}} Mother localization was found. <b>The</b> <b>cartridge</b> was auctioned and uploaded to the Internet, where it unofficially became known as EarthBound Zero.

5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to <b>the</b> <b>cartridge</b> during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E
5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on <b>the</b> <b>cartridge</b> as it is hit by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E
50|$|The 1895, {{as well as}} {{the later}} Model 1899 and early Model 99, used a rotary {{magazine}} to hold <b>the</b> <b>cartridges.</b> <b>The</b> rotating magazine uses a spring-loaded spool with grooves to hold <b>the</b> <b>cartridges.</b> <b>The</b> Savage 1899 took advantage of the spool to include a counter to indicate how many shots are left. The Model 99 continued using this system for many years, until its replacement with a detachable magazine.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, pistol dueling became popular as a sport in France.

50|$|The Feederle {{brothers}} (Fidel, Friedrich, and Josef) used <b>the</b> Borchardt <b>cartridge</b> {{in their}} {{design for the}} Mauser C96 pistol. <b>The</b> Borchardt <b>cartridge</b> thus was <b>the</b> basis for <b>the</b> 7.63×25mm Mauser <b>cartridge,</b> which used <b>the</b> same dimensions but was eventually loaded with a stronger powder charge. By extension, <b>the</b> Borchardt <b>cartridge</b> was also <b>the</b> basis for <b>the</b> 7.62×25mm Tokarev <b>cartridge,</b> which was developed directly from the Mauser round using an even stronger powder charge than <b>the</b> Mauser <b>cartridge.</b>|$|R
5|$|Iridion started {{development}} as a shooter for the Game Boy Color; on January 10, 2001, Shin'en announced they would stop making games for the Color, instead working on games exclusively for the Game Boy Advance. Iridions executive producer was Dan Kitchen, a former programmer for Atari. Iridion 3D was Shin'en's first product to utilize the GAX Sound Engine, which allowed real-time decoding of song data in an extremely small file size; this allowed more space on <b>the</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{to be used for}} graphics.|$|E

Unusually, there is no finger lift for cueing but the arm is fitted with a conventional lever-operated lift/lower assembly.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, Dragon Quest VI did {{not receive}} an English-language {{localization}} because of being cost-ineffective.

5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} weighs 6.0grams (93grains)—roughly {{half as much}} as {{a typical}} 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge—making extra ammunition less burdensome, or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge also has a relatively small diameter, a relatively high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. <b>The</b> <b>cartridge</b> has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it has roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability.

5|$|A {{key element}} to Colt's success was {{vigorous}} protection of his patent rights. Even though he lawfully held the only patent on a revolver, scores of imitators copied {{his work and}} Colt found himself constantly in litigation. In {{each one of these}} cases, Colt's lawyer, Edward N. Dickerson, deftly exploited the patent system and successfully shut down Colt's competitors. However, Colt's zealous protection of his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States. His preoccupation with patent infringement suits slowed his own company's transition to <b>the</b> <b>cartridge</b> system and blocked other firms from pursuing revolver designs. At the same time, Colt's policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism; as a result they created their own.|$|E

5|$|Killer Instinct Gold is a 1996 {{fighting}} {{video game}} {{based on the}} arcade game Killer Instinct2. The game was developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo64 video game console. As in other series entries, players control characters who fight on a 2D plane set against a 3D background. Players press buttons to punch and kick their opponent in chains of successive hits, known as combos. Large combo successions lead to stronger attacks and brutal, stylistic finisher moves underscored by an announcer. Charactersincluding a gargoyle, a ninja, and a femme fatalefight in settings such as a jungle and a spaceship. Killer Instinct Gold includes the arcade release's characters, combos, and 3D, pre-rendered environments, but excludes its full-motion video sequences and some voiceovers due to restrictions of <b>the</b> <b>cartridge</b> media format. The Gold release adds a training mode, new camera views, and improved audiovisuals.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{significant}} {{to the design}} of the P90 is the small-caliber, high-velocity bottlenecked cartridge it uses. The 5.7×28mm cartridge was created by FN Herstal in response to a NATO requirement that called for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns. The 5.7×28mm cartridge weighs 6.0g (93grains)—roughly half as much as a typical 9×19mm cartridge—allowing the same number of rounds to be carried for less weight, or allowing more rounds to be carried for the same weight.

5|$|Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles were {{originally}} planned {{as a single}} game.

5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{projectile}} potentially poses {{less risk}} of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, {{as well as}} risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437yd), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875yd), posing greater risk of collateral damage {{in the event of}} a miss. This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge's intended applications, so the cartridge's limited energy at long range is not considered to be disadvantageous. Since the SS190 projectile does not rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow point, <b>the</b> <b>cartridge</b> (and 5.7×28mm weapons) is considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare.|$|E
5|$|The magazines, {{situated}} deep {{under the}} casemates, consist of alternating pairs of shell and cartridge rooms accessed via an ammunition passage {{at the front}} and a lighting passage behind. Great care was taken to reduce {{the possibility of an}} accidental explosion.

The lighting was provided from oil lamps situated behind glass windows and accessed only from the lighting passage, which was physically separated {{from the rest of the}} magazine. Sets of lifting gear enabled the workers to winch the cartridges and ammunition up to the casemates, with which they could communicate via voice tubes.|$|E
5|$|EarthBound, {{known in}} Japan as , is a {{role-playing}} video game published by Nintendo for the Super NES video game console in 1994. Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka reprised their roles from Mother as composers for the game, and {{were joined by}} assistant composers Hiroshi Kanazu and Toshiyuki Ueno. In an interview with Weekly Famitsu, Keiichi Suzuki commented on how the SNES gave the composers much more freedom to compose what they wanted than the NES, which made development of the music for EarthBound much easier than for its predecessor. This freedom was partially {{a result of the}} larger memory space available, because one of the many problems the composers had in the first game was trying to get all of their music on to <b>the</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Another advantage was that the SNES could support playing eight notes at the same time, which when combined with the increased sound quality meant that he could compose music for the game in a similar fashion to how he would compose music for real life. Suzuki cited John Lennon as an influential figure to all the composers while the soundtrack was being developed, as his songs about love matched up with the feeling of the game. Critics and players have noted similarities between parts of some songs in the game to popular songs, including several suspected homages to songs by Lennon and The Beatles. Legal issues surrounding these similarities were suspected to prevent the game from being released on the Virtual Console outside of Japan, but the rumors were ultimately proved untrue.|$|E
