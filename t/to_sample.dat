40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined whether acquired sample equivalence in many-to-one matching {{was affected}} by variation in sample–response requirements. In each experiment, pigeons responded on either identical or different response schedules <b>to</b> the <b>sample</b> stimuli that occasioned the same reinforced comparison choice (i. e., <b>to</b> the within-class <b>samples).</b> Transfer-of-control tests were then conducted to determine acquired equivalence, or lack thereof, between these samples. In both experiments, there was minimal or no evidence of acquired sample equivalence when pigeons responded differently <b>to</b> the <b>samples</b> within each common-choice class. By contrast, transfer was observed if pigeons responded (a) identically <b>to</b> all <b>sample</b> stimuli, or (b) identically <b>to</b> <b>samples</b> within each common-choice class (viz., <b>to</b> <b>samples</b> that occasioned the same reinforced choice) and differently <b>to</b> <b>samples</b> from different classes (viz., <b>to</b> <b>samples</b> that occasioned different choices). These results may help to explain the recent lack of evidence for response membership in pigeons' acquired equivalence (Urcuioli, Lionello-DeNolf, Michalek, & Vasconcelos, 2006). They also {{raise questions about the}} functional sample stimuli and about possible interactions between acquired equivalence and acquired distinctiveness...|$|R

5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can be enough <b>to</b> <b>sample</b> genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on nucleic acids detection use {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history.

Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts <b>to</b> <b>sample</b> the subfloor basalt.

5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible.

The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best <b>to</b> <b>sample</b> randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E

5|$|The {{extremely}} {{short distance}} of the eyewall of Hurricane Danny from a Doppler radar station in Mobile, Alabama and its slow landfall {{over the course of}} a day led to further study by meteorologists. The proximity to land allowed for measurements at a level closer to the surface than it is possible for hurricane reconnaissance aircraft to achieve, with the slow landfall allowing for more extended observation. One conclusion of the study included the need <b>to</b> <b>sample</b> the boundaries of an eyewall more to establish a better estimate of surface-level winds and the overall intensity of a storm. Another conclusion was that while Danny's slow movement positioned it over a tidal estuary bordering the Gulf, maintaining of or increase in strength was possible since eyewall convection remained over waters with high sea surface temperatures and other environmental conditions remained favorable.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{numerical}} weather prediction is <b>to</b> <b>sample</b> {{the state of the}} fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in METAR reports, or every six hours in SYNOP reports. Sites launch radiosondes, which rise through the depth of the troposphere and well into the stratosphere. Data from weather satellites are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available. Compared with similar data from radiosondes, the satellite data has the advantage of global coverage, however at a lower accuracy and resolution. Meteorological radar provide information on precipitation location and intensity, which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time. Additionally, if a pulse Doppler weather radar is used then wind speed and direction can be determined.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the usual}} product {{development}} cycle, which grows a concept into a final product, {{most of the}} development work in Rare Replay was in converging 30 games across six platforms onto one disc. The engineering challenge lay in the quantity of games and platforms being emulated rather than the emulation effort itself. Rare worked in close collaboration with Microsoft, who were secretly developing the Xbox One's backward-compatibility features, which Rare ultimately used in Rare Replay. The Microsoft team helped prepare Rare's nine Xbox 360 games for the release. Their discontinued online services were not restored for the compilation. On Rare Replay design, lead designer Paul Collins added that the Snapshot challenges were built to encourage players <b>to</b> <b>sample</b> all of the games, and that the rewind feature was to help all players finish the games without quitting in frustration. The compilation's opening musical number was a compromise from the original vision: a musical history of the company's oeuvre, as told through small musical introductions to each Snapshot. The final opening was intended to evoke players' memories of Rare properties, and includes several Easter eggs.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 75 - 88). Seasonal differences in group size, behavior, icrographics. distribution, and coloration patterns of dusky dolphins (Lacenorhynchus obscures) in Kaikoura, New Zealand, have led researchers to question whether "winter'' and "summer'' groups are temporally and behaviorally segregated into genetically distinct populations. Exfoliated skin samples were collected in Kaikoura from July 1997 to May 1998 for genetic analysis of 40 "winter'' and 40 "summer'' individuals via skin swab. A 473 base pair section of the mitochondrion DNA control region was amplified and sequenced for the 80 samples. Nucleotide and haplotype diversity were 0. 16 and 0. 98, respectively. AMOVA and phylogenetie analyses indicate "winter'' and "summer'' groups are not subdivided with respect to maternal lineages. Lack of subdivision between seasonal populations is further supported by: (1) demographic patterns determined from mismatch distribution analysis suggest New Zealand dusky dolphins underwent a population expansion in the Pleistocene; (2) current levels of diversity suggest the long-term effective population size has been large', (3) preliminary analysis of photo-identification data indicate individuals are present in Kaikoura both winter and summer; (4) comparison of 80 <b>samples</b> from Kaikoura <b>to</b> eight beach-east <b>samples</b> from locations throughout New Zealand reveal shared haplotypes between regions. Behavioral responses <b>to</b> <b>sampling</b> were recorded for 315 contacts and 48 controls. The number of pro-and pest-contact joyriders and sample time were used as indicators of group-level response <b>to</b> <b>sampling.</b> The behavioral state of dolphins prior <b>to</b> <b>sampling</b> or time of day did not affect responses <b>to</b> <b>sampling.</b> Small groups were found to be more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>sampling.</b> Dolphin groups appeared <b>to</b> habituate <b>to</b> <b>sampling</b> activities after the first hour spent <b>sampling.</b> Responses <b>to</b> <b>sampling</b> were mild with 18 % showing no response to contact.
