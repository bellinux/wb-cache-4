5|$|The crowd {{eventually}} dispersed after Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson promised an inquiry, but {{the crowd}} re-formed the next day, prompting {{the withdrawal of the}} troops to Castle Island. Eight soldiers, one officer, and four civilians were arrested and charged with murder. Defended by lawyer and future American president John Adams, six of the soldiers were acquitted, while the other two were convicted of manslaughter and given reduced sentences. The men found guilty of manslaughter were sentenced to branding on their hand. Depictions, reports, and propaganda about the event, notably the colored engraving produced by Paul Revere (shown at <b>top-right),</b> further heightened tensions throughout the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E
5|$|The return {{match at}} Anfield took place the {{following}} week. Celtic's Alan Thompson and Liverpool's Dietmar Hamann both {{came close to}} scoring for their respective sides in the opening quarter-hour with long range shots. On 19 minutes, Jerzy Dudek turned a 30-yard free kick from Henrik Larsson around the post. Two minutes from half time, Celtic were awarded a free kick 25 yards from goal. Thompson struck a low shot past Dudek from the set piece, with the ball going under the defensive wall, which had jumped up and appeared to distract the Liverpool goalkeeper. Celtic sealed their victory on 82 minutes when John Hartson played a one-two with Larsson, and then drove a swerving shot from 25 yards out into the <b>top-right</b> corner of Dudek's goal. Celtic's 20 win saw them win the tie 31 on aggregate and progress to the semi-finals.|$|E
5|$|German Bundesliga team VfB Stuttgart were Celtic's fourth round {{opponents in}} the Spring of 2003. Celtic came from behind to win the first leg 3–1 at Parkhead, while in the second leg, despite Celtic going up 2–0 early, a {{comeback}} from Stuttgart saw the Bundesliga side win 3–2 on the night, although Celtic would progress 5–4 on aggregate. The quarter-finals saw another English Premier League opponent for Celtic, this time Liverpool. The first leg took place at Celtic Park on 13 March 2003, ending 1–1 through a first-minute Larsson goal; the away goal, however, gave Liverpool an advantage entering their home tie at Anfield. In the first leg, Liverpool player El Hadji Diouf spat at a Celtic supporter, and was later fined £5,000 at Glasgow's Sheriff Court for the incident. The return match at Anfield took place the following week. Two minutes from half-time, Celtic were awarded a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Alan Thompson struck a low shot past Jerzy Dudek from the set piece, with the ball going under the defensive wall which had jumped up and appeared to distract the Liverpool goalkeeper. Celtic sealed a 20 victory on 82 minutes when John Hartson played a one-two with Larsson, then drove a swerving shot from 25 yards out into the <b>top-right</b> corner of Dudek's goal.|$|E
5|$|The {{spectrum}} {{of light that}} comes from a single source (see idealized spectrum illustration <b>top-right)</b> can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for features in the spectrum such as absorption lines, emission lines, or other variations in light intensity. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the {{spectrum of}} various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth. A very common atomic element in space is hydrogen. The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a signature spectrum specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the redshift can be calculated using the table below. Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the redshift one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or white noise (random fluctuations in a spectrum).|$|E

25|$|The replay {{was played}} {{in front of}} a small but very vocal Boro crowd who were fired up by an {{unfortunately}} worded letter from the club seemingly asking them to sit down and be quiet in their last home game. The fans didn't have to wait long for a goal as in the fifth minute Stewart Downing curled an unstoppable free-kick over the wall and into the <b>top-right</b> hand corner of the net. Tuncay doubled the lead with a volley as West Ham's defense failed to clear the ball. The visitors dominated the possession but could not convert it to goals, and with Middlesbrough threatening on the counterattack, they couldn't afford to neglect their defensive duties. In the end, the 2–0 was enough to see Middlesbrough through to the last eight for the fourth consecutive season.|$|E
25|$|For many years, California was {{the only}} state that did not use an exit {{numbering}} system. It was granted an exemption in the 1950s due to having an already largely completed and signed highway system; placing exit number signage across the state was deemed too expensive. To control costs, California began to incorporate exit numbers on its freeways in 2002—Interstate, U.S., and state routes alike. Caltrans commonly installs exit number signage only when a freeway or interchange is built, reconstructed, retrofitted, or repaired, and it is usually just tacked onto the <b>top-right</b> corner of an already existing sign. Newer signs along the freeways follow this practice as well. Most exits along California's Interstates now have exit number signage, particularly in rural areas. California, however, still does not use mileposts, although a few exist for experiments or for special purposes.|$|E
25|$|Umbro will {{manufacture}} the kits for Lyon. Umbro {{have been}} the official kit provider of Lyon since 2003 and, two years ago, signed an extension with Lyon until 2013. This season, Lyon will have brand-new home, away, Champions League kits, which were revealed to the public on 12 July, despite the shirts leaking on 17 June. The home shirt has a white base color, with the horizontal red and blue stripe in the middle, reverting from the club's red and blue vertical stripe {{that has been used}} in previous years. The logo of Umbro appears on the <b>top-right</b> of the shirt in blue. The away shirt features a black and red design. The top part of the shirt is black and it fades horizontally in the middle into red. The shirt has a partly red collar, and also has red details on the black sleeves. The European kit is midnight blue with the horizontal red and blue stripe locating {{in the middle of the}} shirt.|$|E
25|$|Although Kelly may {{be better}} known for his paintings, he also worked at {{sculpture}} throughout his career. In 1958, Kelly conceived {{one of his first}} wood sculptures, Concorde Relief I (1958), a modestly scaled wall relief in elm, which explores the visual play and balance between two rectangular forms layered on top of each other, the uppermost with its <b>top-right</b> and lower-left corners removed. He made 30 sculptures in wood throughout his career. From 1959 onwards, he created freestanding folded sculptures. The Rocker series began in 1959 after Kelly's casual conversation with Agnes Martin, who lived below him on Coenties Slip in Lower Manhattan. Playing with the paper top from a take-out coffee cup, Kelly cut and folded a section of the round object, which he then put on the table and rocked back and forth. Soon after, he constructed his first sculpture-in-the-round, Pony. The title refers to a child's hobby horse with curving rocker supports.|$|E
25|$|Nike {{manufactured}} the kits for Paris Saint-Germain and Emirates Airlines {{continued to}} be the club's main sponsor. Nike have been PSG's official kit provider since 1989. Emirates have been the club's partner since 2005 and the major shirt sponsor since January 2006. Emirates Airlines confirmed their commitment to PSG by extending the current partnership until 2014. Les Parisiens received brand new home and away kits. The home shirt had PSG's traditional colors. It was dark blue with a vertical red band and two thinner white stripes on {{the middle of the}} chest which disappeared under the main sponsor's logo in white writing. The borders of the sleeves were partly red. The away shirt had a simple design. Silver was the main color while the sponsor's logo was accented by a red background bordered by white and black thin stripes. The shirts had the club badge on the top-left, the Nike logo on the <b>top-right</b> and the club sponsor Fly Emirates written across the middle.|$|E

25|$|Initially, More O’Ferrall {{introduced}} {{this type of}} analysis to discuss the continuity between concerted and step-wise β-elimination reaction mechanisms. The model also provided a framework within which to explain the effects of substituents and reaction conditions on the mechanism. The appropriate lower energy species were placed {{at the corners of}} the two dimensional plot (Figure 2). These were the reactants (top left), the products (bottom right) and the intermediates of the two possible stepwise reactions: the carbocation for E1 (bottom left) and the carbanion for E1cB (<b>top-right).</b> Thus, the horizontal axes represent the extent of deprotonation (C-H bond distance) and the vertical axes represent the extent of leaving group departure (C-LG distance). By applying the Hammond and anti-Hammond effects, he predicted the effects of various changes in the reactants or reaction conditions. For example, the effects of introducing a better leaving group on a substrate that initially eliminates via an E2 mechanism are illustrated in Figure 2. A better leaving group increases the energy of the reactants and of the carbanion intermediate. Thus, the transition state moves towards the reactants and away from the carbanion intermediate.|$|E

500|$|This {{traditional}} ancestry may {{be traced}} to the late 17th century when a chief adopted the designation of [...] "McOlaus" [...] and another was the first MacLeod to incorporate the royal Manx arms into MacLeod heraldry. In a document dating to 1630, Iain Mòr MacLeod of Dunvegan (chief 1626–1649) appears as [...] "John McOlaus of Dunvegane"—McOlaus representing MacOlaf. This chief's son, Iain Breac (chief 1664–1693), is the first MacLeod to have incorporated the Manx triskelion into his coat of arms. The triskelion was borne in the arms of the kings of Mann and the Isles {{as far back as the}} 13th century. The earliest known arms borne by the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan (pictured <b>top-right)</b> are, however, quite different the royal Manx arms. These earliest MacLeod arms date to the mid 15th century; recorded in a leading European armorial known as the Armorial de Berry. Accordingly, it has been suggested that these points show that 17th century belief of a descent from Olaf was not one of long standing.|$|E
