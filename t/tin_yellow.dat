30|$|Investigation and {{scientific}} analysis, especially {{the combination of}} optical microscopy and Raman micro-spectroscopy, showed the frequent use of lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type I and II during the High and Late Gothic period in the Bohemian panel paintings. Lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II was confirmed in the artworks assigned to the period from c. 1345 to 1420. Lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type I was confirmed on the paintings from 1390 on. On panel paintings both yellows were used like single pigments or in various pigment mixtures in the colour painting layers. In the yellow areas, the most common combinations were with lead white and earth pigments. Sometimes mixtures with vermilion and red lake were found. In the green areas lead tin yellows were mixed with copper green pigments and lead white. The lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II occurs {{in this country in}} the 14 th century on better quality artworks where the close links to progressive trends can be assumed. The knowledge of the use of the lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II was a normal part of workshop practice. Various techniques using the lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II were combined in a single workshop (Master of the Třeboň Altarpiece) with regard to the requirements of the final aesthetic quality (drapery, decorative painting). It is attractive to assume that the first use of this technique in Bohemia was linked with the arrival of foreign masters, especially those from the area of Italy, working on prestigious orders in connection with the flourishing of the royal court. It is also highly probable that some local masters were acquainted {{with the use of the}} lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II as a specific pigment during their travels.|$|E
30|$|The first {{identification}} of lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellows</b> {{by means of}} advanced instrumental techniques {{was carried out in}} 1940 in the Doener Institut in Munich by the emission spectroscopy [23]. Since then thanks {{to the development of the}} instrumental analytical techniques it was possible to confirm the presence of lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellows</b> in many other artworks. X-ray diffraction (XRD) or Raman spectroscopy can be used for this purpose [26 - 28]. Elemental analysis (such as scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive analysis or X-ray fluorescence) could be used as a complementary technique [29], but the differentiation of each type by the presence of silica could be misleading because of the frequent combination with earth pigments that contain quartz [30].|$|R

30|$|The last {{example of}} {{individual}} employment {{of the lead}} <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II {{was found on the}} Triptych with the Death of the Virgin called the Roudnice Altarpiece - inside of right wing, painting of the Man of Sorrows and eight kneeling devotees assigned to the period 1410 – 1420. Lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II was identified in particular in the painting of the bishop’s collar and was located in the lower layer applied on the white layer of lead white (imprimiture) on the ground made of chalk. This lower yellow layer is then covered by a second lighter yellow layer in which the presence of lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type I alone was confirmed. This unusual combination of layers will be subjected to an additional investigation (to be published separately).|$|E
30|$|Giotto used inky washes under thin {{layers of}} egg tempera paint.

SEM-EDX of one of the yellow {{pigments}} confirmed it is lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II, PbSn 1 -xSixO 3. The ratio of colorant to the glassy phase indicates this material was produced for use as a pigment rather than as a glass. Ultramarine was not used in this painting, azurite is the blue pigment. The azurite used here does not contain elemental impurities, however malachite and the rare green–blue mineral mixite, BiCu 6 (OH) 6 (AsO 4) 3 (H 2 O) 3, are found in the blue paint.|$|E

30|$|Colour {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} properties of objects, in archaeology and art history. This review is aimed at collecting information on the stability of traditional inorganic mediaeval pigments under a variety of conditions. The pigments considered are whites (leadwhite and calcium carbonate), yellows (ochres, orpiment, massicot, lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellows),</b> orange-reds (ochres, realgar, vermillion, litharge, red lead), blues (ultramarine, blue ochre, smalt, azurite, Egyptian blue), greens (green earths, malachite, verdigris and other Cu containing materials), brown (umbers) and black (carbon black). Pigments as Naples yellow (Pb 2 Sb 2 O 7 /Pb 3 (SbO 4) 2), lead chromate yellows (PbCrO 4 /PbCr 1 −xSxO 4), Prussian blue (KFe[Fe(CN) 6]·xH 2 O/Fe 4 [Fe(CN) 6] 3 ·xH 2 O), zinc white (ZnO), etc., although known to degrade, are not included in this review, as they were not available during the Middle Ages [1]. For the purpose of this review, mainly chemical and archaeometrical literature was reviewed, so that an explanation for the on-going degradation processes could be provided as revealed by advanced analytical techniques.|$|R

30|$|During the {{measurements}} of standard pigments (Kremer No. 10110, 10120, Böke & Fritz Art.No. 101 - 7) {{by means of}} Raman micro-spectroscopy a higher sensitivity of both yellows on the excitation laser of 532  nm was observed. The MP for laser of 532  nm was 1  mW for lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type I and 4  mW for lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II. Laser of 780  nm {{was used for the}} investigation of the samples from the artworks because of the resistance of both pigments to the excitation source in full range of power. The disadvantage of this laser lies in the worse detection of some green pigments present in the pigment mixtures because of the very low Raman signal. These pigments (verdigris or malachite) were detected already during the previous investigations and were identified by means of optical microscopy, micro-chemical tests and SEM/EDS.|$|E
30|$|Thanks to the Raman {{spectroscopy}} it {{was possible}} {{for the first time to}} map the usage of lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type I and II in such a broad range. Combination of the analytical techniques brought the knowledge about the morphology of the grains and variability of the use of the lead tin yellows in the Bohemian panel paintings.|$|E
30|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the lead}} <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type I was identified on the artwork Votive panel, called from Dubeček which has been assigned already before c. 1390. This pigment was then confirmed on all the investigated artworks that were dated up to 1550 (Table  2). It was used frequently in yellow draperies, most often in mixture with lead white, {{as well as in}} green areas of the paintings where the combination with copper green pigments, usually verdigris with lead white, were mostly confirmed. In rare cases the admixtures of ochre or earth pigments, azurite or black pigment were identified. In the artwork Altarpiece with the Execution of St. Barbara, called the St. Barbara Altarpiece from Osek – St. Sebastian/St. Paul by the Monogrammist IW the lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type I was found in the layers of flash, together with lead white, chalk, black pigment, vermilion and red lake.|$|E

30|$|Samples {{from the}} artworks of the Master of the Vyšší Brod altarpiece and the Master of the Třeboň Altarpiece that were {{analyzed}} by means of Raman spectroscopy contain lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II that shows uniform composition from the chemical point of view (Raman spectra presented in Figures  3 b and 4 b). In the cross-sections and microscopical preparations isotropic glassy like particles with lemon yellow internal reflections, translucent with light yellow colour and very high relief were observed by means of optical microscopy (see Figure  3 a). Among {{the presence of other}} pigments the lead white was frequently found in the layer with the lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II. There were marginally identified also the admixtures of vermilion, black pigment and ochre. For example, both shadow and light areas of the yellow robe of St. Ludmila on the Votive Panel of John Očko from Vlašim were coloured with the yellow ochre.|$|E
30|$|This broader survey {{brings the}} first {{summary of the}} {{findings}} acquired {{within the framework of}} the historical art fund of Bohemia.

30|$|XRF {{confirmed}} the general palette of inorganic pigments by inference from elemental compositon as lead white, yellow iron earths, green earth, azurite, lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow,</b> and vermilion.

30|$|Some {{historical}} manuscripts {{contain the}} recipes with more detailed {{instructions for the}} preparation of the pigments, describing the amount of main substances [10], or the ratio of the components.

30|$|For {{this reason}} the {{question}} about the provenance of the lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II in the workshop of the Master of the Vyšší Brod Cycle is very interesting. In Bohemia there is also very significant medieval tradition of glassmaking. The most numerous group of findings from this period is the group of sodium-calcium glasses (Na 2 O-CaO-SiO 2). However, a glass containing lead oxide PbO was found marginally [42]. The painting technique, dating of the artwork and also findings in the literature sources indicate rather the import of the pigment from Italy.|$|E
5000|$|Economics {{and history}} professors have {{published}} scholarly studies that indicate {{the images and}} characters used by Baum and Denslow closely resembled political images that were {{well known in the}} 1890s.

The notion of a [...] "Tin Man" [...] has deep roots in European and American history, according to Green (2006), and often appeared in cartoons of the 1880s and 1890s. Baum and Denslow, like most writers and illustrators, used the materials at hand that they knew best. They built a story around them, added Dorothy, and added a series of lessons to the effect that everyone possesses the resources they need (such as brains, a heart and courage) if only they had self-confidence.

30|$|The results {{presented}} here conform to Cennini’s observation about red lakes prepared from alum-mordanted clothlets being less stable than those made {{directly from the}} unmordanted species. A similar observation {{had been made by}} Saunders and Kirby [25] who found that watercolors made using uncomplexed carminic acid were more stable than either the aluminium- or tin-complexed colorants. They found that the presence of Ca 2 + in the formulation destabilized the aluminium complex. Analogous results have been observed for dyed fibers; for example, Gupta et al. [26] comparing the effect of various mordants and mordanting methods on the lightfastness of purpurin on nylon, found that while mordanting with copper or iron improved lightfastness, using aluminium, and to some extent tin, decreased the relative lightfastness of the dye compared to the unmordanted dye. Similar results were obtained for wool, and the procedures used for dyeing influence stability on wool as well as on nylon [27, 28]. Alum and <b>tin</b> mordants for <b>yellow</b> dyes on wool gave the least stable colors [29]. Our experiments show that the situation is complex, and that the pH of a paper substrate contributes to the comparative instability of an anthraquinone dye or pigment in watercolor paint whether mordanted (i.e., complexed) or not.|$|R

30|$|A {{summary of}} the {{historical}} usage of both types of yellow pigments in paintings was published by Kühn [31]. The work reports that the lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type I was commonly used from the half of the 15 th to the 18 th century in the whole European region [19]. On the other hand an extended use of the lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II was documented in the period {{from the beginning of}} the 14 th century to the first half of the 15 th century especially in the Italian paintings where the connection to the glass production is pointed out [20]. Presence of this pigment in Italian paintings was relatively widely investigated and it was identified in paintings from the region of Tuscany (Florence, Pisa, Siena), Veneto (Venice) and Lazio (Viterbo) [32]. There are some rare examples in the literature where the Bohemian paintings are mentioned, usually in connection to the Bohemian glass production [20]. No broader investigation that would report on the presence of these pigments in Bohemian paintings has been carried out so far. From the beginning of the 15 th century till the end of the 16 th century there are some rather unique findings in the paintings of the Italian High Renaissance masters (Tintoretto) and the Dutch painter Hendrick ter Brugghen [33].|$|E
40|$|The plasma {{nitriding}} response of a titanium alloy (Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V) {{has been investigated}} {{as a function of}} the mode of plasma excitation, i. e. DC or Microwave. The Microwave Induced Plasma (MIP) was generated in a TM 012 cylindrical cavity using a 1. 5 kW power supply operating at 2. 45 GHz. DC {{plasma nitriding}} was conducted in a 40 kW commercial unit. Nitriding experiments carried out in the MIP, in nitrogen-hydrogen gas mixtures at 65 to 100 mbar pressure, established that MIP provides an excellent mass transfer medium for nitriding of the titanium alloy. Furthermore, significant advantages over DC plasma have been discerned, regarding the surface appearance (uniformity) and colour of the nitrided Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V alloy. The most striking feature of the MIP nitrided titanium samples is the uniform surface appearance from the edge to the centre. Except for a very narrow band around the edge, the rest of the surface displays a uniform golden colour. In stark contrast, DC plasma nitriding results in uneven surfaces, manifested as grey/silvery rings around the periphery of the specimen, and a dark brown colour in the central part. These differences have been correlated to the most pertinent plasma parameters of the two processes. MIP is an electrodeless plasma characterised by high operating pressure (65 to 100 mbar), a relatively high electron (or particle) density (of the order of 10 ^^ cm 2 ̆ 2 ^) and low electron/ion energies, typically in the range of 3 - 4 eV. DC plasma, on the other hand, operates at moderate pressures (3 - 5 mbar) and results in a lower ionisation efficiency. Further, in the DC plasma the specimen is at the cathode potential and is subjected to high energy ion bombardment which results in significant sputtering from the surface. It is argued that the severity of sputtering, especially around the edges of the sample, is primarily responsible for the non-uniformity of treatment in DC plasma nitriding. Excessive sputtering also prevents the build up of nitrogen in the surface of titanium in the early stages of DC plasma nitriding. Consequendy, the predominant layer forming on the surface is Ti 2 N which retards the diffusion of nitrogen. The accumulation of nitrogen on the surface as nitriding progresses results in the formation of superstoichiometric TiN exhibiting a dark brownish/reddish colour. For MIP nitriding, stoichiometric <b>TiN,</b> displaying a <b>yellow</b> golden colour, is the major constituent of the compound layer...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the use of {{microscopy}} and microanalysis to obtain a more complete characterization of the yellow pigment, a variant of glassy lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II, the quality of the azurite, and the discovery of the presence of the green–blue copper mineral, mixite. The novel finding of mixite is a reminder that painters and other artists and craftsmen used a diverse range of materials, and instrumental analysis is valuable for their identification, complementing and augmenting information given in treatises. The results may also help the investigation of geographical sources, and hence trade, of pigments used by trecento artists.|$|E
30|$|The early wide {{usage of}} lead–tin yellow {{appears to have}} {{occurred}} in fourteenth century Tuscan painting, including works by Giotto and his contemporaries. The pigment used in Madonna and Child and other Florentine artists’ works likely came from the ceramicists or glass-makers who would have used something similar for a colorant in their own work [15]. There is in fact some evidence for overlap between the Florentine glass-makers’ and painters’ commissions and materials, even in the early 14 th century [16]. Lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow</b> type II with a similar low proportion of glass as the pigment used in this panel was used to make beads which might have come from Italy that were found in a 13 – 14 th century grave in Lithuania [17]. These are opaque and more similar to enamels than glass {{in the proportion of}} the coloring oxides. An early example of the pigment lead <b>tin</b> <b>yellow,</b> a material containing a low amount of Si was found in a Merovingian (8 th C) crucible [18]. The aggregated appearance of the crystallites and no signs of conchoidal fracture {{at the edges of the}} clusters suggest the yellow colorant in Giotto’s paint was manufactured for use as a pigment and is not pulverized glass, which some later artists used [19]. The inhomogeneity of the particle at high magnification is worth noting. It occurs at a finer scale than the microRaman based on optical microscopy can readily measure.|$|E
