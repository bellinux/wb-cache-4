25|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of the Greek War of Independence (1821–1830), Anthimos Gazis suggested Konstantas to join the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia. Konstantas rejected the offer, however, when the revolution broke up he joined the revolutionary forces. He also became one of the delegates in the Fourth National Assembly at Argos, 1829. When the Greek independence was established he worked as a teacher in the orphanage of Aegina, an institution founded by the head of the newly formed Greek state, Ioannis Kapodistrias. With the arrival of Prince Otto he left the orphanage and in 1835 he returned to his hometown, which was still under Ottoman rule. There he continued his <b>teaching</b> <b>activity</b> until his death, in 1844.|$|E
25|$|The University of Greifswald {{was founded}} on 17 October 1456 with the {{approval}} of the Holy Roman Empire and the Pope. This was possible due to the great commitment of Greifswald's lord mayor, Heinrich Rubenow, who was also to become the university's first rector, with the support of Duke Wartislaw IX of Pomerania and Bishop Henning Iven of the local St Nicolas' Cathedral. The founding took place in the local cathedral, which was later remodeled by Caspar David Friedrich and his brother and can still be visited today. The founding of the university was made possible by a decree that restricted <b>teaching</b> <b>activity</b> at the University of Rostock (founded 1419). Several professors left Rostock for Greifswald to continue their work there, where Heinrich Rubenow took the chance of establishing his own university. Originally, the university consisted of the four traditional divisions: Theology, Philosophy, Medicine and Law.|$|E
25|$|Konstantas {{was born}} in the village of Milies, Thessaly, Ottoman Empire (present-day Greece), where he {{received}} early schooling. At the age of 20 he went to Mount Athos, Chios and Constantinople (Istambul) where he attended courses in ecclesiastical schools. In 1780 he moved to Bucharest and in 1784 he started his <b>teaching</b> <b>activity</b> in the local Princely Academy. In 1788 he went in a number of European cities (Vienna, Halle, Padua) to continue his studies, while in 1803 he negotiated with Anthimos Gazis the establishment of an advanced educational institution in his birthplace, which would contain a library of 4,000 volumes. His initiative was supported by Anthimos Gazis and was only partially realized in 1814–16 because the Ottoman authorities limited the school's functions. In the meantime he rejected an offer to teach at the Academy of Iasi and another one to become head of the Patriarchical Academy in Constantinople.|$|E

40|$|Many {{teachers}} commonly use assessment as {{the starting}} point of their <b>teaching</b> <b>activities</b> because they believe that assessment drives learning and <b>teaching</b> <b>activities.</b> Hence students tend to organise their learning activities around these prescribed assessment tasks. These beliefs and practices have the potential to detract from promoting effective, efficient, and engaging learning. Teachers, in using assessment tasks to orchestrate their <b>teaching</b> <b>activities</b> send out a message to their learners which minimises the importance of the learning experience.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{the last}} 15 years Evidence-based Medicine (EbM) has gained much {{publicity}} in the German-speaking countries, {{but it is}} currently difficult to conclude how much the contents of EbM with its five steps according to Sackett have spread. Data from the year 2006 show that {{less than half of}} all medical faculties in Germany have introduced EbM into undergraduate teaching {{and that there is a}} shortage in EbM <b>teaching</b> <b>activities</b> for graduates in the German-speaking countries as well. The goal of this survey is to display the undergraduate and graduate Evidence-based Practice <b>teaching</b> <b>activities</b> in the German-speaking countries. METHODS: In a two-step survey, we first sent out a total of 551 letters to medical faculties, colleges, boards of physicians, the German Hospital Association, the associations of statutory health insurance physicians in Germany, the Medical Service of the German health insurances and asked the 30 participants of the 2011 EbM Academy as key informants in writing to give details about potential providers of EbM <b>teaching</b> <b>activities.</b> Via email we also consulted the members of the German-speaking colleges of general practitioners and family medicine and the German Network for EBM, course participants and contact persons of familiar <b>teaching</b> <b>activities.</b> In a second step a pre-tested detailed questionnaire with 36 items in the five categories framework and structure, participant characterisation, contents and didactics, evaluation and publication, and planning and publicity was sent to potential providers. RESULTS: Altogether 185 <b>teaching</b> <b>activities</b> were identified, 80  % of which were located in Germany, 13  % in Austria and 7  % in Switzerland. In 82. 6  % of the cases it was either a seminar, a course or a workshop with a median of 20 participants and an average duration of 17. 9 hours. The <b>teaching</b> <b>activities</b> mainly addressed students (63. 2  %), physicians (37. 8  %), caregivers and members of other health care professions with little or no prior knowledge of EbM. The first three steps of EbM (formulating clinical questions, search for and appraisal of the literature) were taught in more than 75  % of the <b>teaching</b> <b>activities,</b> whereas steps four and five (integration of results, evaluation) were only taught in 53. 9  % and 33. 3  % of the cases, respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Compared to 2006, a remarkable increase in EbM <b>teaching</b> <b>activities</b> was observed in the German-speaking areas. These activities address different target audiences; the main content focus is on the first steps of EbM...|$|R
