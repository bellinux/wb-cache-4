5|$|During World War II, {{and after}} Perry Ellwood died in 1943, May Ellwood again altered the home; {{to save on}} fuel oil, she had the upper floors of the house closed off. During this period, the library functioned as a guest room and a {{bathroom}} was added across the library's west wall. <b>The</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> removed before the house opened as a museum in 1967. The library's plaster cornice and other architectural details have been restored based on a 1912 photograph. In 1964 the home was donated {{to the city of}} DeKalb and converted into a museum.|$|E
25|$|At some point, {{even the}} prisoners who were {{thought of as}} role models and obeyed all of the guards' {{commands}} were being punished. Going to <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> considered a privilege rather than a necessity, and those who acted out against the guards were made to urinate and defecate in a bucket in their cell.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{of the house was}} much smaller than the year before. The living room was brought back inside the house, with two glass doors separating it from the main floor area. On Launch Night, McCall said the room will change colour depending on what mood the housemates were in, however the walls only changed colour on eviction nights. The bedroom was across from the living room, and featured a waterbed, <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> accessed through the bedroom, and featured a bath, shower and also a toilet. The kitchen was small and beside the door leading to the garden. In the garden, which was much larger than the house, was a barbecue, a pool, a seating area and a bridge titled The Bridge to Nowhere which led to another seating area. The interior stairs remained closed off once again, and had a yellow and black theme.|$|E
50|$|The {{second floor}} {{contains}} 5 bedrooms, two dressing rooms and two <b>bathrooms.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>are</b> decorated in 22K gold trim, mirroring <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> below, which <b>is</b> decorated with 22K gold and ruby marble. <b>The</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>are</b> fed {{water from a}} 540 gal tank on the third floor, used as for storage or other amenities.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bathrooms</b> <b>are</b> {{located on}} <b>the</b> 2nd and 3rd floors of <b>the</b> main building. <b>Bathrooms</b> <b>are</b> also {{located in the}} gymnasium, the kirin building, the modern {{languages}} building and the cafeteria.|$|R
5000|$|... "USA TODAY {{and other}} people have been finding out and investigating,...There was no damage to <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> I have never even entered <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> It <b>was</b> locked, so we couldn't go in there at all. The story about me vandalising <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> absurd. It never happened." ...|$|R
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. [...] "Miss Alli" [...] from Television Without Pity have the episode a positive review and rated it an A–. Francis Rizzo III from DVD Talk called the episode [...] "classic", and praised {{the performance of}} Rainn Wilson as Dwight. He noted that the episode, along with several others, [...] "wouldn't be nearly as entertaining" [...] without his character. TV Fanatic reviewed several quotes from [...] "The Fight", and rated Michael's [...] "Would I rather be feared or loved?" [...] soliloquy and Michael's confession that Dwight cried {{at the end of}} Armageddon 5 out of 5. In 2006, Jenna Fischer said that the episode's cold opening, featuring Jim moving Dwight's desk into <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>was</b> her favorite prank on the show.|$|E
500|$|... "Patriot Games" [...] was {{watched by}} 8.45 million viewers, {{making it the}} 55th most-watched program of the week. According to MacFarlane, the episode {{polarized}} viewers, who either [...] "hated or loved the violence". Ryan J. Budke from AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, specifically praising the scene in which Stewie beats up Brian. Budke also {{said that it was}} [...] "fun" [...] and that you could tell the crew had a good time making it. Overall, he considered it [...] "not a bad episode. The scene eventually {{became one of the most}} popular videos on YouTube." [...] The episode ranked number 1 in IGN's Top 10 Musical Moments in the show, for [...] "Shipoopi," [...] and Brian and Stewie's fight in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> named the 5th greatest fight scene in the show on another list.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of sale in 2008, Pikes Hotel had 29 bedrooms, with a pool, sauna, health centre, and tennis court. Today it has 26 rooms with {{king-sized}} beds, one restaurant named Room 39 which has received much critical acclaim, and 2 bars. As of 2009 it costs £157 {{to stay at the}} hotel. The rooms retain the sense of the original farmhouse, and are furnished in the Moroccan style with some heavy dark wood furnishings. The rooms each have different themes, including [...] "Honeysuckle" [...] and [...] "Sunset", the latter of which is set behind the middle of three dark wood doors {{on the second floor of}} a small outhouse. According to author Stephen Armstrong, this room had a [...] "modest sitting room with a huge antique mirror, plush sofas and a CD player which didn't work. The bedroom was enormous, and <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> decorated in a vaguely Moroccan style with a curtained bath nestling behind a low arch.|$|E
50|$|Four Seasons <b>Bathroom</b> in Arak <b>is</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>bathroom</b> in Iran. This <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} <b>the</b> late Qajar (Ahmad Shah) by Haji Muhammad Ibrahim khansari. A variety of {{decorated}} tiles {{in the building}} display designs of humans, animals, and plants. Drawings and paintings of the four seasons {{of the year in}} the four corners of <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reason for its name. <b>The</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only <b>bathroom</b> where, a separate part is devoted to religious minorities.

25|$|To {{complete}} the set up, 26 surveillance cameras are positioned {{all over the}} house to watch the housemates' every move, including <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> For modesty's sake, however, images from <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> will <b>be</b> shown if <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> used for any purpose other than bathing (such as gossiping).|$|R

500|$|With a {{shooting}} budget of $700,000, Saw began principal photography on [...] at Lacy Street Production Facility in Los Angeles for 18 days. <b>The</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> the only set {{that had to}} be built. Danny Glover completed his scenes in two days. Due to the tight shooting schedule, Wan could not afford to shoot {{more than a couple of}} takes per actor. [...] "It was a really tough struggle for me. Every day, it was me fighting to get the shots I did not get. I had high aspirations, but there's only so much you can do. I wanted to make it in a very Hitchcockian style of filmmaking, but that style of filmmaking takes time to set up and so on," [...] Wan said about the very short shooting schedule. He said the style instead ended up being [...] "more gritty and rough around the edges due to the lack of time and money that we had to shoot the movie with" [...] and it ultimately became the aesthetic of the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Toxic" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} December 2003, on a sound-stage in Los Angeles, California. It was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single [...] "Stronger". The editor of the video was David Blackburn, who also edited [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "Do Somethin'". Brad Rushing was the cinematographer. Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex-lover, to which Kahn created a treatment for. Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed, exemplifying the scene in which she drops water on the passenger's lap. Spears {{said she wanted to}} join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed a man in the bathroom. Kahn suggested making him a fat man, so the [...] "common man" [...] would feel represented. Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds. Kahn stated he was [...] "not sure what I was thinking about when she told me about that scene, maybe those intros to James Bond movies, but every video needs an iconic image to remember, and that's it". The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears, and every scene had a completely different strictly structured routine. After the treatment was finished, Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances, as in most of his projects. The plane passenger in which Spears drops water on was played by his long-time casting director, while the fat man in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> played by the casting director's assistant. Spears's boyfriend is played by Martin Henderson, who starred in Kahn's directorial debut Torque.|$|E
2500|$|After closing {{its doors}} to the public, the house {{was used by the}} Texas Gulf Coast Chapter of the American Society of Interior Designers as a showcase. [...] The home was {{redesigned}} at no cost to the GHF. [...] Designers donated their time, and businesses and craftsmen donated an estimated $100,000 worth of materials and time. [...] The redesigned house features wood floors, stenciling in the entryway, and faux crown molding in the dining room. The color palette is now blues, roses, soft yellow, and gold colors, and the furniture is a mix of period piecessome originally owned by the Williams familyand contemporary furniture. [...] The theater was converted to a kitchen, and <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> upgraded with antique fixtures.|$|E
50|$|The {{rooms are}} all well-furnished with local antiques, and <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>are</b> modern. None {{of the rooms}} have televisions; instead, {{classical}} music is piped in.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, {{a fire in}} {{the school}} left the school damaged in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> and main hall. The halls and <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>were</b> later cleaned up and remodeled and then resumed classes in May 2014.|$|R
50|$|Furo {{are part}} of the Japanese ritual of bathing, not meant for washing but rather for {{relaxing}} and warming oneself. Washing is carried out separately outside the yubune. The bather should enter the water only after rinsing or lightly showering. Generally Japanese <b>bathrooms</b> <b>are</b> small by Western standards, so <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> set up much like a walk-in shower area but containing the furo. Since <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> a complete wet-area, in modern buildings and ryokan heating is provided by air conditioners overhead. The water is hot, usually approximately 100 to 108 degrees F (38 to 42 degrees Celsius).|$|R

60|$|The track {{leading to}} <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> most in evidence, {{and the two}} professors quickly {{discovered}} the big snowball resting in the bathtub.|$|E
6000|$|Peter, the snake, loafing contentedly {{about the}} carpet, found himself seized {{by what the}} Encyclopaedia calls the [...] "distensible gullet" [...] and looked up reproachfully. The next moment {{he was in his}} bag again; and Archie, {{bounding}} silently into <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>was</b> tearing the cord off his dressing-gown.|$|E
50|$|The average room is 30 to 35 {{square metres}} {{in size and}} feature silk covered walls. <b>The</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>are</b> classically {{decorated}} in marble and have jacuzzi baths.|$|R
50|$|According to a Haaretz report, {{the cell}} is 16 square meters in size, and {{includes}} a table, chair, bed, television, and several personal items. <b>The</b> cell <b>bathroom</b> stall and shower area is separated {{from the rest of}} the cell by a transparent door that hides the inmate's genitals, and the camera in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> not normally activated, but <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> has special monitoring system that works by identifying breathing and body movements. If no movement is detected after a certain period, the camera in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> activated and an alarm is raised. The showerhead is also flexible to prevent any suicide-by-hanging attempt by an inmate. During Zygier's stay there, the cell was under constant camera surveillance.|$|R
50|$|Also in 2015 the Obama {{administration}} {{announced it}} had opened a gender-neutral <b>bathroom</b> within <b>the</b> White House complex; <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> Eisenhower Executive Office Building, {{next door to}} the West Wing.|$|R
60|$|Then those {{magnificent}} water-tight compartments {{that cost}} {{so much time}} and money--well, they weren't water-tight after all. The water moved free as the air from one compartment to another; furthermore, a strong smell of gasolene from the after compartment leads me to suspect that some {{one or more of the}} half-dozen tanks there stored have sprung a leak. The tanks leak, and they are not hermetically sealed in their compartment. Then there was the bath-room with its pumps and levers and sea-valves--it went out of commission inside the first twenty hours. Powerful iron levers broke off short in one's hand when one tried to pump with them. <b>The</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> the swiftest wreck of any portion of the Snark.|$|E
6000|$|Though {{the house}} was not large it had, like all houses on Floral Heights, an {{altogether}} royal bathroom of porcelain and glazed tile and metal sleek as silver. The towel-rack was a rod of clear glass set in nickel. The tub was long enough for a Prussian Guard, and above the set bowl was a sensational exhibit of tooth-brush holder, shaving-brush holder, soap-dish, sponge-dish, and medicine-cabinet, so glittering and so ingenious that they resembled an electrical instrument-board. But the Babbitt whose god was Modern Appliances was not pleased. The air of <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> thick {{with the smell of}} a heathen toothpaste. [...] "Verona been at it again! 'Stead of sticking to Lilidol, like I've re-peat-ed-ly asked her, she's gone and gotten some confounded stinkum stuff that makes you sick!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{admired the}} car, she admired the colour {{of the car}}, she admired the lamps {{of the car and}} the door of the car and the little {{fittings}} of the car. She admired the horn. She admired the twist of the horn. She admired Clarence and the uniform of Clarence and she admired and coveted the great fur coat that he held ready for his employer. (But if she had it, she said, she would wear the splendid fur outside to show every little bit of it.) And when the car at last moved forward and tooted--she admired the note--and vanished softly and swiftly through the gates, she was left in the porch with Mr. Brumley still by sheer inertia admiring and envying. She admired Sir Isaac's car number Z 900. (Such an easy one to remember!) Then she stopped abruptly, as one might discover that the water in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> running to waste and turn it off.|$|E
5000|$|Approx 67 minutes: {{the scene}} where Adam attacks Brenda in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> cut in <b>the</b> Adam and Nicole version, losing shots of him {{slapping}} her and trying to drown her in the bath.|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} {{inside the}} I-Beam was deliberately kept as warm {{as possible in}} order to encourage people to take off their shirts while they were dancing; sexual encounters in <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>were</b> a common occurrence.|$|R
50|$|Maturational Delay- the child's {{recognition}} that the bladder is full {{and he or she}} needs to go to <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>is</b> a developmental issue. Many children with Enuresis will develop this skill as they grow older.|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} in 1909. The {{interior}} of the residence retains much of the historic design elements, although it was altered to some degree between 1992-1994 {{for use as a}} medical clinic. To meet code requirements, the first floor was rearranged. The stairway was moved, the hallway was widened and <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> remodeled. On the second floor, the ceiling height was increased and <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> re-configured. In addition, the basement was dug out to legal code ceiling height.|$|E
5000|$|The police {{crept up}} to the front door, slowly opened it, and stepped inside. Coming out of <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>was</b> George Kelly Barnes. Caught without a weapon, Kelly {{supposedly}} cried, [...] "Don’t shoot, G-Men! Don’t shoot, G-Men!" [...] as he surrendered to FBI agents and Memphis police.|$|E
50|$|At some point, {{even the}} prisoners who were {{thought of as}} role models and obeyed all of the guards' {{commands}} were being punished.
