5|$|Americium readily {{reacts with}} oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common {{oxidation}} state for americium is +3, in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation {{states have been}} observed between +2 and +7, which is <b>the</b> <b>widest</b> <b>range</b> among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am4+ (yellow-reddish), AmV; (yellow), AmVI (brown) and AmVII (dark green). All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm.|$|E

25|$|Isolated {{flooding}} started across {{parts of}} the state in early December.

25|$|Early visual {{observations}} {{contributing to}} the phase curve of Mercury were obtained by G. Muller in the 1800s and by André-Louis Danjon in the mid-twentieth century. W. Irvine and colleagues used photoelectric photometry in the 1960s. Some of these early data were analyzed by G. de Vaucouleurs, summarized by D. Harris and used for predicting apparent magnitudes in the Astronomical Almanac for several decades. Highly accurate new observations covering <b>the</b> <b>widest</b> <b>range</b> of phase angles to date (2 to 170°) were carried out by A. Mallama, D. Wang and R. Howard using the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronograph (LASCO) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite. They also obtained new CCD observations from the ground. These data are now {{the major source of}} the phase curve used in the Astronomical Almanac for predicting apparent magnitudes.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the {{trombone}} gained a footing in the orchestra and opera, trombonists were no longer usually employed by a cathedral or court orchestra, and so were expected to provide their own instrument. Military musicians were provided with instruments, and instruments like the long F or E bass trombone remained in military use until around the First World War. However, orchestral musicians adopted the trombone version with <b>the</b> <b>widest</b> <b>range</b> that they could easily apply {{to any of the}} three trombone parts that typically appeared in scores—the tenor trombone. The appearance of valve trombones in the mid-19th century did little to alter the make-up of the orchestral trombone section; though it was ousted from orchestras in Germany and France, the valve trombone remained popular almost entirely to the exclusion of the slide instrument in countries such as Italy and Bohemia, and composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, Giacomo Puccini, Bedřich Smetana, and Antonín Dvořák scored for a valve trombone section.|$|E

25|$|Many metal {{silicides}} are known, most {{of which}} have formulae that cannot be explained through simple appeals to valence: their bonding ranges from metallic to ionic and covalent. Some known stoichiometries are M6Si, M5Si, M4Si, M15Si4, M3Si, M5Si2, M2Si, M5Si3, M3Si2, MSi, M2Si3, MSi2, MSi3, and MSi6. They are structurally more similar to the borides than the carbides, {{in keeping with the}} diagonal relationship between boron and silicon, although the larger size of silicon than boron means that exact structural analogies are few and far between. The heats of formation of the silicides are usually {{similar to those of the}} borides and carbides of the same elements, but they usually melt at lower temperatures. Silicides are known for all stable elements in groups 1–10, with the exception of beryllium: in particular, uranium and the transition metals of groups 4–10 show <b>the</b> <b>widest</b> <b>range</b> of stoichiometries. Except for copper, the metals in groups 11–15 do not form silicides. Most instead form eutectic mixtures, although the heaviest post-transition metals mercury, thallium, lead, and bismuth are completely immiscible with liquid silicon.|$|E
25|$|Those {{models that}} {{emphasize}} on lexical processes {{can be further}} {{divided into two groups}} based on how attention is allocated in the reading model. The mainstream model E-Z Reader (Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003), along with older ones like Reader (Just & Carpenter, 1980) and EMMA (Salvucci, 2001) assumes that attention is allocated to only one word sequentially. On the contrary, the SWIFT model assumes that attention in reading is distributed among the currently fixated word and its neighbours. Since attention allocation determines the input stream in these models, difference in attention allocation results in fundamental difference in the subsequent processing and simulation output. E-Z Reader incorporates various lexical properties into a complex structure of interaction between lexical processing, saccade programming and attention shifting; it reproduces <b>the</b> <b>widest</b> <b>range</b> of phenomena in reading behaviours and can be generalised to reading behaviours in elder people, in different languages and in different types of text presentation (Reichle, 2011). In contrast, SWIFT resorts to a dynamic field of parallel activation that stochastically triggers saccade programming, yielding parsimonious simulations of refixation, regression (fixate back to a previous word), and neighbouring effects (how neighbouring words affect the current fixation) (Engbert & Kliegl, 2011). The debate is still on whether attention in reading should be relaxed to more than one word.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of <b>the</b> <b>widest</b> <b>range</b> of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E
