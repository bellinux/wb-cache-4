40|$|Guanine rich {{sequences}} adopt {{a variety}} of four <b>stranded</b> <b>structures,</b> which differ in strand orientation and conformation about the glycosidic bond {{even though they are}} all stabilised by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonded guanine tetrads. Detailed model building and molecular mechanics calculations have been carried out to investigate various possible conformations of guanines along a strand and different possible orientations of guanine strands in a G-tetraplex structure. It is found that for an oligo G stretch per se, a parallel four <b>stranded</b> <b>structure</b> with all guanines in anti conformation is favoured over other possible tetraplex structures. Hence an alternating syn-anti arrangement of guanines along a strand is likely to occur only in folded back tetraplex structures with antiparallel G strands. Our study provides a theoretical rationale for the observed alternation of glycosidic conformation and the inverted stacking arrangement arising from base flipover, in antiparallel G-tetraplex structures and also highlights the various structural features arising due to different types of strand orientations. The molecular mechanics calculations help in elucidating the various interactions which stabilize different G-tetraplex structures and indicate that screening of phosphate charge by counterions could have a dramatic effect on groove width in these four <b>stranded</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sample-spanning {{networks}} of aggregated colloidal particles have a finite stiffness and deform elastically when {{subjected to a}} small shear stress. After some period of creep, these gels ultimately suffer catastrophic failure. This delayed yielding is governed by the association and dissociation dynamics of interparticle bonds and the <b>strand</b> <b>structure</b> of the gel. We derive a model which connects the kinetics of the colloids to {{the erosion of the}} <b>strand</b> <b>structure</b> and ultimately to macroscopic failure. Importantly, this model relates time-to-failure of the gel to an applied static stress. Model predictions are in quantitative agreement with experiments. It is predicted that the <b>strand</b> <b>structure,</b> characterized by its mesh size and strand coarseness, has a significant impact on delay time. Decreasing the mesh size or increasing the strand thickness makes colloidal gels more resilient to delayed yielding. The quench and flow history of gels modifies their microstructures. Our experiments show that a slow quenching increases the delay time due to the coarsening of the strands; by contrast, preshear reduces the delay time, which we explain by the increased mesh size as a result of shear-induced fracture of strands.

Here we investigated {{the effect on}} translation of an RNA/RNA duplex between part of the coding region and sequences of the 3 'untranslated region of lysozyme mRNA. A cDNA was constructed which contained 2 identical sequences of 150 nucleotides, {{one of which was}} an inverted repeat of the other. Cell-free transcription of this cDNA with T 7 RNA polymerase resulted in a mRNA with an extended RNA/RNA duplex within the coding region.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of berberine with single <b>stranded</b> poly(rA) <b>structure</b> was investigated {{using a combination}} of spectrophotometric, spectrofluorimetric, circular dichroic, viscometric, and thermodynamic studies. The interaction process was characterized by typical hypochromic and bathochromic effects in the absorption spectrum of berberine, enhancement of fluorescence intensity of berberine, increase of viscosity, and perturbation of circular dichroic spectrum of single stranded poly(rA). Scatchard plot obtained from spectrophotometric analysis showed that berberine bound strongly to single stranded poly(rA) in a non-cooperative manner. In contrast, berberine does not show any significant effect (i) in its absorbance and fluorescence spectra on binding to double stranded poly(rA), (ii) alter the circular dichroic spectrum of double stranded poly(rA), or (iii) increase of viscosity of double stranded poly(rA) indicating that it does not bind at all to double <b>stranded</b> poly(rA) <b>structure.</b> Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the binding of the alkaloid to single stranded poly(rA) is an endothermic process and entropy driven.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} two new, {{perceptually}} motivated strategies to better measure {{the similarity of}} 2 D shape instances {{that are in the}} form of closed contours. The first strategy handles shapes that can be decomposed into a base structure and a set of inward or outward pointing âstrandâ <b>structures,</b> where a <b>strand</b> <b>structure</b> represents a very thin, elongated shape part attached to the base structure. The similarity of two such shape contours can be better described by measuring the similarity of their base <b>structures</b> and <b>strand</b> <b>structures</b> in different ways. The second strategy handles shapes that exhibit good bilateral symmetry. In many cases, such shapes are invariant to a certain level of scaling transformation along their symmetry axis. In our experiments, we show that these two strategies can be integrated into available shape matching methods to improve the performance of shape classification on several widelyused shape data sets. Shape matching through nonrigid shape deformation is a typical approach to measure shape similarity [6, 14, 10, 21, 13, 16]. In general, this approach measures the amount of energy required to deform one shape contour into another based on some physical or mathematical model. The model is then optimized using methods such as dynamic programming to obtain a set of corresponded points on the two shape contours that minimize the deformation cost of this model. However, this approach is often very sensitive to strong, local shape variations that human vision may handle very well. For example, the two shape contours shown in Figs. 1 (a) and (b) are similar in general, but their outward parts, represented by the dashed curves, are quite different from each other. A large deformation cost may be required to match these two shape contours. 1...|$|R
