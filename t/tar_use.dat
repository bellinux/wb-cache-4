The death of Bluewater was announced to the fleet, at sunrise, by hauling down his flag from the mizzen of the Cæsar. The vice-admiral's flag came down with it, and re-appeared at the next minute at the fore of the Plantagenet. But the little white emblem of rank never went aloft again in honour of the deceased. At noon, it was spread over his coffin, on the main-deck of the ship, agreeably to his own request; and more than once that day, did some rough old <b>tar</b> <b>use</b> it, to wipe the tear from his eyes.|$|E

50|$|The {{choice between}} tar and rsync is {{dictated}} by the hardware and bandwidth available to the client. Clients backed up by rsync use considerably more CPU time than client machines using tar or SMB. Clients using SMB or <b>tar</b> <b>use</b> considerably more bandwidth than clients using rsync. These trade-offs are inherent in {{the differences between the}} protocols. Using tar or SMB transfers each file in its entirety, using little CPU but maximum bandwidth. The rsync method calculates checksums for each file on both the client and server machines in a way that enables a transfer of just {{the differences between the two}} files; this uses more CPU resources, but minimizes bandwidth.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: A multi-centre IARC-coordinated European {{cohort study}} {{provided}} {{evidence of an}} association between lung cancer risk and bitumen fume exposure. Sensitivity {{analyses were conducted to}} assess whether these associations were robust to assumptions in the exposure assessment for which support could not be obtained due to lack of either measurements or direct observations. METHODS: New exposure estimates were generated by changing assumptions on exposure levels, specific tasks, lags, and coal <b>tar</b> <b>use.</b> Subsequently, Poisson regression models estimated relative risks (RRs); change in fit of models was evaluated. RESULTS: The influence of these assumptions was minimal, with log-likelihood deviations between - 5. 0 and 4. 7 % and similar patterns in dose-dependent increases of lung cancer risk. In the highest exposure categories, point estimates of RRs ranged 2. 07 - 2. 83 for average, and 1. 22 - 2. 23 for cumulative exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The small increase in lung cancer risk associated with bitumen fume exposure depends only to a limited extent on the subjective judgments made in the exposure assessment for this cohort...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: An {{exposure}} matrix (EM) for {{known and}} suspected carcinogens {{was required for}} a multicenter international cohort study of cancer risk and bitumen among asphalt workers. METHODS: Production characteristics in companies enrolled {{in the study were}} ascertained through use of a company questionnaire (CQ). Exposures to coal tar, bitumen fume, organic vapor, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, diesel fume, silica, and asbestos were assessed semi-quantitatively using information from CQs, expert judgment, and statistical models. Exposures of road paving workers to bitumen fume, organic vapor, and benzo(a) pyrene were estimated quantitatively by applying regression models, based on monitoring data, to exposure scenarios identified by the CQs. RESULTS: Exposures estimates were derived for 217 companies enrolled in the cohort, plus the Swedish asphalt paving industry in general. Most companies were engaged in road paving and asphalt mixing, but some also participated in general construction and roofing. Coal <b>tar</b> <b>use</b> was most common in Denmark and The Netherlands, but the practice is now obsolete. Quantitative estimates of exposure to bitumen fume, organic vapor, and benzo(a) pyrene for pavers, and semi-quantitative estimates of exposure to these agents among all subjects were strongly correlated. Semi-quantitative estimates of exposure to bitumen fume and coal tar exposures were only moderately correlated. EM assessed non-monotonic historical decrease in exposures to all agents assessed except silica and diesel exhaust. CONCLUSIONS: We produced a data-driven EM using methodology that can be adapted for other multicenter studies...|$|E
