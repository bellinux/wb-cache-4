5|$|The Germans {{were not}} able to hold Dijon and ordered a {{complete}} withdrawal from Southern France. Army GroupG retreated further north, pursued by Allied forces. The fighting ultimately came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the Vosges mountains, where Army GroupG was finally able to establish a stable defense line. After meeting with the Allied units from Operation Overlord, the Allied forces were in need of reorganizing and, facing stiffened German resistance, the offensive was halted on 14September. Operation Dragoon was considered a success by the Allies. It enabled them to liberate most of Southern France in a time span of only four weeks, while inflicting heavy casualties on the German forces, although a substantial part of the best German units was able to escape. The captured French ports were put into operation, allowing the Allies to solve their supply problems soon after.|$|E
5|$|Four {{hours of}} {{practice}} were {{held for the}} field on Wednesday afternoon, but again suffered from variable wet conditions throughout. The No. 17 Porsche once again led the session although Webber was the fastest driver to set the three minutes and 21.362 seconds lap time. Audi closed to within half a second with Loïc Duval's three minutes and 21.950 seconds lap. The LMP2 category had only a single car manage a lap under three minutes and 40 seconds when Richard Bradley set a three minutes and 39.897 seconds lap, a full second ahead of the No. 34 OAK Ligier-Honda. The KCMG car had earlier caused the session to be red flagged when the car came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the first Mulsanne Straight chicane. The Murphy Prototypes Oreca-Nissan later caused a second stoppage when Mark Patterson spun in the Porsche Curves entry and heavily impacted the safety barrier. Patterson was unhurt. The LMGTE Pro category was again led by Aston Martin, Richie Stanaway's No. 99 car setting a three minutes and 55.895 seconds lap, followed by the No. 64 Corvette and the No. 97 Aston Martin. Mathias Lauda kept the No. 98 Aston Martin ahead in LMGTE Am, nearly two seconds ahead of the two Proton Porsche cars.|$|E
5|$|In {{that race}} at Brands Hatch, Pryce took an unfancied Royale RP11 to {{first place in}} the Formula Three support race for the 1972 Formula One Race of Champions against many {{established}} Formula Three drivers such as Roger Williamson, Jochen Mass and James Hunt. So large was Pryce's advantage {{at the end of the}} race, many of the other teams voiced an opinion that Pryce's car had run the race underweight; it turned out that the circuit's weighbridge certificate had expired and everyone's cars had been underweight. Pryce retired from the leading group in the following two rounds at Oulton Park and Zandvoort, and then during practice for the support race of the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix his car came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> Casino Square after a wire had come loose. He had exited his car to correct the problem when Peter Lamplough lost control of his car and struck the Royale RP11. Pryce was knocked into a shop window and broke a leg.|$|E

Upbound trams continued along Tyholtveien to the stop at Asbjørns gate, which served the Tyholt neighborhood. This section consisted of double track laid {{prior to the}} loop being built. Asbjørns gate was used for a regulation pause in the schedule. The line continued along Henrik Mathiesens vei to a stop named Lærerhøyskolen. This served the neighborhood of Rosenborg and a campus of the Norwegian College of Teaching in Trondheim. The line then continued down one block of Christians Monsens gate before reaching Stadsingeniør Dahls gate. Just afterwards the tram made a stop.

2500|$|Route 75 was a {{proposed}} freeway in the U.S. State of New Jersey in the Newark area in 1960s and 1970s. [...] It {{was designed to}} connect the existing Route 21 freeway north of Newark with Interstate 78, U.S. Route 1-9, and Newark Airport. [...] The state of New Jersey applied for interstate status for the route in 1970, but construction of the road remained stalled in courts throughout the 1970s. [...] In 1973, the state of New Jersey and the Federal Highway Administration shelved plans for the route, and in 1997, the state of New Jersey officially removed the route from its route logs. [...] Despite its removal, vestiges of Route 75 still remain. [...] The first example is Exit 13 on Interstate 280 eastbound in Newark. [...] The exit is an enormous three lane ramp, while through traffic on I-280 has only two lanes. [...] The ramp comes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> a traffic light on First Street, just south of Orange Street.

2500|$|In 1961, {{shortly after}} Pigeon Forge officially incorporated, North Carolina {{brothers}} Grover and Harry Robbins opened Rebel Railroad in the town's Middle Creek area. The railroad simulated {{a ride on}} a Confederate steam train that was under attack by Union soldiers during the Civil War, playing upon the centennial of the war that was sweeping {{the country at the}} time. After the Union assault was beaten back, the railroad came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> a mock-frontier mountain town, complete with blacksmith shop, general store, and saloon. By 1964, the Civil War Centennial was beginning to die down, so the Robbins brothers decided to rename Rebel Railroad Goldrush Junction.

Goldrush Junction was much more successful than Rebel Railroad had ever been, prompting the Robbins to buy a log flume amusement ride and erect it on the property in 1967.

The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. [...] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash {{was a result of}} a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system, even in inclement weather. Additionally, investigators recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by inbound trains. [...] The NTSB also recommended that Metro reinforce the 1000-series cars to help protect them against telescoping in a crash. [...] Metro rejected this recommendation in 2002, saying the modification was impractical and might lead to [...] "higher longitudinal accelerations" [...] and thus greater injuries. [...] The NTSB also advised Metro to install event recorders, similar to airplane black boxes, on all 1000-series cars. [...] This recommendation echoed one made following Metrorail's first fatal accident in 1982, when the NTSB recommended the installation of event recorders in trains, but despite some discussion by WMATA managers, no recorders had been installed by January 1996.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{disastrous}} [...] season and slow {{start to the}} 2006 season Michael Schumacher won consecutive races at Imola and the Nürburgring. During the final lap of his qualifying session for the Monaco Grand Prix, Schumacher came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the La Rascasse hairpin, resulting in yellow flags, meaning that other drivers could not go at maximum speed. After the session there were immediate complaints from the other teams claiming {{that this was a}} deliberate move by Schumacher to ensure he started in pole position – Alonso's flying lap that was affected by the yellow flags had been likely to beat Schumacher's fastest time – {{at the end of the}} second sector, Alonso was more than two-tenths of a second ahead of Schumacher's time, and his final time was just 0.064seconds slower than Schumacher. Although Schumacher insisted that he had simply locked up his brakes at the corner, a stewards' inquiry stated, [...] "We are left with no alternative but to conclude that the driver deliberately stopped his car on the circuit." [...] The penalty was that Schumacher's qualifying times were all deleted, demoting him to 22nd position on the grid. He opted to start from the pitlane, and finished fifth, after an incident in the race that required the safety car to be deployed. The Safety Car failed to aid Schumacher however, but in fact hampered him; because he was the last car to be lapped by leader Alonso, and under 2006 FIA rules; he was not allowed to un-lap himself under Safety Car conditions. This meant he was almost a full lap down on third placed Coulthard, and fourth placed Barrichello on the resumption of the race. But by the end, he was threatening to pass them for position; finishing less than two seconds off a podium spot.|$|E
