50|$|Nearly 15 {{years of}} {{environmental}} studies wrapped up {{on both the}} <b>toll</b> and <b>free</b> sections of the I-69 extension between Indianapolis and Evansville in 2006; the project was still being considered as a toll road by then. Project engineers and designers were by then identifying exact placement of interchanges, bridge structures, and connecting roads. In June 2006, officials revisited their decision from the Tier 1 EIS {{to account for the}} effects of tolling on the route, preparing a Tier 1 reevaluation report that concluded that the previously selected route remained the preferred alternative, even with tolls; the report was approved by the Federal Highway Administration in the fall of 2006.|$|R
500|$|In 1873 {{the privately}} owned Albert Bridge, between Chelsea and Battersea bridges, opened. Although Albert Bridge {{was not as}} {{successful}} as intended at luring customers from Chelsea Bridge and soon found itself in serious financial difficulties, it nonetheless caused {{a sharp drop in}} usage of Chelsea Bridge. In 1877 the Metropolis Toll Bridges Act was passed, which allowed the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW) to buy all London bridges between Hammersmith and Waterloo bridges and free them from tolls. Ownership of Chelsea Bridge was transferred to the MBW in 1877 at a cost of £75,000 (about £ in [...] ), and on 24 May 1879 Chelsea Bridge, Battersea Bridge and Albert Bridge were declared <b>toll</b> <b>free</b> by the Prince of Wales in a brief ceremony, after which a parade of Chelsea Pensioners marched across the bridge to Battersea Park.|$|E

30|$|As {{described}} above, {{there are}} large regional differences in the advantages the users report from the various incentives.

In addition, 26  % uses toll roads only and 6  % bus lanes only.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>toll</b> road {{remained}} <b>free</b> {{during its}} ramp up phase. Average daily patronage for August 2012 was 81,470, with average weekday traffic of 85,862.

[...] In February 2013, when Airport Link went into receivership, the average daily traffic using the road was 47,802 vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Some toll {{roads are}} concessions, privately funded and managed with {{supervision}} from SANRAL; {{these include the}} Platinum Highway (N1/N4), the Maputo Corridor (N4) and the N3 Toll Concession.

2500|$|During {{the three}} semi-finals (episodes 5-7), two finalists were chosen from each program, {{one by the}} jury and another by public vote. [...] The public voted for a {{contestant}} by phoning a specific telephone number, which was published before the show aired and shown during and after each performance. [...] Public voting started when the program aired on Friday and ended at midnight Sunday. Unlike the American TV series, where the public voted for free by calling a <b>toll</b> <b>free</b> number, the Swedish audience paid 5.70 Swedish kronor (June 2007, approximately US$0.82) for each call they made.|$|E
2500|$|Bihar Government {{has taken}} a number of steps to prevent the {{recurrence}} of such incidents. The Government issued a <b>toll</b> <b>free</b> number for all complaints related to Mid-Day Meal. It also ordered that the raw grain samples would be kept for three months at Godowns from where items for Midday Meal are supplied. A case was filed by Akhilanand Mishra (one of the victims).

2500|$|The first fixed {{crossing}} at Blackfriars was a [...] long toll bridge {{designed in}} an Italianate style by Robert Mylne and constructed with nine semi-elliptical arches of Portland stone. Beating designs by John Gwynn and George Dance, it took nine years to build, {{opening to the}} public in 1769. It was the third bridge across the Thames in the then built-up area of London, supplementing the ancient London Bridge, which dated from several centuries earlier, and Westminster Bridge. It was originally named [...] "William Pitt Bridge" [...] (after the Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder) as a dedication, but its informal name relating to the precinct within the City named after the Blackfriars Monastery, a Dominican priory which once stood nearby, was generally adopted. It was later made <b>toll</b> <b>free.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{survey of}} {{economic}} {{literature on the}} subject, however, finds that most economists agree {{that some form of}} road pricing to reduce congestion is economically viable, although there is disagreement on what form road pricing should take. Economists disagree over how to set tolls, how to cover common costs, what to do with any excess revenues, whether and how [...] "losers" [...] from <b>tolling</b> previously <b>free</b> roads should be compensated, and whether to privatize highways. Also, concerns regarding fossil fuel supply and urban transport high emissions of greenhouse gases in the context of climate change have renewed interest in congestion pricing, as it {{is considered one of the}} demand-side mechanisms that may reduce oil consumption.|$|R
5000|$|By June 11, {{most of the}} {{wreckage}} had been removed. For the new “permanent” bridge, two key issues had to be addressed: <b>toll</b> vs. <b>free</b> and iron vs. wood. Citizens were clearly {{in favor of a}} free bridge. (The Truesdell bridge was the last toll bridge in Dixon.) In spite of the intense emotions about the Truesdell Bridge, only two citizens attended the June city council meeting that decided the kind of bridge to be built. Alderman Kelsey proposed that “we build a good wooden bridge, a Howe Truss.” The motion passed unanimously. The overseer of the bridge project promised that the bridge would be “strong enough to carry a train of locomotives.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave Thomas MacDonald, {{chief at}} the Bureau of Public Roads, a {{hand-drawn}} {{map of the}} United States marked with eight superhighway corridors for study.

Fairbank wrote a report called <b>Toll</b> Roads and <b>Free</b> Roads, [...] "the first formal description of what became the interstate highway system" [...] and, in 1944, the similarly themed Interregional Highways.|$|R
