5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society. One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>a</b> proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the concept}} of chakra appears in the Indian mythology {{as well as in}} Buddhism and in some other belief systems, when asked in an interview, Kishimoto claimed that none of these {{influences}} were the basis for his use of the concept in Naruto.

Legislators also approved construction of a canal around the Cumberland Falls and improvements along the Tradewater River.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, several U.S. Navy {{submarines}} {{were forced}} back to base to repair {{damage caused by}} cookiecutter shark bites to the neoprene boots of their AN/BQR-19 sonar domes, which caused the sound-transmitting oil inside to leak and impaired navigation. An unknown enemy weapon was initially feared, before this shark was identified as the culprit, and the problem was solved by installing fiberglass covers around the domes. In the 1980s, some thirty U.S. Navy submarines were damaged by cookiecutter shark bites, mostly to the rubber-sheathed electric cable leading to the sounding probe used to ensure safety when surfacing in shipping zones. Again, the solution was <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>a</b> fiberglass coating. Oceanographic equipment and telecommunications cables have also been damaged by this species.|$|E

5|$|Wu {{chose to}} do this by taking a sample of {{radioactive}} cobalt-60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed {{to reduce the amount}} of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to practically nil. Also, Wu needed <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>a</b> constant and uniform magnetic field across the sample of cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line up in the same direction. For this cryogenic work, she needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.|$|E
5|$|In October and November 2004, the IOC {{established}} an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic programme and all non-Olympic recognised sports. The goal was <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>a</b> systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for each {{celebration of the}} Games. The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic programme. These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport. From this study five recognised sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash. These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash. Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic programme. In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{implementation}} of this strategy was left to the commander on site, Major General Walter Walker, {{a veteran of the}} Burma Campaign of the Second World War who had learned the hard lessons of the Malayan Emergency. Walker realised that a defensive strategy would leave all British forces tied down defending their bases, and instead determined to take the initiative from the aggressive Indonesians. Walker ordered that one-third of a unit should be left defending its base, which would be one of many along the border, while the remainder patrolled the jungle, foraying into Indonesian territory and attempting to keep them tied down at their headquarters instead. Thus, the British would attempt to control the jungle in the style of classic guerrilla warfare. But Walker was walking on a tightrope. His instructions, as were given to most colonial commanders, were to use 'minimum force' so as not to provoke Sukarno into escalating the conflict. However, he had <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>a</b> certain level of destructive power to cow the aggressive and assertive Indonesians.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the history}} of fabric {{production}} natural dyes have been used <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>a</b> form of colour, with dyes from plants, including indigo from Woad, having dozens of compounds whose proportions may vary according to soil type and climate; therefore giving rise to variations in shade. In {{the case of the}} Saltire, variations in shades of blue have resulted in the background of the flag ranging from sky blue to navy blue. When incorporated as part of the Union Flag during the 17th century, the dark blue applied to Union Flags destined for maritime use was possibly {{selected on the basis of}} the durability of darker dyes, with this dark blue shade eventually becoming standard on Union Flags both at sea and on land. Some flag manufacturers selected the same navy blue colour trend of the Union Flag for the Saltire itself, leading to a variety of shades of blue being depicted on the flag of Scotland.|$|E
