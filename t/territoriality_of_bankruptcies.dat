40|$|Mainstream International Relations theory defines {{sovereignty}} as {{a property}} of territorial states. The emergence of global ecopolitical NGOs has challenged the traditional relationship between territory and sovereignty by proposing alternate constructions of territory. These alternate constructions <b>of</b> <b>territoriality</b> have emerged most clearly in post-colonial Latin American states where conflicts have erupted between ecopolitics and economic development. A critical {{reading of the}} discourse of mainstream sovereignty and ecopolitics through three case studies—petroleum development in the Ecuadoran Amazon, {{the creation of a}} private nature preserve in southern Chile, and the Grande Carajas Iron Ore mine in the Brazilian Amazon—reveals that the signified of sovereignty has split. Territoriality in the post-colonial Latin American state can be read in terms <b>of</b> three constructions—the <b>territoriality</b> <b>of</b> the post-colonial state; the <b>territoriality</b> <b>of</b> global ecopolitical organizations; and the <b>territoriality</b> <b>of</b> global financial IGOs. The diversity of territorial constructs produces a diversity in the structure of sovereignty that requires the marginalization of these constructs by the mainstream discourse of International Relations theory. ...|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} deterritorialization as an important dimension of globalization on the contemporary evolution of the modern state. The modern state has been a territorial phenomenon in the sense it has used strategical approaches to space {{in order to control}} it. The effective use of such strategies has enabled the modern state to achieve and maintain unprecedented degree <b>of</b> <b>territoriality,</b> that is a control over a physical space. However, with the rise of the trend of deterritorialization constituting the spatial logic <b>of</b> globalization, the <b>territoriality</b> <b>of</b> the modern state has become problematic. Thus the basic characteristics of the modern state, which have been founded in its territoriality, are being eroded under the effects of deterritorialization. The case of European Integration is analyzed to reveal the extent and scope of deterritorialization and to show how deterritorialization has challenged the <b>territoriality</b> <b>of</b> the modern state.

40|$|Abstract. In Lithuania, <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> {{natural persons}} is a {{relatively}} new subject that has been scientifically only randomly dealt with. The bill <b>of</b> <b>Bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> Natural Persons in Lithuania was proposed as early as in spring 2009 (No. XIP- 450, 24. 03. 2009). The bill met with a considerable amount of criticism and was postponed for further improvement. By decree No. 413 of April 7, 2010, the Government of the Republic of Lithuania approved the concept <b>of</b> the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons of the Republic of Lithuania. The principal goal of the concept was to consolidate the main provisions of the future law. The Law <b>of</b> <b>Bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> Natural Persons of the Republic of Lithuania has come into effect since March 1, 2013. The authors of the article overview the concept and models <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons and introduce the advantages and shortcomings of the institute <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons. Based on scientific sources of Lithuanian and foreign authors, the article offers a theoretically systemized version of the main reasons determining the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons. The reasons fall into two categories – economic and social. The article is mainly targeted at defining the reasons that determine the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons in Lithuania. To achieve this goal, a quantitative survey of the questionnaires of natural persons affected by bankruptcy has been taken for the basis. In their questionnaires, the natural persons affected by bankruptcy have been asked to evaluate the reasons <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy.</b> The results have been analyzed with the help of factor analysis and statistically processed using the SPSS statistical software package.

40|$|This report {{looks at}} the basis and {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> law in the Czech Republic and the impact <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> on various sections of Czech society. The current legal framework is founded on the Bankruptcy and Settlement Act of 1991 and has been amended seven times, the most recent and significant of these being the 1996 amendment. As a consequence of these changes, the law now represents a reasonably functional mechanism for bringing about bankruptcy and settlement. The number <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> cases coming to court grew rapidly in the period 1992 - 1996. However, because of the shortcomings <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> legislation, {{the vast majority of}} these cases became stuck in the courts, while settlement of such cases was almost non-existent. The 1996 amendment sought to address the loopholes in the law which allowed indebted businesses to prolong or avoid bankruptcy declaration, principally by restricting the availability of the so-called „protection period“. The lack of expertise within the Czech legal fraternity has contributed to the slow processing <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> cases. In particular, the low level <b>of</b> training <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> administrators and the low financial rewards such work offers has limited the number of competent officials able to deal wit...|$|R
