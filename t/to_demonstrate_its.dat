5|$|Disquiet about Belgium's {{support for}} the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country. The Secretary General of the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, {{believed}} that the crisis would provide the organisation with a chance <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> <b>its</b> potential as a major peacekeeping force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command. On 14 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 143, calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN-commanded force.|$|E

5|$|Opposing the {{decentralisation}} stance {{taken in}} the treaty, Pavlov {{was one of the}} key players in the establishment of the State Committee for the State of Emergency in August 1991.

The Committee's main goal was to ensure that the Soviet Union continued as a highly centralised union state. The Emergency Committee was led by Gennady Yanayev, Vice President of the Soviet Union, Interior Minister Boris Pugo, Defence Minister Dmitry Yazov and other hardliners who were determined to take action to oust Gorbachev.|$|E
5|$|The lack of old native {{names for}} {{it has been}} used <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> <b>its</b> absence in Britain before {{introduction}} in around 1487, but this is challenged by the presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree, fior chrann which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at least {{as far back as the}} Gaelic settlement at Dál Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries. This would make it either an archaeophyte (a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500) or perhaps native if it can be seen to have reached Scotland without human intervention. At the moment it is usually classified as a neophyte, a plant that is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500. Today, the sycamore is present in 3,461 (89.7%) of hectads in Britain, more than any native tree species.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee's {{breath was}} thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and it was {{considered}} responsible for epidemics and drought. Seaweed burning to create what was known {{at the time as}} kelp began on Stronsay in 1722. The product– soda ash– was an alkali mainly used to treat acidic soil, although as time went on its commercial importance in soap and glass manufacture increased. The pungent smoke emitted during the process was believed to enrage the nuckelavee, resulting in a wild rampage of plague, the deaths of cattle and the destruction of crops. The nuckelavee was said to have infected horses on Stronsay with the deadly disease known as mortasheen, <b>to</b> <b>demonstrate</b> <b>its</b> fury and exact its revenge against the islanders for burning seaweed; the infection subsequently spread to all the other islands involved in the industry. The creature was also blamed for prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water shortages and poor harvests.|$|E
