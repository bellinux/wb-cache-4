5|$|In 1837, the Maine <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society</b> split {{over whether}} they should seek to ban wine as well as spirits; Dow sided with the anti-wine forces, who formed their own organization, the Maine Temperance Union. That year James Appleton, a Whig {{representative}} in the state legislature, proposed a prohibition law, and Dow spoke often and forcefully {{in favor of the}} effort, which was unsuccessful. Appleton proposed a similar law in 1838 and 1839, but despite his and Dow's best efforts, he continued to be defeated.|$|E
5|$|The community's Finns {{organized}} a <b>temperance</b> <b>society</b> {{and built the}} Finnish Temperance Hall. The community also included a band, a volunteer fire department, tennis courts and a clubhouse for employees. A small Methodist church and Presbyterian church were built. The town also had a night watchman and later a full-time patrolman. Always noted as a quiet, orderly town, Elcor managed to avoid the social vagaries of adjacent communities, like Gilbert's red-light district.|$|E
5|$|Many of Portland's middle- and upper-class citizens, {{including}} Dow, believed drunkenness {{was a great}} {{threat to}} the city's moral and financial well-being. In 1827, he became {{a founding member of}} the Maine <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society.</b> The group initially focused its efforts on the evils of distilled beverages, but by 1829, Dow declared he would abstain from all alcoholic beverages. At the same time, he associated himself with anti-Masonic and anti-slavery causes, and became more involved with politics generally. In the 1832 presidential election, unsatisfied with both Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay, Dow backed William Wirt, a minor-party candidate.|$|E

5|$|Temperance {{became a}} part of the evangelical Protestant {{initiative}} during Indiana's pioneer era and early statehood. Many Hoosiers freely indulged in drinking locally distilled whiskey on a daily basis, with binges on election days and holidays, and during community celebrations Reformers announced that the devil was at work and must be repudiated. A state <b>temperance</b> <b>society</b> formed in 1829 and local temperance societies soon organized in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and Logansport. By the 1830s pietistic (evangelical) Protestants and community leaders had joined forces to curb consumption of alcohol. In 1847 the Indiana General Assembly passed a local option bill that allowed a vote on whether to prohibit alcohol sales in a township.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} turned {{public opinion}} against Dow, {{and he was}} denounced in newspapers across the nation. He was tried for violation of the prohibition law; the prosecutor was former U.S. Attorney General Nathan Clifford, a longtime Dow opponent, and the defense attorney was a fellow founder of the Maine <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society,</b> future senator William P. Fessenden. Dow was acquitted, but his opponents convinced the coroner to impanel a jury that pronounced the protester's death a homicide. He was ultimately acquitted of that charge, but his popularity had suffered and he declined to run for re-election as mayor.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Dow {{returned}} to his leadership of the prohibition movement, co-founding the National <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society</b> and Publishing House with James Black in 1865. He {{spent the rest of}} the 1860s and 1870s giving speeches in support of temperance across the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. His efforts produced little success, as the public turned against prohibition and the alcohol industry was better organized to resist. Dow expended a great deal of effort organizing and giving speeches in support of the Liberal Party before the British elections of 1874, as their leader, William Ewart Gladstone, was sympathetic to prohibition; the Liberals lost decisively, a result Gladstone and Dow blamed on liquor interests. Dow continued to promote prohibition in Britain until May 1875 when, exhausted, he returned home.|$|E
50|$|Alcoholics Anonymous was not {{the first}} {{organization}} to use sobriety chips: other <b>temperance</b> <b>societies</b> gave medallions to those who swore to stop drinking/using and to track the duration of their sobriety.|$|R

5|$|Although {{best known}} for their joint {{work on behalf of}} women's suffrage, Stanton and Anthony first joined the temperance movement. Together, they were {{instrumental}} in founding the short-lived Woman's State <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society</b> (1852–1853). During her presidency of the organization, Stanton scandalized many supporters by suggesting that drunkenness be made sufficient cause for divorce. But the relationship between the women's suffrage movement and the temperance movement was hardly accidental. The two movements had common interests, with women's suffrage filling the role of cause and prohibition becoming the effect. Later, in state after state, once women gained the right to vote, they could press for various political measures to reduce drunkenness, perceived to be largely a problem involving the male sex. Thus, the two movements became frequently allied.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt did not fare as well {{in state}} politics. He ardently {{supported}} Jacksonian principles, and wielded his veto against bills critical of President Jackson's land policy. He supported Jackson's desire to dissolve the Second Bank of the United States. Instead, he favored opening a number of state banks, but faced with a Whig majority in the legislature, he succeeded only in chartering the Louisville Bank of Kentucky. He also favored completion of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad, and supported a $300,000 loan from the state Board of Internal Improvements for that purpose. In 1833, a loan for half the amount was approved, and the railroad was not completed until 1851. Breathitt was {{also part of the}} temperance movement in Kentucky. In an 1832 address, he blamed consumption of alcohol for the high murder rate in the state. When the Kentucky Legislative <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society</b> was formed at a meeting in the state house on January 13, 1834, Breathitt was chosen as its president and Lieutenant Governor Morehead served as one of five vice-presidents.|$|E
5|$|Drawn by the city's prosperous economy, the Blackburns {{relocated}} to Natchez, Mississippi, in 1847. Luke Blackburn quickly became {{an active member}} of the community, helping found a <b>temperance</b> <b>society,</b> joining a militia group, and becoming the administrator of a local hospital. He became a close associate of Jefferson Davis and William Johnson. In 1848, Blackburn served as the city's health officer and implemented the first successful quarantine against a yellow fever outbreak in the Mississippi River valley. Using his own personal funds, he established a hospital for boatmen who navigated the Mississippi River. He also successfully lobbied the Congress to establish a hospital in Natchez; upon its completion in 1852, he was appointed surgeon there. In 1854, he implemented another successful quarantine against yellow fever. The Mississippi Legislature commissioned Blackburn to lobby the Louisiana State Legislature to establish a quarantine at New Orleans to protect cities along the Mississippi River; Louisiana authorized him to organize such a system.|$|E
50|$|He {{arrived in}} New York in 1848 and, ignorant of English, {{was sent to}} {{minister}} to the Native Americans at Old Town, Maine. They had been without a priest for twenty years. He founded several <b>temperance</b> <b>societies</b> in Maine.|$|R

50|$|An {{economic}} boom began in 1866, {{when the first}} coal mine was opened by businessman Ira B. Mackey, Jr. Vienna was inundated with men seeking work in some 20 mines opened over the next 20 years. The built environment of Vienna Center (also called Vienna Village) changed {{with the construction of}} 32 saloons, bar-rooms, and billiard parlors. Some Vienna residents responded by establishing <b>temperance</b> <b>societies.</b> Tensard Mackey (Ira B. Mackey's brother) operated a temperance hotel on the northeast corner of Vienna Center; this building stood until 1966. Temperance reform nationwide was the work of women, and in 1880 Vienna's <b>temperance</b> <b>societies</b> petitioned the state to allow women to vote on local issues.|$|R
25|$|Besides those {{dedicated}} to missions, Congregationalists created voluntary societies for encouraging education, Bible reading and moral reform. Some of these became national organizations, {{such as the}} American Education Society in 1815 (which provided financial aid for seminary students), the American Bible Society in 1816, the American Colonization Society in 1817, and the American <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society</b> in 1826. Some of these were joint projects with Presbyterians.|$|E
25|$|He married Minerva Fort. Their daughter, Missouri Pinckney, {{was born}} on July 17, 1829. A second daughter, Minerva, nicknamed Eliza, was born mentally ill in 1832. While living in Columbus, Georgia, he enlisted in the militia {{and worked as a}} merchant. In Muscogee County, {{he was a member of}} the <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society</b> and served for a short time as a judge. By 1832, Fannin was {{involved}} in the (illegal) business of transporting slaves.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} {{was another}} target of reformers in the 1850s. Americans drank heavily, which contributed to violent behaviour, crime, health problems, and poor workplace performance. Groups {{such as the}} American <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society</b> condemned liquor as being a scourge on society and urged temperance among their followers. The state of Maine attempted in 1851 to ban alcohol sales and production entirely, but it met resistance and was abandoned. The prohibition movement was forgotten during the Civil War, but would return in the 1870s.|$|E
50|$|John Mackay Wilson (15 August 1804 - 2 October 1835) was a Scottish writer {{famous for}} the six volume Tales of The Borders. He was born in Tweedmouth, {{on the border between}} Scotland and England. He gave many talks to <b>Temperance</b> <b>societies.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Priests also founded <b>temperance</b> <b>societies,</b> reading clubs, {{and were}} {{significant}} {{figures in the}} Ukrainian cooperative movement.

50|$|This {{controversy}} over whether churches or members should participate in mission boards, Bible tract <b>societies,</b> and <b>temperance</b> <b>societies</b> led the Primitive Baptists {{to separate from}} other general Baptist groups that supported such organizations, and to make declarations of opposition to such organizations in articles like the Kehukee Association Declaration of 1827.|$|R
25|$|The then 29-year-old Williams became {{friendly}} with 32-year-old Agnes Powell, {{who worked as}} a secretary with the <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society.</b> She was the eldest of a family of three sons and four daughters of Captain Francis Powell of Kent, who was prominent in local Masonic and Conservative political circles. Williams and Agnes Powell married in 1898 {{in the face of the}} strongest opposition of her father, who refused to give his consent and thereafter refused to receive Williams. They had five children; the first, Henry Francis Sylvestre, was born the following year.|$|E
25|$|In 1836, Young {{secured a}} vat from Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth's failed post on Wapato Island {{and began a}} {{distillery}} to produce alcohol. The Methodist Mission superintendent Jason Lee organized the Oregon <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society</b> and, along with McLoughlin, tried to get Young to stop his efforts. McLoughlin and the HBC prohibited alcohol sales to the Indigenous peoples, as they had seen that it caused problems. Late in the year, U.S. Navy Lieutenant William A. Slacum arrived on the ship Loriot and helped to dissuade Young from following through on the venture.|$|E
25|$|In 1852, she {{was elected}} as a {{delegate}} to the state temperance convention, but the chairman stopped her {{when she tried to}} speak, saying that women delegates were there only to listen and learn. Anthony and some other women immediately walked out and announced a meeting of their own, which created a committee to organize a women's state convention. Largely organized by Anthony, the convention of 500 women met in Rochester in April and created the Women's State <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society,</b> with Stanton as president and Anthony as state agent.|$|E

50|$|A temperance {{fountain}} was {{a fountain}} {{that was set}} up, usually by a private benefactor, to encourage people not to drink beer by the provision of safe and free water.

25|$|Indianapolis {{residents}} {{also established}} several new philanthropic and cultural institutions. While the Marion County <b>Temperance</b> <b>Society</b> (1828), the Indianapolis Benevolent Society (1835), and the Indianapolis Widows and Orphans Friends' Society (1851), addressed the town's early social concerns, the Indiana State Library (1825) and the Indiana Historical Society (1830) were formed to preserve {{state and local}} history. Early residents also had access to public lecture halls and the city's first libraries. By the early 1850s Indianapolis also had several new gathering places, including the Grand Lodge of the Free Masons, the city's first public hall; a new Odd Fellows Hall; the first Bates House hotel; and a Young Men's Christian Association. Local entertainment included musical concerts, theatrical performances, and art exhibitions. During the 1850s the city's German community established {{the first of several}} German clubs and cultural societies. The Indianapolis Turngemeinde (1851) or Turners, merged with other German clubs and became known as the Indianapolis Social Turnverein. The Indianapolis Maennerchor (1854) is the city's oldest German-language musical club. The Western Association of Writers was founded in Indianapolis in 1886.|$|E
5000|$|Gradually the {{association}} became more widely accepted, benefitting from {{its association with}} Evangelical Christianity and the Temperance movement.
