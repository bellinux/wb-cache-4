5|$|By {{the morning}} of 29 April it was {{estimated}} that approximately 10,000 people had gathered around the Embassy, while some 2,500 evacuees were in the Embassy and consular compounds. The crowds prevented the use of buses for transporting evacuees from the Embassy to the DAO Compound for evacuation and the Embassy gates were closed to prevent the crowd from surging through. Eligible evacuees now had to make themselves known to the Marine guards or Embassy staff manning <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> were then lifted over <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> into the Embassy compound. Among those arriving at the Embassy were Dr Phan Quang Dan, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for social welfare and refugee resettlement, and Lieutenant-General Dang Van Quang.|$|E
5|$|In Chagas-endemic areas, {{the main}} mode of {{transmission}} is through an insect vector called a triatomine bug. A triatomine becomes infected with T. cruzi by feeding on the blood of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> roofs.|$|E

5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E

40|$|Key words: {{diversion}} tunnel; {{textural stress}}; stress distribution; failure peculiarity Abstract. The textural stress has great {{effect on the}} stability of rock. According to the measured geo-stress data, through FEM and combined with the linear multivariate regression method, the geo-stress field was conducted. Using these methods, a diversion tunnel of a large-scale hydropower station was analyzed to study the stress distribution. It was shown that the stress concentration was located {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arch top, the stress in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> was little <b>and</b> <b>the</b> failure happened at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arch top, then the bottom board and some areas far from the tunnel. Under the condition without considering textural stress, the stress concentration area located in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> failure happened at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> then in <b>the</b> middle of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> arch top...|$|R
5|$|Angkor Wat, {{located at}} , {{is a unique}} {{combination}} of the temple mountain (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric galleries. The temple is a representation of Mount Meru, {{the home of the}} gods: the central quincunx of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.|$|E
5|$|At {{the angle}} of each aisle, a spiral {{staircase}} – still visible {{on each side of}} the surviving east wall – gave access to a passage inside <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> to secondary stairs within the angles of the main gable enabling access to all parts of the building for maintenance and cleaning without requiring scaffolding. Nothing remains of the north or south transepts, which extended on the north side beyond the present boundary wall into the graveyard of St Nicholas's Church.|$|E
5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> gates of the city. The castle had fallen into disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities {{had no control over}} royal property and the precincts became a refuge for lawbreakers.|$|E

Some extend as much as 4 feet up <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> are held in position using adhesive foam tapes or glues.|$|R

5|$|For the {{restoration}} of the Gamla stan metro station in 1998 the artist Göran Dahl furnished <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> floors with motifs from various medieval textiles and manuscripts, including the Överhogdal tapestries and the 14th-century Nobilis humilis (Magnushymnen) from the Orkney Islands. Vädersolstavlan is prominently featured on the eastern wall just south of the platform where the terrazzo wall depicts the emblematic sun dog arcs interwoven with enlarged fragments of textiles.|$|E
5|$|Further {{renovation}} {{work in the}} early 1970s led to improvements in the building's structure and included restoration of <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> windows. Large portions of cement additions by Zettervall to the exterior structure of the cathedral were removed decades later as they adversely affected the building's fabric. In 1989, Pope John Paul II took part in an ecumenical service in Uppsala Cathedral with Archbishop Bertil Werkström. Fire protection equipment was installed in 2010 and the electrical and heating systems have been replaced.|$|E

40|$|We {{interpret}} {{experimental results}} {{on the structure of}} an open channel flow with a strong transverse variation of the bottom roughness. Knowing <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> parameters, we analyze the behavior of Reynolds stress components by using asymptotic solutions of an algebraic stress model developed in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> free surface regions. This analysis allowed us to emphasize effects of secondary flows on the production of turbulence near <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> capability of this model to predict the normal components of the Reynolds tensor in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> free surface regions when the turbulent shear stresses are well predicted...|$|R

5|$|In 1876, the {{congregation}} voted {{by a margin}} of over two to one to re-orient the synagogue pews in the manner of Christian churches, and introduce mixed seating. However, nothing was done about this until 1879, when the renovations were carried out: the front pews were removed, the side pews extended to <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> the vestibule moved outside the sanctuary. Led by rabbi Dr. E. M. Myers, the synagogue was re-dedicated on September 7.|$|E
