Alternative configurations, such as gas filled columns and submerged motor pumps, will require development. Continued development, in general, should be expected due to changing technology and industry changes.

Eight of the programs occurred from 1996 to 2000. All involve long shaft pumps; all involve testing at TNX; and all involve a problem of some kind.

In this paper, it is observed that the static and dynamic characteristics of a five <b>pad</b> <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearing for the LBP and LOP configurations are influenced by the variation of preload and pivot offset.

40|$|LectureTilting pad {{bearings}} {{are used}} extensively in high power and/or high speed pump applications. Traditional white metallined {{also known as}} babbitted <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearings are used for oil lubricated bearings. Babbitted <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearings are not ideal for applications with low viscous lubricants, like waterbased fluids. For these applications, polymer bearings offer many advantages over traditional bearing materials including: Low friction coefficient, Higher flexibility, Wide range of operational temperature, High corrosion and chemical resistance, High shock and impact resistance, Tolerance against particle contamination, Electrical insulation. To achieve the desired improvement in performance, the material specifics of the polymer have to be carefully considered in the design process. One option available is a polymer lined <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearing which combines the excellent tribological properties of polymers and the high structural stiffness of the steel back. But a polymer lined metal pad does not provide the same equalizing effect offered by the higher compressibility of a solid polymer pad. For example the problems of an edge carrier can be reduced for a <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> journal bearing and the self-equalizing mechanism can be avoided for a <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> thrust bearing while considering the higher flexibility of solid PEEK pads. An additional advantage of a solid polymer pad is {{the elimination of the}} bonding between the polymer and the steel, so that a possible source of a bearing failure can be avoided upfront already. During a qualification test of a commercially available solid polymer <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> thrust bearing, the high Hertzian contact stress at the pivot let to indentations in the polymer. After a few operating hours these indentations are clearly visible and will finally lead to a complete loss of the advantages of a <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearing over a fixed geometry bearing. This lecture describes the steps involved in the optimization of the solid polymer <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearing design, with the objective to increase the reliability of the bearing assembly. The limitations of the available solid polymer <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> thrust bearing have been overcome by the integration of a metal reinforced pivot as mentioned by Gassmann et al. (2013). The results of the TEHD analysis presented form the base of the optimized journal and thrust bearing design. The new journal and thrust bearing design has been validated through testing of a prototype. The data collected during tests with the optimized thrust and journal bearings are in excellent agreement with the simulations. With the optimized bearing design, the limitations of the original pad design have been mitigated. The successfully qualified journal and thrust bearing are one of the building blocks required for product lubricated pumps and will be used in subsea pump applications...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 31 - 42 Analysis, design, and {{optimization}} of {{high performance}} journal and thrust bearings {{in a high}} speed integrally geared compressor are described. The high speed and relatively small bearing size stretches the applicable limits of conventional style <b>tilt</b> <b>pad</b> bearings. The variation in the load magnitude, {{as is the case}} with most gear loaded bearings, requires careful analysis of the stability and unbalance response characteristics. An optimized new flexible pivot bearing was used in this application to provide stable operation throughout the wide ranges of load and inlet temperature. The bearing incorporated a directed lubrication feature to reduce the hot oil carry over which is known to be a major contributor to high bearing temperatures in high speed applications. The precision inherent in the manufacturing process used to produce this style of bearing allowed further optimization of the preload and pivot offset. The use of an offset pivot configuration demonstrated lower sensitivity to bearing clearance variation. The necessity for high rotational speeds in integrally geared compressors increases the frictional power losses in the journal and thrust bearings. The parasitic losses constitute a significant percentage of the overall bearing power losses. Bearing designs that were utilized to reduce both the frictional and parasitic losses in the thrust bearings are discussed. The new thrust bearings were designed to provide an optimum crown-to-film thickness ratio allowing the bearing to carry the design thrust load with fewer pads. The analytical results for the conventional and deflection journal and thrust bearings are presented and compared to the test data. The new bearing resulted in lower steady state vibrations. At surge conditions, the synchronous and subsynchronous vibrations were about 25 percent of the conventional <b>tilt</b> <b>pad</b> bearing. The frictional and parasitic power losses with the new thrust bearing were about 20 percent lower than those of the conventional bearings. The temperature rise was also lower which indicated that the inlet temperature can be further increased with the new bearing allowing a wider operating temperature range and lower frictional losses...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 25 - 32 One {{property}} of heavily to moderately loaded sleeve bearings is the resulting asymmetric stiffness and damping coefficients. These asymmetric properties often result in split {{first critical speed}}s. Since the horizontal stiffness is much softer than the vertical, a horizontal first critical speed may appear from several hundred to several thousand revolutions per minute lower than the vertical first critical. <b>Tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearings produce more symmetric bearing properties. This symmetry usually results in a single unsplit first critical speed that is located approximately midway between the sleeve bearing split peaks. Two different case histories are examined. An induction motor and a steam turbine were both initially designed with <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearings. Both rotor bearing systems resulted in first critical speeds in the operating speed range. Numerous attempts to shift the critical out of the operating range were explored without success. As a last attempt short of a complete rotor redesign, switching to sleeve bearings was successful. Analytical results that support the decision to switch to sleeve bearings are shown along with actual test stand response plots. Additionally, for the steam turbine, results from a high speed balance are presented along with actual field speed-amplitude plots. While a <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> to sleeve bearing change is not recommended for all classes of turbomachinery to shift critical speeds, it is a powerful design tool as it may produce critical speed changes of up to 1000 rpm...|$|R
40|$|A flat, sector-shaped {{geometry}} for a liquid-lubricated {{thrust bearing}} is analyzed considering both the {{pitch and roll}} of the pad. Results are presented in design charts that enable a direct approach {{to the design of}} point- and line-pivoted, <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> bearings. A comparison is made with the Mitchell bearing approximation and it is found that this approximation always overestimates load capacity...|$|R
