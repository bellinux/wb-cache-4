5|$|The {{idea of a}} sonic {{weapon was}} one which had been unsuccessfully pioneered by German {{scientists}} {{under the control of}} Albert Speer during World War II. A book that Tintin examines in Professor Topolino's house, German Research in World War II by Leslie E. Simon– a retired Major General in the US Army– really existed and was published in 1947. In the strip, Hergé preserved the English language title of the book rather than translating it into French, although altered the book's cover design to remove a prominent swastika. The inclusion of the book {{is one of the few}} instances <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> reference to the Second World War within The Adventures of Tintin.|$|E
25|$|I {{have come}} to the clear {{conclusion}} that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. Nor do I consider <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services. I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, but I do not consider <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> occasion for any further investigation.|$|E

Gravity is mediated by a mysterious force, acting instantaneously across a distance, whose actions are independent of the intervening space. In contrast, Einstein denied <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> background Euclidean reference frame that extends throughout space.

25|$|The Brahmajāla Sutta {{mentions}} many śramaṇas {{with whom}} Buddha disagreed. For example, {{in contrast to}} Sramanic Jains whose philosophical premise includes {{the existence of an}} Atman (self, soul) in every being, Buddhist philosophy denies <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> self or soul. This concept called Anatta (or Anatman) is a part of Three Marks of existence in Buddhist philosophy, the other two being Dukkha (suffering) and Anicca (impermanence). According to Buddha, states Laumakis, everything lacks inherent existence. Buddhism is a non-theistic philosophy, which is especially concerned with pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination) and śūnyatā (emptiness or nothingness).|$|E
25|$|The Bermuda Triangle, {{also known}} as the Devil's Triangle, is a loosely-defined region {{in the western part of}} the North Atlantic Ocean, where a number of {{aircraft}} and ships are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Most reputable sources dismiss the idea <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> mystery. The vicinity of the Bermuda Triangle is one of the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships frequently crossing through it for ports in the Americas, Europe, and the Caribbean islands. Cruise ships and pleasure craft regularly sail through the region, and commercial and private aircraft routinely fly over it.|$|E
25|$|Khaled Abou El Fadl {{claims that}} the verses (88:21–22) {{emphasizes}} that even Muhammad {{does not have the}} right to think of himself as a warden who has the power to coerce people. This is reaffirmed by many of the historical reports regarding the Qur'anic revelation that emphasize that belief and conviction cannot be coerced. He further states that moderates consider the verse (2:256) to be enunciating a general, overriding principle that cannot be contradicted by isolated traditions attributed to the Prophet. He concludes that moderates do not believe <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> punishment that attaches to apostasy.|$|E

25|$|Polls {{consistently}} show {{a marked}} contrast between support for domestic partnerships and same-sex marriage. In 1997, roughly 38 percent of Californians supported same-sex marriage. More polls show {{an increase in}} support for same-sex marriage, but few polls suggest <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> more support for same-sex marriage than a statistical tie with opponents. On November 4, 2008, Californians voted, 52.2% to 47.8%, to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry. However, a recent 2012 poll showed vast increase in support of same sex marriage with 59% of Californians supporting same sex marriage and 80% supporting legal recognition of same sex couples. The 2012 poll found {{for the first time}} a majority support for same-sex marriage when non-marriage domestic partnerships were presented as an option.|$|E
25|$|The {{asymptotic}} complexity {{is defined}} by the most efficient (in terms of whatever computational resource one is considering) algorithm for solving the game; the most common complexity measure (computation time) is always lower-bounded by the logarithm of the asymptotic state-space complexity, since a solution algorithm must work for every possible state of the game. It will be upper-bounded by the complexities of each individual algorithm for the family of games. Similar remarks apply to the second-most commonly used complexity measure, the amount of space or computer memory used by the computation. It is not obvious <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> lower bound on the space complexity for a typical game, because the algorithm need not store game states; however many games of interest are known to be PSPACE-hard, and it follows that their space complexity will be lower-bounded by the logarithm of the asymptotic state-space complexity as well (technically the bound is only a polynomial in this quantity; but it is usually known to be linear).|$|E
25|$|Other scholars, like Bryan S. Rennie, {{have claimed}} that there is, to date, no {{evidence}} of Eliade's membership, active services rendered, or of any real involvement with any fascist or totalitarian movements or membership organizations, nor <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> evidence of his continued support for nationalist ideals after their inherently violent nature was revealed. They further assert {{that there is no}} imprint of overt political beliefs in Eliade's scholarship, and also claim that Eliade's critics are following political agendas. Romanian scholar Mircea Handoca, editor of Eliade's writings, argues that the controversy surrounding Eliade was encouraged by a group of exiled writers, of whom Manea was a main representative, and believes that Eliade's association with the Guard was a conjectural one, determined by the young author's Christian values and conservative stance, as well as by his belief that a Legionary Romania could mirror Portugal's Estado Novo. Handoca opined that Eliade changed his stance after discovering that the Legionaries had turned violent, and argued that {{there was no evidence of}} Eliade's actual affiliation with the Iron Guard as a political movement. Additionally, Joaquín Garrigós, who translated Eliade's works into Spanish, claimed that none of Eliade's texts he ever encountered show him to be an antisemite. Mircea Eliade's nephew and commentator Sorin Alexandrescu himself proposed that Eliade's politics were essentially conservative and patriotic, in part motivated by a fear of the Soviet Union which he shared with many other young intellectuals. Based on Mircea Eliade's admiration for Gandhi, various other authors assess that Eliade remained committed to nonviolence.|$|E

500|$|Fetter notably debated Alfred Marshall, {{presenting}} a theoretical reassessment of land as capital. Fetter's arguments have {{been credited with}} prompting mainstream economists to abandon the Georgist idea [...] "that land is a unique factor of production and hence <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> special need for a special theory of ground rent...." [...] A proponent of the subjective theory of value, Fetter {{emphasized the importance of}} time preference and rebuffed Irving Fisher for abandoning the pure time preference theory of interest that Fisher had earlier espoused in his 1907 book, The Rate of Interest.|$|E
500|$|Fetter's {{stand on}} this issue further led him to oppose Georgist ideas like the land value tax. Mark Blaug, a {{specialist}} {{in the history of}} economic thought, credits Fetter and John Bates Clark with influencing mainstream economists to abandon the idea [...] "that land is a unique factor of production and hence <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> special need for a special theory of ground rent....

It would not be contended that it extends so far as to authorize what the constitution forbids, or a change in the character of the government, or in that of one of the states, or a cession of any portion of the territory of the latter, without its consent. But, with these exceptions, it is not perceived <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> limit to the questions which can be adjusted touching any matter which is properly the subject of negotiation with a foreign country." ...|$|E

500|$|Philosophers and non-philosophers {{differ in}} their intuitions about what {{consciousness}} is. While most people have a strong intuition {{for the existence of}} what they refer to as consciousness, skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions. [...] Gilbert Ryle, for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of [...] "consciousness" [...] we end up misleading ourselves by thinking <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings. [...] More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness.|$|E
500|$|On 15 June 2007, Sony {{issued the}} {{following}} statement: [...] "We {{do not accept}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> connection between contemporary issues of 21st century Manchester and a work of science fiction in which a fictitious 1950s Britain is under attack by aliens. It is not our intention to cause offence by using a representation of Manchester Cathedral in chapter eight of the work. If we have done so we sincerely apologise." [...] The apology was also included in an advertisement in a Manchester newspaper. The Dean of the Manchester Cathedral, the Reverend Rogers Govender, said in a statement: [...] "We acknowledge the admission by Sony that the building in the game is Manchester Cathedral. We thank Sony for the apology they have made. However, we do not move from the position that we are against violence and especially the gun violence seen in this portrayal of the Cathedral." [...] On 6 July 2007, Sony issued an unreserved apology to Manchester Cathedral by publishing it in the Manchester Evening News, although they refused to make a donation.|$|E
500|$|In June 2013, the {{pictures}} {{for the book}} and of Gaga, taken during the Monster Ball tour were introduced [...] {{in the middle of}} a lawsuit. Gaga's former assistant Jennifer O'Neil had filed a case against the singer for overtime money owed to her by Gaga's management but never paid. As evidence for her case, O'Neil requested for the photos taken by Richardson to be presented to the court, intending to prove her [...] "crazy" [...] schedule while on tour with the singer and that O'Neil was working [...] "around the clock." [...] A Manhattan Federal Court judge ordered the photographer to submit over 142,000images, but Richardson dismissed the request. He said that the request was a [...] "harassment" [...] for him and the documents asked to be submitted in the subpoena were [...] "irrelevant" [...] in lieu of the actual case. Judge Paul G. Gardephe noted in the court that [...] "Mr. Richardson hasn't demonstrated to [...] <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> significant burden in producing the photographs." [...] Writing for Complex magazine, Gregory Babcock analyzed that Richardson—who made a yearly gross of $58million from his job—would lose money if he cooperated in the case. He reasoned that if the 142,000images were deemed as evidence for the case, then (as per US laws) they would enter the public record. Hence his work would be deemed free and devoid of any copyright, thus leading to attribution and reproduction by anyone. The New York Post reported in October 2013 that Richardson lost his appeal which caused his lawyer to comment that it was [...] "immeasurable financial loss" [...] for the photographer.|$|E
