25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E

[...] "Martin was the most informative person that I spoke to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this because I think he had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not talking <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E
