5|$|Below is Aston Villa's {{record in}} European and Intercontinental {{competitions}} sanctioned by UEFA. As of December 2012, {{they are one}} of only five English clubs to have won the European Cup, which <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> 1982.

Olivia learns one of the victims, Jonathan Swift, {{was the son of}} a scientist who tests on animals, and was killed while breaking into his father's lab. They also realize the chimera was created based on work by one of Walter's peers, not Walter himself.|$|E

5|$|In July 1910 {{racial tension}} flared towards the African-American {{community}} after a tremendous upset victory by African-American boxer Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada. Mobs of whites roamed throughout Omaha rioting, as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> {{cities across the}} U.S. The mobs wounded several black men in the city, killing one.|$|E

5|$|In the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, {{financial}} decision-makers {{were able}} to benefit somewhat from the lessons and experiences of the previous cycle. Developing economies generally stayed better balanced than <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s; the world economy was less oil-intensive; and global inflation and interest rates were much better contained. Oil exporters opted to make most of their investments directly into a diverse array of global markets, and the recycling process was less dependent on intermediary channels such as international banks and the IMF.|$|E

The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders oldest rivalry is {{with the}} Blues. At the start of Super Rugby the teams {{originally}} represented 'old foes' Canterbury and Auckland. The two teams have meet twice in the Grand Final, with the Crusaders winning the first meeting in 1998, 20-13. This victory denied the Blues a three-peat. However, the Blues exacted revenge in 2003, winning the rematch 21-17. However, in recent times the rivalry has cooled, with the Blues no longer threatening title challenges, as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> their glory days.|$|E

5|$|When Jane Rosalind and Henry, Leigh Hunt's son, became romantically involved, Jane {{strongly}} {{disapproved of}} the relationship. She sent Jane Rosalind {{to live with}} her old friend Claire Clairmont in France in an attempt to thwart the match. Clairmont, however, took Jane Rosalind's side and sent her back to England to be with Henry. Jane then relented and allowed them to marry, which <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> 1842. Jane's disapproval of the match caused serious offence to Leigh Hunt and his family.|$|E
5|$|A common snack in Africa is Koki or Moyin-Moyin, {{where the}} cowpeas are mashed into a paste and then wrapped in banana leaves. They {{also use the}} cowpea paste as a {{supplement}} in infant formula when weaning babies off milk. Slaves brought to America and the West Indies cooked cowpeas {{much the same way}} as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Africa, although many people in the American South considered cowpeas not suitable for human consumption. A popular dish was Hoppin' John, which contained black-eyed peas cooked with rice and seasoned with pork. Over time cowpeas became more universally accepted and now Hoppin' John is seen as a traditional Southern dish ritually served on New Year's Day.|$|E
5|$|All {{records of}} an early {{existence}} of Christians in South Canara were lost {{at the time of}} their deportation by Tipu Sultan in 1784. Hence, it is not known exactly when Christianity was introduced in South Canara, although it is possible that Syrian Christians settled in South Canara, just as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Kerala, a state south of Canara. The Italian traveller Marco Polo recorded that there were considerable trading activities between the Red Sea and the Canara coast in the 13th century. It can be surmised that foreign Christian merchants were visiting the coastal towns of South Canara during that period for commerce; it is possible some Christian priests might have accompanied them for evangelistic work.|$|E

5|$|Both coaches {{told the}} media that they {{believed}} their respective teams should play far better than <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the National semifinal games {{if they wanted to}} win the upcoming game. Coach Smith expressed concerns over Georgetown's shooting ability and feared that Floyd would come out shooting very well from the field. In addition, Smith noted that Ewing would play a large factor in the game because his defensive presence in the game limits second chance opportunities for Georgetown's opponents. Ken Rappoport of the Associated Press wrote of how North Carolina was a very disciplined team that takes only high-percentage shots.|$|E
5|$|County went undefeated in Gannon's {{first four}} league games in charge. After three weeks, this upturn in results saw Gannon offered the job full-time, which {{allowed him to}} guide County to safety. The club won {{more than twice as}} many points in the second half of the season than <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the first. Believing that safety would be assured on the final day of the season, he was proved correct as they managed to avoid relegation with a final day draw with champions Carlisle United. Comparisons were made to Sam Allardyce. As a {{committed}} Stockport fan, and already a legend at the club for his ten years as a player, he was loved by many County supporters. After delaying talks, he accepted a one-year rolling contract in the summer.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} year, the State of Texas {{announced}} it would provide $500,000 worth of grant funds to Gulfton-area agencies for crime prevention programs. The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money than <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E

5|$|Garrick {{commissioned}} Robert Adam and {{his brother}} James to renovate the theatre's interior, which <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> 1775. Their additions included an ornate ceiling and a stucco facade facing Bridges Street. This facade {{was the first time}} any structure that might be considered part of the theatre proper actually abutted the street: the building, like the 1663 original, had been built in the centre of the block, hemmed in by other structures. The narrow passage from Bridges street to the theatre now became an interior hallway; some theatre office space also went up behind the new facade.|$|E
5|$|Industry {{appeared}} {{very early}} in Sélestat. The town had already several factories {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century: a tilery, a sawmill, 12 tanneries and 11 mills. Sélestat quickly became specialised in wire gauze making but it never became a large industrial centre, remaining a small town with limited influence. The completion of the Strasbourg-Basel railway (1840), one of the first to be built in France, did not lead to significant urban development. The town walls that still encircled the town were a significant factor in its economic and demographic stagnation. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Alsace and a part of Lorraine were annexed by the new German Empire. The German authorities demolished the city walls in 1874 and built new spacious neighbourhoods around the old town, as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Strasbourg and Metz.|$|E
5|$|Like the extinctions {{of other}} New Zealand birds {{such as the}} piopio in the 19th century, {{the decline of the}} huia was poorly studied. Massive {{deforestation}} occurred in the North Island at this time, particularly in the lowlands of southern Hawkes Bay, the Manawatu and the Wairarapa, as land was cleared by European settlers for agriculture. The huia was particularly vulnerable to this as it could only live in old-growth forest where there were abundant rotting trees filled with wood-boring insect larvae. It seems it could not survive in regenerating, secondary forests. Although the mountainous part of its former range was not deforested, the lowland forests of the valleys below were systematically destroyed. The destruction of this part of its habitat would have undoubtedly had a severe impact on huia populations, but its removal would have been particularly dire if <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> fact descend to the lowlands as a winter refuge to escape snow at higher altitudes as some researchers including Oliver have surmised.|$|E
