25|$|In a Western equitation class a rider may {{be asked}} <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> or pattern, used to judge the rider's {{position}} {{and control of the}} horse. Tests may be as simple as jogging in a circle or backing up, or as complex as a full reining pattern, and may include elements such as transitions from halt to lope or lope to halt, sliding stops, a figure-8 at the lope with simple or flying change of lead, serpentines at the lope with flying changes, the rein back, a 360 degree or greater spin or pivot, and the rollback.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} based {{partially}} on Hynes's own experiences. After his mother died, and his marriage ended, {{he took a}} road trip {{of his own and}} wrote [...] "different things," [...] some of which came together in the script for The Go-Getter. Before production began, Hynes and three other crew members traveled to almost every location visited in the film <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> shoot, trying various filming styles and techniques. Filming took place between October and November 2005 in Oregon, Nevada, California, and Mexico. Singer and guitarist M. Ward provided most of the music for the film, complemented by songs from The Black Keys, Elliott Smith, The Replacements, and Animal Collective.|$|E

50|$|FRC {{is the sum}} of Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV) and Residual Volume (RV) and {{measures}} approximately 2400 mL in an 80 kg, average-sized male. It cannot be estimated through spirometry, since it includes the residual volume.

These systems are fundamentally a miniature PLC dedicated to the testing of the valve.|$|E

50|$|Western Sydney Wanderers {{along with}} active support group the Red and Black Bloc campaigned for the {{installation}} of German style rail seating to enable safe standing in the northern stands {{as part of the}} 2015 refurbishment.

50|$|Suvorov {{recalled}} his crew {{and returned to}} K-429. Much of the crew could not be contacted, and their places were filled by sailors from the naval base and from five other boats that were in port at the time. Nearly one-third of the 120 crewmen had never been on K-429 before, {{and none of them}} received any training on K-429. On 23 June 1983, K-429 was ordered to proceed immediately to the torpedo firing range. Suvorov refused that order, replying that standard operating procedures required him <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> dive first.|$|E

House wants to give the patient an ice bath to confirm, and goes to Cameron again. Cuddy stops by at the hospital. She has found out about Cameron's permissiveness with House and admonishes her. House barges in while the two are talking. He brings up Cuddy's bonding problem, and suggests giving Rachel up. Cuddy leaves, and Cameron tells House <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> on {{a sample of the}} blood before trying the cold bath. The blood clots when exposed to cold, but when the patient is put in the cold bath, her vital signs remain normal.|$|E

50|$|Flow-through tests {{typically}} come in {{the form}} of cassettes divided into four parts: an upper casing, a reactive membrane panel, an absorbent panel, and a lower casing. <b>To</b> <b>perform</b> <b>a</b> <b>test,</b> a diluted sample is applied to the reactive membrane panel and flows through to the absorbent pad, with the target analyte being captured in the membrane. The membrane is then washed to remove unbound, non-target molecules, washed again with a solution containing a signal reagent, and washed again to remove unbound signal reagent. If the analyte was present in the original sample, then by the end of this process it should be bound to the membrane, with the signal reagent bound to it, revealing (usually visually) the presence of the analyte on the membrane.|$|E

50|$|Gringoire is {{chased by}} faux cripples into {{the court of}} miracles, the den of beggars and thieves. Clopin, the king of these people, decides to hang Gringoire. Gringoire, to avoid death, has <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>a</b> <b>test,</b> which he quickly fails. He is then offered to women to avoid hanging. Esmeralda marries him, but only out of pity. The next day, the {{archbishop}} visits Frollo in his cell and informs him that Quasimodo has been arrested. Frollo refuses to testify at the trial, using the false excuse of not wanting to disgrace the church. At the Palis de Justice, the deaf judge assumes he is being mocked, as Quasimodo is unable to properly answer the judge's questions, and sentences him to a flogging.|$|E
5000|$|Experiments {{such as the}} Michelson-Morley {{experiment}} of 1887 (and later other experiments such as the Trouton-Noble {{experiment in}} 1903 or the Trouton-Rankine experiment in 1908), presented evidence against the theory of a medium for light propagation known as the Luminiferous aether; a theory that had been an established part of science for nearly one hundred years at the time. These results cast doubts on {{what was then a}} very central assumption of modern science, and later {{led to the development of}} special relativity. In an attempt to explain the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment in the context of the assumed medium, aether, many new hypotheses were examined. One of the proposals was that instead of passing through a static and unmoving aether, massive objects at the Earth's surface may drag some of the aether along with them, making it impossible to detect a [...] "wind". Oliver Lodge (1893-1897) was one of the first <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> of this theory by using rotating and massive lead blocks in an experiment that attempted to cause an asymmetrical aether wind. His tests yielded no appreciable results differing from previous tests for the aether wind.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the {{administration}} remains suspicious and the President orders B-2s scrambled for potential simultaneous air strikes on five Iranian uranium enrichment facilities. McGarry tells Communications Director Toby Ziegler {{to have a}} statement ready once the strikes are carried out, as Ziegler unsuccessfully tries to convince McGarry that the situation would be better handled by the UN. Vice President Russell steps in, recounting to the President and the Joint Chiefs an encounter he had with a drunken Israeli government official who revealed that the country had secretly developed its own nuclear submarines. Russell surmises that Israel (which, having developed nuclear weapons technology years ago, would have no apparent reason <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>a</b> <b>test)</b> needed to test a weapon that had been miniaturized to fit on a submarine-based missile, earning new respect for himself within {{the administration}}. The President calls off the air strike, averting an international crisis, and invites the Israeli Prime Minister to Washington under the pretext of discussing the settlement of the West Bank. President Bartlett shares his concerns over proliferation and escalation with the Prime Minister, who says that the submarines {{are part of an}} essential second-strike capability against Iran, which he is certain will eventually develop nuclear weapons.|$|E
