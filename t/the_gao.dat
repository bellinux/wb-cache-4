5|$|<b>The</b> <b>GAO</b> {{found no}} {{evidence}} of improper or unlawful command influence by USAF leaders on the investigation or subsequent administrative and military justice actions. <b>The</b> <b>GAO</b> noted, however, that it was unable to obtain complete confirmation of this finding because the DoD denied <b>the</b> <b>GAO</b> request to interview key USAF officials including Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>GAO</b> {{released}} its investigation report on 12 November 1997. The investigation {{determined that the}} USAF accident investigation was properly convened and met its assigned objectives. <b>The</b> <b>GAO</b> report, however, found that the USAF investigation had failed to note that Wickson and May neglected to report their contact with unidentified aircraft to the Duke (Martin) aboard the AWACS {{as required by the}} ROE. Furthermore, the USAF investigation report incorrectly stated that Martin had no authority to terminate the engagement when, in fact, he did. <b>The</b> <b>GAO</b> report added that the failure of Wickson and May to report their contact to Martin was indicative of a well-known, general lack of discipline among F-15 aircrews involved in OPC and this was not discussed in the USAF report.|$|E
5|$|The victims' families, the media, {{and members}} of the U.S. Congress were sharply {{critical}} of the U.S. Navy's findings. The U.S. Senate and U.S. House Armed Services Committees both held hearings to inquire into the Navy's investigation and later released reports disputing the U.S. Navy's conclusions. The Senate committee asked <b>the</b> <b>GAO</b> to review the U.S. Navy's investigation. To assist <b>the</b> <b>GAO,</b> Sandia National Laboratories provided a team of scientists to review the Navy's technical investigation.|$|E

30|$|In this section, {{we first}} examine the {{proposed}} methodology over a network similar to <b>the</b> <b>Gao’s</b> 12 -node network [57]. <b>The</b> <b>Gao’s</b> network {{is readily available}} in the literature and is {{being used by the}} researchers as a common currency or a common benchmark network to exchange their findings. Therefore, the results reported in this paper can then be referred and examined in further studies. We then undertake a large-sized network of Winnipeg as a challenging case study to display applicability of the proposed methodology. All delay functions associated with the links conform to BPR-type.|$|R

5|$|In September 1995 the House National Security Subcommittee on Military Personnel, {{chaired by}} Bob Dornan, {{requested}} that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct its own investigation into the shootdown incident. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>GAO</b> was asked {{to determine if the}} USAF accident investigation board had met its objectives, if the subsequent military justice investigations had followed established guidelines, and if the DoD and/or USAF had improperly or unlawfully influenced these investigations.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect that <b>the</b> <b>GAO</b> {{investigation}} revealed {{was that}} the training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of the Watkins memo, and based upon a suggestion from the Office of Independent Counsel, on March 20, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno requested that Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr expand his inquiry to specifically include the travel office affair, in particular allegations that White House employees had lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, and that David Watkins or Hillary Clinton had made false statements in previous testimony to <b>the</b> <b>GAO,</b> Congress, or the Independent Counsel.|$|E

5|$|In April 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{assessed}} the F-22's cost to be $361million per aircraft, with $28billion invested in development and testing; the Unit Procurement Cost {{was estimated at}} $178million in 2006, based on a production run of 181 aircraft. It was estimated {{by the end of}} production, $34billion will have been spent on procurement, resulting in a total program cost of $62billion, around $339million per aircraft. The incremental cost for an additional F-22 was estimated at about $138million in 2009. <b>The</b> <b>GAO</b> stated the estimated cost was $412 million per aircraft in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In March 1996, the US General Accounting Office (GAO) {{stated that}} it was cheaper to buy HarrierIIPlus {{aircraft}} outright than to remanufacture existing AV-8Bs. The USN estimated the cost for remanufacture of each aircraft to be US$23–30million, instead of $30million for each new-built aircraft, while <b>the</b> <b>GAO</b> estimated the cost per new aircraft at $24million. Nevertheless, the program continued and, in 2003, the 72nd and last AV-8B to be remanufactured for the USMC was delivered. Spain also participated in the program, the delivery of its last refurbished aircraft occurring in December 2003, which {{marked the end of}} the AV-8B's production; the final new AV-8B had been delivered in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the new findings, the U.S. Navy, with Sandia's assistance, reopened the investigation. In August 1991, Sandia and <b>the</b> <b>GAO</b> completed their reports, concluding that the explosion was likely caused by an accidental overram of powder bags into the breech of the 16-inch gun. The U.S. Navy, however, disagreed with Sandia's opinion {{and concluded that the}} cause of the explosion could not be determined. The U.S. Navy expressed regret (but not an apology) to Hartwig's family and closed its investigation.|$|E

25|$|The FBI, in {{agreeing with}} <b>the</b> <b>GAO's</b> report, said its highest {{priority}} was {{to abandon the}} J.

5|$|The FBI raid {{led to the}} {{formation}} of Colorado's first special grand jury, the juried testimony of 110 witnesses, reviews of 2,000 exhibits and ultimately a 1992 plea agreement in which Rockwell admitted to 10 federal environmental crimes and agreed to pay $18.5 million in fines out of its own funds. This amount was less than the company had been paid in bonuses for running the plant as determined by <b>the</b> <b>GAO,</b> and yet was also by far the highest hazardous-waste fine ever; four times larger than the previous record. Due to DOE indemnification of its contractors, without some form of settlement being arrived at between the U.S. Justice Department and Rockwell the cost of paying any civil penalties would ultimately have been borne by U.S. taxpayers. While any criminal penalties allotted to Rockwell would not have been covered by U.S. taxpayers, Rockwell claimed that the Department of Energy had specifically exempted them from most environmental laws, including hazardous waste.|$|E
25|$|In an April 2007 United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) Report on Title Insurance, <b>the</b> <b>GAO</b> {{recommended}} {{that state and}} federal legislators and regulators improve consumers ability to shop for title insurance based on price, encourage price competition, and ensure consumers are paying reasonable prices for title insurance.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>GAO</b> has {{authority}} to audit check-processing, currency storage and shipments, and some regulatory and bank examination functions, however, there are restrictions to what <b>the</b> <b>GAO</b> may audit. Under the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, 31 U.S.C. section 714(b), audits of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks {{do not include}} (1) transactions for or with a foreign central bank or government or non-private international financing organization; (2) deliberations, decisions, or actions on monetary policy matters; (3) transactions made {{under the direction of}} the Federal Open Market Committee; or (4) a part of a discussion or communication among or between members of the Board of Governors and officers and employees of the Federal Reserve System related to items (1), (2), or (3).

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the crisis two {{solutions}} have been proposed.

Proposals to merge the SEC and CFTC have also been made.|$|E
