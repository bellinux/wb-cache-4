DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The organic photoelectric component comprises a substrate (110) having a glass, a base electrode (122) having a transparent material, a cover electrode (124), an organic layer arrangement (126) having complementary doped layers, and a contact layer (150) with a metal. The substrate comprises a first surface and a second surface, which are connected by a side wall. The base electrode is formed on the first surface of the substrate and <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> <b>layer</b> <b>arrangement</b> is arranged between the cover electrode and the base electrode. The contact layer electrically contacts the base electrode or the cover electrode and is formed along the side wall to the second surface to provide a contact region on the second main surface. The organic photoelectric component further comprises a protective layer, so that a layer stack is protected against the environment with the base electrode, the cover electrode and <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> <b>layer</b> <b>arrangement</b> in an interior of the protective layer and the substrate, and a base electrode contact and a cover electrode contact. The base electrode contact is arranged outside of the protective layer and has an electrical connection with the base electrode inside the protective layer. The cover electrode contact is arranged outside of the protective layer and has electrical connection to the cover electrode inside the protective layer. The contact layer forms a projection (L) over the second surface, and is formed to extend in a region along the second surface of the substrate. The contact layer is a first contact layer, which contacts the cover electrode contact. The organic photoelectric component further includes a second contact layer, which contacts the base electrode contact, and a rectangular or hexagonal flat arrangement along the lateral directions of the substrate. The first contact layer extends along the side wall to the second surface of the substrate and the second contact layer extends along an opposing side wall to the second surface of the substrate. The layer stack is designed to form a solar cell or an organic light emitting diode. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for producing an organic photoelectric component. USE - Organic photoelectric component useful in an illumination module (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The organic photoelectric component ensures homogeneous current density distribution on large areas, and is compact...|$|E
5000|$|Nacre {{formation}} {{is not fully}} understood. The initial onset assembly, as observed in Pinna nobilis, {{is driven by the}} aggregation of nanoparticles (~50-80 nm) within an organic matrix that arrange in fibre-like polycrystalline configurations. The particle number increases successively and, when critical packing is reached, they merge into early-nacre platelets. Nacre growth is mediated by <b>organics,</b> controlling <b>the</b> onset, duration and form of crystal growth. Individual aragonite [...] "bricks" [...] are believed to quickly grow to the full height of the nacreous layer, and expand until they abut adjacent bricks. This produces the hexagonal close-packing characteristic of nacre. Bricks may nucleate on randomly dispersed elements within <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> <b>layer,</b> well-defined <b>arrangements</b> of proteins, or may grow epitaxially from mineral bridges extending from the underlying tablet. Nacre differs from fibrous aragonite - a brittle mineral of the same form - in that the growth in the c-axis (i.e., approximately perpendicular to the shell, in nacre) is slow in nacre, and fast in fibrous aragonite.|$|R

Could species richness under beech and hornbeam be explained by differences in N dynamics? Location: Ancient forests dominated by beech and hornbeam in Luxembourg, on decalcified and lime-rich parent material. Methods: Species composition and soil characteristics, i. e. mass of <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> <b>layer,</b> pH, moisture content, bulk density and air-filled pore space, were determined under beech and hornbeam on decalcified marl and limestone, and analysed with cluster analysis, correspondence analysis and ANOVA, with tree species and parent material as independent factors. Net N mineralization, nitrification and N in soil and microbial biomass were determined in a laboratory incubation experiment over a pH gradient, and correlated with species richness. Results: Species richness was lower under beech than under hornbeam on both decalcified marl and on limestone. Mass of <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> <b>layer</b> was higher under beech in all cases, but pH and soil moisture only differed between tree species on decalcified marl. Species richness increased with soil N, microbial N and nitrification in the mineral topsoil, but was not correlated with net N mineralization, and was negatively correlated with nitrification in <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> <b>layer</b> and with efficiency of N mineralization per unit microbe.

These three compartments are allocated to the morphological distinguishable L, F and H horizons of <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> <b>layer.</b> Changes in <b>the</b> pools of these organic compartments are described with first order equations for decomposition and transformation. Rate constants for decomposition and transformation were derived by calibrating the model to measured organic matter pools in <b>organic</b> <b>layers</b> of a chrono-sequence of five first succession Scots pine stands between 15 and 120 years old. Simulated pools of <b>organic</b> matter in <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> <b>layers</b> were in agreement with measured pools in the five pine stands, except for the first thirty years of the H-horizon. During this period, an increase in <b>organic</b> matter in <b>the</b> H horizon was simulated while no H horizons were observed in the field. The simulated total pool of <b>organic</b> matter in <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> <b>layer</b> agreed well with values from a field inventory in 20 other Scots pine stands, but the simulated distribution over the three horizons differed from the field measurements which varied among sites. For the Scots pine stands the model was able to simulate <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> matter accumulation in the top 40 -cm of the mineral soil; derived almost completely from fine root turnover. The accumulated pool of nitrogen in <b>the</b> <b>organic</b> <b>layer</b> was in agreement with measured pools for the oldest Scots pine stand but was too high for the younger stands. Especially, the accumulation of N in the F-horizon was too fast, presumably due to an overestimated retention of nitrogen...|$|R
