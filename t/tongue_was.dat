50|$|All {{sides of}} the <b>tongue</b> <b>are</b> assessed. To inspect the dorsal side (top) of the tongue, a patient sticks out their tongue. A healthy dorsal <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> symmetrical, pink, moist, {{slightly}} rough from the papillae, possibly with a thin, whitish coating. The {{sides of the}} <b>tongue</b> <b>are</b> inspected with a gloved hand holding a piece of gauze. The <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> moved side to side and inspected; it should be pink, moist, smooth and glistening. Assessment of the ventral (bottom) surface of the <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> done by having the patient touch the tip of their tongue against the roof of their mouth. If healthy, it should have prominent veins and be pink, smooth, moist, glistening and free of lesions. The frenulum should be centered under the tongue. Abnormal findings includes marked redness, cyanosis or extreme pallor. Diseases include scrotal or fissured tongue, migratory glossitis (geographic tongue), atrophic glossitis, black hairy tongue, caviar lesions, carcinoma, macroglossia, candidiasis, aphthous ulcer and leukoplakia.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, and {{especially}} in Canadian French, the terms Anglophone, Anglo-Canadian or simply Anglo, are widely used to designate someone whose mother <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> English, as opposed to Francophone, which describes someone whose mother <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> French, and to Allophone, which describes someone whose mother <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> a language other than English or French. (In Quebec, the word Anglophone or Anglo refers to English-speaking Quebecers in both English and French.) Anglo-Metis is also sometimes {{used to refer to}} a historical ethnic group.|$|R
50|$|Strawberry tongue (also called {{raspberry}} tongue), {{refers to}} glossitis which manifests with hyperplastic (enlarged) fungiform papillae, giving {{the appearance of}} a strawberry. White strawberry <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> where there is a white coating on the tongue through which the hyperplastic fungiform papillae protrude. Red strawberry <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> where the white coating is lost and a dark red, erythematous surface is revealed, interspaced with the hyperplastic fungiform papillae. White strawberry <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> seen in early scarlet fever (a systemic infection of group A β- hemolytic streptococci), and red strawberry tongue occurs later, after 4-5 days. Strawberry <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> also seen in Kawasaki disease (a vasculitic disorder primarily occurring in children under 5), and toxic shock syndrome. It may mimic other types of glossitis or Vitamin B12 deficiency.|$|R
5|$|Charles' {{choices were}} appropriate. Philip was {{culturally}} Spanish: {{he was born}} in Valladolid and raised in the Spanish court, his native <b>tongue</b> <b>was</b> Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain. Ferdinand was familiar with, and to, the other princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Although he too had been born in Spain, he had administered his brother's affairs in the Empire since 1531. Some historians maintain Ferdinand had also been touched by the reformed philosophies, and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained at least nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed. Other historians maintain that while Ferdinand was a practicing Catholic, unlike his brother he considered religion to be outside the political sphere.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the food}} eaten by station crews was frozen, {{refrigerated}} or canned. Menus were prepared by the cosmonauts, {{with the help of}} a dietitian, before their flight to the station. The diet was designed to provide around 100g of protein, 130g of fat and 330g of carbohydrates per day, in addition to appropriate mineral and vitamin supplements. Meals were spaced out through the day to aid assimilation. Canned food such as jellied beef <b>tongue</b> <b>was</b> placed into a niche in the core module's table, where it could be warmed in 5–10 minutes. Usually, crews drank tea, coffee and fruit juices, but, unlike the ISS, the station also had a supply of cognac and vodka for special occasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} fossils of megalodon are its teeth. Diagnostic {{characteristics}} include a triangular shape, robust structure, large size, fine serrations, {{a lack of}} lateral denticles, and a visible V-shaped neck (where the root meets the crown). The tooth met the jaw at a steep angle, similar to the great white shark. The tooth was anchored by connective tissue fibers, and the roughness of the base may have added to mechanical strength. The lingual side of the tooth, the part facing the <b>tongue,</b> <b>was</b> convex; and the labial side, {{the other side of}} the tooth, was slightly convex or flat. The anterior teeth were almost perpendicular to the jaw and symmetrical, whereas the posterior teeth were slanted and asymmetrical.|$|E

50|$|The anteater's <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> {{covered with}} {{thousands}} of tiny hooks called filiform papillae which are used to hold the insects together with large amounts of saliva. Swallowing {{and the movement of}} the <b>tongue</b> <b>are</b> aided by side-to-side movements of the jaws. The <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> attached to the sternum and moves very quickly, flicking 150 times per minute. The anteater's stomach, similar to a bird's gizzard, has hardened folds and uses strong contractions to grind the insects; a digestive process assisted by small amounts of ingested sand and dirt.|$|R
50|$|In Belgium and France, {{boiled beef}} <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> often {{prepared}} with mushrooms in a Madeira sauce {{but can also}} be served with a vinaigrette. In Ashkenazi Jewish, Russian and Ukrainian cuisine, boiled <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> often served with chrain. Beef tongue or veal <b>tongue</b> <b>is</b> also found in classic recipes for Russian salad. In Austria, Germany and Poland, it is commonly served either with chrain or with horseradish cream sauce. The traditional Berlin / North-German variant adds capers and vinegar to the sauce based on the broth with white roux.|$|R
5|$|By mid-May it {{was clear}} that he would not make the Derby and he was removed from the race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the {{veterinary}} surgeon, remained convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to the conviction of the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that the horse had been poisoned. He stated that the horse was fine on the morning of the 21 April, but a few hours later his <b>tongue</b> <b>was</b> so inflamed he could not hold it in his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may have in fact been attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the struggles of the horse, it burst in his mouth, blistering his tongue. The Derby was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{have strong}} bills for {{drilling}} and drumming on trees, and long sticky tongues for extracting food. Woodpecker bills are typically longer, sharper {{and stronger than}} the bills of piculets and wrynecks; however, their morphology is very similar. The bill's chisel-like tip is kept sharp by the pecking action in birds that regularly use it on wood. The beak consists of three layers; an outer sheath called rhamphotheca, made of scales formed from keratin proteins, an inner layer of bone which has a large cavity and mineralised collagen fibers, and a middle layer made of porous bone which connects the two other layers. Combined, this anatomy helps the beak absorb mechanical stress. Species of woodpecker and flicker that use their bills in soil or for probing as opposed to regular hammering tend to have longer and more decurved bills. Due to their smaller bill size, many piculets and wrynecks will forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers. The long sticky tongues, which possess bristles, aid these birds in grabbing and extracting insects from deep within a hole in a tree. It {{has been reported that}} the <b>tongue</b> <b>was</b> used to spear grubs, but more detailed studies published in 2004 have shown that the tongue instead wraps around the prey before being pulled out.|$|E
