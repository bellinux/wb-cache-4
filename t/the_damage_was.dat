The storm damaged 26schools and 2,500homes in the country's interior. An estimated 27,500people were affected by the storm throughout Guatemala.

5|$|In 1996, severe floods {{caused by}} heavy rainstorms in the San Juan {{watershed}} caused both San Juan and Trabuco creeks to overflow, destroying long {{sections of the}} concrete river banks near their confluence. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> attributed to severe erosion at the base which caused the concrete to lose support and crumble. A nearby residential community was threatened, but the floods receded before the levee collapsed and no serious harm was done. The failed sections were repaired with grouted riprap.|$|E

5|$|Across its path, Bingiza {{destroyed}} 25,464houses {{and damaged}} 36schools. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> less than expected, given {{the strength of}} the cyclone. Most of the damage occurred due to the poor infrastructure and drainage systems of Madagascar, along with high levels of poverty. A total of 34deaths were reported, along with 13injuries. When Bingiza made its final landfall, it produced five days of rainfall to a region already severely affected by flooding. In Vangaindrano district in southeastern Madagascar, the cyclone caused widespread flooding that isolated five villages, as well as covering fields of rice and other crops. A total of 310people in the southern portion of the country were left homeless.|$|E

5|$|After {{approximately}} three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening meal was withheld. That caused the prisoners to riot, breaking fittings; during the commotion, three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries.

The extent of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, Karnet, and Barton's Mill. However, other improvements could not be undertaken without funding from the state government, which did not consider prison reform a priority.|$|E
5|$|After peaking, Hary {{weakened}} due to land interaction, and {{it struck}} Madagascar southeast of Antalaha. After turning south over land, Cyclone Hary quickly moved offshore. There were three {{deaths in the}} country, {{one of which was}} from electrocution. There was locally heavy crop damage, and four bridges were destroyed. However, <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> considered minimal, given the intensity of the storm. After affecting Madagascar, Hary accelerated to the southeast, and the eastern periphery of the circulation moved over Réunion. On the mountain peaks of the island, rainfall reached , although it was much less near the coast. The rainfall caused flooding, killing one person, and 20,000people were left without power. Hary became extratropical on March13, although its remnants continued for several days as a powerful mid-latitude storm.|$|E

Gunnery Officer Dietrich von dem Borne was wounded badly, one foot having been severed. His comrade and trigger man Heinrich Büssinger was badly wounded as well and died several hours after the attack. Hartenstein ordered the 3.7cm flak gun to continue the attack, causing only superficial damage.|$|E
