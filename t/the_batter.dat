5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding a hit to <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an unforced preceding runner is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, a hit is automatically not credited and <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to <b>the</b> <b>batter.</b> For example, if <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> is a fast runner, the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an unforced runner from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.|$|E

50|$|The chalk lines {{delineating}} the two Foul Lines {{are rarely}} extended through <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> boxes.

5|$|A common Palestinian dessert {{reserved}} {{only for}} Ramadan is qatayef, {{which could be}} provided by the numerous street vendors in several major Palestinian cities or towns as well as typical Palestinian households. Qatayef is the general name of the dessert as a whole, but more specifically, the name of <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> that acts as a base. The result of <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> being poured into a round hot plate appears similar to pancakes, except only one side is cooked, then folded.

50|$|If the infraction is {{discovered}} during a plate appearance (that is, a pitch has been thrown to <b>the</b> current <b>batter),</b> then <b>the</b> umpire considers <b>the</b> current <b>batter</b> and <b>the</b> previous one. If <b>the</b> current <b>batter's</b> name {{does not follow}} <b>the</b> previous actual <b>batter's</b> name in <b>the</b> written order, <b>the</b> current <b>batter</b> is improper. There is no penalty, but the situation is rectified — <b>the</b> proper <b>batter</b> comes to bat and assumes <b>the</b> improper <b>batter's</b> current count. In this situation, if <b>the</b> proper <b>batter</b> is on base, then he is simply skipped in the order, and <b>the</b> next <b>batter</b> in <b>the</b> order is now <b>the</b> proper <b>batter.</b> In this situation under high school (NFHS) rules, <b>the</b> proper <b>batter</b> is brought in off the bases, assumes his proper at bat, and a courtesy runner (the last batted out) takes his place on the bases.|$|R

5|$|When a {{defensive}} player has {{the ball and}} can end the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do so because of a mental mistake (not an error) and a runner subsequently scores, the official scorer must decide whether to credit <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> with a run batted in (RBI). If the runner recognized the mistake after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If the runner was oblivious to the mistake or runs home without slowing, <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> is credited with an RBI.|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> {{is given}} first base because of catcher's {{interference}} or obstruction, the official scorer does not presume that an out {{would have been}} recorded on that runner, but if that runner later scores the run is unearned.|$|E

5000|$|Lastly, each [...] "event box" [...] on a Project Scoresheet {{scorecard}} {{is broken}} down into three sections: before the play, during the play, and after the play.

A hit is considered [...] "during the play" [...] because it ends <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> plate appearance, and baserunner movement subsequent to <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> activity is considered [...] "after the play".|$|R

5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any difficult judgment call where the official scorer is required to decide whether to credit a hit to <b>the</b> <b>batter,</b> the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that the term “leadoff hitter” can be used interchangeably to {{describe}} not only <b>the</b> first <b>batter</b> on <b>the</b> lineup card, but also <b>the</b> first <b>batter</b> up in any particular inning. For example, if, in the second inning, <b>the</b> fifth <b>batter</b> in <b>the</b> lineup card is <b>the</b> first <b>batter</b> up, it will be said that he is leading off or that he is <b>the</b> leadoff <b>batter</b> for that particular inning.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Battered</b> Women’s Shelter Movement in Canada emerged {{predominantly}} {{during the}} late 1960s and early 1970s, {{within the framework of}} second wave feminism. Building on the oft-used second wave slogan, “the personal is political, second wave understandings of the state's role in regulating private life paved the road for a re-conceptualization of domestic violence as a social problem as opposed to a completely private matter. The movement was generated in large part because for women who had experienced domestic violence, “there was no place to go.” However, several feminists have criticized <b>the</b> <b>Battered</b> Women's movement for its reliance on <b>the</b> <b>battered</b> woman-as-victim archetype.|$|R

5|$|Play {{starts with}} a batter {{standing}} at home plate, holding a bat. <b>The</b> <b>batter</b> waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts {{to hit the ball}} with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out (see below) is said to be safe and is now on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely {{as a direct result of}} a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for <b>the</b> <b>batter.</b> A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.|$|E
5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even at the expense of <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook <b>the</b> <b>batter.</b> The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E

5|$|When {{a batter}} {{attempts}} a sacrifice bunt {{and the resulting}} bunt is so well-placed that he safely reaches first base, the official scorer may elect to credit <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> with a hit instead of a sacrifice {{if there is no}} error on the play and an ordinary effort by the defense would not have recorded an out.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} other {{statistics}} that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics. For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, {{the manager of the}} fielding team {{may be more likely to}} change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{influential}} early mainframe {{game was}} Baseball, a sports game {{that was created}} on a PDP-10 minicomputer at Pomona College in 1971 by English major Don Daglow. Baseball was the first baseball video game that allowed players to manage the game as it unfolded, rather than just picking players {{at the beginning of}} a game. The program is documented at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Baseball was continually updated through 1974, and distributed to other PDP-10 installations. The text-based game had each player control the pitcher or the batter; they would enter their intention to, for example, pitch to or walk <b>the</b> <b>batter,</b> or switch hitters. The batting player could direct on-base players to steal, and <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> to hit. The results of the play would be printed out onto paper as a verbose description, like a radio description of the game. Daglow went on to develop more sophisticated baseball games in 1983 with Intellivision World Series Baseball, and 1987 with Earl Weaver Baseball, as well as numerous other games.|$|E
