40|$|Abstract — Power {{quality is}} a measure of ideal power supply system. There are many voltage related power quality issues in the {{industries}} like impulse, voltage sag and swell, over and under voltage, flickers, harmonics, voltage interruption etc. but <b>the</b> <b>harmonics</b> is a very commonly and most affected issue in industry, So we focus on <b>the</b> <b>harmonics</b> and brief discussion about other issue. There are many nonlinear devices which are using in industries like air compressors, blowers, VFD operated motors and various air handling units which inject <b>harmonics</b> in to <b>the</b> line, which create power quality problem. Filter is used for reduce harmonics. Many types of filters are available in market like active filter, passive filter, low pass filter, high pass filter, single tuned filter, hybrid filter etc. We use hybrid filter for reduce <b>the</b> <b>harmonics</b> because it reduce <b>the</b> <b>harmonics</b> nearer to zero which is advance than any other filter. Matlab use for hybrid filter simulation and results shows how this filter reduces <b>the</b> <b>harmonics...</b>|$|R
5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of <b>the</b> <b>harmonic</b> series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} {{led to the development of}} the prime number theorem.|$|E
5|$|Newton is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions {{to the theory of}} finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of <b>the</b> <b>harmonic</b> series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's summation formula) and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. Newton's work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin's decimals.|$|E

The numerical {{results show that}} <b>the</b> <b>harmonics</b> power is reduced by using QPUs, but the fundamental radiation power also has a pronounced decrease as the saturation length gets very long.

5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced by the sound or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain <b>the</b> <b>harmonic</b> structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E
5|$|Schubert's last sonatas mark a {{distinct}} change of compositional style from his earlier piano sonatas, with several important differences. The typical movement length has increased, {{due to the}} use of long, lyrical, fully rounded-off, ternary-form themes, the insertion of development-like passages within expositions, and the lengthening of the development section proper. Texturally, the orchestral grandeur of the middle-period sonatas gives way to a more intimate writing that resembles a string ensemble. New textures appear in the last sonatas – scale-like melodic elements, free counterpoint, free fantasia, and simple accompanimental patterns such as Alberti bass, repeated chords, and ostinati; the orchestral unison texture, abundant in the preceding sonatas, has disappeared. <b>The</b> <b>harmonic</b> language has also changed: more distant key relationships are explored, longer modulatory excursions, more major/minor shifts of mode, and more chromatic and diverse harmonic progressions and modulations, using elements such as the diminished seventh chord. In general, the last sonatas seem to enact a return to an earlier, more individual and intimate Schubertian style, here combined with the compositional craftsmanship of Schubert's later works.|$|E

5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of <b>the</b> <b>harmonic</b> timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E

Unalaq then seizes power in the Southern Water Tribe by force, {{starting}} a civil war {{in which he is}} opposed by his brother, Korra's father, Tonraq. Seeking allies against Unalaq, Korra experiences the life of the first Avatar, Wan, who fused his soul with the spirit Raava to imprison her opponent Vaatu. Aided by his twin children Eska and Desna, Unalaq frees Vaatu during <b>the</b> <b>Harmonic</b> Convergence, a decamillennial alignment of planets, and unites with him to become a dark Avatar.

This fails thanks to the help of Suyin Beifong, Lin's previously estranged sister. Zaheer and his team– members of the Red Lotus, an anarchic secret society– kill the Earth Queen, throwing her kingdom into chaos, and try to force Korra's surrender by taking the Air Nomads hostage, including Suyin's daughter Opal. In the final confrontation, Zaheer's comrades are killed and he is captured by the Air Nomads led by Jinora. Two weeks later, a weakened, wheelchair-bound Korra watches as Jinora is anointed an airbending master, and Tenzin rededicates the Air Nomads to service to the world.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{a system}} that changes {{the shape of the}} wave (beyond simple scaling or shifting) creates {{additional}} harmonics (harmonic distortion). This is called a non-linear system.

50|$|Natural {{harmonics}} {{are played}} {{on an open}} string. The pitch of the open string when it is plucked or bowed is called <b>the</b> fundamental frequency. <b>Harmonics</b> are also called overtones or partials.
