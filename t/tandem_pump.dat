40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical approach for lowering the outlet flow ripple of a crescent pump by applying a tandem crescent pump {{consisting of two}} gear pairs with an index angle between them. The outlet flow of the <b>tandem</b> <b>pump</b> is obtained by summing the flow produced by the two gear pairs, and the flow ripple of the <b>tandem</b> <b>pump</b> can be attenuated by properly selecting the design parameters {{in terms of the}} index angle and the displacement ratio between the two gear pairs. A lumped parameter model is presented for evaluating the crescent pump’s flow ripples, and experiments were performed on a single crescent pump to validate the model from the aspects of the steady-state flow-pressure characteristics and the outlet pressure ripples. In this way, the main causes of the flow ripple could be identified by comparing the kinematic flow with the actual flow evaluated by the model. Additionally, simulation results suggested that a <b>tandem</b> <b>pump</b> with an index angle of 13. 85 ° and displacement ratio of 0. 5 could lead to a more than 45 % decrease in the outlet flow ripple than a single pump with the same displacement {{in a wide range of}} operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{megawatt}} {{pilot experiment}} (MEGAPIE) {{to be conducted}} at the Paul-Scherrer Institute (PSI) the feasibility of a lead-bismuth alloy cooled target for spallation purposes will be demonstrated. Such types of liquid metal cooled targets are under consideration for various concepts of accelerator driven systems (ADS) aimed to transmute nuclear waste {{in order to reduce}} the size of a final repository or to generate fast neutrons for applications like neutron tomography etc. A major component of such targets are the pumps, which are necessary to remove the heat from the highly heat loaded window facing the proton beam generated by the accelerator and transporting the heat through the heat exchangers. Since the pumps are merely inaccessible for maintenance during operation electro-magnetic pumps without any rotating parts are preferred compared to mechanical devices.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{procedure is}} proposed to determine variable excitation loads coming from pressure evolution inside tooth spaces in external gear pumps. Pressure force and torque are estimated {{with respect to}} the angular position of the gears, taking into account the phenomena that occur during the meshing course. In particular, the paper proposes a general methodology aiming at determining pressure force and torque components along the three coordinate axes and suitable to be applied on both spur and helical gear configuration. Firstly, the method to calculate pressure loads acting on a single tooth space during a complete revolution is given, then the total pressure force and torque loading each gear is obtained. Particular attention is addressed on the description of the helical gear scenario. As an example, the method is applied to a tandem gear pump, characterized by the presence of two stages, one with spur gears and one with helical gears. An experimentally assessed model to calculate the pressure ripple inside the <b>tandem</b> <b>pump</b> is described and the proposed procedure for pressure load estimation is applied. Eventually, the pressure loads estimated with the present procedure are compared with other estimation methods already described in the literature. The comparison shows that the present methodology is able to describe a wider range of phenomena involved in the meshing evolution and to determine all the pressure force and torque components applied to helical gears. The method gives suitable results to study the balancing and the dynamic behavior of gear pumps...|$|E

The main goal of this work is to reduce the disturbing noise generated by axial piston swash plate type hydrostatic pumps by attenuating the shaft torque variation. The analysis begins by deriving the equation of the shaft torque {{as a function of the}} average torque and the total number of pistons that are used within the rotating group. A swash plate control law is derived according to which if the swash plate is adjusted continuously, would give a constant shaft torque. In a second method, it is shown that with the use of an optimized index angle, the torque ripple amplitude for a <b>tandem</b> <b>pump</b> could be reduced by as much as 75 %.

It is, however, difficult to realize efficient 1018 nm YDFL. The best demonstration to date {{is limited by the}} use of both conventional aluminosilicate host and smaller core diameters. In these cases, higher inversion is required due to the aluminosilicate host and higher pump brightness is required due to the smaller core, which results in high signal brightness for the same output power. These factors lead to large pump power to exit fiber, resulting in poor efficiency. Phosphosilicate host, on the other hand, requires much lower inversions to reach the gain threshold at 1018 nm. The combination of phosphosilicate host and large-core leakage channel fibers (LCF) is a perfect candidate for efficient 1018 nm fiber laser. We report a highly efficient Yb-doped phosphosilicate LCF laser with a quantum defect of 4. 1 % using a similar to 50 mu m-core diameter and similar to 420 mu m cladding diameter.

40|$|In {{the medical}} field high power fibre-coupled AlGaAs diode lasers {{operating}} around 800 nm are already making {{an impact in}} surgery but for more specialised applications high powers at other wavelengths are required. It is an attractive idea to develop active fibres as add-ons to such fibre coupled diode systems increasing the range of applications of such devices at little extra cost and minimal additional complexity. Rare-earth-doped optical fibres exhibit the traditional advantages of a glass laser host of broad emission and absorption spectra but without the usual associated thermal problems. With fibre lasers wavelength selection and temperature stabilisation of the pump diode is unnecessary, and the emission spectra allows for broad tuning. Double-clad fibres comprising a doped core, usually single-moded located within a large multimode waveguide enable efficient pumping of fibre lasers with diode ways or diode bars. Fibre lasers can thus be considered as simple wavelength convertors and brightness enhancers for the high power but poorly specified output of diode sources. In the this paper we describe a multiwatt Nd 3 + fibre laser pumped via a second cladding by the DIOMED 25 laser diode unit. This multi diode array source is designed for coupling up to 25 Watts of diode power into a plastic-clad silica fibre of 400 µm diameter. The laser fibre which is a double-clad structure fabricated from lead-silicate glasses is interchangeable with the normal PCS delivery fibre. The device operates at 1. 058 µm with a slope efficiency > 50 % and a 150 times brightness enhancement.

40|$|High power fibre lasers with {{efficient}} amplification {{of optical}} signals {{have been widely}} used for various applications for many years. A great advantage of fibres is their thermal properties, which are so good that fibres are often quoted as being immune to thermal degradation. However, powers keep increasing and the fibre geometry is becoming more similar to their “bulk” (non-waveguiding) counterparts. Thermal problems are severe in bulk lasers, and are, unsurprisingly, becoming more important also for fibres. Heating is inevitable in the laser cycle due to the energy difference(quantum defect) between pump and signal photons. Nevertheless, there is substantial room to reduce the heating by minimising the quantum defect, with pump and signal wavelengths as close as possible. In this thesis, I demonstrate low-quantum-defect fibre amplifiers and lasers based on two different energy conversion processes, i. e., in high-brightness (<b>tandem)</b> <b>pumped</b> ytterbium-doped fibre and in short-wavelength-pumped Raman fibre. The latter approach increases the photon energy relative to the thermal energy and vibrational energy of the host. Firstly, as it comes to tandem-pumping of ytterbium-doped fibre amplifiers, the challenge is to make the pump and signal wavelengths as close as possible, while keeping the signal gain and pump absorption sufficiently high. With the optimum average ytterbium excitation level and high pump brightness, the quantum defect can be as small as 0. 6 % when pumped at 1030 nm, according to theoretical calculations. Subsequently, an experimental amplifier core-pumped by a single-mode laser source is presented. A 2 % quantum defect is reached, with pump and signal wavelengths at 1030 nm and 1050 nm, respectively. The slope efficiency reaches 95 % to 96 %. Initial investigations show low photodarkening with tandem-pumping, with some dependence on the dependence on ytterbium ions concentration. Secondly, Raman conversion of pulses in a diode-pumped highly nonlinear fibre is studied in a ring-laser cavity configuration. The quantum defect is 3. 5 % with 806 nm pump and 835 nm Stokes wavelengths. A slope efficiency of 65 % is obtained with 600 m long fibre and 100 ns pulse width. Then, I study experimentally and theoretically 975 nm continuous-wave-pumped fibre Raman lasers based on a graded-index and a double-clad fibre. Both lasers emit at 1019 nm (4. 3 % quantum defect) with improved brightness. A record laser output of 6 W and 19 % slope efficiency from the double-clad Raman fibre and 20 W from the graded-index fibre shows further scaling of singlemode power is possible with improved cavity and fibre design. <br/...|$|R

This unique wavy shape is bidirectional, can be used in liquids, gases or combination, and incorporates a sealing damn that minimizes leakage. The combination of waviness, tilt at the valleys of the waves, and a seal dam has been referred to as the wavy-tilt-damn or WTD. The WTD shape provides both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic load support that is sufficient to enable the seal to operate in a noncontracting mode during dynamic operation. The smooth wave peaks present a low wearing condition during start and stops when the seal faces make contact. Field results also indicate that the WTD shape is contamination resistant and exhibits lower leakage than grooved face technology. Since its introduction in dry running noncontacting gas backup seals, wavy face technology has been applied to many different applications and seal design configurations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{estimate}} {{the effect size}} of hypoglycemia risk reduction on closed-loop control (CLC) versus open-loop (OL) sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy in supervised outpatient setting. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty patients with type 1 diabetes initiated the study at the Universities of Virginia, Padova, and Montpellier and Sansum Diabetes Research Institute; 18 completed the entire protocol. Each patient participated in two 40 -h outpatient sessions, CLC versus OL, in randomized order. Sensor (Dexcom G 4) and insulin <b>pump</b> (<b>Tandem</b> t:slim) were connected to Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) - a smartphone artificial pancreas platform. The patient operated the system through the DiAs user interface during both CLC and OL; study personnel supervised on site and monitored DiAs remotely. There were no dietary restrictions; 45 -min walks in town and restaurant dinners were included in both CLC and OL; alcohol was permitted. RESULTS: The primary outcome - reduction in risk for hypoglycemia {{as measured by the}} low blood glucose (BG) index (LGBI) - resulted in an effect size of 0. 64, P = 0. 003, with a twofold reduction of hypoglycemia requiring carbohydrate treatment: 1. 2 vs. 2. 4 episodes/session on CLC versus OL (P = 0. 02). This was accompanied by a slight decrease in percentage of time in the target range of 3. 9 - 10 mmol/L (66. 1 vs. 70. 7 %) and increase in mean BG (8. 9 vs. 8. 4 mmol/L; P = 0. 04) on CLC versus OL. CONCLUSIONS: CLC running on a smartphone (DiAs) in outpatient conditions reduced hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia treatments when compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy. This was accompanied by marginal increase in average glycemia resulting from a possible overemphasis on hypoglycemia safety...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{attainment}} of rational energy use {{can be obtained}} by using a co-generation system, which is a system able to produce thermal and electric power at the same time, or better through a trigenerative system able to produce the necessary cooling energy to air conditioning from "waste " thermal energy. If a system of electrical energy production gives consistent quality and quantity of thermal energy as a by-product, it is always convenient beyond that useful to recover it. In this way, both a higher efficiency of the whole system and an obvious reduction of the polluting emissions (otherwise produced if the thermal energy rate is generated in a separate manner) are obtained. Among the energy production systems that have the characteristic of “trigenerate ” in addition to the production of primary energy in the shape of mechanical or electrical energy, fuel cells in <b>tandem</b> with heat <b>pumps</b> are undoubtedly among the more innovative energetic systems, in terms of energetic sustainability or environmental sustainability. These innovative fuel cell systems are the object of study of both research bodies and automotive constructors as an alternative to traditional internal combustion engines. In this paper, the analysis of these fuel cell systems, working in the propulsion and in the trigenerative order, in the low-power field is carried out, in terms of some significant parameters based {{on the use of the}} fuel, on its electric power conversion performance and above all on the environmental impact of the considered system. Then the determination of the said system is achieved in an application to a real case relative to land traction. Finally, through CAD modelling, the feasibility of rationally positioning the two energetic systems, the propulsive and the trigenerative ones, inside the vehicle, is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) {{manufactured}} by Baker Hughes, model no. WJE- 1000 {{is designed for}} wells {{that are expected to}} have a high content of abrasive solids. It is a mixed flow, <b>tandem</b> compression type <b>pump.</b> Although the erosion of the pump diffuser and impeller stages are significant, the ESP study shows that the most sever failure is due to components that affect the pump?s rotor dynamics such as radial bearings and impeller seals when eroded with 100 mesh sand. Erosion of these seals will result in an internal leakage that can significantly affect stage pressure rise, efficiency, power consumption, vibration, pump life and running cost. The erosion study utilizing 100 mesh fracture sand at 0. 2 % concentration, with the pump operating at 3600 RPM, 40 PSI intake pressure, 1150 GPM for over 117 hours comparisons are made to the pump?s baseline performance. Measurements of the rotor bearings, impeller seals and their corresponding stators showed that the wear patterns generally increase with time and differ by location. Stage 1 bearings and seals suffered the least amount of erosion and stage 3 rotor components suffered the most erosion. The maximum change in stage 3 bearing clearances was 223 % and the maximum change in stage 3 impeller seal clearances was 300 %. Performance wise the total pump efficiency dropped by 6. 77 %, the total pressure rise dropped by 6. 3 %, the pump?s best efficiency point decreased by 0. 78 %, and the power consumption increased by 0. 49 %. Pump vibration patterns also changed with time and by location. The maximum shaft orbit diameter was at stage 3 and it grew 643 % in diameter after 117 hours of erosion. The waterfall plots of the pump?s ramp up changed significantly with time. After 117 hours at 3600 RPM, sub-synchronous oscillations at 67 % of the synchronous speed dominated the amplitude peaks showing that the rotor vibration locked with the rotor?s first natural frequency at around 2500 RPM. After 117 hours, another sub-synchronous started showing a peak at the rotor?s second natural frequency at 1500 RPM...|$|R
40|$|Ion {{beams of}} MeV energy are in routine use as depth microscopes to {{determine}} composition and impurity profiles with depth resolutions of 100 - 300 Å over near-surface regions. Backscattering spectrometry with He ions and proton-induced x-rays are simple to implement. These techniques {{have been used}} in studies of thin-film reactions, solid-phase epitaxy, metallurgy of integrated circuits and solar cells, oxidation and corrosion, and other near-surface phenomena. The Spacelab orbital environment provides the possibility of depositing contamination-free films on clean interfaces. Ion beam techniques for material analysis can then be used to evaluate thin-film interdiffusion, and compound formation in a contaminant-free ambient. In addition, the ion beam techniques would be available for rapid analysis of near-surface regions of other experiments, such as molecular-beam epitaxy. The instrumentation-semiconductor nuclear-particle detectors and multichannel analyzer for such measurements are simple and were used in early Surveyor lunar analyses. The accelerator is based on the <b>tandem</b> accelerator principle <b>pumped</b> by the vacuum of space. It consists of a series of eight light equispaced titanium concentric spheres which are supported on a single insulating hollow column. The largest sphere which is at the potential of the spacecraft has a diameter of 200 cm. The smallest sphere has a diameter of 30 cm and is maintained at l MV potential. Voltage is generated between the largest sphere and the smallest sphere by using an inductively charged stapled belt to physically transfer charge. The belt system operates in vacuum {{within the confines of the}} hollow insulating column and needs only energy to supply bearing losses and the work done against the electrostatic forces. A series of small holes located collinear on the concentric spheres create a region of uniform electrostatic field which accelerate negative particles to 1 MeV at the terminal. Here a small gas canal is used for stripping electrons from the particles, causing them to change sign from negative to positive. These positive particles are repelled from the terminal back to ground to give He^(++) particles with energies up to 3 MeV and H^+ of 2 MeV. Two types of ion sources would be provided with this device. The first, a simple Penning source, would produce H^- beams for proton-induced x-ray measurement. A second lithium exchange source would provide He^- for backscatter measurements...|$|R
