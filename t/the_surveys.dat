5|$|Brunner {{retired in}} 1869 at the {{relatively}} young age of 46. He remained {{employed by the}} Nelson Provincial Council as a consultant surveyor and was also head of the Nelson Survey Department. His administration skills were {{not up to the}} latter role and many of <b>the</b> <b>surveys</b> produced under his supervision were of poor quality. He also continued to seek private work and contributed to a report on the suitability of the Buller region for settlement and this was published in early 1873. On his retirement in 1869 he had retained his offices of sheriff, returning officer and registration officer but was relieved of these in 1872 in cost-cutting measures by the Nelson Provincial Council. This did not meet with the approval of locals.|$|E

On each episode, two female contestants attempt {{to figure out what}} men believe about marriage, dating, work, and other subjects. Similar to Family Feud, the questions have previously been answered by a survey of one hundred men. Over the course of four rounds, a celebrity panel consisting of two men and a woman helps the contestants by offering their opinions about the correct answers to <b>the</b> <b>surveys.</b> The winner advances to the bonus round, which features a top prize of $10,000.|$|E

Demographic surveys by sociologist Susan Palmer and David Ownby in North American communities found that 90% of practitioners were ethnic Chinese (in Europe, there are proportionally more Caucasians). The average age was approximately 42. Among survey respondents, 56% were female and 44% male; 80% were married. <b>The</b> <b>surveys</b> found the respondents to be highly educated: 9% held PhDs, 34% had master's degrees, and 24% had a bachelor's degree.|$|E

Norway did not participate in <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> this year. <b>The</b> <b>survey</b> design used and described in ICES (2012) allowed for a flexible setup of transects and good coverage of the spawning aggregations.

Transects of all vessels were consistent in spatial coverage and timing, delivering full coverage of the respective distribution areas within 19 days...|$|R

5|$|Traditionally, devices like a blink {{comparator}} {{were used}} in astronomy to detect objects in the Solar System, because these objects would move between two exposures—this involved time-consuming steps like exposing and developing photographic plates or films, and people then using a blink comparator to manually detect prospective objects. During the 1980s, the use of CCD-based cameras in telescopes {{made it possible to}} directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images. Because the CCD captured more light than film (about 90% versus 10% of incoming light) and the blinking could now be done at an adjustable computer screen, <b>the</b> <b>surveys</b> allowed for higher throughput. A flood of new discoveries was the result: over a thousand trans-Neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Illegal {{trade routes}} {{are known to}} exist from Cambodia, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with much of this trade destined for China. Surveys from 1998 and 1999 show that 80 to 90 animals were {{imported}} from Vietnam though Hekou Port into Yunnan province, making it the most commonly recorded animal in <b>the</b> <b>surveys.</b> China is the primary destination of most Vietnamese slow lorises, although they are also smuggled to other countries, including Taiwan. In one noted incident, 102 animals were confiscated during transit to Ho Chi Minh City in August 1993; of these, only four survived. Pygmy lorises may cost up to US$400 on the Taiwanese pet market. In the USA, occasionally, pygmy lorises smuggled from Vietnam have been confiscated. The Endangered Primate Rescue Centre reports that the pygmy slow loris is the most often rescued species, which reflects their abundance in trade. In Europe, illegal purchases have been reported from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Moscow.|$|E

Because subjective perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> context influence <b>the</b> way individuals interpret, ask, and respond to survey questions, we first present a taxonomy of contextual variables.

The {{indicator of the}} willingness of Ukraine's residents to participate in social contacts of varying degrees of closeness with different ethnic groups (the Bogardus Social Distance Scale) calculated based on the yearly sociological surveys has been consistently showing that Russians are, on the average, least socially distanced within Ukraine except the Ukrainians themselves. The same survey has shown that, in fact, that Ukrainian people are slightly more comfortable accepting Russians into their families than they are accepting Ukrainians living abroad. Such social attitude correlates with the political one as <b>the</b> <b>surveys</b> taken yearly between 1997 and 2005 consistently indicated that the attitude {{to the idea of}} Ukraine joining the union of Russia and Belarus is more positive (slightly over 50%) than negative (slightly under 30%).|$|E

25|$|By 1985, traffic had {{increased}} {{so much that}} it became clear that by 1988 all international traffic would have to move to Gardermoen. The areas at Hobøl had been freed up, and a government report was launched recommending that a new airport be built at Gardermoen, although an airport at Hurum had also been surveyed. However, the report did not look into the need of the Air Force that was stationed at Gardermoen, and was therefore rejected by the parliament the following year. In 1988, a majority of the government chose Hurum as their preferred location, and Minister of Transport Kjell Borgen withdrew from his position. In 1989, new weather surveys from Hurum showed unfavorable conditions. There were large protests from meteorologists and pilots who stated that <b>the</b> <b>surveys</b> were manipulated. Two government committees were appointed, and both concluded that there were no irregularities in <b>the</b> <b>surveys.</b>|$|E
