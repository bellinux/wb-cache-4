5|$|In 1787, Catherine II of Russia came to Kiev (Kyiv) for a {{visit and}} wished to see the Mezhyhirya Monastery. She never got <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> because the monastery mysteriously burned down the night before her arrival.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} the whale was found dead, {{floating}} out at sea. It was towed to Stonehaven and dragged onto the beach. John Struthers, the Regius professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen, quickly visited the carcass, recording it as 40 feet long with flukes measuring 11 feet 4 inches. A local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale {{and had it}} transported to his yard in Dundee. On the first Sunday that it was there, 12,000 people paid <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{she does}} not expect <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> Izzi asks Tom to finish {{the outcome of the}} story for her. As they look out to the star of a nebula, she imagines, as the Mayans did, that their souls will meet there after life and when the star goes supernova. In the 26th century, future space {{traveler}} Tommy travels there for the event, in a spaceship made of an enclosed biosphere containing the Tree of Life he seeded above her grave.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in October of each year, Pleione {{along with}} the rest of the cluster can be seen rising in the east in the early morning before dawn. <b>To</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> after sunset, one will need to wait until December. By mid-February, the star is visible to {{virtually}} every inhabited region of the globe, with only those south of 66° unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Even in cities like Cape Town, South Africa, at the tip of the African continent, the star rises almost 32° above the horizon. Due to its declination of roughly +24°, Pleione is circumpolar in the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than 66° North. Once late April arrives, the cluster can be spotted briefly in the deepening twilight of the western horizon, soon to disappear with the other setting stars.|$|E
5|$|Ernie says Scully is now marked and the {{creature}} will go after her too. When his ground radar goes off, Scully goes outside. Ernie stays inside and is butchered by the bat creature.

The creature disappears into the night while Scully helps the injured Doggett.|$|E
50|$|On January 11, 1468 the Cardinal {{was elected}} Chamberlain of the College of Cardinals for a one-year term.

5|$|In 1884, Harrison and Gresham {{competed for}} {{influence}} at the 1884 Republican National Convention; the delegation ended up supporting James G. Blaine, the eventual nominee. In the Senate, Harrison achieved passage of his Dependent Pension Bill, only <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> vetoed by President Grover Cleveland. His efforts {{to further the}} admission of new western states were stymied by Democrats, who feared that the new states would elect Republicans to Congress.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Home Counties Aircraft Services {{were based}} at Penshurst. A de Havilland DH.60 Gipsy Moth was {{exhibited}} at a car showroom in Tunbridge Wells, causing severe traffic congestion {{due to the}} number of people visiting the town <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Home Counties Aircraft Service Ltd was registered later that year. By October 1930, Mr Waters, the manager of Home Counties Aircraft Service Ltd had formed the Surrey Aero Club, based at Gatwick Racecourse Aerodrome.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{announcement}} was made public on March 21, 1966. The two-week flight of Apollo 1 was not only to test the spacecraft systems, but also the ground tracking and control facilities.

5|$|A minute later, West Ham {{went ahead}} again; defender Paul Konchesky {{received}} {{the ball on}} the left flank, and played a ball into the Liverpool penalty area, only <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> sail over goalkeeper Reina and into the goal. Three minutes later, Liverpool made another substitution, as Alonso went off with an injury to be replaced by defender Jan Kromkamp. Minutes later, West Ham captain Nigel Reo-Coker had an attempt to score, but his shot went over the Liverpool goal. West Ham subsequently made their first substitution of the match, as Ashton was replaced by fellow striker Bobby Zamora. Liverpool also replaced Crouch with midfielder Dietmar Hamann.|$|E
5|$|After his defeat, Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition around the country, and was gratified <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> spread to eleven states. He also made efforts to refute the charge made by his enemies (including his cousin John Neal) that the Maine law was ineffective and that drinking had actually increased in Portland during Dow's term in office. In 1854, Dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully; as the Whig Party {{began to break}} apart, Dow attracted support from the Free Soilers and the Know Nothings, a nativist party. By the next year, those two parties began to join anti-slavery Whigs in a new party, the Republicans. They soon controlled the state legislature and, with Dow's encouragement, strengthened the enforcement provisions of the Maine law. Dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re-elected to the office he had left three years earlier.|$|E

5|$|Alien {{opened in}} American theaters on May 25, 1979. The film had no formal premiere, yet moviegoers {{lined up for}} blocks <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood where a number of models, sets, and props were {{displayed}} outside to promote it during its first run. Religious zealots {{set fire to the}} model of the space jockey, believing it to be the work of the devil. In the United Kingdom, Alien premiered at a gala performance at the Edinburgh Film Festival on September 1, 1979, before starting an exclusive run at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on September 6, 1979, but it did not open widely in Britain until January 13, 1980.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} December 1883, a {{humpback}} whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off Dundee, attracting much local interest. It was harpooned, but after an all-night struggle escaped. A week later it was found dead, and was towed on to the beach at Stonehaven, near Aberdeen. Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet long with a tail 11 feet 4 inches wide. Struthers {{was not able to}} start dissecting it at once, as a local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale and took it to his yard in Dundee, where on the first Sunday, 12,000 people paid <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>It</b> is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E

In addition, the Navy intercept station in the islands, known as Station CAST, had an ultra secret Purple cipher machine, which decrypted Japanese diplomatic messages, and partial codebooks for the latest JN-25 naval code.

5|$|Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, {{inserted}} into the Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is {{seen by many as}} showing that Deckard is a replicant—because Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme. The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> from multiple perspectives.|$|E
5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century, Tycho Brahe {{measured}} the diurnal parallax of Mars that Johannes Kepler {{used to make}} a preliminary calculation of the relative distance to the planet. When the telescope became available, the diurnal parallax of Mars was again measured in an effort to determine the Sun-Earth distance. This was first performed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1672. The early parallax measurements were hampered by the quality of the instruments. The only occultation of Mars by Venus observed was that of October 13, 1590, seen by Michael Maestlin at Heidelberg. In 1610, Mars was viewed by Galileo Galilei, who was first <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> via telescope. The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed any terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.|$|E
