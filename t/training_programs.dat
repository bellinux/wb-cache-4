This paper shows that the average distance of a training center in a village, and the active labor proportion in a family are the core instruments that influence participation of laborers in the rural labor <b>training</b> <b>program.</b> It suggests that rural laborers enter the <b>training</b> <b>program</b> due to the availability of abundant labor in a family, and the convenient conveyance cost to the training center.

40|$|Background: Although running has {{positive}} effects on health and fitness, the incidence of a running-related injury (RRI) is high. Research on prevention of RRI is scarce; to date, no studies have involved novice runners. Hypothesis: A graded <b>training</b> <b>program</b> for novice runners {{will lead to a}} decrease in the absolute number of RRIs compared with a standard <b>training</b> <b>program.</b> Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: GRONORUN (Groningen Novice Running) is a 2 -armed randomized controlled trial comparing a standard 8 -week <b>training</b> <b>program</b> (control group) and an adapted, graded, 13 -week <b>training</b> <b>program</b> (intervention group), on the risk of sustaining an RRI. Participants were novice runners (N = 532) preparing for a recreational 4 -mile (6. 7 -km) running event. The graded 13 -week <b>training</b> <b>program</b> was based on the 10 % training rule. Both groups registered information on running characteristics and RRI using an Internet-based running log. The primary outcome measure was RRIs per 100 participants. An RRI was defined as any musculoskeletal complaint of the lower extremity or back causing a restriction of running for at least 1 week. Results: The graded <b>training</b> <b>program</b> was not preventive for sustaining an RRI (chi(2) = 0. 016, df = 1, P =. 90). The incidence of RRI was 20. 8 % in the graded <b>training</b> <b>program</b> group and 20. 3 % in the standard <b>training</b> <b>program</b> group. Conclusions: This randomized controlled trial showed no effect of a graded <b>training</b> <b>program</b> (13 weeks) in novice runners, applying the 10 % rule, on the incidence of RRI compared with a standard 8 -week <b>training</b> <b>program.</b> Keywords: running-related injuries; incidence; prevention; training program; novice runner...|$|R
