50|$|In June 2008 it was {{reported}} at <b>the</b> meeting of <b>American</b> <b>Astronomical</b> Society that using their new MOA-II telescope, the observatory discovered what is {{at the time the}} smallest planet known outside of our Solar System. The planet MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb is just 3.3 times larger than Earth and is orbiting a small star, MOA-2007-BLG-192L (3000 light years from Earth). There is some possibility the planet has a thick atmosphere and a liquid ocean on its surface.|$|R
50|$|Andrew Howard {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} a Super-Earth in orbit around HD 156668. This planet is designated HD 156668 b. The announcement was made at <b>the</b> 215th <b>American</b> <b>Astronomical</b> Society meeting on January 4 to 7, 2010 in Washington D.C.. The planet orbits its star in only 4.6 days with a distance approximately 0.05 AU away from the parent star. The researchers used the wobble method where the resulting spectrum showed color shifts which was used to approximate the mass of the astronomical object. The observation revealed data that the exoplanet was at least 4.15 Earth masses. Later observations revealed that the minimum mass is now 3.1 Earth masses.|$|R
50|$|Holyoke {{encouraged}} broader intellectual exploration beyond {{curriculum and}} disciplinary changes. In 1755, the Dudleian Lecture was {{given for the}} first time by the College President. In 1756, in order to improve English oratory, a system of public exhibitions was introduced. Lasting for over a century, selected students participated in debates, orations, and dialogues in the English language. In 1761, John Winthrop, the Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, arranged <b>the</b> first <b>American</b> <b>astronomical</b> expedition to observe Venus's transit over the Sun. While not considered an intellect by his contemporaries, Holyoke did strengthen Harvard’s academic program in mathematics and science, and during his tenure Harvard established the first laboratory for experimental physics in North America.|$|R
5|$|Kepler-4 {{is named}} for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA {{telescope}} tasked with finding Earth-like planets that transit their stars as seen from Earth. As the previous three planets that Kepler confirmed had already been confirmed by other finds, Kepler-4 and its planet {{were the first to}} be discovered by the Kepler team. The star and its system were announced in Washington, D.C. at the 215th meeting of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Astronomical</b> Society on January 4, 2010, along with Kepler-5, Kepler-6, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. Of the presented planets, Kepler-4b was the smallest, around the size of planet Neptune. The discovery of Kepler-4b and the other planets presented at the AAS meeting helped to confirm that the Kepler spacecraft was indeed functional.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5 {{is named}} so {{because it was}} the fifth planet-bearing star {{discovered}} {{during the course of the}} Kepler Mission, a NASA operation that seeks to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in front of, their host stars with respect to Earth. The star's planet, Kepler-5b, was the second of the first five planets to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets found by Kepler were used as tests, and had already been discovered. Kepler-5b was presented to the public on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Astronomical</b> Society in Washington, D.C., along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-6, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5b {{is one of}} {{the first}} five planets {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. It is a Hot Jupiter that orbits a subgiant star that is more massive, larger, and more diffuse than the Sun is. Kepler-5 was first flagged as the location of a possibly transiting planet, and was reclassified as a Kepler Object of Interest until follow-up observations confirmed the planet's existence and many of its characteristics. The planet's discovery was announced at a meeting of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Astronomical</b> Society on January 4, 2010. The planet has approximately twice the mass of Jupiter, and is about 1.5 times larger. It is also fifteen times hotter than Jupiter. Kepler-5b orbits Kepler-5 every 3.5 days at a distance of approximately 0.051 AU (7.6 Gm).|$|E
25|$|The USAF's Project Blue Book files {{indicate}} that approximately 1% of all unknown reports came from amateur and professional astronomers or other users of telescopes (such as missile trackers or surveyors). In 1952, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, then {{a consultant to}} Blue Book, conducted a small survey of 45 fellow professional astronomers. Five reported UFO sightings (about 11%). In the 1970s, astrophysicist Peter A. Sturrock conducted two large surveys of <b>the</b> AIAA and <b>American</b> <b>Astronomical</b> Society (AAS).

Recognizing the contribution of non-professionals {{to the advancement of}} astronomical research, the AAS gave the Chambliss Amateur Achievement Award to R. Jay GaBany of San Jose, California, [...] "who has single-handedly, through his dedicated and careful work, spawned a new research direction in the exploration of galaxy evolution via low-surface-brightness imaging of galaxy halo substructure." [...] GaBany has devoted hundreds of hours working with professional astronomers to make deep images that reveal faint tidal streams and rings in the outer halos of galaxies, indicative of recent and ongoing galaxy interactions with dwarf satellites, supporting studies of galaxy formation. He was also inducted into the SBIG Hall of Fame for astrophotography.|$|R
40|$|Groups {{of young}} stars {{located in the}} solar {{neighborhood}} have recently {{received a lot of}} attention. These stars, which are ∼ < 10 million years old, can provide insights into the birth of stars and planetary systems. For example, the TW Hydrae Association is just at the age when planets are believed to form, while MBM 12 represents an earlier stage. In this Perspective, I briefly discuss recent research in this field. Much glory in astronomy comes from probing the farthest reaches of the universe for the most exotic beasts. But poking around closer to home for more prosaic objects has its own rewards–such as finding small groups of relatively isolated young stars destined for the limelight. Over the past few years, one such group, known as the TW Hydrae Association, has attracted quite a following, as evidenced by the high attendance of a special session during <b>the</b> recent <b>American</b> <b>Astronomical</b> Society meeting. <b>The</b> reason for this widespread interest is that the TW Hydrae group, and others like it in the solar neighborhood, may tell us a lot about the birth of stars and planetary systems.

5|$|Kepler-6 {{was named}} for the Kepler Mission, a NASA and {{accomplishment}} project launched in 2009 that aims to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in front of, their home stars with respect to Earth. Unlike stars like the Sun or Sirius, Kepler-6 {{does not have a}} common and colloquial name. The discovery of Kepler-6b was announced by the Kepler team on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Astronomical</b> Society along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. It was the third planet to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets to be verified by data from Kepler had been previously discovered. These three planets were used to test the accuracy of Kepler's measurements.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-8 {{was named}} {{the way it was}} because it is home to the eighth {{planetary}} system confirmed {{during the course of the}} Kepler Mission, a NASA-directed program tasked with searching a region of the sky for terrestrial planets that transit, or cross in front of (and thereby, for a while, make dimmer) the stars that they orbit with respect to Earth. The planet in orbit around Kepler-8, Kepler-8b, was the fifth of the first five planets discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets confirmed by Kepler had been previously discovered, and were only used to verify the accuracy of Kepler's measurements. Kepler-8b's discovery was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Astronomical</b> Society in Washington, D.C., alongside planets in orbit around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-6, and Kepler-7.|$|E
