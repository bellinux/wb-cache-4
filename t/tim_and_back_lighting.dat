50|$|The male {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by its bright blue head <b>and</b> <b>back</b> (<b>lighter</b> than the closely related indigo bunting), its conspicuous white wingbars, and its light rusty breast and white belly. The color pattern may suggest {{the eastern and}} western bluebirds, but the smaller size (13 - 14 cm or 5 - 5.5 inches long), wingbars, and short and conical bunting bill quickly distinguish it. The female is brown, grayer above and warmer underneath, told from the female indigo bunting by two thin and pale wingbars and other plumage details.|$|R

50|$|To use {{powdered}} {{substances in}} photography {{it is essential}} to have a structured photo shoot set up. A minimum of two lights are needed. The main light (high speed flash in this case) is located {{at the front of the}} photo scene <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>light(s)</b> at the <b>back</b> of the scene to outline the powder. The powder is either thrown at the model at the moment of camera shoot by an assistant, or the model would perform a movement tossing the powder that was previously applied to the hair, arms, legs, etc. As a result, the photo shows captured movement of a model with a smoke-like effect.|$|R
50|$|The three light {{setup is}} a {{standard}} method used in photography and, although {{is not the only}} method used, it is the most common. This method uses three separate positions that help the photographer illuminate the subject.

5000|$|Low-key {{lighting}} is {{a style of}} lighting for photography, film or television. It is a necessary element in creating a chiaroscuro effect. Traditional photographic lighting, three-point lighting uses a key light, a fill <b>light</b> <b>and</b> a <b>back</b> <b>light</b> for illumination. Low-key lighting often uses only one key light, optionally controlled with a fill light or a simple reflector.|$|R

30|$|It is {{notoriously}} known that cellulose-based paper substrates exhibit autofluorescence. Cellulose paper is strongly excited with UV, followed by blue, generating blue to green emissions [83]. Therefore an unwanted background autofluorescence, along with paper’s reflection (back scattering), must be addressed. Also {{with the use}} of biological samples, autofluorescence <b>and</b> <b>back</b> scattering <b>light</b> from paper surfaces can be even more problematic [84, 85].|$|R

30|$|This article briefly {{reviews the}} {{developments}} of the phosphors with high thermal stability and high efficiency for use in phosphor-converted LED (pcLED) packages by Lightscape Materials Inc. (wholly owned by The Dow Chemical Company). The current industry design objectives for pcLED packages are first outlined with emphasis on the emission spectral features required for target brightness and color characteristics for general illumination <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>light</b> unit for liquid crystal displays. There is a growing demand on thermal stability of the phosphor emission as the LED package power increases. A phenomenological analysis is described on luminescence loss {{and its relation to}} thermal stability of luminescence emission at elevated temperatures, which serves as an empirical guide in the search for new phosphor materials of high thermal stability. Finally, the formulations and luminescence properties of the proprietary carbidonitride and oxycarbidonitride phosphors are discussed.|$|R
