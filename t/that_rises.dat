5|$|Any rider {{may take}} {{unlimited}} trips {{of up to}} 30 minutes, measured from when the bike is withdrawn from a dock to when it is returned. (If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour on a scale <b>that</b> <b>rises</b> from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips {{from place to place}} instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E
5|$|Aristarchus {{is located}} on an {{elevated}} rocky rise, known as the Aristarchus Plateau, {{in the midst of}} the Oceanus Procellarum, a large expanse of lunar mare. This is a tilted crustal block, about 200km across, <b>that</b> <b>rises</b> to a maximum elevation of 2km above the mare in the southeastern section. Aristarchus is just to the east of the crater Herodotus and the Vallis Schröteri, and south of a system of narrow sinuous rilles named Rimae Aristarchus.|$|E

5|$|Maple syrup is a syrup {{usually made}} from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, {{although}} {{it can also be}} made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar <b>that</b> <b>rises</b> in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.|$|E
5|$|Submarine {{volcanism}} {{is driven}} by various processes. Volcanoes near plate boundaries and mid-ocean ridges are built by the decompression melting of mantle rock <b>that</b> <b>rises</b> on an upwelling portion of a convection cell to the crustal surface. Eruptions associated with subducting zones, meanwhile, are driven by subducting plates that add volatiles to the rising plate, lowering its melting point. Each process generates different rock; mid-ocean ridge volcanics are primarily basaltic, whereas subduction flows are mostly calc-alkaline, and more explosive and viscous.|$|E
5|$|The sharptooth houndshark is a stout-bodied {{species with}} a short, thick, and blunt snout. The {{nostrils}} are widely spaced and preceded by lobe-like flaps of skin {{that do not}} reach the mouth. The horizontally oval eyes have ridges underneath and are equipped with nictitating membranes. The large mouth bears long, deep furrows at the corners, with those on the lower jaw almost meeting in the middle. The teeth are small and tightly packed to form pavement-like surfaces. Each tooth has a rounded, molar-like base <b>that</b> <b>rises</b> to a sharp, upright central cusp; rarely, a pair of barely developed lateral cusplets may also be present. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E

The tallest structure in the prefecture is Tokyo Skytree, a lattice tower <b>that</b> <b>rises</b> 634metres (2,080ft), which was completed in 2012. It also stands as the tallest structure in Japan, the tallest tower {{in the world and}} the 2nd-tallest freestanding structure in the world. The tallest building and third-tallest overall structure in Tokyo is the 256-metre-tall (838ft) Toranomon Hills, which was completed in 2014. The prefecture's second tallest building is Midtown Tower, which rises 54stories and 248metres (814ft) in height. Overall, of the 25tallest buildings and structures in Japan, 16are in Tokyo.|$|E
