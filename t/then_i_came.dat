That's the way I normally make songs– I write everything in the studio– and it obviously means that producers are very important to me. It's a complete joint effort.|$|E

Adams said no, but Sudyk wrote in his article that he would. According to Adams, [...] "not to make a liar out of Bob, I showed up with my drum, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to the next game and the next game and the next game." [...] The Indians' promotions director at the time, Jackie York, also approached Adams and asked him to play at every game. Adams formally declined but continued to attend games with his drum.|$|E
500|$|The film is set {{six months}} after the events of The Avengers. In the film Tony Stark {{experiences}} PTSD-like symptoms following the Battle of New York in The Avengers. Black explained, [...] "that's an anxiety response to feeling inferior to The Avengers, but also to being humbled by sights he cannot possibly begin to understand or reconcile with the realities he's used to... There's a line in the movie about 'ever since that big guy with the hammer fell out of the sky, the rules have changed'. That's what we're dealing with here." [...] Bruce Banner appears in a post-credits scene, with Ruffalo reprising the role. About the scene, Ruffalo said [...] "They were about to wrap the movie and I saw Robert [...] at the Academy Awards... and he said, 'What do you think about coming and doing a day?' I said, 'Are you kidding me? Bang, lets do it!' We sort of spitballed that scene, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> in and we shot {{for a couple of hours}} and laughed." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} 7 Khoon Maaf came when Ruskin Bond sent his book of Short Story {{collection}} to Vishal Bhardwaj. He {{was intrigued by}} a four-page story's title named [...] "Susanna's Seven Husbands", and thought it had potential for a novel and a film. Bhardwaj said, [...] "I told myself why would a woman have seven husbands and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{to know that she}} also kills them! I was immediately hooked to it. It reminded me of a very old film, Bluebeard's Seven Wives". Bhardwaj suggested the story to a fellow director, who was looking for a good story. However, after reading the short story, the director dismissed it saying it has no film potential. After reading the story twice, he became even more confident about possibility of a film. Bhardwaj who had previously adapted Bond's novel The Blue Umbrella into a film, decided to adapt the short story for the screen. Bhardwaj later requested Bond to turn the story into a novella, noting that only Bond could flesh out the characters well, to which he agreed. Bond expanded the story into an 80-page novella, which later became a 200-page full-length Hindi script. Bhardwaj co-wrote the script with Matthew Robbins.|$|E

Hewett began her music career {{at the age of}} 12 when she sang with The Esquires at the Bendigo YMCA. At about 13 years old she {{appeared}} on TV pop music series, The Go!!

2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were strange to me.

[...] She wrote saying that as I had left home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to write to me to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if you like you can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to accompany me. [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station {{in front of me and}} could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E
