5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E

In the early 1960s, Bernal returned to the subject of the origin of life— analysing meteorites for evidence of complex molecules— and to the topic of the structure of liquids, which he <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> his Bakerian lecture in 1962.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s The Etobicoke Board of Education {{had gone through}} the process of closing over thirty schools because of a {{dramatic}} decline in enrolment, which dropped from 65,000 to fewer than 35,000 pupils. In spite of this, the senior staff felt compelled to resume innovative programs that had characterized the Board during the 1960s and 1970s.

25|$|Asha's {{sibling rivalry}} with Lata Mangeshkar is often <b>talked</b> <b>about,</b> <b>in</b> {{spite of their}} insistence that these are just tales. As young children, they were very close. As a child, Lata used to carry Asha all the time. They were so inseparable that when Lata went to school she would take Asha with her. One day the teacher protested {{and said that they}} cannot have two {{students}} on one fee. Lata refused to return to school without Asha and quit her studies.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} made into the film Lady in the Lake, {{starring}} and directed by Robert Montgomery. Montgomery tried a technique that had often been <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> Hollywood but never used in a major film: he used the camera as the protagonist (Philip Marlowe) of the film. Other characters talk directly to the camera. The voice of Marlowe is that of Montgomery, but his face is shown only in reflections. Reviews of the film were not appreciative of the new approach. Most critics gave the director credit for trying an experimental technique but felt the experiment had been a failure.|$|E

By going to the foreign Ministry in the later years of González administration he avoided the political scandals of corruption, and of the dirty war allegedly being fought against ETA, that characterised its last years. Towards the end of 1995, Solana – the only surviving member of González's original cabinet – was <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> the press as a possible candidate to replace him and lead the PSOE in the following March elections. Instead, he made the leap to international politics.|$|E

25|$|Collaboration {{with the}} Nazi {{occupation}} is an aspect less often <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> Luxembourg. Studies {{have shown that}} collaboration was a phenomenon in all layers of society. There was, however, an over-representation of civil servants among the collaborators. On average, the collaborators were younger than the general population. In early September 1944, approximately 10,000 people left Luxembourg with the German civil administration: it is generally assumed that this consisted of 3,500 collaborators and their families. In 1945, 5,101 Luxembourgers, including 2,857 men and 2,244 women were in prison for political activities, constituting 1.79% of the population. 12 collaborators were sentenced to death and were shot in Reckenthal in Luxembourg City. 249 were sentenced to forced labour, 1366 were sentenced to prison and 645 were sent to workhouses.|$|E
25|$|American wrestlers became {{especially}} {{popular with}} the public during the early 1970s. One of the biggest US tours occurred in 1972 when Big Bad John, Bulldog Brower, Les Wolff, King Curtis Iaukea, Spiros Arion, Mark Lewin, Thunderbolt Patterson, Sweet Daddy Siki, Tarzan Tyler, Dewey Robertson and Haystacks Calhoun wrestled throughout New Zealand. Calhoun {{and his wife were}} often seen and <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> the national media. The couple made numerous television appearances, press interviews and visited schools. That same year, the Rickard-Barnett partnership ended when Barnett sold his share of Big Time Wrestling, an Australian wrestling program that had briefly aired in New Zealand, and returned to work in the United States. Rickard then decided to promote wrestling events full-time with All Star Pro-Wrestling. Rickard's later affiliation with the National Wrestling Alliance ensured the arrival of many wrestlers from North America and elsewhere for the next several years.|$|E

Their descriptions were coded and analyzed to explore the way that they <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> money issues <b>in</b> their marriages. The research questions focused on how couples <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> financial stress and how they <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> financial decisions <b>in</b> their relationships. An unanticipated finding was how they <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> transcending finances <b>in</b> their marriages. The findings can contribute to future research and financial education for African American couples...|$|R

500|$|The {{film was}} made {{in an attempt to}} {{challenge}} the [...] "no pressure" [...] attitude often displayed both by governments and individuals towards taking real action on climate change. 10:10 highlighted the urgency of action with claims that carbon dioxide emissions must be stabilised by 2014 (within four years) in order to avoid disaster, and that [...] "300,000 real people" [...] are already killed by climate change annually. Lizzie Gillet, 10:10 global campaign director, explained: [...] "With climate change becoming increasingly threatening, and decreasingly <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> the media, we wanted {{to find a way to}} bring this critical issue back into the headlines while making people laugh.

500|$|In 1968, R. Gordon Wasson {{proposed}} that A.muscaria was the Soma <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> the Rig Veda of India, a claim which received widespread publicity and popular support at the time. He noted that descriptions of Soma omitted any description of roots, stems or seeds, which suggested a mushroom, {{and used the}} adjective hári [...] "dazzling" [...] or [...] "flaming" [...] which the author interprets as meaning red. One line described men urinating Soma; this recalled the practice of recycling urine in Siberia. Soma is mentioned as coming [...] "from the mountains", which Wasson interpreted as the mushroom having been brought in with the Aryan invaders from the north. Indian scholars Santosh Kumar Dash and Sachinanda Padhy pointed out that both eating of mushrooms and drinking of urine were proscribed, using as a source the Manusmṛti.|$|E
500|$|Eliminativism {{maintains}} that the common-sense understanding of the mind is mistaken, and that the neurosciences will one day reveal that the mental states that are <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> everyday discourse, using words such as [...] "intend", [...] "believe", [...] "desire", and [...] "love", do not refer to anything real. Because of the inadequacy of natural languages, people mistakenly {{think that they have}} such beliefs and desires. Some eliminativists, such as Frank Jackson, claim that consciousness does not exist except as an epiphenomenon of brain function; others, such as Georges Rey, claim that the concept will eventually be eliminated as neuroscience progresses. Consciousness and folk psychology are separate issues and it is possible to take an eliminative stance on one but not the other. The roots of eliminativism go back to the writings of Wilfred Sellars, W.V. Quine, Paul Feyerabend, and Richard Rorty. The term [...] "eliminative materialism" [...] was first introduced by James Cornman in 1968 while describing a version of physicalism endorsed by Rorty. The later Ludwig Wittgenstein was also an important inspiration for eliminativism, particularly with his attack on [...] "private objects" [...] as [...] "grammatical fictions".|$|E

500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason that}} when we talked about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the first season... we realized that not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Garcia posted several {{videos of}} his inmates' {{performances}} on YouTube {{in hopes of}} inspiring other prisons {{to learn from the}} experience. The clips became some of the most <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> cyberspace. The most popular of the videos was uploaded in April 2007. It showed over 1,500 male inmates imitating the zombie dance featured in the music video of Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller". The prisoners wore their orange jail-issue jumpsuits during the performance in the jail's exercise yard. The Los Angeles Times later commented that the dance moves were not lifted directly from the video, [...] "but they are performed with such precision it somehow seems that they must have been". Inmate Crisanto Nierre played the role of Michael Jackson. Nierre, who at the time was awaiting trial on drug charges, has been a fan of Jackson since he was in a dance troupe at high school. USA Today noted that his favorite Jackson tracks were [...] "Bad" [...] and [...] "Smooth Criminal". Former pizza chef Wenjiel Resane, who is gay, played the part of Jackson's girlfriend. At the time, Resane had already been at the prison for three years, also awaiting trial on drug charges.|$|E
500|$|Lovato {{collaborated with}} Beckett on a song titled [...] "For the Love of a Daughter". Although not {{planning}} to write a personal song, a [...] "really long talk" [...] with Beckett resulted in the song being written. The song chronicles Lovato's relationship with her estranged birth father, who left the family when she was two years old. In the song, she pleads with her father to [...] "put the bottle down" [...] and questions him: [...] "How could you {{put your hands on}} the ones that you swore you loved?" [...] The song was set to appear on the album, but Lovato and her management felt of the song's subject would be too much for her young audience and later was removed from the album. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained: [...] "When I took a step back, I realized I wouldn't like those subjects being <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> somebody else's home, with a seven-year-old and their mom." [...] Several other [...] "emotional" [...] songs were also put on hold. The song was later selected and included on her third studio album Unbroken released in September 2011, when Lovato had left Disney Channel.|$|E
