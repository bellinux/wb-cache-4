40|$|Striking {{a balance}} between trade {{facilitation}} and preventing trade deflection {{is the single most}} difficult challenge with regard to the issue of rules of origin (ROO). ASEAN ROO is already considered as among the simplest in the world and still, in practice, results fall short of expectations. Haddad (2007) made the following observations about the ASEAN ROO : (1) low AFTA preference utilization rate, (2) difficult compliance even for supposedly simple value-added rule, (3) administrative cost of compliance to prove origin acting as deterrent, (4) low margin of preference for goods traded within ASEAN, and (5) the bulk of intra-ASEAN trade occurring in commodities where preference margins are below the threshold that would justify the cost of compliance. Lessons from the EU experience indicate {{that there are a number}} of factors which could further lessen the negative effects of restrictive rules of origin schemes. This is related to the wide spectrum of ROO among the various East Asian FTAs. According to Manchin and Pelkmans-Balaoing (2007), the burden of production costs induced by restrictive rules of origin can be somewhat reduced by allowing less restrictive cumulation rules (e. g. diagonal or full cumulation), allowing duty drawback, outsourcing and higher de minimis levels. Furthermore, administrative costs can also be reduced by more trader-friendly approaches, such as self-certification methods. The reforms in ASEAN ROOs are indeed heading toward the direction of less restriction and simplification as described by Manchin and Pelkmans-Balaoing (2007) : The relatively ample allowance for imports in the AFTA stems from the realization that for many heavily-traded products in the region, like electronics, production processes may be so splintered that the value of local content is often a small percentage of the products total value. Very early on in the formation of AFTA, it was recognized that the 40 percent ASEAN origin rule may often not be met in the case of trade in textile and textile products. In 1995, it was therefore decided that either the percentage value-added or the substantial transformation rule may be used by ASEAN exporters. The AFTA ROO underwent further overhaul, starting in 2003, when operational procedures were further clarified and simplified. In the same year, the decision was reached to adopt a change in <b>tariff</b> <b>heading</b> rule for determining the origin of the product as a general alternative rule applicable to all products which cannot comply with the 40 percent local/ASEAN content requirement, giving priority to sectors which are the subject of private sector requests and those sectors prioritized by the AEM for accelerated integration. As of last year (2006), the change of <b>tariff</b> <b>heading</b> rule is fully endorsed for four sectors : wheat-flour, wood-based products, aluminum products and iron and steel. Forging ASEAN in an effective regional economic bloc and eventually an economic community, however, would entail more fundamental structural reforms. The argument by the 2003 McKinsey report that market fragmentation lies at the heart of ASEANs competitiveness challenge is rather simplistic. Fortunately, the six projects currently being undertaken by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) address these fundamental issues. These studies deal primarily with supply side constraints focusing on enhancing the capability of ASEAN member countries to engage with each other and other countries more effectively and meaningfully. In the medium term, ASEAN member countries can push for an East Asia Free Trade Area that will consolidate the various bilateral and sub-regional FTAs and therefore overcome the noodle bowl syndrome. This would be a direct result of harmonizing the various ROO. It goes without saying that the ultimate or long-term objective would be an equitable and efficient multilateral trading system anchored on lower MFN rates under the auspices of the WTO.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{following}} study called ―Analysis of the Canadian’s {{market window}} of opportunity and its influence on the Peruvian exports of Sacha Inchi‖, regarding the 2008 – 2012 period, has as its main objective to demonstrate {{the influence of the}} Canadian’s market {{window of opportunity}} in the Peruvian exports of Sacha Inchi by the 2014. This study is possible due to the increasing demand and interest of the international markets, especially the Canadian market, regarding the organic and functional healthy products such as the Sacha Inchi and its outstanding benefits for the human health and the opportunities that implies for the Peruvian exports success of the mentioned product. In order to accomplish that, it was necessary to analyze: the Canadian consumer profile, the evolution and tendency of the Peruvian exports to the World and Canada during the 2008 – 2012 period, the evolution of the number of enterprises and the number of <b>tariffs</b> <b>heading</b> used for Peruvian exports of Sacha Inchi to the target market, and the Canadian Imports regarding the most representatives <b>tariffs</b> <b>heading</b> used in Peru for the export of the Sacha Inchi to the Canadian market, this way it was possible to demonstrate the success of the Sacha Inchi in the target market. In conclusion, it was possible to conclude that the Canadian’s market window of opportunity will positively influence on the Peruvian exports of Sacha Inchi by increasing them in the 2014, which is why, according to the interviewee experts; it should be used by the Peruvian producers and exporters in order to succeed in the Canadian market. TesisEl presente trabajo denominado ―Análisis de la ventana de oportunidad del mercado canadiense y su influencia en las exportaciones peruanas de Sacha Inchi‖, teniendo como línea base el periodo 2008 – 2012, tiene por finalidad demostrar la influencia que tendría la ventana de oportunidad del mercado canadiense en las exportaciones peruanas de Sacha Inchi para el año 2014. Este proyecto de investigación nace en vista de: la creciente demanda e interés de los mercados internacionales, especialmente Canadá, respecto a los productos orgánicos, saludables y funcionales como el Sacha Inchi y sus excepcionales beneficios para el ser humano; y de las oportunidades que esto implica para el éxito de las exportaciones peruanas de dicho producto. Para ello, se procedió a analizar el perfil del consumidor canadiense, también se analizó la evolución y tendencia de las exportaciones peruanas de Sacha Inchi al mundo y a Canadá durante el periodo 2008 – 2012, así como la evolución del número de empresas y del número de partidas arancelarias utilizadas para la exportación del Sacha Inchi a dicho mercado;así mismo se analizaron las importaciones canadienses en general respecto a las partidas arancelarias más utilizadas en el Perú para la exportación de Sacha Inchi a dicho mercado, con el objetivo de demostrar la prosperidad del segmento de mercado para el Sacha Inchi en Canadá. Finalmente, se concluyó que la ventana de oportunidad del mercado canadiense influirá positivamente incrementando las exportaciones peruanas de Sacha Inchi en el año 2014, razón por la cual, según reafirman los expertos entrevistados, deberá ser aprovechada por los exportadores peruanos para lograr el éxito en dicho mercado...|$|R

40|$|LLM (Import and Export Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Customs duty {{represents}} an inescapable financial obligation in international trade. Such duties {{are determined by}} valuing the imported goods according to the classification of the goods. To classify the goods under an appropriate <b>tariff</b> <b>heading</b> is notoriously difficult – despite the almost trite principles from judicial decisions amongst the jurisdictions discussed in this study, such as the European Union, Australia, Canada and the United States of America. In South Africa, the Customs and Excise Act 91 of 1964 defines the ambit of customs duties and ratifies the Harmonised System ("HS"). The HS allows for a uniform approach to tariff classification used by countries across the world accounting for in excess of 95 % of the world trade. Countries that employ this system are obliged to incorporate the HS into such country's domestic legislation and to use all headings and subheadings of the HS without addition or alteration, together with the numerical codes and to apply the General Rules for Interpretation and all section, chapter and subheading notes. Classification of goods {{is to be done}} objectively at the time of presentation of the goods to the tax authorities. The intentions of the importer or the descriptions of the goods in advertisements and manuals constitute inadmissible evidence. In the recent judgment of Smith Mining Equipment (Pty) Ltd v The Commissioner: South African Revenue Service 1 ("Smith Mining") the court, however, opined that it was not obliged to consider the notes referred to above, in the absence of evidence on use of the specific vehicles at the different locations allowed for in the Tariff Headings. The Court expected the importer to present evidence on use and relied on evidence from the manual, whilst it ignored the evidence that the importer presented structured along the applicable tariff notes. The court's approach clamped on the Additional Rules in the USA and the more liberal approach applied in Canada, but stands in conflict with the approach in the European Union and the trite principles from the South African case law.

40|$|The South African Revenue Service {{has since}} 2009 {{introduced}} “reference pricing” {{as a tool}} to detect undervaluation of customs values of imported clothing and textiles. The term “reference pricing” is not defined in the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 which is the legislation that governs the importation of goods into the Republic of South Africa. The mandate of the South African Revenue Service, amongst others, is to facilitate legitimate trade. By applying the reference pricing guidelines the South African Revenue Service will target all importers who declare customs values which are less than the reference price for a targeted <b>tariff</b> <b>heading</b> associated with an item of clothing or textile. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 is clear in that the transaction value which is the price paid or payable for the imported goods shall be the value used for customs duty purposes. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 also requires that the interpretation of the sections 65, 66 and 67 of the said Act shall be subject to the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Valuation Agreement). Part I of the Valuation Agreement deals with the rules for customs valuation. Article 17 of part 1 allows for customs administrations to satisfy themselves as to the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented for customs valuation purposes. The Technical Committee on Customs Valuation of the World Trade Organisation decided the following in so far as Article 17 of the aforesaid agreement is concerned: “ 1. When a declaration has been presented and where the customs administration has reason to doubt the truth or accuracy of the particulars or of documents produced in support of this declaration, the customs administration may ask the importer to provide further explanation, including documents or other evidence, that the declared value represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods, [...] ” It would appear that the South African Revenue Service is using reference prices {{as a tool to}} support its reason for doubting the truth or accuracy of the declared customs values. The indiscriminate use of reference pricing, it is submitted, affects legitimate trade adversely. This treatise provides an understanding of how the customs value should be determined in terms of the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 and the Valuation Agreement. It then provides a background to reference pricing and how reference pricing will be used to detect undervalued imports of clothing and textiles, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using reference pricing and a comparative analysis of the approach adopted by the Mexican Tax Administration Service in so far as the use of reference pricing is concerned. It was established that the reference price cannot replace the customs value of an imported clothing item as the customs value is based on the price actually paid or payable for it and not on some arbitrary or fictitious value. The reference price can only be used as a tool to identify importers that are possibly undervaluing the customs values. The disadvantages far outweigh the advantages of using reference pricing. The treatise further provides a background to the use of a valuation database as a risk assessment tool and compares this to the use of reference pricing. The use of reference pricing and its impact on trade facilitation is then discussed as well as whether the use of reference pricing is consistent with the risk management principles as discussed in the World Customs Organisation Risk Management Guide. It was established that the South African Revenue Service has not disclosed the basis of arriving at the reference price per <b>tariff</b> <b>heading</b> that it targets and the use of reference pricing is not sanctioned by any international guideline or agreement. It was also established that the use of reference pricing targets compliant importers unnecessarily and this practice goes against the principles of trade facilitation. The use of reference pricing can be used as a tool to detect undervalued imports of clothing but should not be used as a basis to stop every consignment of clothing simply because the customs value declared is less than the reference price. It should not be used as a stand-alone tool but rather enhanced further with the recommendations provided. In the final analysis, recommendations are provided which seek to enhance the reference pricing mechanism and to further identify and exclude compliant importers and limit the use of reference pricing to target non-compliant importers who undervalue the customs value of imported clothing and textile items...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the implications of}} the proliferation of ROO and sensitive list under SAFTA and bilateral FTAs among South Asian countries with particular reference to Nepal. In this regard this study makes a comparative assessment of different ROO arrangements under different bilateral FTAs as well as under SAFTA and BIMSTEC with a view to finding out the relative flexibility of SAFTA ROO vis-à-vis ROO in other regional and bilateral FTAs in South Asia. In addition, this study also explores the impact of the sensitive list maintained by India, under SAFTA, on the rise in exports from Nepal to India. The study uses a partial equilibrium model, namely the WITS/SMART model, to simulate different scenarios. It appears that when there is no ROO requirement and there is no sensitive list, the South Asian countries, under a full SAFTA scenario, are able to increase their exports within the region quite substantially. India appears to be the largest gainer from such scenario. However, Nepal also turns out to be important gainer as her exports to the South Asian region as whole increase by around US$ 90 million. Interestingly almost all of hear export increase would be targeted to Indian market (99 percent) under such a scenario. The analysis on trade creation and trade diversion for Nepal suggests that under a full SAFTA scenario, the trade creation effect (US$ 160821 thousand) will be higher than the negative trade diversion effect (US$ 19454 thousand) resulting in a net trade effect equal to US$ 141367. It also appears that the revenue loss and welfare gains for Nepal, resulting from such a scenario, would be US$ 90881 thousand and US$ 20486 thousand, In the second scenario, because of ROO (and assuming no sensitive list in India) 34 percent of the potential rise in exports from Nepal to India appears to be unrealized. In the third simulation, because of SAFTA sensitive list in India (and assuming no ROO) as high as 47 percent of the potential rise in exports from Nepal to India appears to be lost. In the final simulation, it appears that SAFTA ROO and sensitive list in India eats up more than two-third of the potential rise in exports from Nepal to India. It can therefore, be argued that since the value-additions of most of Nepal’s export products are very low, a 30 percent value-addition requirement under SAFTA as well as under the India-Nepal Trade Treaty would act as a significant barrier for her export expansion in India. This is also true for other LDCs in South Asia. Therefore, the problem of ROO will need to be resolved, {{keeping an eye on the}} manufacturing/processing capability of the LDCs. In addition, the other criteria of the ROO, namely the change in <b>tariff</b> <b>head,</b> under SAFTA should also be made consistent with those that are currently in force in the bilateral trade agreements within the SAARC region, which happen to be more liberal than the prevailing SAFTA rules. It also appears that SAFTA sensitive list is too stringent to allow significant rise in exports from the LDCs (in this case Nepal) to the Indian market. In almost all the cases, the products, which are included in the sensitive list, have significantly high export potentials. It can thus be concluded that if these sensitive lists are not phased out, there will be very little to gain from SAFTA by Nepal and other LDCs in this region. ...|$|R
