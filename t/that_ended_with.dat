5|$|After {{a pair of}} Tiger {{possessions}} <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> punts and an Alabama possession <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a lost fumble by McCarron, the Crimson Tide {{started their}} fourth scoring drive of the afternoon. The drive began with a 22-yard McCarron pass to Christion Jones and finished with a 15-yard Yeldon touchdown run. Immediately after Yeldon scored, the referees stopped the game temporarily and cleared the field due to lightning strikes {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the stadium. After a 40-minute stoppage, the game resumed with a Jeremy Shelley extra point and a Crimson Tide lead of 28–0. Missouri responded on the kickoff that ensued with their only touchdown of the afternoon on a 98-yard Marcus Murphy return that made the halftime score 28–7.|$|E
5|$|After its premiere, Eaten Alive {{was widely}} criticized for false advertising. One critic {{compared}} the special to The Mystery of Al Capone's Vaults—a television event <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a similarly disappointing outcome {{that did not}} meet promoted expectations.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{opened the}} third quarter with a six-play, 75-yard drive <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a ten-yard Lacy {{touchdown}} run. On the kickoff that ensued, Demetrius Hart forced a fumble by Arkansas' Dennis Johnson that was recovered by Foster at the Razorbacks' 27-yard line. Two plays later, Alabama led 38–0 after T. J. Yeldon scored on a one-yard run. Arkansas responded with their longest drive of the game; however, it ended when Deion Belue forced a Knile Davis fumble that was recovered by Nick Perry at the Alabama 20-yard line. With {{the majority of the}} offensive starters pulled from the game, the Crimson Tide reserves led Alabama on a 15-play, 80-yard drive <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a 12-yard Kenyan Drake touchdown run early in the fourth quarter. The final touchdown of the game was set up late in the game after Knile Davis lost his second fumble of the game on a Jeoffrey Pagan tackle that was recovered by Denzel Devall. Two plays later, backup quarterback Blake Sims made the final score 52–0 with his 27-yard quarterback sneak for a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|A 65-yard screen {{pass from}} Vince Evans to Walter Payton gave the Bears a 13–10 lead. The Buccaneers {{answered}} {{that with a}} drive <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> an eight-yard touchdown reception by Isaac Hagins. This score, with 5:08 left in the game, put the Buccaneers ahead of the Bears and left them as the only remaining undefeated team in the league. It was the third consecutive loss for the Bears. Jerry Eckwood also contributed a 61-yard touchdown run, the longest running play in Buccaneers history to that point. A broken wrist suffered in this game would contribute to Eckwood's diminished performance later in the season.|$|E
5|$|After sailing for the Clyde {{and back}} to New York in July on its first mercy mission, Blanche F. Sigman moved to its new homeport of Charleston in August 1944. Sailing later that month, the Sigman headed to the Mersey and Liverpool. In October the ship sailed for Gibraltar, Oran, and Leghorn. In December, it {{repeated}} its previous voyage but also stopped at Naples as well, eventually making its way back to Charleston in January 1945. Throughout 1945, the hospital ship made six transatlantic treks, visiting Marseille three times, Naples, Oran, Gibraltar, Milford Haven, Wales, Avonmouth, Cherbourg, and Horta. The Sigmans sixth mission {{of the year was}} a return trip to Cherbourg <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a return to its new homeport of New York.|$|E

Florida State also began the year {{under a new}} head coach. Bobby Bowden, who retired after 57years as a head coach, 34 at Florida State and 33consecutive winning seasons, was {{replaced}} by Jimbo Fisher. Immediately before the 2010 season began, Bowden claimed he had been pushed out as head coach, causing a stir before Florida State's first game.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Rubinstein {{handed over}} the {{directorship}} of the Conservatory to Zaremba. Later that year he resigned his conductorship of the Russian Music Society orchestra, {{to be replaced by}} Balakirev. Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda to the society. In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a request for a word of encouragement should the Dances not be performed.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the {{law school}} {{established}} the Center for Dispute Resolution, an alternative dispute resolution program. In 1992, the Collins Legal Center went through an award-winning renovation and expansion <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a dedication ceremony and speech by former U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. In her dedication speech, O'Connor advocated for civility among those in the legal profession and for avoiding personal attacks among lawyers. In December 2005, the school's moot courtroom was used for a real civil trial after the Marion County Courthouse was damaged the previous month.|$|E

5|$|In his {{freshman}} season, Gragg played in all 12 of the Arkansas Razorbacks' games {{as the team}} finished with a 5–7 win–loss record. During the second game of the season, against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks, Gragg caught a 25-yard pass from quarterback Casey Dick on fourth down and one to continue a drive <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> the game-winning touchdown. The catch was Gragg's only reception in 2008. After he dislocated his ankle in a preseason practice, {{he was given a}} medical redshirt and did not play for the 2009 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} home conference {{game of the}} 2013 season, Alabama shutout the Ole Miss Rebels 25–0 at Tuscaloosa. After the Crimson Tide defense forced a punt on the Rebels' first possession, AJ McCarron led the Alabama offense on an 11 play, 61-yard drive <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a 3–0 lead after a 28-yard Cade Foster field goal. Each team played strong defense for the {{remainder}} of the quarter with an Eddie Jackson interception of a Laquon Treadwell sideline pass for Alabama being the major play. Alabama then extended their lead in the second quarter to 9–0 at halftime after Foster connected on field goals of 53 and 42-yards.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 2010, Butler faced top-seeded Syracuse. The Bulldogs {{got off to}} a good start, {{jumping out}} to a 12–1 lead and a 35–25 halftime advantage. Syracuse rallied in the second half, taking its first lead of the game, 40–39, off a Wes Johnson three-pointer. Stevens called timeout and Butler regained the lead on its next possession, {{stopping}} the run. At the 5:32 mark, Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a dunk and 54–50 lead. Stevens again called time out and re-focused the team. Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes, taking a 60–54 lead with 0:59 to go. Butler held on to win 63–59, advancing to the Elite Eight {{for the first time in}} school history.|$|E

5|$|The 1995 Sugar Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 1995 in the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. Defense {{dominated}} {{in the first}} quarter as neither team scored during the game's first fourpossessions. Late in the quarter, however, Texas' offense, led by quarterback James Brown, put together an eight-play, 72-yard drive <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a four-yard touchdown pass. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Texas led 7–0. Early in the second quarter, Texas added another three points with a 52-yard field goal that came off of an interception. But the Hokies began to fight back. Brian Still returned a Texas punt 60yards for Tech's first points of the game, and at halftime, the Longhorns' lead was cut to just threepoints.|$|E
5|$|The North Carolina Tar Heels {{began the}} 1997 college {{football}} season having gone 102 in 1996, a year <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a 2013 win over West Virginia in the 1997 Gator Bowl. Hopes were {{high for the}} Tar Heels heading into the 1997 season, with some writers and fans picking North Carolina {{to have a chance}} to compete for the national championship. The Tar Heels bore out those hopes in the first game of the season, beating Big Ten opponent Indiana, 236.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Volunteers {{entered the}} 2009 season {{following}} a 2008 campaign <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a bowl-ineligible 5-7 record. After the 2008 season ended, Tennessee fired head coach Phillip Fulmer and replaced him with Lane Kiffin, who promised {{to turn the}} program around. Kiffin made an offseason splash by breaking the social norms among SEC head football coaches and violating a handful of NCAA rules. In a season-opening win over Western Kentucky, Kiffin appeared {{to have made a}} difference for Tennessee, as the Volunteers had their largest margin of victory in nine years.|$|E

5|$|The {{cities of}} Ionia {{remained}} independent {{until they were}} conquered by the Lydians of western Asia Minor. The Lydian king Alyattes II attacked Miletus, a conflict <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a treaty of alliance between Miletus and Lydia, that meant that Miletus would have internal autonomy but follow Lydia in foreign affairs. At this time, the Lydians were also {{in conflict with the}} Median Empire, and the Milesians sent an army to aid the Lydians in this conflict. Eventually a peaceable settlement was established between the Medes and the Lydians, with the Halys River set up as the border between the kingdoms. The famous Lydian king Croesus succeeded his father Alyattes in around 560 BC and set about conquering the other Greek city states of Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Smith fumbling the {{football}} with Oakland in scoring position. New York defensive end Gerry Philbin recovered the football at the Jets' 3-yard line {{setting up a}} 97-yard drive, consisting entirely of two Namath passes to Don Maynard, who was covered by Raiders' rookie cornerback George Atkinson. The 50-yard touchdown pass followed a 47-yard throw, and gave the Jets a 26–22 lead. Turner added another field goal to the Jets' total, giving them a 29–22 lead. The Raiders promptly responded with Lamonica orchestrating an 88-yard drive <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> a 22-yard pass to receiver Fred Biletnikoff with less than four minutes remaining in the game, tying the contest.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} Orange Bowl after a 9–4 season that culminated in a 30–12 victory in the 2008 ACC Championship Game.
