Once outside I got into {{conversation}} with the Prince's crew. Among other things <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> their princely coachman had recently made his radio operator stand to attention in the plane and confined him to his quarters for three days because he (the radio operator) had lost his screen [...] during a mission." ...|$|E

Less {{than a week}} later, {{the occupied}} government proclaimed that all Jews in Belgium would {{have to wear a}} yellow badge on their clothing, and in July the Gestapo began raids on Jewish premises, followed by deportations of Jews to Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps, resulting in around 32,000 Belgian Jews being killed. Hergé later recalled: [...] "I saw very few Jews wearing the yellow star, but finally I did see some. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> some Jews were gone; that people had come for them and sent them away. I didn't want to believe it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Since {{joining the}} Raiders, Brown had a {{complicated}} {{relationship with the}} Oakland Raiders and late owner Al Davis. During a 2009 interview with Sportsradiointerview.com Brown commented on his former boss:“Meeting Al (Davis) was pretty unique. I found out five or ten minutes after my first practice there that he hated African-American athletes from Notre Dame. And <b>they</b> literally <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that.</b> <b>They</b> literally <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> because we’re known for using our education more than our athletic ability {{that he thought that}} I would be one of these guys that would basically take the money and run. I don’t know if that was a ploy to get me amped up, but it certainly worked." ...|$|R
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the 2012–13 season, Bridges signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Bury Town on a free transfer. On joining Bury Town, Bridges said — [...] "I'm good friends with Adam Tann and Craig Parker and they couldn't say enough good things about the club. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the players are really well looked after and the club is full of good honest people". He left Bury Town in December 2013 due to the club's {{financial}} problems, and subsequently joined Brackley Town of the National League North in January 2014. Bridges made his debut for Brackley on 11 January 2014, coming on as an 87th-minute substitute in a 31 victory over Gainsborough Trinity.

[...] My productions were a collection of haphazard observations, put together no doubt {{against the backdrop of}} what I had read. [...] Every beginning author does the same. [...] To be sure, this kind of work was to me a great mortification. [...] Then I began asking older authors, and <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then , brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: [...] 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?' [...] After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art. [...] I expect that it will contain some fairly new things." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{they had}} been refused medical care and had other {{requests}} unanswered and that other high risk prisoners had been moved out of container city to other prisons but not them and they felt it was unfair.

6000|$|... "I believe," [...] {{the girl}} said, [...] "from what <b>they</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> I {{was taken in}} revenge. My father had charged one of the gypsies with theft, and the man having been hung, the others, to avenge themselves, carried me off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no, I don't know <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> but <b>that's</b> neither here nor there. I know, without that, that {{at dinner}} yesterday, Angelo was as tired as a dog, and yet Luigi wouldn't lend him the legs to go up-stairs {{and take a}} nap with." ...|$|R

2500|$|<b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it {{was going}} to be a trilogy. [...] What {{happened}} was that all of the people that made Streets of Fire left Universal Studios and went to 20th Century Fox. It was made at Universal, so they owned the rights to the story. [...] So it was left behind. I was told by Joel Silver that the sequel was going to be set in the snow, and the following film would be set in the desert.|$|E

[...] But the White Chief is not as the big men in out tribes. [...] He wore no plumes and no decorations. [...] He had none of his young men (warriors) with him, and only that I heard him talk he would have been to me as other white men. [...] But my brother Mr. Gladstone came to see me in my lodge as a friend, and I was glad to see the White Chief, for though my tongue was tied in his {{presence}} my heart was in full friendship. [...] After he went away <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> half of his great nation of white men have adopted him as their chief.

6000|$|... "It isn't {{much of a}} story," [...] Guy began, {{making a}} desperate effort. [...] "It was {{my first visit to}} Paris, and I lost my head a bit.

"Allan, {{in the old}} days, mariners who had sailed the {{northern}} seas, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> therein amidst mist and storm float mountains of ice, shed from dizzy cliffs which are hid in darkness where no sun shines. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> also <b>that</b> whereas above the ocean's breast appears but a blue and dazzling point, sunk beneath it is oft a whole frozen isle, invisible to man.|$|R
60|$|Real estate! That's nothing! Why <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{fifteen years}} ago I could have had all sorts of things,--trunk line railways, sugar refineries, silver mines,--any of them for a song.

60|$|We were separated, a {{few days}} afterward, by the {{distressing}} news which reached me {{of the state of}} my brother's health. I went at once to his house in the country.

60|$|That was the end, but <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{afterwards}} <b>that,</b> {{when the}} great pyre had burned out, in it was found the head of Ki looking like a red-hot stone.

60|$|Harry (Turns to Bessie at once; easy manner). I'd like to {{know about}} this swindle that's going to be sprung on him. I didn't mean to startle the old man.

6000|$|... "What about George?", he said. [...] "I {{met him in}} {{the hall}} as I was coming in, but he ran off in the very deuce of a hurry. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at Epsom <b>that</b> he was hard hit." ...|$|R
