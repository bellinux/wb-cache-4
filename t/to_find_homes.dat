5|$|Through {{his work}} on behalf of the League of Nations, Nansen helped to {{establish}} the principle of international responsibility for refugees. Immediately after his death the League set up the Nansen International Office for Refugees, a semi-autonomous body under the League's authority, to continue his work. The Nansen Office faced great difficulties, in part arising from the large numbers of refugees from the European dictatorships during the 1930s. Nevertheless, it secured the agreement of 14 countries (including a reluctant Great Britain) to the Refugee Convention of 1933. It also helped to repatriate 10,000 Armenians to Yerevan in Soviet Armenia, and <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>homes</b> for a further 40,000 in Syria and Lebanon. In 1938, the year in which it was superseded by a wider-ranging body, the Nansen Office was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E

25|$|A year later, Rudolph {{goes out}} to the {{reindeer}} games where all the other new fawns will be inspected by Santa and learn to pull his sleigh. During flight practice, Rudolph becomes acquainted with a beautiful doe named Clarice who tells him he's cute, which causes Rudolph to fly. However, while engaging in celebratory play with the other bucks, Rudolph's fake nose pops off, causing the others to make fun of him. Rudolph is then told he can no longer play in the reindeer games. Walking away, Rudolph meets up with Hermey, an elf who ran away from Santa's workshop because {{he wanted to be a}} dentist instead of making toys, and they decide to run away together. The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius, who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold. After escaping the Abominable Snow Monster of the North on an iceberg, the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler, a winged lion named King Moonracer. The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>homes</b> for the unwanted toys. However, Rudolph awakens in the night and leaves the island on his own due to his concern that his nose, which attracts the Abominable, will endanger his friends.|$|E

2500|$|Consistent in {{his view}} that [...] "in exerting {{political}} pressure at home, one must always be cautious and tactful or risk incurring the hostility of influential diplomatic figures," [...] neither Goldmann, nor the Jewish leadership around him, mounted a public campaign against the American immigration quota system, even as European Jewry were seeking refuge from Nazism. Some American Jews, including Louis Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter, did try their hands at quiet diplomacy with some success, such that the quotas were being filled by 1939. The worsening of the refugee problem after the Anschluss in 1938, however, created additional pressure, leading President Roosevelt to call for an international conference known as the Evian Conference, which met in France in July of that year. The conference goal was <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>homes</b> {{for the hundreds of}} thousands of displaced Jews. Goldman attended as an observer for the World Jewish Congress. Of the 32 nations that attended, only the Dominican Republic agreed to accept additional refugees.|$|E
2500|$|Harlem {{suffers from}} {{unemployment}} rates generally {{more than twice}} as high than the New York average and high mortality rates as well. In both cases, the numbers for men have been consistently worse than the numbers for women. Unemployment and poverty in the neighborhood resisted private and governmental initiatives to ameliorate them. During the Great Depression, unemployment in Harlem went past 20% and people were being evicted from their homes. In the 1960s, uneducated blacks could find jobs more easily than educated ones could, confounding efforts {{to improve the lives of}} people who lived in the neighborhood through education. Land owners took advantage of the neighborhood and offered apartments to the lower-class families for cheaper rent but in lower class conditions. As of 1999, 179,000 housing units were available for the citizens of Harlem. Housing activists in Harlem state that, even after residents were given vouchers for the Section 8 housing that was being placed, many were not able to live there and had <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>homes</b> elsewhere or become homeless. Infant mortality was 124 per thousand in 1928 (12.4%) [...] By 1940, infant mortality in Harlem was 5% (one infant in 20 would die), and the death rate from disease generally was twice that of the rest of New York. Tuberculosis was the main killer, and four times as prevalent among Harlem citizens than among the rest of New York's population.|$|E

60|$|The girls sat together, {{with the}} heavy basket on their knees, and ate while they gazed out at the cool, dark ridges. The train clattered slowly on, {{apparently}} over a road that was all curves. And it was supper-time for everybody in that crowded coach. If Helen {{had not been so}} absorbed by the great, wild mountain-land she would have had more interest in the passengers. As it was she saw them, and was amused and thoughtful at the men and women and a few children in the car, all middle-class people, poor and hopeful, traveling out there to the New West <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>homes.</b> It was splendid and beautiful, this fact, yet it inspired a brief and inexplicable sadness. From the train window, that world of forest and crag, with its long bare reaches between, seemed so lonely, so wild, so unlivable. How endless the distance! For hours and miles upon miles no house, no hut, no Indian tepee! It was amazing, the length and breadth of this beautiful land. And Helen, who loved brooks and running streams, saw no water at all.|$|E
