5|$|Ann Rivers (born 1968) is an American politician, who {{has served}} as a Republican member of the Washington State Senate since she was {{appointed}} to represent the 18th district in 2011, upon the resignation of Joe Zarelli. Prior to this {{she was a member of}} the Washington House of Representatives. In her first full term, a Majority Coalition Caucus was formed, taking control away from <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state senate. Rivers was appointed to be majority whip for the session, a rare appointment for a freshman senator. She won re-election for another four-year term in 2012, with 67% of the vote against 32% for her opponent, Ralph Schmidt.|$|E
5|$|His {{popularity}} in the Northern states declined sharply after he supported the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which nullified the Missouri Compromise, while many whites in the South continued to support him. Passage of the act led to violent conflict over the expansion of slavery in the American West. Pierce's administration was further damaged when several of his diplomats issued the Ostend Manifesto, calling for the annexation of Cuba, a document which was roundly criticized. Although Pierce fully expected to be renominated by <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1856 presidential election, he was abandoned by his party and his bid failed. His reputation in the North suffered further during the Civil War as he became a vocal critic of President Abraham Lincoln. Pierce, {{who had been a}} heavy drinker for much of his life, died of severe cirrhosis of the liver in 1869.|$|E
5|$|Morehead was {{nominated}} for lieutenant governor at his party's nominating convention in Baltimore, Maryland in 1831, and was elected on a split ticket with Democratic governor John Breathitt. He ascended to the governorship upon Breathitt's death in 1834. Saddled with a shortened term, Morehead {{was not able to}} formulate a significant legislative agenda, and stuck to the politically safe issue of internal improvements during his term. When his party changed its name to the Whig Party and wrested control of the General Assembly from <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1834, Morehead hosted the new party's first nominating convention in Frankfort.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the term}} of U.S. Senator Dolliver would expire in March 1907, Dolliver was up for {{re-election}} by the General Assembly in January 1907.

25|$|Evanston {{was heavily}} Republican in voter {{identification}} {{from the time}} of the Civil War up to the 1960s. Nixon carried Evanston in the 1968 presidential election. The city began trending Democratic in the 1960s, though it did not elect a Democratic mayor until 1993. The city swung particularly heavily to <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, along with many other Chicago suburbs, and now almost exclusively identifies with Democrats in elections on all levels of government.|$|E
25|$|Jewish American {{communities}} {{tend to be}} a stronghold for the Democratic Party, {{with more}} than 70% of Jewish voters having cast their ballots for <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2004 and 2006 elections. Al Gore received 79% of the Jewish votes in 2000, and Barack Obama won about 77% of the Jewish vote in 2008. Support tends to vary among specific sectarian groups. For example, only 13% of Orthodox Jews supported Barack Obama in 2008 while around 60% of Conservative Jews and Reform Jews did so. A 2010 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 60% of self-described Jews identified as Democratic or leaning towards the party, compared to 33% with those feelings towards Republicans.|$|E

25|$|They {{convinced}} Lieutenant Governor Mahlon Manson {{to resign}} from office, thereby removing anyone to easily take over the governorship should Gray have to resign. They used the issue to prevent his name from being entered as a candidate. Gray {{decided to have a}} Lieutenant Governor elected in the mid-term election to fill the seat, removing the issue, and allowing him to resign and accept the candidacy. The election was held and Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate refused to accept the election, and declared it unconstitutional and elected Democrat Alonzo Green Smith to serve as Lieutenant Governor. The Senate Republicans were furious and began making a commotion in the opening prayer of the session. They went ahead and had Robertson sworn in but the Democrats filed a court suit to prevent him from being seated.|$|E
25|$|At the 1940 state Democratic Party Convention, Schricker won the {{nomination}} for governor {{on the second}} ballot, winning {{the majority of the}} delegates from the rural parts of the state. Opinion had turned strongly against <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last year, primarily over welfare spending. To win the election, Schricker focused on his personal popularity rather than his connection to the party. He won the election by less than 4,000 votes and was the only Democrat elected in any statewide election. Republicans swept to power and took strong majorities in the General Assembly {{for the first time in}} 15 years. Part of the Republican platform had been to remove the state from the federal welfare system, revoke the massive increase in power granted to the governor by the Executive Reorganization Act, and cut spending and taxes.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 {{elections}} saw {{a return}} to power by <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Michigan State House of Representatives and the retention of Republican control over the Michigan Senate. The partisan division of power in Michigan's state government led to a showdown between Granholm and lawmakers over the FY2008 state budget {{that resulted in a}} four-hour shutdown of nonessential state services in the early morning of October 1, 2007, until a budget was passed and signed. The budget cut services, froze state spending in areas such as the arts, increased the state income tax, and created a new set of service taxes on a variety of businesses, e.g.,ski lifts and interior design and landscaping companies, to address a state budget shortfall. As a result of the controversial budget, some taxpayer and business advocates called for a recall campaign against Granholm and lawmakers who voted for the tax increases.|$|E

25|$|Many historians {{argue that}} the Compromise {{played a major role}} in postponing the American Civil War for a decade, while the Northwest was growing more wealthy and more populous and was being brought into closer {{relations}} with the Northeast. During that decade, the Whig Party had completely broken down, to be replaced with the new Republican Party dominant in the North and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South. Others {{argue that the}} Compromise only made more obvious the pre-existing sectional divisions and laid the groundwork for future conflict. They view the Fugitive Slave Law ad helping to polarize the US, as shown in the enormous reaction to Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law aroused feelings of bitterness in the North. Furthermore, the Compromise of 1850 led to a breakdown in the spirit of compromise in the United States in the antebellum period, directly before the Civil War. The Compromise exemplifies that spirit, but the deaths of influential senators who worked on the compromise, primarily Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, contributed to the feeling of increasing disparity between the North and South.|$|E
25|$|While {{only five}} Democratic presidential nominees have carried Indiana since 1900, 11 Democrats were elected {{governor}} during that time. Before Mitch Daniels became governor in 2005, Democrats {{had held the}} office for 16consecutive years. Indiana elects two senators and nine representatives to Congress. The state has 11electoral votes in presidential elections. Seven of the districts favor the Republican Party according to the CPVI rankings; there are currently seven Republicans serving as representatives and two Democrats. Historically, Republicans have been strongest in the eastern and central portions of the state, while Democrats have been strongest in the northwestern part of the state. Occasionally, certain counties {{in the southern part}} of the state will vote Democratic. Marion County, Indiana's most populous county, supported the Republican candidates from 1968 to 2000, before backing <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 elections. Indiana's second most populous county, Lake County, strongly supports the Democratic party and has not voted for a Republican since 1972. In 2005, the Bay Area Center for Voting Research rated the most liberal and conservative cities in the United States on voting statistics in the 2004presidential election, based on 237cities with populations of more than 100,000. Five Indiana cities were mentioned in the study. On the liberal side, Gary was ranked second and South Bend came in at 83. Among conservative cities, Fort Wayne was 44th, Evansville was 60th and Indianapolis was 82nd on the list.|$|E
500|$|In November 2008, in {{response}} to the ongoing economic downturn, Corzine proposed an economic recovery package consisting of additional massive spending, accelerated capital improvement spending and reforms and cuts to the corporate income tax. [...] As of December 2008 many elements of the plan had been approved by <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NJ Legislature. On January 2, 2009, Corzine joined the governors of four other states in urging the federal government to provide $1trillion in aid to the country's 50 state governments to help pay for education, welfare and infrastructure as states struggle with steep budget deficits amid a deepening recession.|$|E

500|$|McEwen easily won {{re-election}} in every race save his last and {{was seen as}} unbeatable in his district. However, Ohio lost two seats in the 1990 reapportionment. The Democrats and Republicans in the Ohio General Assembly struck a deal to eliminate one Democratic and one Republican district, as one congressman from each party was expected to retire. The Republican expected to retire was Clarence E. Miller, a thirteen-term veteran called [...] "chairman of the caucus of the obscure" [...] for his invisibility on Capitol Hill. However, Miller surprised everyone by deciding to run for a fourteenth term. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Statehouse would not reconsider the deal and Miller's Tenth District was obliterated.|$|E
500|$|In 1836, Johnson was the Democratic {{nominee for}} {{vice-president}} on a ticket with Martin Van Buren. Campaigning with the slogan [...] "Rumpsey Dumpsey, Rumpsey Dumpsey, Colonel Johnson killed Tecumseh", Johnson fell one {{short of the}} electoral votes needed to secure his election. Virginia's delegation to the Electoral College refused to endorse Johnson, abstaining instead. However, {{he was elected to}} the office by the Senate. Johnson proved such a liability for <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1836 election that they refused to renominate him for vice-president in 1840. President Van Buren campaigned for re-election without a running mate. He lost to William Henry Harrison, a Whig. Johnson tried to return to public office but was defeated. He finally was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1850, but he died on November 19, 1850, just two weeks into his term.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra held differing {{political}} views throughout his life. His mother, Dolly Sinatra (1896–1977), was a Democratic Party ward leader. Sinatra met President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, and subsequently heavily campaigned for <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1944 presidential election. According to Jo Carroll Silvers, in his younger years Sinatra had [...] "ardent liberal" [...] sympathies, and was [...] "so concerned about poor {{people that he}} was always quoting Henry Wallace". He was outspoken about racism, particularly toward blacks and Italians, from early on. In November 1945 Sinatra was invited by the mayor of Gary, Indiana, to try to settle a strike by white students of Froebel High School against the [...] "Pro-Negro" [...] policies of the new principal. His comments, while praised by liberal publications, led to accusations by some {{that he was a}} Communist, which he strongly denied. In the 1948 presidential election, Sinatra actively campaigned for President Harry S. Truman. In 1952 and 1956, he also campaigned for Adlai Stevenson.|$|E
