5|$|After Selvo was deposed, it {{took several}} years for Venice {{to recover from the}} defeat at Corfu and for the Venetians to fully realize the {{immediate}} impact of his actions as Doge. When Venice provided military aid to the Byzantine Empire, they were awarded a Golden Bull by Emperor Alexios I that would provide the Venetians a great economic and strategic advantage throughout the eastern empire for centuries. According to the terms of the decree, annual grants were awarded to all the churches in Venice (including a special gift to the coffers of St Mark's), the Republic was granted whole sections of the Golden Horn in Constantinople, and Venetian merchants were given a full exemption from all <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>duties</b> throughout the territories of the Byzantine Empire. Not only did this aid the rapid economic growth of Venice in the next few centuries by giving Venetian goods a significant price advantage over other foreign goods, but it initiated a long period of artistic, cultural, and military relationships between Venice and Byzantium. This combination of eastern and western cultural influences made Venice a symbolic gateway between the east and the west in Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Magnus {{was opposed}} by his cousin Haakon Magnusson, son of King Olaf's brother and {{short-lived}} co-ruler King Magnus Haraldsson, who claimed half the kingdom. Haakon was proclaimed king in the Uplands {{and at the}} Øyrating, the thing of Trøndelag (in central Norway). According to Førsund, Haakon {{took control of the}} entire portion of the kingdom once held by his father (also including the Frostating—the thing of Hålogaland in northern Norway—and the Gulating—the thing of western Norway). Haakon secured support by relieving farmers of <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>duties</b> (including taxes dating back to the Danish rule of Sweyn Knutsson during the early 1030s), while Magnus pursued costly policies and demanded lengthy military service. After Magnus settled at the new royal estate in Nidaros for the winter of 1094–95, Haakon also travelled to the city and took up residence at the old royal estate. Their relationship became increasingly tense, culminating when Haakon saw Magnus' longships fully rigged at sea. Haakon summoned the Øyrating in response, leading Magnus to sail southwards. Haakon attempted to intercept Magnus by travelling south to Viken by land (over the mountains of Dovrefjell), but he died unexpectedly while hunting in February 1095.|$|E

25|$|By the 1770s Pombal had {{effectively}} neutralised the Inquisition, {{consequently the}} new Christians, still {{the majority of}} the educated and liberal middle class {{of the city and the}} country, were freed from their legal restrictions and finally allowed access to the high government positions previously the exclusive monopoly of the 'pureblood' aristocracy. Industry was supported in a somewhat dirigiste, but vigorous, manner, several royal factories being established in Lisbon and other cities that thrived. After the Pombaline period there were twenty new plants for every one that had previously existed. The various state-imposed <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>duties,</b> which had proven burdensome to trade, were abolished in 1755. Throughout the implementation of these initiatives by the Junta do Comércio, Pombal relied on donations and loans made by the merchants and industrialists of Lisbon.|$|E
2500|$|The bill {{outlined}} three proposals: {{the first}} was full devolution or 'devolution max', suggesting that the Scottish Parliament should be responsible for [...] "all laws, <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>duties</b> in Scotland", {{with the exception of}} [...] "defence and foreign affairs; financial regulation, monetary policy and the currency", which would be retained by the British government. The second proposal outlined Calman-type fiscal reform, gaining the additional powers and responsibilities of setting a Scottish rate of income tax that could vary by up to 10p in the pound compared {{with the rest of the}} UK, setting the rate of stamp duty land tax and [...] "other minor taxes", and introducing new taxes in Scotland with the agreement of the UK Parliament, and finally, [...] "limited power to borrow money". The third proposal was for full independence.|$|E
2500|$|Radstadt. One of {{the best}} {{preserved}} walled towns in Austria. The area was originally settled in the 7th century by the Bavarians and in the 13th century the Archbishop of Salzburg founded a new town partly replacing the older settlement of Altenmarkt. It was in an important strategic position on the boundary of the Archbishop’s territories with the Duchy of Carinthia. On July 27, 1289, Archbishop von Hohenegg issued a charter giving the citizens of Radstadt - ‘Cives in Rastatt’ - those same town rights, privileges and liberties as were enjoyed by Salzburg, and exempted them from all <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>duties</b> {{for a period of}} ten years, with the exception of those expenses which were necessary for the fortification and defence of the town. This suggests that the town walls were built at this time. The settlement has a grid plan, originally with E and W gates and a rectangular N-S marketplace. In the 16th century the Archbishop refortified the town to counter the envisaged Turkish threat. Large round towers, three of which survive were added to the corners and a wide ditch on the N and W. An early 18th-century painting shows the wall to have been strengthened with buttresses, projecting gun emplacements added to the parapet walkway and lower casement slots for gun positions. [...] The town still maintains its uniformed ‘Bürgergarde’ militia ...|$|E
