500|$|Lovering {{appeared}} in the 2006 documentary loudQUIETloud, which covered the Pixies' 2004 reunion tour. His father died midway during the tour, and Lovering began drinking heavily as a result. According to Thompson, Lovering [...] "messed {{up a couple of}} songs" [...] during a number of live shows. [...] "It was all caught on film", said Thompson, [...] "but they re-edited this to look like it happened in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> tour and it looked like this whole tour careened into this drunken stupor with David. It really wasn't like that at all". He toured with the Pixies throughout 2005 and 2006, while performing at the Magic Castle on Friday nights with The Unholy Three. In 2007, Lovering played a benefit concert for Wally Ingram as part of The Martinis. Later that year, he formed a new band called The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with Los Angeles musicians Amit Itelman and Oscar Rey.|$|E

2500|$|I wouldn't say we're {{overwhelming}} favourites but I {{think we}} generally start as favourites against most teams at home.

The Windies haven't played any one-day cricket for a while and we're in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> season, so I suppose we are the team to beat.

2500|$|The Yuledays are {{the days}} that signify {{the end of an}} old year and the {{beginning}} of a new one, so 2 Yule is the first day of the year.

In leap years (every fourth year except centennial years) a day is added after Mid-year's Day called Overlithe. [...] All these days are placed outside of any month. These days are primarily holidays and feast days. Mid-year's Day is meant to correspond to the summer solstice, which Tolkien describes as being 10 days earlier than <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> day <b>of</b> <b>our</b> year. However, since then the summer solstice has shifted slightly so it falls on a different date now, rendering the difference between Mid-year's Day and <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> day <b>of</b> <b>our</b> year eleven days, instead of ten.|$|R
