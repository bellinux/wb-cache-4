5|$|The aim of some later novels {{has been}} to {{concentrate}} as much on local colour as on the story. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> of William Percival Crozier's historical romance The Fates Are Laughing (1945), set during the fall of Sejanus and the reign of Caligula, written by a classicist with an eye for detail.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, June 28, Union and Confederate soldiers clashed again {{near the}} Golding house. Jones {{suspected that the}} Federals near the house were withdrawing, and authorized Toombs to perform a reconnaissance-in-force to ascertain whether <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> However, Toombs turned the reconnaissance operation into a full engagement and advanced with some of Anderson's men. Before he could be countermanded, the Confederates had already been repulsed by the VI Corps.|$|E
5|$|He adopted {{his crew}} cut hair style while {{serving in the}} United States Marine Corps. Carey has had {{refractive}} surgery to correct his vision and therefore did not really require glasses (any glasses he wore in public were merely props to help the audience recognize him). However, while <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for several years, on the May 17, 2006, episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! he revealed that when he turned 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals. As of 2007, Carey resides in Los Angeles and New York City.|$|E
60|$|Now such an {{argument}} {{is not hard}} to follow; and if it is granted that its premisses <b>are</b> <b>true</b> in fact, no one will deny that the conclusion must also <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> But it depends for its truth upon an instance of a general logical principle. The logical principle is as follows: 'Suppose it known that if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then that <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> Suppose it also known that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then it follows that that is true.' When it is the case that if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> that <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> we shall say that this 'implies' that, and that that 'follows from' this. Thus our principle states that if this implies that, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then that <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> In other words, 'anything implied by a <b>true</b> proposition <b>is</b> true', or 'whatever follows from a <b>true</b> proposition <b>is</b> true'.|$|R

5|$|In June 1963, Kenyatta {{met with}} the Tanganyikan President Julius Nyerere and Ugandan President Milton Obote in Nairobi. The trio {{discussed}} the possibility of merging their three nations into a single East African Federation, agreeing {{that this would be}} accomplished {{by the end of the}} year. Privately, Kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 came around the federation had not come to pass. In May 1964, Kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation. He publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been a ruse to hasten the pace of Kenyan independence from Britain, but Nyerere denied that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E
5|$|Little of <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> but at {{the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E
5|$|According to Ammianus, a deserter {{informed}} Chnodomar that Julian had 13,000 {{men with}} him at Saverne. But this leaves {{open the possibility that}} he may have summoned more to join him for the battle. It is possible that Severus' division was additional, as it is stated that while Julian was at Saverne, Severus' men occupied a separate camp near Barbatio's army. Libanius implies that Julian had 15,000 men under his command. If <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> the additional 2,000 may have been Severus' division. Also, Julian may have been able to call on some limitanei units to join his comitatus for the campaign. Zosimus states that on arrival in Gaul, Julian set about a major recruitment drive. This would mainly have aimed at reconstituting limitanei regiments that had largely dissolved during the years of anarchy. Julian's force may therefore have numbered somewhat more than 15,000.|$|E

5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> but ignored the fact {{that she would have to}} return to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating that she needed to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E
5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} {{at a pace}} that would eventually catch up with the United States and Western Europe. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West came to an abrupt end, and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output per head of Western Europe and a little more than one third that of the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{was highly}} {{successful}} at the Rutchenkovo mine, and in mid-1922 {{he was offered}} the directorship of the nearby Pastukhov mine. However, he refused the offer, seeking to be assigned to the newly established technical college (tekhnikum) in Yuzovka, though his superiors were reluctant to let him go. As he had only four years of formal schooling, he applied to the training program (rabfak) attached to the tekhnikum {{that was designed to}} bring undereducated students to high-school level, a prerequisite for entry into the tekhnikum. While enrolled in the rabfak, Khrushchev continued his work at the Rutchenkovo mine. One of his teachers later described him as a poor student. He was more successful in advancing in the Communist Party; soon after his admission to the rabfak in August 1922, he was appointed party secretary of the entire tekhnikum, and {{became a member of the}} bureau—the governing council—of the party committee for the town of Yuzovka (renamed Stalino in 1924). He briefly joined supporters of Leon Trotsky against those of Joseph Stalin over the question of party democracy. All of these activities left him with little time for his schoolwork, and while he later claimed to have finished his rabfak studies, it is unclear whether <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E

25|$|On November 9, 2012, it was {{reported}} that Harvick would drive for Stewart-Haas Racing beginning in 2014 once his longtime contract expired with Richard Childress Racing. When Harvick was later asked if <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> at the Cup race in Phoenix, he refused to give a definite answer. He was repeatedly asked by reporters in victory lane at Phoenix and at the Championship buffet in Las Vegas, but he continued to refuse to answer.|$|E
25|$|While <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> in the past, newer {{versions}} of the EMIT bioassay are much less sensitive to ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, etc.), and this has become relatively uncommon as of 1998, {{at least in the}} United States. However, abnormally high doses of ibuprofen can still potentially cause a false positive in not only THC but other drugs such as barbiturates. Nonetheless, this no longer works as an alibi for THC since GC/MS can now distinguish between the two.|$|E

25|$|A Strontium isotope {{analysis}} of 86 people from Bell Beaker graves in Bavaria suggests that 18–25% of all graves were occupied {{by people who}} came from a considerable distance outside the area. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> of {{children as well as}} adults, indicative of some significant migration wave.

25|$|This {{practice}} {{may have}} arisen {{out of a}} Jewish prohibition of singing songs of the non-Jews (due to the secular character and lyrics of the songs). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> {{in the case of}} Arabic songs, whereby Jews were allowed to listen to the songs, but not allowed to sing them with the text. In order to bypass the problem, many composers, throughout the centuries, wrote new lyrics to the songs with the existing melodies, in order not to violate the tradition of not singing non-Jewish songs.|$|E

25|$|In {{early works}} Tolkien {{stated that the}} names of the {{prominent}} Easterlings were given to them by the Elves, and are thus from Sindarin language. The meanings proposed for the names as they were then are: Bór 'faithful vassal', Borthandos 'faithful intelligent (one)', Borlas 'faithful joy', Boromir 'faithful jewel'; Ulfang 'hideous beard', Uldor 'hideous ruler', Ulfast 'hideous shaggy hair' and Ulwarth 'hideous betrayer'. Later, however, Tolkien changed both the names and conception, assuming that all {{the names of the}} Easterlings are uninterpretable in languages of Eldar or Edain (<b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> of Brodda even in early texts).|$|E
25|$|Before this {{landmark}} case, pre-trial involuntary {{commitment of}} incompetent individuals often meant lengthy or even lifetime confinement in a maximum security institution with little concern for treatment. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> {{even though they}} were neither tried for or convicted of a crime. In this case, the Court for the first time put limits on the length of time an incompetent person may be confined. However, the Court offers only general guidelines and by 1994, twenty years after the case, 32 states still had not enacted periodic judicial review of incompetent detainees. Many states still allowed a detention period that exceeded that maximum sentence that person would have received if convicted.|$|E
25|$|Display type {{refers to}} the use of type at large sizes, perhaps 30 points or larger. Some typefaces are {{considered}} useful solely at display sizes, and are known as display faces. Most effect typefaces are display types. Common features of display type include tighter default letter spacing, finer details and serifs, slightly more condensed letter shapes and larger differences between thick and thin strokes; many of these are most visible in serif designs. Many display typefaces in the past such as those intended for posters and newspaper headlines were also only cut in capitals, since it was assumed lower-case would not be needed, or at least with no italics. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> of many early sans-serif fonts.|$|E
