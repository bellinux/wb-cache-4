5|$|After the {{inception}} of Scouting in the early 1900s, some nations' programs have taken part in social movements such as the nationalist resistance movements in India.

5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E

40|$|The {{mounting}} {{tension between}} African {{states and the}} International Criminal Court casts a dark shadow over the Court’s tenth anniversary. Since the Prosecutor’s application for an arrest warrant against the Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir in July 2008, African states have expressed their concerns and indeed frustrations about the Court. The purpose of this thesis is to explain what these proclaimed concerns and frustrations might imply for <b>the</b> sociological <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court. In contrast to most preceding studies on sociological <b>legitimacy</b> in <b>the</b> international realm, this thesis embarks upon this task by analysing <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> perceptions <b>of</b> African states. Unmistakably, these perceptions are subjective qualities and are as such not readily accessible for outside-observers. However, although scholars cannot make conclusive statements about <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> perceptions <b>of</b> African states, they {{can come up with}} reasonable assumptions about what African states perceive as legitimate and what this might imply for <b>the</b> sociological <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court. This thesis proposes that such reasonable assumptions can be derived from the specific contexts in which African states have expressed their concerns and frustrations about the Court and from the wider political space in which African states operate. ...|$|R

5|$|During the 16th century, the {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted.
