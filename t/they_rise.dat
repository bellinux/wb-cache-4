5|$|Muqarnas are elaborately carved {{ceilings}} to semi-domes, {{often used}} in mosques. They are typically made of stucco (and thus {{do not have a}} structural function), but can also be of wood, brick, and stone. They are characteristic of Islamic architecture of the Middle Ages from Spain and Morocco in the west to Persia in the east. Architecturally they form multiple tiers of squinches, diminishing in size as <b>they</b> <b>rise.</b> They are often elaborately decorated.|$|E
5|$|The crests of Corythosaurus {{resemble}} {{that of a}} cassowary, or a Corinthian helmet. They {{are formed}} {{by a combination of}} the praemaxillae, nasals, prefrontals and frontals, as in Saurolophus, but instead of projecting backwards as a spine, <b>they</b> <b>rise</b> up to make the highest point above the orbit. The two halves of the crest are separated by a median suture. In front of the orbit, the crest is made of thick bone.|$|E
5|$|The three named {{species of}} Gryposaurus differ in {{details of the}} skull and lower jaw. The {{prominent}} nasal arch found in this genus is formed from the paired nasal bones. In profile view, <b>they</b> <b>rise</b> into a rounded hump {{in front of the}} eyes, reaching a height as tall as the highest point {{of the back of the}} skull. The skeleton is known in great detail, making it a useful point of reference for other duckbill skeletons.|$|E

5|$|The {{wings are}} {{modified}} when gliding so that <b>they</b> <b>rise</b> {{from the body}} at an angle, but are closer to horizontal further along the wingspan. In silhouette, the comparatively long neck, head and beak stick out from the front almost {{as far as the}} tail does behind. For active flight, the white-bellied sea eagle alternates strong deep wing-beats with short periods of gliding.|$|E
5|$|There {{are reasons}} that seamounts are biologically important. <b>They</b> <b>rise</b> {{high in the}} water column, {{creating}} complex current patterns that support life on, around, and above the seamount. The surface of the seamount also provides a substrate upon which organisms can attach themselves and grow. This in turn supports the species that feed on them, in turn supporting the whole ecological food web. Scientists have found that seamounts often provide a habitat for endemic species that are not found anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|A {{visit by}} Dahlia Brinkley, the only Springfield Elementary {{graduate}} ever to enter an Ivy League college, gives Lisa a severe inferiority complex {{because she is}} involved in very few extracurricular activities. When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her résumé and takes the position. Since she knows nothing about baseball, she seeks advice from the patrons of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and <b>they</b> <b>rise</b> in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all {{the fun out of}} the game, and hits a home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.|$|E

For {{a minute or two}} they stood motionless, {{watching}} the distant figures; and then, turning, bounded away. The chief uttered an exclamation of disgust, for it was evident at once that, from the direction that they were taking, the herd would not pass, as he hoped, close by the bushes.|$|R

5|$|One Piece: Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack! was {{produced}} by Production I.G for the 1998 Jump Super Anime Tour and was directed by Gorō Taniguchi. Luffy, Nami, and Zoro are attacked by a sea monster that destroys their boat and separates them. Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka's father have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labor. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy's capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all the villagers. <b>They</b> <b>rise</b> up against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armored battleship. The Straw Hat Pirates are forced to fight Ganzack once more {{to prevent him from}} destroying the island.|$|E
5|$|Plinian eruptions (or Vesuvian) are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named for the historical eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD that buried the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum and, specifically, for its chronicler Pliny the Younger. The process powering Plinian eruptions starts in the magma chamber, where dissolved volatile gases are stored in the magma. The gases vesiculate and accumulate as <b>they</b> <b>rise</b> through the magma conduit. These bubbles agglutinate and once they reach a certain size (about 75% of the total volume of the magma conduit) they explode. The narrow confines of the conduit force the gases and associated magma up, forming an eruptive column. Eruption velocity {{is controlled by the}} gas contents of the column, and low-strength surface rocks commonly crack under the pressure of the eruption, forming a flared outgoing structure that pushes the gases even faster.|$|E

25|$|Whitchurch–Stouffville has a {{continental}} climate moderated by the Great Lakes and influenced by warm, moist air masses from the south, and cold, dry {{air from the}} north. The Oak Ridges Moraine affects levels of precipitation: as air masses arrive from Lake Ontario and reach the elevated ground surface of the moraine, <b>they</b> <b>rise</b> causing precipitation.|$|E
25|$|Atomic {{spectroscopy}} was {{the first}} application of spectroscopy developed. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) involve visible and ultraviolet light. These absorptions and emissions, {{often referred to as}} atomic spectral lines, are due to electronic transitions of outer shell electrons as <b>they</b> <b>rise</b> and fall from one electron orbit to another. Atoms also have distinct x-ray spectra that are attributable to the excitation of inner shell electrons to excited states.|$|E
25|$|The Alleghenies {{comprise}} the rugged western-central {{portion of the}} Appalachians. <b>They</b> <b>rise</b> to approximately 4,862 feet (1,483 m) in northeastern West Virginia. In the east, they are dominated by a high, steep escarpment known as the Allegheny Front. In the west, they slope down into the closely associated Allegheny Plateau, which extends into Ohio and Kentucky. The principal settlements of the Alleghenies are Altoona, State College, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania; and Cumberland, Maryland.|$|E

25|$|Very {{little has}} survived of ancient Chinese architecture, {{due to the}} {{extensive}} use of timber as a building material. Brick and stone vaults used in tomb construction have survived, and the corbeled dome was used, rarely, in tombs and temples. The earliest true domes found in Chinese tombs were shallow cloister vaults, called simian jieding, derived from the Han use of barrel vaulting. Unlike the cloister vaults of western Europe, the corners are rounded off as <b>they</b> <b>rise.</b>|$|E
25|$|The North Anatolian Mountains in {{the north}} are an {{interrupted}} chain of folded highlands that generally parallel the Black Sea coast. In the west, the mountains tend to be low, with elevations rarely exceeding 1,500 meters, but <b>they</b> <b>rise</b> in an easterly direction to heights greater than 3,000 meters south of Rize. Lengthy, troughlike valleys and basins characterize the mountains. Rivers flow from the mountains toward the Black Sea. The southern slopes—facing the Anatolian Plateau—are mostly unwooded, but the northern slopes contain dense growths of both deciduous and evergreen trees.|$|E
25|$|The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) is {{the small}} but {{professional}} military force of Jamaica. The JDF {{is based on the}} British military model with similar organisation, training, weapons and traditions. Once chosen, officer candidates are sent to one of several British or Canadian basic officer courses depending on the arm of service. Enlisted soldiers are given basic training at Up Park Camp or JDF Training Depot, Newcastle, both in St. Andrew. As with the British model, NCOs are given several levels of professional training as <b>they</b> <b>rise</b> up the ranks. Additional military schools are available for speciality training in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{are being}} used with {{increasing}} frequency in automotive lamps. They offer very long service life, extreme vibration resistance, and can permit considerably shallower packaging compared to most bulb-type assemblies. LEDs also offer a potential safety benefit when employed in stop lights, because when power is applied <b>they</b> <b>rise</b> to full intensity approximately 250 milliseconds (¼ second) faster than incandescent bulbs. This fast rise time not only improves the intentional conspicuity of the stop lamp, but could also provide following drivers with increased time {{to react to the}} appearance of the stop lamps. However, this faster rise time has not been shown to make cars with LED stop lamps less likely to be struck from behind.|$|E
25|$|The first donuts popular {{until the}} 16th century {{were made of}} the same dough as bread, filled with pork and fried on smalec. Only later they were made sweet. Every respectful cake shop makes pączki {{the night before the}} Poles hit the shops to buy them. Polish pączki are made of yeast, flour and eggs, and fried in oil or smalec only briefly, until <b>they</b> <b>rise</b> up, so that the fat would not soak inside. Some people fill a few of them with almond or nut instead of marmalade; a chance {{encounter}} is supposed to bring good luck. Even though during Easter many housewives make pączki and faworki at home, one can see crowds of people at confectioneries buying this Fat Thursday’s specialty.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} di Penates is more defined in Etruria: Arnobius (citing a Caesius) {{states that the}} Etruscan Penates were named Fortuna, Ceres, Genius Iovialis and Pales; {{according}} to Nigidius Figulus, they included those of Jupiter, of Neptune, of the infernal gods and of mortal men. According to Varro the Penates reside in the recesses of Heaven and are called Consentes and Complices by the Etruscans because <b>they</b> <b>rise</b> and set together, are twelve in number and their names are unknown, six male and six females and are the cousellors and masters of Jupiter. Martianus states they are always in agreement among themselves. While these last gods {{seem to be the}} Penates of Jupiter, Jupiter himself along with Juno and Minerva is one of the Penates of man according to some authors.|$|E
