5|$|After {{the release}} of 100% Love (2011), Akkineni Nagarjuna decided <b>to</b> <b>act</b> and produce in an all-star film along with his father, actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao and elder son Naga Chaitanya. Nageswara Rao {{suggested}} Nagarjuna to begin the film as early as possible, because of his age. After examining and rejecting many scripts due to a perceived lack of novelty, Nagarjuna was advised by actor Nithin's father and distributor Sudhakar Reddy {{to listen to a}} script by Vikram Kumar, who was directing Nithin and Nithya Menen in Ishq (2012). Although he liked the script after the first narration, he agreed <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in the film only after watching Ishq before its theatrical release.|$|E

5|$|In the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled {{over the}} terms of a regency during the King's incapacity. While both agreed that it would be most {{reasonable}} for George III's eldest son and heir apparent, the Prince of Wales, <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as regent, to Pitt’s consternation Fox suggested that it was the Prince of Wales's absolute right <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on his ill father's behalf with full powers. Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered.|$|E

5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's commitment <b>to</b> <b>act</b> {{in accordance}} {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in that way.|$|E
