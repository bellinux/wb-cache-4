5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Man Tag Team match pitting <b>The</b> <b>Unlikely</b> Alliance (Christian Cage, Kevin Nash, and Samoa Joe) against The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, and Tomko). The match {{duration}} was twelve minutes and twenty-nine seconds. Angle {{was forced to}} sit out of the match for five minutes, giving <b>The</b> <b>Unlikely</b> Alliance the three on two advantage. Joe won the encounter after he forced Tomko to submit with his signature Coquina Clutch submission maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, {{the story}} was greatly {{modified}} {{to make it more}} suitable as a family film. By the time it was completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of <b>the</b> <b>unlikely</b> friendship of two creatures, who should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E
5|$|In the semifinal, three skaters, {{including}} the defending champion, crashed {{into each other}} and Bradbury moved up into second place {{to qualify for the}} final. In the final, Bradbury was substantially slower than his opponents and was safely in last place, around 15m behind with only 50m to go, when all four rivals collided and fell over, allowing him to avoid the pile-up and take the victory. <b>The</b> <b>unlikely</b> win turned Bradbury into something of a folk hero across Australia and around the world.|$|E

5|$|On the February 14, 2008, {{episode of}} Impact!, Tomko {{announced}} he attacked Christian Cage {{at the event}} because he no longer wanted an alliance with Cage and felt he could become a star on his own. Tomko then joined The Angle Alliance later on the same episode. On the February 21, 2008, episode of Impact!, it was revealed a Six-Man Tag Team match pitting the team of Cage, Samoa Joe, and Kevin Nash against The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, and Tomko) was planned for the Destination X PPV event on March 9, 2008. At Destination X, Cage, Joe, and Nash under <b>The</b> <b>Unlikely</b> Alliance moniker defeated The Angle Alliance.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Destination X was a Six Man Tag Team match pitting <b>The</b> <b>Unlikely</b> Alliance of Christian Cage, Kevin Nash, and Samoa Joe against The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, and Tomko). The storyline behind this match was Joe's quest {{to win the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship from Angle, with the two {{scheduled}} {{to fight for the}} title at TNA's next PPV event Lockdown on April 13, 2008. Also connected was Cage's feud with Styles and Tomko, after the two betrayed him and cost him the TNA World Heavyweight Championship twice against Angle in the storyline at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 6, 2008, and at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008. This bout was announced on the February 21, 2008, episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact! during a backstage segment between Joe and Management Director Jim Cornette. On the March 6, 2008, episode of Impact!, the participants in the match fought in a series of matches to determine who would get a five-minute man advantaged at Destination X. Nash defeated Styles, Tomko defeated Joe in a First Blood match, and Cage defeated Angle in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match, leaving it two to three, with <b>The</b> <b>Unlikely</b> Alliance gaining the advantage.|$|E

5|$|Zootopia (known as Zootropolis in some territories) is a 2016 American 3D computer-animated buddy comedy film {{produced}} by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The film {{was directed by}} Byron Howard and Rich Moore and {{was based on a}} screenplay written by Jared Bush (who also co-directed) and Phil Johnston. Zootopia focuses on <b>the</b> <b>unlikely</b> partnership between an ambitious rabbit police officer, Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and a crafty red fox con artist, Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) as they uncover a conspiracy behind the mysterious disappearance of predators from a mammalian metropolis.|$|E
5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major population center (Knoxville) in <b>the</b> <b>unlikely</b> event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E

5|$|Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis {{has gained}} {{something}} of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), {{perhaps because of the}} desperate circumstances and <b>the</b> <b>unlikely</b> odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.|$|E
5|$|Mary was courted by Duke Philip of Bavaria {{from late}} 1539, {{but he was}} Lutheran and his suit for her hand was unsuccessful. Over 1539, the king's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, {{negotiated}} a potential alliance with the Duchy of Cleves. Suggestions that Mary marry the Duke of Cleves, who was the same age, came to nothing, but a match between Henry and the Duke's sister Anne was agreed. When the king saw Anne {{for the first time}} in late December 1539, a week before the scheduled wedding, he did not find himself attracted to her but was unable, for diplomatic reasons and in the absence of a suitable pretext, to cancel the marriage. Cromwell fell from favour and was arrested for treason in June 1540; one of <b>the</b> <b>unlikely</b> charges against him was that he had plotted to marry Mary himself. Anne consented to the annulment of the marriage, which had not been consummated, and Cromwell was beheaded.|$|E

5|$|By October5, {{the eye of}} Nora was {{no longer}} evident on {{satellite}} imagery, which indicated {{the beginning of a}} weakening trend. However, a Special Sensor Microwave/Imager observed a small eye that was open to the northwest. The convection became ragged, and on October6 the winds decreased below hurricane-force. Around the same time, a strong approaching mid-level trough caused Nora to slow and turn to the east. Continued wind shear and the presence of dry air stripped the thunderstorms away from the center, and by October7 all of the deep convection had dissipated. As a result, it was downgraded to a tropical depression, and Nora weakened {{to the extent that it}} barely met the criteria for being a tropical cyclone. The NHC maintained advisories due to the circulation's proximity to western Mexico, as well as <b>the</b> <b>unlikely</b> potential for redeveloping thunderstorms due to its movement over warmer waters. Nora accelerated to the east-northeast and later to the northeast due to the advancing trough. As it approached western Mexico, an area of curved convection unexpectedly developed over the center. Without additional redevelopment, the poorly defined circulation of Nora made landfall near Mazatlán, Sinaloa early on October9. It dissipated shortly thereafter over the high terrain of western Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey to}} the Eastern Mediterranean was inevitably long and eventful. Travelling overland, Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, drowned in the Saleph River, and few of his men reached the Eastern Mediterranean. Travelling by sea, Richard the Lionheart, King of England conquered Cyprus in 1191 in {{response}} to his sister and fiancée, who were travelling separately, being taken captive by the island's ruler, Isaac Komnenos. Philip II of France was the first king to arrive at the siege of Acre; Richard arrived on 8June 1191. The arrival of the French and Angevin forces turned the tide in the conflict, and the Muslim garrison of Acre finally surrendered on 12July. Philip considered his vow fulfilled and returned to France to deal with domestic matters, leaving most of his forces behind. But Richard travelled south along the Mediterranean coast, defeated the Muslims near Arsuf, and recaptured the port city of Jaffa. He twice advanced to within a day's march of Jerusalem before judging that he lacked the resources to successfully capture the city, or defend it in <b>the</b> <b>unlikely</b> event of a successful assault, while Saladin had a mustered army. This marked the end of Richard's crusading career and was a calamitous blow to Frankish morale. A three-year truce was negotiated that allowed Catholics unfettered access to Jerusalem. Politics in England and illness forced Richard's departure, never to return, and Saladin died in March 1193. Emperor HenryVI initiated the German Crusade to fulfil the promises made by his father, Frederick, to undertake a Crusade to the Holy Land. Led by Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, the army captured the cities of Sidon and Beirut. However, in 1197 Henry died and most of the Crusaders returned to Germany to protect their holdings and take part in the election of his successor as Emperor.|$|E
5|$|The team of Curry Man and Shark Boy were {{pitted against}} Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray), who were {{accompanied}} by Johnny Devine, in a thirteen-minute-and-twelve-second Fish Market Street Fight. Prior to this bout, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that if Team 3D made weight, then the weight restriction on them would be lifted. Also, that Kurt Angle originally won the Six Sides of Steel Cage match against Christian Cage, however the decision with <b>The</b> <b>Unlikely</b> Alliance gaining the advantage in the Six Man Tag Team match was still in effect. Before the bout, both members of Team 3D were weighed, with both coming in below the mark. In a Fish Market Street Fight the match is won by pinfall or submission, {{in which there are}} no disqualifications and the ring area is covered by fish paraphernalia. Devine interfered in the match near the end, accidentally throwing white powder in Ray's face. This led to Shark Boy tossing him out of the ring and through a table. Afterwards, Ray mistakenly performed Team 3D's signature tag team maneuver the 3D on Devon with Curry Man, allowing Shark Boy to cover for the pinfall victory.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>unlikely</b> {{expedition}} team ends {{up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located {{billions of}} light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him {{in charge of the}} expedition, though the others are not quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia of wear and tear, has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time. However, the main life support is not so easily fixed. The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently aware of the problem, drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the scrubbers. Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, {{at the end of which}} the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.|$|E
