5|$|By the 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> {{encountered}} capacity {{problems on}} the San Francisco Chief, which ran between Chicago and San Francisco. Unlike the El Capitan, the Chief carried a mix of sleeping cars and coaches. To augment capacity, <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> ordered an additional 24 coaches in 19631964; 12 step-down and 12 standard. This was the final major order for new long-distance passenger equipment before the coming of Amtrak. Each San Francisco Chief carried four Hi-Level coaches, displacing six single-level coaches.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> {{introduced}} the El Capitan in 1938. The train {{ran on the}} Santa Fe's main line between Chicago and Los Angeles. Unusually for streamliners of the period, the El Capitan carried coaches only, and had no sleeping cars. Passengers flocked to the new train, and <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> added cars to meet the demand. The train grew from five cars in 1938 to fourteen in 1952. Sometimes demand was high enough to justify running a second instance ("section") of the train on the same day. <b>The</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> sought a solution to increase {{the capacity of the}} train without lengthening it further. Two popular innovations by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB) suggested a solution. First, in 1945, the CB {{introduced the}} first dome car, in which passengers rode on a second level high above the tracks, affording better views. Second, in 1950, it placed bilevel rail cars in commuter service in the Chicago area. Taken together, these innovations suggested a new possibility: a long-distance bilevel coach, with greater capacity than single-level cars, and the panoramic views of a dome.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{derailments}} {{in the mid-1970s}} shattered Amtrak's confidence in the locomotive, and many railroads banned it from their tracks. Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotive's trucks, {{the weight of the}} water and steam generators used for train heating, or the vibration of baggage cars behind the locomotive. In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH, which was already in use on short-distance routes. Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs. The remainder were traded to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) for use in freight service. <b>The</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), successor to <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe,</b> retired them in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Commerce {{expanded}} after <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> Trail {{opened in}} 1822, and {{greater numbers of}} examples survive. Until 1880, all such textiles were blankets as opposed to rugs. In 1850, these highly prized trade items sold for $50 in gold, a huge sum at that time.|$|E
