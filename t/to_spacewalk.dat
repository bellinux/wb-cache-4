5|$|In 2137, 15 {{years after}} the {{disappearance}} of the Nostromo spacecraft, Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, is approached by the android Christopher Samuels of the Weyland-Yutani corporation. Samuels informs her that the flight recorder of the Nostromo was recently located by a ship named the Anesidora and is being held aboard Sevastopol, a remote space station owned by the Seegson Corporation, in orbit around the gas giant KG348. He offers her a place on the Weyland-Yutani team sent to retrieve it so that she can have closure regarding the fate of her missing mother. Ripley, Samuels, and Weyland-Yutani executive Nina Taylor travel to Sevastopol on board the courier ship Torrens, owned by captain Diane Verlaine. The group arrives at Sevastopol to find the station damaged and its communications offline. Ripley, Samuels, and Taylor attempt <b>to</b> <b>spacewalk</b> over to the station to investigate, but their EVA line is severed by debris, and Ripley is separated from them and forced to enter the station on her own.|$|E

5000|$|NASA {{has used}} VR {{technology}} for twenty years. [...] Most notable is {{their use of}} immersive VR to train astronauts while they are still on Earth.

50|$|At first, the Sunbird's {{commander}} {{refuses to}} communicate with them, suspicious of their motives. As they continue to plead with the astronauts to accept their rescue offer, the men are chilled to hear their mission referred to in historical terms. They {{come to realize that}} they were not only thrown off-course in space, but in time as well, and that their flight was lost centuries ago. They are given bare details of the current Earth: an undefined cataclysm has reduced the human population to a mere few million. Eventually, the Sunbird agrees to rendezvous with the spaceship Gloria to allow the astronauts <b>to</b> <b>spacewalk</b> to safety.|$|E

On 27 September 2008, Zhai became the first Chinese astronaut <b>to</b> <b>spacewalk,</b> completely outside the craft. Fellow crew member Liu Boming stood by at the airlock and could be seen straddling the portal. Zhai successfully completed his spacewalk at 18:25 CST. Zhai wore the Chinese developed Feitian space suit, while Liu wore the Russian derived Orlan-M space suit.|$|E

They {{make it to the}} P-Sec Headquarters, where they discover Lexine Murdoch, Caldwell's girlfriend and agree to take her to safety. The group races to find a shuttle and eventually find one in the Megavents, thanks to mining company executive Warren Eckhardt. They fly to the Ishimura for help, but are warned to return; they are shot down, causing the shuttle to crash on the Ishimura and forcing them <b>to</b> <b>spacewalk</b> to a nearby airlock.|$|E
50|$|The Soyuz 4 and 5 {{spacecraft}} docked on 16 January, {{the first}} time two manned spacecraft had docked (Apollo 9 {{would do the same}} in March of the same year). The two craft possessed only a primitive probe (Soyuz 4) and drogue (Soyuz 5) docking assembly. A connecting tunnel for the docking mechanism had not yet been developed, which prevented a simple internal transfer between the craft. This required the two transferring cosmonauts <b>to</b> <b>spacewalk</b> from one vehicle to the other. Aboard Soyuz 5, Yevgeny Khrunov and Aleksei Yeliseyev immediately began preparing for their extra-vehicular activity (EVA). Boris Volynov, who would remain aboard Soyuz 5, filmed them donning their Yastreb space suits.|$|E

5000|$|Soyuz 7K-OK {{spacecraft}} had a [...] "probe and drogue" [...] {{docking mechanism}} {{to connect with}} other spacecraft in orbit, in order to gather engineering data as a preparation for the Soviet space station program. There were two variants of Soyuz 7K-OK: Soyuz 7K-OK(A) featuring an active [...] "probe" [...] docking port, and Soyuz 7K-OK(P) featuring a passive [...] "drogue" [...] docking target. The docking mechanisms of 7K-OK and 7K-LOK did not allow internal transfer (this feature was added on the 7K-OKS version), thus cosmonauts had <b>to</b> <b>spacewalk</b> between docked modules. This procedure was conducted successfully on the joint Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 missions, where Aleksei Yeliseyev and Yevgeny Khrunov transferred from their Soyuz 5 to the Soyuz 4 craft.|$|E

5000|$|STS-104 {{took place}} from July 12-July 24, 2001. [...] This was the 10th {{mission to the}} International Space Station (ISS). During the 13-day flight the crew {{conducted}} joint operations with the Expedition-2 crew. Dr. Gernhardt {{was one of two}} astronauts <b>to</b> perform three <b>spacewalks</b> <b>to</b> install the joint airlock “Quest” (including the first US space walk from the ISS) and to outfit it with four high-pressure gas tanks. The mission was accomplished in 200 Earth orbits, traveling 5.3 million miles in 306 hours and 35 minutes.|$|R

50|$|The Quest Joint Airlock is used <b>to</b> host <b>spacewalks</b> {{from the}} USOS {{segment of the}} ISS. It {{consists}} of two main parts: the equipment lock and the crew lock. The equipment lock is where the Extravehicular Mobility Units are stored and preparations for spacewalks are carried out. The crew lock is depressurized during spacewalks. The Quest airlock was delivered and installed by the STS-104 crew in July 2001.|$|R
5000|$|STS-69 {{took place}} from September 7-September 18, 1995. [...] Its prime {{objective}} was the successful deployment and retrieval of a SPARTAN satellite and the Wake Shield Facility (WSF).

Dr. Gernhardt was one of two astronauts <b>to</b> perform a <b>spacewalk</b> <b>to</b> evaluate future Space Station tools and hardware, logging 6 hours and 46 minutes of EVA. Mission duration was 260 hours, 29 minutes, and 8 seconds, traveling 4.5 million miles in 171 orbits of the Earth.|$|R
