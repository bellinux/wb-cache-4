40|$|This {{theme of}} this paper is the design and {{characterisation}} of a velocity amplifier (VAMP) machine for high-acceleration shock testing of micro-scale devices. The VAMP applies multiple sequential impacts to amplify velocity through a system of three progressively smaller masses constrained to move in the vertical axis. Repeatable, controlled, mechanical shock pulses are created through the metal-on-metal impact between pulse shaping test rods, which form part of the penultimate and ultimate masses. The objectives are to investigate the controllable parameters that affect the shock pulses induced on collision, namely; striker and incident <b>test</b> <b>rod</b> material; <b>test</b> <b>rod</b> length; pulse shaping mechanisms; and impact velocity. The optimum VAMP configuration was established as a 60 mm long titanium striker <b>test</b> <b>rod</b> and a 120 mm long titanium incident rod. This configuration exhibited an acceleration magnitude and a primary pulse duration range of 5, 800 – 23, 400 g and 28. 0 – 44. 0 μs respectively. It was illustrated that the acceleration spectral content can be manipulated through control of the <b>test</b> <b>rod</b> material and length. This is critical in the context of practical applications, where it is postulated that the acceleration signal can be controlled to effectively excite specific components in a multi-component assembly affixed to the VAMP incident <b>test</b> <b>rod...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this paper is a {{velocity}} amplification machine for high-g shock testing of micro-scale devices. The machine uses multiple sequential impacts to amplify velocity through a system of progressively smaller masses constrained to move in the vertical axis. Shock pulses are created through the finite collinear metal rod impact between the penultimate and ultimate masses, imparting shock pulses in excess of 20, 000 G for an impact velocity of approximately 4. 2 m/s. For stand-alone application or as an attachment to a drop table, the machine represents a small-scale and inexpensive alternative to conventional Hopkinson Bars or ballistic techniques. The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate the interaction between the penultimate and ultimate masses in order to generate controlled shock pulses. The influence of the following parameters was examined: the geometry and material of the <b>test</b> <b>rods</b> enclosed in the penultimate and ultimate masses; mitigator use; and isolation of the <b>test</b> <b>rods.</b> A Hopkinson pressure bar was used as an ideal input to the pulse shaping <b>test</b> <b>rods</b> as a direct comparison to the velocity amplifier data.

A laboratory-based investigation that involved immersing <b>test</b> <b>rods</b> of ladle refractory sidewall brick into molten slags of varying compositions was conducted. The mechanism of sidewall buildup was subsequently investigated by varying the thermal regime following slag immersion and observing the resulting microstructures. Slags high in silica exhibited a discontinuous precipitation of corundum, with an additional deposit of anorthite depending on the cooling rate following slag immersion. Slags containing large quantities of alumina were observed to form well-defined bands of hibonite and calcium dialuminate, {{in addition to a}} matrix in some regions, which contained spinel and calcium aluminate.

40|$|The LOCA test series IFA- 650 {{conducted}} at the OECD Halden Reactor Project (HRP) has provided unique data {{on the performance of}} fuel rods during LOCA transients. One focus of the current investigations is the performance of the fuel in the ballooning stage of the LOCA transient. In this stage, relocation of fuel material is a possibility, in which case pellet fragments fall down to fill the void introduced by the increased volume of the ballooned cladding. This increases the heat load in that region, further promoting corrosion of the cladding. A special concern in the case of high-burnup fuels is the increasing number of small fuel fragments, which may be expected to cause a higher packing fraction in the ballooned region.     In this work, a novel technique is presented for assessing the average density of the fuel material in the ballooned region of LOCA test rods. The investigation is based on non-destructive gamma emission tomography measurements, using the dedicated instrument recently developed at the HRP in collaboration with Westinghouse (Sweden) and Uppsala University. In this approach, the gamma radiation field surrounding the <b>test</b> <b>rod</b> has been measured with a narrowly collimated HPGe detector. Tomographic reconstruction of the data was performed, providing the radial gamma-ray source distribution within the measured volume, which reveals the fuel fragment distribution. From this, the density of the fuel in the measured volume (i. e., the packing fraction) may be calculated.   The technique has been used to investigate a LOCA <b>test</b> <b>rod</b> of the Halden Reactor Project LOCA series. The LOCA experiment was carried out about one month prior to the gamma tomography examination. The results show that the distribution of the relocated fuel can be imaged using gamma rays from fission products.

In addition, the peaks of activation products offer valuable information on the location of the test rig structures, which may be utilized in a quantitative tomographic reconstruction to assess the spatially resolved packing fraction...|$|E

Knowledge of the above experimental quantities allows K and P to be evaluated using the solving equations of the analytical procedure.

40|$|Fretting {{damage to}} fuel rods reduces the service {{lives of the}} fuel {{assemblies}} and therefore increases reactor operating costs. The future development of fretting-resistant spacer grids neces-sitates the investigation of fretting behavior by means of model tests. This paper {{presents the results of}} such tests carried out to investigate fretting in three different fuel rod support configura-tions. The tests were performed in water at room temperature in a fretting test stand (referred to below simply as “autoclave”) using test rods with zirconium-alloy cladding tubes. The <b>test</b> <b>rod</b> was excited by means of electromagnet to induce vibration. The depth of the fretting marks and their volume increased as test-ing progressed. The resulting increase in the grid-to-rod gap caused changes in rod dynamic behavior and in the intensity of rod motion. Fretting rate is affected by rod motion, and the presence of edges at the point of contact between rod and sup-port accelerates fretting wear. Spring design affects not only the degree of fretting but also the time history of the fretting process. Steady-state fretting was identified in the case of rods supported by convex springs without edges at the point of rod-to-support contact. The results of the model tests should provide a bet-ter understanding of fretting processes inside the reactor. They should not, however, be used to describe real conditions inside a reactor.

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{proposed as}} alternatives by Rock [...] {{frame of reference}} and hierarchical organisation of perception [...] were tested {{in a series of}} experiments {{with the use of the}} rod-and-frame illusion. This illusion produces errors in the apparent vertical due to the presence of a tilted frame surrounding the <b>test</b> <b>rod.</b> The apparent vertical is shifted in the direction of the frame tilt. When an upright square was added inside the tilted frame, rod-setting errors varied according to the visual characteristics of the display. In the case of a large display presented in the dark (experiment 1), there continued to be large errors in the direction of the outer-square tilt. This finding supports the frame-of-reference hypothesis, which proposes that the orientation of all objects in the visual field is dominated by the most peripheral reference. In the case of a small display presented in a lit environment (experiments 2 and 3), the direction of errors was the opposite. This latter finding was taken to indicate that the rod was set with reference to the perceived tilt of the inner upright square. Thus, according to a hierarchical - organisation hypothesis, the orientation of an object in the visual field is influenced by objects in the immediate surroundings not by outermost reference.
