25|$|On September 9, 1994, Shamrock {{returned}} to the octagon at UFC 3 in an event that was marketed by the UFC as the ultimate rematch between two-time champion Royce Gracie and #1 contender Shamrock. Shamrock's first fight, now allowed to wear his shoes, was against top ranked judo practitioner Christophe Leininger. Leininger engaged for a takedown, but Shamrock blocked and got on <b>top,</b> <b>unloading</b> hard punches and headbutts until the tap out. Shamrock crossed faced Leininger so hard into the mat that Leininger admitted to being knocked out for a second, and he later was revealed to have suffered a mild concussion. Shamrock's next fight was in the semifinals against kickboxer Felix Mitchell. Shamrock took Mitchell down and forced him to tap out due to a rear naked choke. With this win, Shamrock advanced to the finals of UFC 3. However, Shamrock refused {{to compete in the}} finals after he learned Gracie had dropped out of the tournament after his win over Kimo Leopoldo, combined with a knee injury he suffered during his match with Leininger.|$|E
50|$|The lifts at Mt. Baker are {{not named}} but {{referred}} to by number. All are fixed-grip quads. Chairs 3 and 4 access the same point from different sides of the mountain using a continuous loop of cable (haul rope); there is a mid-station at the <b>top</b> for <b>unloading</b> only.|$|R
2500|$|According to Jason Autry, {{he agreed}} to help Zach dispose of the body. They drove to a spot along the Tennessee River with plans to [...] "gut" [...] her so she didn't float to the <b>top.</b> After <b>unloading</b> her body from {{the bed of the}} truck, they {{realized}} she was still alive, so Zach shot her {{in the back of the}} head. Fearing that the noise of the gunshot may attract attention, they loaded her body back into the truck and Zach dropped Jason off. Autry testified that Zach later said that he'd dumped the body near a place called Kelly Ridge. (Her remains were found in a different location and it is unclear how the body ended up where it was ultimately found.) ...|$|R
50|$|Many {{variants}} exist due to {{the wide}} variety of liquids and gases transported. Tank cars can be pressurized or non-pressurized, insulated or non-insulated, and designed for single or multiple commodities. Non-pressurized cars have various fittings on the top and may have fittings on the bottom. Some of the top fittings are covered by a protective housing. Pressurized cars have a pressure plate, with all fittings, and a cylindrical protective housing at the <b>top.</b> Loading and <b>unloading</b> are done through the protective housing.|$|R
40|$|A pad {{assembly}} method for analyzing tilting-pad bearings is presented. The method {{results in the}} complete coefficient matrix for a tilting-pad bearing; the matrix is independent of the pad inertia, the pitch frequency {{and the number of}} degrees of freedom of the pad. A {{pad assembly}} method is used because it allows the collection of more bearing data with less computer time than a brute force iterative procedure. The results given show the complete dynamical matrices for a five-pad tilting-pad bearing both including and ignoring the damping effects of the <b>unloaded</b> (<b>top)</b> pads. For a symmetrical tilting-pad bearing the reduced cross-coupling coefficients are zero when the moment of inertia of the pad is ignored...|$|R
5000|$|Calculating {{the elastic}} modulus with {{software}} involves using software filtering techniques to separate the critical unloading data {{from the rest of}} the load-displacement data. The start and end points are usually found by using user defined percentages. This user input increases the variability because of possible human error. It would be best if the entire calculation process was automatically done for more consistent results. A good nanoindentation machine prints out the load unload curve data with labels to each of the segments such as loading, <b>top</b> hold, <b>unload,</b> bottom hold, and reloading. If multiple cycles are used then each one should be labeled. However mores nanoindenters only give the raw data for the load-unload curves. An automatic software technique finds the sharp change from the top hold time to the beginning of the unloading. This can be found by doing a linear fit to the top hold time data. The unload data starts when the load is 1.5 times standard deviation less than the hold time load. The minimum data point is the end of the unloading data. The computer calculates {{the elastic modulus}} with this data according to the Oliver-Pharr (nonlinear). The Doerner-Nix method is less complicated to program because it is a linear curve fit of the selected minimum to maximum data. However, it is limited because the calculated elastic modulus will decrease as more data points are used along the unloading curve. The Oliver-Pharr nonlinear curve fit method to the unloading curve data where [...] is the depth variable, [...] is the final depth and [...] and [...] are constants and coefficients. The software must use a nonlinear convergence method to solve for , [...] and [...] that best fits the unloading data. The slope is calculated by differentiating [...] at the maximum displacement.|$|R
