5|$|The {{holding up}} {{of one hand}} with middle and index fingers crossed was the usual gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying <b>time-out.</b> The <b>time-out</b> gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand {{vertically}} with the fingertips touching {{the bottom of the}} horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern <b>time-out</b> has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the <b>time-out</b> gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.|$|E
5|$|The Knapps {{study in}} Monroe County, Indiana, found <b>time-out</b> and {{times to be}} {{by far the most}} {{prevalent}} terms in the 1970s. Variations included I've got times and time. Very few children reported the more traditional kings, queens or I've got kings X. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together. <b>Time-out</b> clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of <b>time-out</b> or time as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, {{only a small number of}} respondents reported anything other than <b>time-out</b> and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included pax, safe, base or home-base and freeze with one small area of fins (Mount Vernon). The Knapps reported that <b>time-out</b> had, since the 1950s, supplanted kings ex as the most popular truce term.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of times}} rather than <b>time-out</b> and I've got times rather than I call time {{appears to have}} been {{influenced}} by older forms such as kings and I've got kings X. There was also one report of times X. Similarly derivatives of <b>time-out</b> are often accompanied by the traditional crossed fingers.|$|E
50|$|When using <b>time-outs</b> as a {{discipline}} strategy, individuals must also {{take into consideration the}} temperaments of the child if one decides to use <b>time-outs.</b> If a child, for example, has a feisty temperament, or a temperament that expresses emotion in a highly intense way, then discipline strategies of using <b>time-outs</b> would be ineffective because of the clash of discipline strategy to the child's temperament trait.|$|R

5|$|With 2:19 to {{play and}} nursing a one-point lead, Texas was in {{position}} to win if they could run out the clock. They began with a 12-yard rush {{on the left side}} by Jamaal Charles for a first down. Charles then carried again up the middle for a two-yard gain to the Ohio State 7. OSU called a <b>time-out</b> to stop the clock at 1:36. On second-and-goal, Vince Young kept the ball and gained threeyards before being tackled by A. J. Hawk. The Buckeyes again called <b>time-out</b> with 1:23 left. Young carried again for threeyards before being brought down by B. Carpenter and A. J. Hawk just one yard short of the goal-line. This time, Texas took a <b>time-out</b> with 29seconds left to play. Following the <b>time-out,</b> Young handed off to Henry Melton who was stopped for no gain. Ohio State took over on downs.|$|E
5|$|In France {{children}} use {{the word}} pouce as {{the equivalent of the}} English pax and the American <b>time-out.</b> The literal translation of pouce is thumb or big toe.|$|E
5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on <b>time-out</b> have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s <b>time-out</b> has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|The {{use of a}} truce term {{is usually}} {{accompanied}} by a gesture, such as crossed fingers of one or both hands or the raising of thumbs. In the US a T-shape made with both hands (representing <b>time-out)</b> has become prevalent and this gesture is also appearing in other countries.|$|E

5|$|Alabama {{started from}} their own four, and Lacy had a short gain before Richardson had four {{consecutive}} runs to move {{the ball to the}} 39-yard line. The next play was Alabama's longest play from scrimmage in the game when McCarron threw a 39-yard pass to Richardson and brought the ball to the LSU 19-yard line. However, for the fourth time in four offensive possessions, the LSU defense held Alabama to a field goal attempt. This time, the 34-yard Jeremy Shelley kick was good and the Crimson Tide took a 3–0 lead. Once the received the kickoff, LSU began their fourth offensive possession {{from their own}} 24. The Tigers opened their drive with runs of 14 and nine yards from Ford, followed by short runs from Ware, Jefferson and Ford again to bring the ball to the Alabama 36. After a five yard substitution penalty, Jefferson completed a 34-yard pass to Russell Shepard to give the Tigers a first and goal from the Alabama eight. After a four-yard rush by Ford and a Jefferson incompletion, Dre Kirkpatrick was called for holding that resulted in a first and goal from the Alabama two-yard line. Jefferson then threw another incompletion followed with a run for no gain by Ford. LSU then called a <b>time-out</b> with two seconds left in the half to set up a field goal attempt, and Alabama followed with a second <b>time-out</b> in an attempt to ice the kicker. Drew Alleman then kicked a 19-yard field goal as time expired to tie the game at 3–3 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|Continuing Navy's {{drive from}} the {{previous}} quarter, Polanco and Eckel continued to run up the middle and {{the right side of}} New Mexico's defense for small gains. Polanco attempted two passes, the first of which was incomplete and the second to slotback Marco Nelson for a first down at the Midshipmen 44-yard line. After 12 plays and over six minutes of game time, the drive reached midfield. After six more rushing plays from Polanco, Eckel, and slotback Eric Roberts, the team reached the Lobos' 28-yard line. Needing three yards to achieve a fourth down conversion, Navy coach Paul Johnson called a <b>time-out.</b> On the next play, Frank Divis threw his second halfback option pass of the day to Polanco, gaining six yards to keep the drive alive. Eckel, Divis, and Roberts rushed for six more plays before the drive came to a halt at the Lobos' 5-yard line. On the final play of the drive, Midshipman kicker Geoff Blumenfeld kicked a 22-yard field goal to make the score 34–19 with 2:07 left in the game.|$|E
5|$|Ohio State {{controlled}} {{most of the}} secondquarter. Their firstscore was a 45-yd {{field goal}} by Josh Huston followed by a 36-yard touchdown pass from Troy Smith to Santonio Holmes to tie the score at 10–10. They took the lead with two more field goals from Josh Huston; the first was from 36yards and the second was from 25yards. Following the kick-off, Texas took possession of the ball at their own 31yard-line with only 31seconds remaining in the first half. Young began the drive by throwing a 36-yard pass to the Ohio State 18yard-line and then the receiver ran out of bounds to stop the clock with 20seconds to play. On the next play, Young rushed for six yards and was tackled in-bounds, causing Texas to use a time out with 12seconds on the clock. On second down, OSU's A. J. Hawk sacked Vince Young for a loss of 8yards, forcing Texas to take another <b>time-out</b> with sevenseconds remaining. Texas put in David Pino to complete a 37-yard kick with twoseconds left, making the score 16–13 in favor of Ohio State. Texas kicked off and time expired on the ensuing 18-yard return by Erick Jackson.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Maryland {{advanced}} to the Oklahoma 20-yard line, and Tatum elected for a field goal attempt. Now against the wind, the kick failed, with the ball going wide right. The Sooners took over on downs and halfback Jack Ging completed a pass to end Max Boydston for a five-yard gain. Ging then rushed for threeyards. On the next play, Calame pitched to Grigg who ran {{to the left and}} picked up 12yards for a first down. Calame then completed a pass to back Bob Burris for sixyards. Grigg faked a pass and ran to the right for a gain of 12yards and a first down on the Maryland 39-yard line. The Terrapins stopped two Sooner rushing attempts before Calame connected with Burris again for an 11-yard gain. Burris then rushed for threemore yards to advance to the Maryland 25. Tatum called a <b>time-out.</b> On third down with oneyard to go, Calame faked a handoff to Ging and executed an option run to the left. He pitched to Grigg and threw a block. Grigg was tackled at the goal-line but managed to extend his body into the endzone. Buddy Leake made the extra point. Shortly before halftime, Calame suffered a separated collarbone. With back-up Pat O'Neal also injured, only third-string quarterback Jack Van Pool remained, and he had little game experience.|$|E

25|$|Pulver battled back in {{the third}} round, {{successfully}} defending Penn's attempts {{to take him to}} the ground, and even scoring defensive takedowns on Penn. Pulver frustrated Penn with nothing more than sheer will power, not only winning the later rounds, but out-grappling the world-renowned Penn. In the fifth round, Penn, frustrated and down on points, chose to stand and trade with Pulver. For the entire five minutes of the fifth round the two stood toe to toe exchanging strikes. With 45 seconds left in the round, a left hand from Pulver staggered Penn, who looked in trouble. However, Penn countered with a right kick straight to the groin, resulting in a 50-second <b>time-out.</b> Although the <b>time-out</b> gave Penn time to recover, when the bout was restarted, Pulver staggered him a second time with 20 seconds remaining. However, the round drew to a conclusion and the fight went into the judges' hands.|$|E
