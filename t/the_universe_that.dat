5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the matter in <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> cannot be seen. Because of the {{gravitational}} effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter in the universe is dark matter. The spatial distribution of dark matter in the universe is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|E
5|$|Distant {{regions of}} space {{are assumed to}} exist and {{to be part of}} reality as much as we are, even though we can never {{interact}} with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>that</b> is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in <b>the</b> <b>Universe,</b> <b>that</b> such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E

25|$|In {{the book}} Ferris gives a {{detailed}} account of dark matter, a mysterious component of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> influences the behavior of galaxies. Cosmologists have made note of five levels of structures larger than galaxies. These are the so-called galaxy groups and clusters, galaxy clouds, superclusters, and supercluster complexes. Ferris points out in his book that it appears unlikely that the universe has a fractal geometry, that is larger and larger structuring complexes, because of his theories behind dark matter.|$|E

25|$|Another ancient flood myth is the Hindu {{story of}} Matsya the fish. According to this story, the god Vishnu {{takes the form}} of a fish and warns the {{ancestor}} Manu about a coming flood. He tells Manu to put all the creatures of the earth into a boat. Unlike the Biblical and Mesopotamian floods, however, this flood is not a unique event brought on by a divine choice; instead, it's one of the destructions and recreations of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> happen at regular intervals in Hindu mythology.|$|E

25|$|Further work by Hawking in {{the area}} of arrows of time led to the 1985 {{publication}} of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards. A paper by Don Page and independent calculations by Raymond Laflamme led Hawking to withdraw this concept. Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American Franklin Medal, and in 1982 made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). Awards do not pay the bills, however, and motivated by the need to finance the children's education and home expenses, in 1982 Hawking determined to write a popular book about <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> would be accessible to the general public. Instead of publishing with an academic press, he signed a contract with Bantam Books, a mass market publisher, and received a large advance for his book. A first draft of the book, called A Brief History of Time, was completed in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Bringing {{these two}} thesis {{together}}, Unger theorizes that {{laws of nature}} develop together with the phenomenon they explain. Laws and initial conditions co-evolve, in the same that they do in how cells reproduce and mutate in different levels of complexity of organisms. In cosmological terms Unger explains the passing from one structure to another at {{the origins of the}} universe when the state of energy was high but not infinite, and the freedom of movement was greater than when operating under a known set of laws. The conditions of the early universe is compatible with <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>that</b> preceded it. The new universe may be different in structure, but has been made with what existed in the old one, e.g. masses of elementary particles, strength of different forces, and cosmological constants. As the universe cools the phenomena and laws work together with materials produced by sequence; they are path dependent materials. They are also constrained by the family of resemblances of the effective laws against the background of the conceptions of alternative states the universe and succession of universes.|$|E
25|$|Green Lantern vol 3 #19 {{attempted}} to retcon Alan Scott's origin and power ring {{to accommodate the}} changes made by Crisis on Infinite Earths. In this story, Alan's ring originally belonged to a Green Lantern named Yalan Gur, who was so favored by the Guardians of <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>that</b> they removed the yellow impurity from his ring (which the Guardians deliberately placed in all the GL rings to limit their power and could be removed at their discretion). However, Yalan Gur abused his power and interfered with the inhabitants of ancient China. The Guardians then substituted a weakness for wood that allowed the local peasants to successfully attack and mortally wound Yalan with simple wooden clubs. Yalan flew into the sky and raged against the Guardians. His body burned in the atmosphere, becoming the green metallic meteorite that ultimately became Alan Scott's lantern. Yalan's spirit also possessed the metal, promising death in his rage and life when he realized his mistakes (the first two prophecies of the green metal, which were fulfilled). When Alan received the lantern, the spirit directed Alan to create the power ring and persona of Green Lantern, complete with the ring's weakness to wood.|$|E
