40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} several filler-modified epoxy resins was inves-tigated. Modifications of matrix resin with thermoplastic particulates or ceramic whiskers were proposed {{as an alternative}} to rubber-toughening for improving the impact resistance of epoxy resins. Addition of 10 % by weight of untreated <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>powders</b> in an epoxy resin only slightly increased the impact energy of the epoxy resin. A reduction in flexural strength of this thermoplastic particulate-filled resin was observed. This is most likely due to poor particulate-matrix bonding. Dispersion of 10 % of ceramic whiskers in an epoxy resin improved appreciably the impact energy, flexural strength and modulus of the epoxy. The impact energy absorbed by a resin was enhanced by the approach of partic-ulate / whisker hybridization. A uniform dispersion of either particulates or whiskers in the epoxy matrix is essential to the achievement of balanced mechanical properties. Deforma-tion and failure mechanisms in these composites were also examined using both SEM and instrumented impact testing...|$|R

The use of hemp fibres to reinforce the polymer aroused great interest and expectations amongst scientists and materials engineers.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} investigation into the fluidized-bed coating of cylindrical metal specimens using two types of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>powders,</b> Rilsan(R) PA 11, a nylon- 11 powder produced by Elf Atochem, France and Cotene(TM) 4612, a linear low density polyethylene powder produced by J. R Courtenay (New Zealand). The effects of dipping time, preheat temperature and particle size distribution on coating thickness and surface finish were investigated. Consistent trends in coating thickness growth with dipping time were obtained for both nylon- 11 and polyethylene powders with increases in coating thickness with preheat temperature. For the same preheat temperature, the lower melting point of polyethylene results in thicker coatings compared to those of nylon- 11. There is a negligible change in the coating thickness for sieved powders compared to that for unsieved powders. A pre-heat temperatures of between 240 degrees C and 300 degrees C is necessary to achieve an acceptable surface finish with both nylon- 11 and polyethylene powders. To minimize errors in achieving the desired coating thickness, dipping times shorter than 2 s are not recommended. The use of graphs of coating thickness versus dipping time in combination with the coating surface roughness plots presented in this paper enable the optimal choice of pre-heat temperature and dipping time to achieve acceptable surface finish.

Attention has been particularly focused on the relationship between baking time and temperature of EFB coated substrates and the morphological characteristics of the resulting polymeric films. First, thermal behaviour of PPA 571 H polymeric powders was characterized by using standard calorimetric techniques. Accordingly, PPA 571 H melting kinetic was experimentally deduced. Based upon experimental findings, predictive analytical model was also developed and employed to trace 'iso-conversion' curves out. Second. metal substrates, made from low carbon steel (AISI 1040), were EFB coated and baked at several baking time and temperatures. Combined analyses of scanning electron and confocal microscopes were led to measure the evolution of the films surface morphology under different baking conditions. Accordingly, a relationship between film morphologies and melting degree was sought. Consistent trends of roughness parameters versus baking parameters were found, with smoother finishes of the polymeric films being achieved for higher degrees of melting, that is, for higher baking temperature and time. Full maps and related analytical models of the finishing levels according to baking parameters were also built up, hence providing first useful indications to powder coaters on how to best deal with their settings.

40|$|WSU Vancouver Honors Thesis. Additive manufacturing, {{also called}} 3 D printing, is a {{technology}} undergoing development which holds {{the potential for}} rapid and cheap production of complicated and exotic parts. Particularly, it is an excellent method of manufacturing when one wishes to minimize material wastage, {{and it can be}} used to produce geometries that would otherwise be difficult or impossible with conventional manufacturing techniques. One of the newest 3 D printing technologies for thermoplastics is high speed sintering (HSS), which uses infrared light to sinter layers of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>powder</b> coated in radiation-absorbent material with an ink-jet printer head. HSS is promising in that it has material requirements similar to that of selective laser sintering (SLS).

40|$|<b>Thermoplastic</b> <b>powder</b> {{impregnation}} {{of continuous}} reinforcement filaments is studied in this work, focusing on impregnation mechanisms and interfacial phenomena. Various existing techniques to mingle powdered resins to continuous filaments are reviewed; a powder impregnation line designed at the Laboratoire de Technologie des Composites et Polymères (LTC) is presented. Two important types of powder coated towpregs are addressed: FIT bundles (Fibres Imprégnées de Thermoplastique) of powder loaded fibres enclosed {{in a thin}} resin sheath, and molten powder towpregs in which the particles are fixed to the fibres in an oven by melting the resin. The impregnation mechanisms of powder coated towpregs are examined. The formation of resin bridges between adjacent fibres is first investigated using a hot stage placed on a microscope. In the absence of externally applied pressure, impregnation is driven by surface energy effects. The driving forces leading to the spreading of the bridge along the fibres are analysed at two levels: at a macroscopic scale, characterising the capillary pressure governing the flow of a liquid into a porous solid, and at a micro-mechanical level analysing the capillary forces in a system defined by a liquid drop in contact with two solid particles. To achieve impregnation at a satisfactory rate, however, {{it is essential to}} apply external pressure to most thermoplastic systems during consolidation. An analytical model for the consolidation stage of unidirectional-powder coated towpregs is presented, placing in context effects due to surface energy, viscous flow, externally applied pressure and fibre bed elasticity. The initial conditions for the computation depend on the impregnation technique used. FIT bundles, and molten powder towpregs are examined. The model is compared at each stage to experimental data obtained by compression moulding powder impregnated towpregs in an instrumented hydraulic press using a closed matched-die mould. This model optimises the processing conditions of a given fibre-resin system to achieve a void free laminate with improved mechanical properties. Mechanical properties can further be improved by optimising interfacial adhesion between resin and fibres. Surface energy effects on composite mechanical properties are studied, relating thermodynamic quantities to adhesive strength. A criterion for optimum adhesion is proposed. The influence of the thermodynamic adhesion between fibres and matrix on the mechanical properties of a continuous fibre reinforced composite is studied for two systems: carbon fibre reinforced poly(ether-ether-ketone) and glass fibre reinforced poly(ether-imide). The fibre surface is modified chemically and characterised by optical contact angle measurements of molten resin droplets on the fibres. Unidirectional fibre reinforced laminates are manufactured. Transverse flexural strength is reported as a function of thermodynamic wetting parameters. Adhesion at the fibre-resin interface is found to correlate with both composite strength and void morphology within the laminate after consolidation. Full potential of powder coated towpregs as a precursor for compression moulded composite parts can be reached by the fabrication of drapeable textile preforms. Corrugated sheets are processed usign FIT woven fabrics. Mechanical property measurements show that complex high quality parts can be processed at high rates using powder coated towpregs...|$|E

40|$|Sintering is {{a typical}} process for metal powders which can be {{effectively}} agglomerated by a solid state diffusion mechanism.

Anyway, such applications have been mentioned about sintering of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>powders</b> in the scientific literature. In this study, sintering has been used {{for the first time to}} agglomerate thermoset powders coming from recycling of fiberglass. This way, two interesting results have been obtained.

Moreover, it has been shown that sintering can lead to very high thickness products which are very difficult to obtain by typical molding processes because of shrinkage or frozen stresses. In order to show the feasibility of this new process, some powders have been collected from the waste of industrial partners. These powders have been molded without the addition of any other material so as to produce small plates or thick bricks. In such cases, a polyester coating was also added to improve the surface quality of the brick.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{fluidized}} bed coating of metal substrates with high performance <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>powders</b> (polyftalamide, PPA). Two different experimental scenarios were investigated: the conventional hot dipping fluidized bed (CHDFB) process and the electrostatic fluidized bed (EFB) coating process. The preliminary experimental plan was scheduled employing design of experiment (DOE) technique. Three experimental factors and operative ranges large enough for practical purposes were considered in both of the examined scenarios. In particular, coating time and airflow rate were chosen as experimental factors in both CHDFB and EFB. The third factor was the preheating temperature of metal substrates in CHDFB and the applied voltage in EFB. A general linear model based upon analysis of variance (ANOVA) {{was used to evaluate}} the significance on coating processes of each experimental factor. Main effect plots (MEPs) and interaction plots (IPs) of coating thickness were drawn. Trends consistent with the settings of the operative parameters were displayed. The experimental trends were first modelled by numerical regression of the experimental data and, subsequently, by using artificial neural network. The reliability of the neural network solution and of the built ad hoc regression models was comparatively evaluated. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network trained with back propagation (BP) algorithm was found to be the most valuable in fitting the coating thicknesses trends for both the coating processes. Examining the developed models outside the operative ranges they were designed for, the good generalization capability and high flexibility of the neural network solution was definitely stated.

40|$|Early on, it {{was found}} that NEAT LARC-TPI <b>thermoplastic</b> {{polyimide}} <b>powder</b> behaved elastoplastically at pressures to 20 ksi and temperatures to 260 degrees celcius (below MP). At high resin assay, resin powder could be continuously cold-flowed around individual carbon fibers in a metal rolling mill. At low resin assay (2 : 1, C:TPI), fiber breakage was prohibitive. Thus, although processing of TPI below MP would be quite unique, it appears that the polymer must be melted and flowed to produce low resin assay prepreg. Fiber tow was spread to 75 mm using a venturi slot tunnel. This allowed intimate powder/fiber interaction. Two techniques were examined for getting room temperature powder onto the room temperature fiber surface. Electrostatic powder coating allows the charged powder to cling tenaciously to the fiber, even while heated with a hot air gun to above its melt temperature. A variant of the wet slurry coating process was also explored. The carbon fibers are first wetted with water. Then dry powder is sprinkled onto the wet tow and doctor-rolled between the fibers.

Commercially available printers are generally based on three main techniques: <b>thermoplastic</b> extrusion, <b>powder</b> deposition and stereolithography. Thermoplastic deposition uses a heated nozzle to extrude small beads of thermoplastic material. As the material hardens, new layers are built up to create a 3 D object. This method is employed in low-cost printers but lacks the resolution and flexibility {{of some of the}} other techniques. Powder deposition printers apply thin layers of binding material on the printer tray and then coat this with a thin layer of powder. This process is repeated to build up the powder/binder layers to create a 3 D object. This technique generally offers higher resolution than the extrusion technique. However, the final material is brittle and porous, requiring additional sealing for long-term use. Stereolithography-based printers employ a vat of light-curable resin and a laser light to build parts. The laser beam traces a cross section of the object {{on the surface of the}} liquid resin. Exposure to the laser light solidifies the pattern and joins it to the layer below, the resolution achievable is of the order of a few microns and the final build material is more durable than other 3 D printing techniques. These printers are now used for final production parts and can produce fine-resolution structures on a sufficient scale to create bespoke molecular imaging test objects.|$|R
