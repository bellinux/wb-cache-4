40|$|Abstract-The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the impact of various pre-processing models on the forecast capability of artificial neural network (ANN) when auditing financial accounts. Hence, the focus of this paper is on the pre-processing of <b>the</b> <b>data.</b> ANNs <b>are</b> selected for auditing purposes because they are capable of learning complex, non-linear underlying relationships. Therefore, they are used to model the dynamics and the relationships between account values in order to find unexpected fluctuations. This study uses a multi-layered neural network with the backpropagation algorithm. The artificial neural network model used in this study was built by using the financial statements of 31 manufacturing companies over four years. The values of the accounts were regarded as a time-series. <b>The</b> <b>data</b> <b>were</b> pre-processed in four different ways. Firstly, all <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>were</b> scaled linearly. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>were</b> pre-processed linearly on a yearly basis. Thirdly, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>were</b> pre-processed linearly on a company basis.

5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>is</b> collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>is</b> then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E
5|$|He {{writes that}} these {{positive}} results are achieved {{in a number}} of ways. Sometimes the industry-sponsored studies are flawed by design (for example by comparing the new drug to an existing drug at an inadequate dose), and sometimes patients are selected to make a positive result more likely. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>is</b> analysed as the trial progresses. If the trial seems to be producing negative data it is stopped prematurely and the results are not published, or if it is producing positive data it may be stopped early so that longer-term effects are not examined. He writes that this publication bias, where negative results remain unpublished, is endemic within medicine and academia. As a consequence, he argues, doctors may have no idea what the effects are of the drugs they prescribe.|$|E

5|$|Scuba diving {{fatalities}} have a {{major financial}} impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba, and when {{the cause of death}} is recorded as drowning, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>is</b> poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting.

5|$|Teams that toured other {{countries}} often became frustrated by lbws given against them; there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams.

However, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>is</b> based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success-rate of appeals to the umpire.

A 2006 study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the reasons were again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location.|$|E
