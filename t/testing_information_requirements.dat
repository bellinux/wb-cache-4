40|$|In 2004 the EU Commission {{initiated}} several REACH Implementation Projects (RIP) {{for development}} of technical guidance documents {{in support of the}} new EU Chemicals Legislation (REACH). The Nordic countries have worked on Information strategies in order to provide an early input to the RIP on information strategies that will prepare guidance documents to Industry regarding testing of chemicals. Guidance is needed on how the information should be generated, in a manner integrating different kinds of data by a weight of evidence approach (e. g., (Q) SAR, in vitro, in vivo data). The information strategies are stepwise procedures, where a higher level of data corresponds to more relevant, certain and accurate test data. The strategies should assist in deciding when sufficient data is available for the regulatory needs (e. g., classification and labelling, PBT-assessment, and risk assessment), considering the tonnage-based requirement set out by REACH. As the basis for elaboration of information strategies for selected environmental and human health end-points (to be published as part 2), some of the currently available <b>testing</b> and <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> have been reviewed, e. g., the EU TGD, OECD guidance documents, and the REACH proposal. It has also been considered how data can be used for classification according to the GHS system. The analysis covers all environmental endpoints, and several human health endpoints.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the early phases of information systems (IS) development projects is to determine users' <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> Systems analysts' primary concern is to secure <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> that are stable over {{the duration of the}} project.

Three hypotheses were derived from the model and tested using data collected on 67 IS projects. Established measures were used to measure the variables of the model. Statistical tests led to the rejection of the hyptheses relating project size, task structure, and the congruence variable to user satisfaction.

40|$|Within the EU FP 6 project OSIRIS {{approaches}} to Integrated Testing Strategies (ITSs) were developed, {{with the aim}} to facilitate the use of non-test and non-animal <b>testing</b> <b>information</b> in regulatory risk assessment of chemicals. This paper describes an analytical Weight-of-Evidence (WoE) approach to an ITS for the endpoint of skin sensitisation. It specifically addresses the European chemicals legislation REACH, but the concept is readily applicable to ITS and WoE procedures in other regulatory frameworks, and for other toxicological endpoints. Bayesian statistics are applied to estimate the reliability of a conclusion on the sensitisation potential of a chemical, combining evidence from different information sources such as QSAR model predictions, in vitro and in vivo test results. The methodology allows for adaptation {{of the weight of}} individual information sources to account for the different levels of reliability of the individual ITS components. The calculated reliability of the WoE conclusion gives an objective, transparent and reproducible measure to decide if the <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> for data evaluation are satisfied. Furthermore, in case the WoE is not sufficient, it gives the possibility to evaluate a priori if and how {{it will be possible to}} fulfil the <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> with additional <b>tests</b> and/or model predictions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores global {{business}} performance outcomes {{as a result}} of aligning ERP systems capabilities to {{global business}} <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> Global business is a network of interconnected organizations that have multinational operations and exchange finished goods, raw materials, services, information, knowledge, skills and capital across national boundaries. It is a new business trend in which organisations from all industry sectors capitalize on cheap labour, low cost capital, unique resources and new market opportunities in the global economy. Global business management entails unique <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> from strategic business units (SBSs) operating {{in different parts of the}} world. Global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> include: 1) multi-level and multi-purpose information from global SBUs; 2) accurate and timely information; 3) consolidated information; 4) global business process information; 5) global supply chain information; and 6) secure information. The first three <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> are important for supporting management decisions while the other three are important for supporting global businesses’ operating decisions. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have been increasingly adopted to meet global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> ERP systems capabilities that support global business information management include multi-level and multi-purpose information management; delivering accurate, timely and consolidated information; integrating global business process information; managing global supply chain information and transmitting secure information. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) technique this research established that if two variables (global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> and ERP systems capabilities) co-align, this resulted in improved business performance. The co-alignment in this research is adopted from Venkatraman’s explanation of “fit as co-variation/co-alignment” perspective. Performance outcomes of global business {{as a result of}} co-aligning ERP systems capabilities and global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> are measured using four perspectives: financial performance; customer performance; learning and growth performance; and internal business process performance. Findings of this research supported the conceptualisation of fit from the co-alignment/co-variation perspective, confirming that the co-alignment of global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> and ERP systems capabilities leads to better business performance of global organizations. The findings also confirmed that global organisations have unique <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> that are somewhat different to local businesses. ERP systems are able to support global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> Findings also confirmed that the financial, customer, learning and growth and internal business process performance of global organizations are moderated by the organization size and the globalization history. Not only does this research fill the void in global business literature by investigating the important role information plays in global business management, but it extends the ERP literature and IT/IS alignment theories to the co-alignment of IS capabilities with global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> for improved performance outcomes. The major contribution to knowledge this research makes is the development and validation of a co-alignment model, extending theories of IT/IS alignment to the alignment of a specific information system (ERP system) to a specific type of business (global business) ...|$|R

As a result, three important determinants for the correctness of requirement specifications have been identified: the knowledge of <b>information</b> analysts, <b>requirement</b> analysis techniques, and problem domains. In {{order to identify}} and explain the important variables for the correctness of requirement specifications, various cognitive models have been built on the basis of different cognitive theories such as normative models, problem solving models, mental models, and comprehension models. However, they are inadequate because they are focused on some rather than all of the three determinants. As a result, two issues related to requirement analysis techniques cannot be accounted for: First, no requirement analysis technique can consistently outperform the others. Second, experienced information analysts use multiple requirement analysis techniques in analyzing complex information systems. This research suggests that an adequate cognitive model need to meet two requirements: first, it can explicate the interactive relationships among the three determinants of <b>information</b> <b>requirement</b> analysis, and second, it can explain the two unsolved issues for requirement analysis techniques The importance of an adequate cognitive model can be shown in four aspects: (1) it provides an adequate model for <b>information</b> <b>requirement</b> analysis; (2) it provides a basis for empirical validation; (3) it provides a framework for viewing and comparing important aspects of <b>information</b> <b>requirement</b> analysis; and (4) it provides a theoretical basis for the design of computer-aided software engineering tools...|$|R

Background There has been considerable emphasis in the literature on information systems (IS) development on using structured approaches as a means of identifying <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> for systems development. An assumption underpinning such approaches is that formal, Information Technology-based data processing systems are the medium through which <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> can be best met (c. f.

This is so, despite the fact that authors in the IS field [2] and in the field of organization theory [3] have long emphasised the significance of the informal, political and interpretative aspects of information. The aim {{of this paper is to}} contribute to the discussion of automated tools in IS development by providing a contrasting perspective on <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> analysis as being socially mediated and thereby requiring awareness of the socio-political aspects of the IS development process and associated techniques.
