The opera in three acts explores the relationship and emotions between two characters during three specific periods in their lives, during youth, middle age and finally, old age. The composer's use of atonal musical language, octatonic scales and the occasional tonal passage are directly linked with the various emotions of the characters and <b>the</b> <b>unfolding</b> <b>of</b> the drama.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSingle-molecule force-clamp {{spectroscopy}} is {{a valuable}} tool to analyze <b>unfolding</b> kinetics <b>of</b> proteins. Previous force-clamp spectroscopy experiments have demonstrated that <b>the</b> mechanical <b>unfolding</b> <b>of</b> ubiquitin deviates from the generally assumed Markovian behavior and involves the features of glassy dynamics. Here we use single molecule force-clamp spectroscopy to study <b>the</b> <b>unfolding</b> kinetics <b>of</b> a computationally designed fast-folding mutant of the small protein GB 1, which shares a similar β-grasp fold as ubiquitin. By treating <b>the</b> mechanical <b>unfolding</b> <b>of</b> polyproteins as <b>the</b> superposition of multiple identical Poisson processes, we developed a simple stochastic analysis approach to analyze the dwell time distribution <b>of</b> individual <b>unfolding</b> events in polyprotein unfolding trajectories. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that <b>the</b> mechanical <b>unfolding</b> <b>of</b> NuG 2 fulfills all criteria of a memoryless Markovian process. This result, in contrast with <b>the</b> complex mechanical <b>unfolding</b> behaviors observed for ubiquitin, serves as a direct experimental demonstration of the Markovian behavior for <b>the</b> mechanical <b>unfolding</b> <b>of</b> a protein and reveals <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unfolding</b> dynamics among structurally similar proteins. Furthermore, we extended our method into a robust and efficient pseudo-dwell-time analysis method, which allows one to make full use <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>unfolding</b> events obtained in force-clamp experiments without categorizing <b>the</b> <b>unfolding</b> events. This method enabled us to measure the key parameters characterizing <b>the</b> mechanical <b>unfolding</b> energy landscape <b>of</b> NuG 2 with improved precision. We anticipate that the methods demonstrated here will find broad applications in single-molecule force-clamp spectroscopy studies {{for a wide range}} of proteins...|$|R

5|$|In 1844, the Scottish {{publisher}} Robert Chambers anonymously {{published an}} extremely controversial but widely read book entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for {{the origins of}} the Solar System and of life on Earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals, with current animals branching off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to <b>the</b> <b>unfolding</b> <b>of</b> a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant, but its implication that humans were only the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. The high profile of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>The</b> <b>unfolding</b> speed <b>of</b> some hyperthermophilic {{proteins}} {{is dramatically}} {{lower than that}} of their mesostable homologs. Ribonuclease HII from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis (Tk-RNase HII) is stabilized by its remarkably slow unfolding rate, whereas RNase HI from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus (Tt-RNase HI) unfolds rapidly, comparable with to that of RNase HI from Escherichia coli (Ec-RNase HI). Results To clarify whether the difference in <b>the</b> <b>unfolding</b> rate is due to differences in the types of RNase H or differences in proteins from archaea and bacteria, we examined the equilibrium stability and <b>unfolding</b> reaction <b>of</b> RNases HII from the hyperthermophilic bacteria Thermotoga maritima (Tm-RNase HII) and Aquifex aeolicus (Aa-RNase HII) and RNase HI from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus tokodaii (Sto-RNase HI). These proteins from hyperthermophiles are more stable than Ec-RNase HI over all the temperature ranges examined. <b>The</b> observed <b>unfolding</b> speeds <b>of</b> all hyperstable proteins at the different denaturant concentrations studied are much lower than those of Ec-RNase HI, which is in accordance with <b>the</b> familiar slow <b>unfolding</b> <b>of</b> hyperstable proteins. However, <b>the</b> <b>unfolding</b> rate constants <b>of</b> these RNases H in water are dispersed, and <b>the</b> <b>unfolding</b> rate constant <b>of</b> thermophilic archaeal proteins is {{lower than that of}} thermophilic bacterial proteins. Conclusions These results suggest that <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> slow <b>unfolding</b> <b>of</b> thermophilic proteins is determined by the evolutionary history of the organisms involved. <b>The</b> <b>unfolding</b> rate constants in water are related to the amount of buried hydrophobic residues in the tertiary structure. </p...|$|R
