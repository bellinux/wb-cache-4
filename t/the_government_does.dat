There must be some substance in the applicant's complaint – <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> not have an immediate duty to justify making a decision that restricts the applicant's right to freedom of speech simply because the applicant complains of an alleged infringement of Article 15(1).|$|E
5|$|Stossel {{has written}} three books. Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media is a 2005 {{autobiography}} from Harper Perennial documenting {{his career and}} philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel– Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, {{which was published in}} 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Stossel's third book No, They Can't: Why Government Fails– But Individuals Succeed. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{constitution}} and laws prohibit discrimination against people with {{physical or mental}} disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other state services, but <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not effectively enforce these laws. A specific law also mandates access to buildings for persons with disabilities; however, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not effectively enforce it.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{legislative}} councillor Gary Fan {{claimed that the}} protests happened because <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not take any adjustment policies. He suggested that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> should put limitation on the individual visit scheme and cancel multiple-entry permit. He believed that the demonstrations will continue if <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>do</b> not adjust their policy.|$|R

The {{head of the}} junta, however, gave several speeches highlighting the importance of combating human trafficking. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not monitor immigration or emigration patterns for evidence of trafficking. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not take steps to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts.|$|R

25|$|Discrimination {{based on}} race, gender, disability, language, {{and social status}} is {{prohibited}} by the constitution and laws; however, women and disabled people continue to experience discrimination, and <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> little to combat it.|$|E

25|$|Some aid {{agencies}} {{have reported that}} the toll may be higher than the official figures because <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not track deaths in rural areas where people never reached a hospital or emergency treatment center.

25|$|Child abuse {{continues}} to occur {{and is not}} uncommon; for example, a University of Buenos Aires study released in August 2008 noted that 56 kindergartens and primary schools in Buenos Aires Province had detected 1,590 cases of family violence in the previous year. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> however take some measures to combat child abuse.|$|E
25|$|Discriminatory acts constituting {{harassment}} or infringement of a person's dignity on {{the basis}} of origin, citizenship, race, religion, or sex (Penal Code Article 313).

25|$|As a {{response}} to globalization, some countries have embraced isolationist policies. For example, the North Korean government makes {{it very difficult for}} foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.|$|E

25|$|Security {{agencies}} sporadically persecuted Muslim {{converts to}} Christianity. In Egypt <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not officially recognize conversions from Islam to Christianity; because certain interfaith marriages {{are not allowed}} either, this prevents marriages between converts to Christianity and those born in Christian communities, and also results in the children of Christian converts being classified as Muslims and given a Muslim education.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> {{not allow}} public movie theaters to exist, and {{permission}} to hold film festivals is rarely granted, but censored versions of films can be legally purchased in many retail stores.

25|$|Religious {{freedom is}} {{virtually}} non-existent. <b>The</b> <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> not provide legal recognition or protection {{for freedom of}} religion, and it is severely restricted in practice. As a matter of policy, the Government guarantees and protects the right to private worship for all, including non-Muslims who gather in homes for religious practice; however, this right is not always respected in practice and is not defined in law.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> {{not provide}} {{substantive}} evidence of protection of trafficking victims during the reporting period. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> restricted <b>the</b> ability of {{international and domestic}} NGOs to operate in Cuba. In partnership with one NGO and another government, Cuba continued to fund the operation of two centers treating sexually abused children, but <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not provide information about who received treatment in these centers. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> also provided funding for women’s shelters where victims could access care, though <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not provide information about who received treatment at the shelters. According to UNICEF, both the centers for children and the women’s shelters are used by trafficking victims, and the staff is trained specifically on how to identify and treat trafficking victims. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not report that police and other officials employed procedures to proactively identify trafficking victims, such as people in prostitution, and guide them to services, but a UNICEF representative indicated that the police receive specific training on identifying trafficking victims and information about how to refer them to available services. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> provided no evidence that it encouraged trafficking victims {{to assist in the}} investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders.|$|R
25|$|The Constitution {{provides}} {{for freedom of}} religion, and the government generally respects this right. While {{separation of church and}} state is mandated by the Constitution, Liberia is considered a Christian state in practice. Public schools offer biblical studies, though parents may opt their children out. Commerce is prohibited by law on Sundays and major Christian holidays. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not require businesses or schools to excuse Muslims for Friday prayers.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> {{not permit}} non-Muslim clergy {{to enter the}} country for the purpose of {{conducting}} religious services, although some come under other auspices and perform religious functions in secret. Such restrictions make it very difficult for most non-Muslims to maintain contact with clergymen and attend services. Catholics and Orthodox Christians, who require a priest on a regular basis to receive the sacraments required by their faith, particularly are affected.|$|E

While simplified characters are taught exclusively in schools, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not officially discourage the use of traditional characters. While all official publications are in simplified characters, the government still allows parents to choose whether to have their child's Chinese name registered in simplified or traditional characters.|$|E
