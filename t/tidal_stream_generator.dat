25|$|<b>Tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>generators</b> (or TSGs) {{make use}} of the kinetic energy of moving water to power {{turbines}}, in a similar way to wind turbines that use wind to power turbines. Some tidal generators can be built into the structures of existing bridges or are entirely submersed, thus avoiding concerns over impact on the natural landscape. Land constrictions such as straits or inlets can create high velocities at specific sites, which can be captured with the use of turbines. These turbines can be horizontal, vertical, open, or ducted.|$|R

30|$|Tidal stream energy works {{much like}} hydro-electric power (HEP) and wind turbine (WT) systems that use {{underwater}} devices that resemble wind turbines and {{are placed in}} fast tidal streams to extract energy. An array of these devices is often deployed to deliver significant amounts of energy to the electricity grid. The amount of energy obtainable from a tidal energy power system varies with location and time. A single <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>generator</b> is, however, able to produce significantly more power than a wind turbine due to the higher density of water. The output changes as the tide ebb and flood are daily varying {{by a factor of}} four over a spring-neap cycle. Nonetheless, tidal energy is highly predictable in both magnitude and timing, more so than the wind and solar forms of energy. Tidal currents are the horizontal components of the flow of water that are associated with propagating waves. We note that in some regards, the velocities can be greatly enhanced and magnified in straits between islands or between islands and mainland [2]. The current in the water is, thus, much more reliable than the wind in the air.|$|E
40|$|Tidal {{stream power}} {{generation}} offers {{the prospect of}} predictable, low-CO 2 power {{at a number of}} locations around the UK and the world. Previous assessments of tidal energy resources have taken the form of desk studies based on simplified navigational data. Where numerical model data has been used it has been at too low a resolution to capture high velocity tidal flows constrained by coastal topography. Analytical solutions for maximum energy extraction in simple tidal channels have been produced, but they have not been extended to more complex open-boundary cases such as flow around headlands and islands. There is therefore a role for site-specific numerical modelling, which when validated, offers the twin advantages of a high-resolution picture of the resource and allowing simulation of momentum extraction within the model to take place. In order to parameterize the sub-grid-scale momentum extraction in such models, a new analytical model of the velocity reduction in a large array of tidal turbines has been derived. The model extends previous models of large wind turbine arrays and uses analogies with flow through submerged vegetation. It provides an equivalent added drag coefficient suitable for use in a 2 -D coastal numerical model. A numerical model of the flows in the region of the Portland Bill headland has been produced, forced by tidal elevations at the free boundary. A site selection exercise was carried out for the Portland Bill location and an area of around 12 km 2 was identified as having a high potential for development using mean cubed speed found through tidal analysis of model results without energy extraction. A large <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>generator</b> array has also been simulated within the Portland Bill model—linked to the new model for momentum extraction—and was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the tidal parameters in the locality. This was the first time that a large tidal array has been simulated in a realistic coastal domain of large extent, with a parameterization that takes into account the interaction of the turbines with the rough-wall flow in the natural state. Results predict that there is a region downstream of the array extending approximately 5 – 10 km around the simulated tidal stream turbine array in which the tidal stream ellipse major axis is reduced by at least 5 %. In the area of momentum extraction the principal semi-diurnal tidal stream ellipse major axis length was reduced by 10 – 15 %. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

50|$|<b>Tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>generators</b> draw {{energy from}} water {{currents}} {{in much the}} same way as wind turbines draw energy from air currents. However, the potential for power generation by an individual tidal turbine can be greater than that of similarly rated wind energy turbine. The higher density of water relative to air (water is about 800 times the density of air) means that a single generator can provide significant power at low tidal flow velocities compared with similar wind speed. Given that power varies with the density of medium and the cube of velocity, water speeds of nearly one-tenth the speed of wind provide the same power for the same size of turbine system; however this limits the application in practice to places where tide speed is at least 2 knots (1 m/s) even close to neap tides. Furthermore, at higher speeds in a flow between 2 and 3 metres per second in seawater a tidal turbine can typically access four times as much energy per rotor swept area as a similarly rated power wind turbine.|$|R
40|$|Ireland set out {{to produce}} 33 % of its {{electricity}} demand from renewable sources by 2020 and reduce emissions {{to the level of}} 1990 in accordance with the Kyoto agreement. These targets require investments in a diverse range of power sources. This paper investigates if <b>Tidal</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>Generators</b> (TSG) can become an economically viable system. Initially a levelised cost was established for tidal and other energies at a baseline year of 2010. Due to t he early stage of development of tidal energy, it is difficult to accurately predict its future capital investment and operational cost. For this reason future costs were estimated for all energy forms and a present worth was established. From this a level ised cost over the project lifetime was calculated. At this point it was found that Tidal Energy was a competitive form of energy. The feasibility of tidal energy was assessed using both constant and varying Renewable Feed In Tariffs (REFIT). Using 2010 v alues a profit of ? 1. 671 Billion could be achieved with a maximum investment of ? 135 million. However if REFIT changed to 32 ?/MWh after the contractual 15 years, a profit of around ? 200 million can be achieved with a maximum investment of around ? 213 million...|$|R
5000|$|Tidal Farms utilize <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>generators</b> {{that are}} grouped {{together}} to produce electricity. These generators use the moving tides to turn turbines {{that are very}} similar the wind turbines used on land. The power {{of the ocean and}} the turbines advance technology guarantee a much more predictable energy output then regular wind turbines. The turbines are usually located in areas with high tidal activity in order for the generators to be as efficient as possible. What makes tidal farms unique is that they are set up in groups to allow much more energy production. The generators are connected to substations on shore to transform voltage from high to low, or low to high. These generators can be semi-submersible or fixed into the sea floor, which means they would be out of sight and not an eyesore for the public. The turbines that would be used would be very slow moving due to the density of the water, this is very beneficial to the aquatic life because fish would be able to freely pass through without being in danger of dying. Some turbines can also be used in irrigation canals, rivers, and dam whether the flow of water is fast or slow.|$|R
5000|$|Tidal {{fences and}} turbines, if {{constructed}} properly, pose less environmental threats than tidal barrages. Tidal fences and turbines, like <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>generators,</b> rely {{entirely on the}} kinetic motion of the tidal currents and do not use dams or barrages to block channels or estuarine mouths. Unlike barrages, tidal fences do not interrupt fish migration or alter hydrology, thus these options offer energy generating capacity without dire environmental impacts. Tidal fences and turbines can have varying environmental impacts depending {{on whether or not}} fences and turbines are constructed with regard to the environment. The main environmental impact of turbines is their impact on fish. If the turbines are moving slowly enough, such as low velocities of 25-50 rpm, fish kill is minimalized and silt and other nutrients are able to flow through the structures For example, a 20 kW tidal turbine prototype built in the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1983 reported no fish kills Tidal fences block off channels, which makes it difficult for fish and wildlife to migrate through those channels. In order to reduce fish kill, fences could be engineered so that the spaces between the caisson wall and the rotor foil are large enough to allow fish to pass through Larger marine mammals such as seals or dolphins can be protected from the turbines by fences or a sonar sensor auto-braking system that automatically shuts the turbines down when marine mammals are detected ...|$|R
40|$|Oceanic tides {{have the}} {{potential}} to yield a vast amount of renewable energy. <b>Tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>generators</b> are one of the key technologies for extracting and harnessing this potential. In order to extract an economically useful amount of power, hundreds of tidal turbines must typically be deployed in an array. This naturally leads {{to the question of how}} these turbines should be configured to extract the maximum possible power: the positioning and the individual tuning of the turbines could significantly influence the extracted power, and hence is of major economic interest. However, manual optimisation is difficult due to legal site constraints, nonlinear interactions of the turbine wakes, and the cubic dependence of the power on the flow speed. The novel contribution of this paper is the formulation of this problem as an optimisation problem constrained by a physical model, which is then solved using an efficient gradient-based optimisation algorithm. In each optimisation iteration, a two-dimensional finite element shallow water model predicts the flow and the performance of the current array configuration. The gradient of the power extracted with respect to the turbine positions and their tuning parameters is then computed in a fraction of the time taken for a flow solution by solving the associated adjoint equations. These equations propagate causality backwards through the computation, from the power extracted back to the turbine positions and the tuning parameters. This yields the gradient at a cost almost independent of the number of turbines, which is crucial for any practical application. The utility of the approach is demonstrated by optimising turbine arrays in four idealised scenarios and a more realistic case with up to 256 turbines in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, Scotland...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>generators</b> extract {{kinetic energy}} from tidal flows and convert it to electricity. Such {{hydrodynamic}} impacts could {{have implications for}} sediment movement and the larger-scale morphology of a site. This study investigates the likely relative impacts of multiple large-scale extraction-scenarios upon a real-world submarine sandbank, the Alderney South Banks. The {{first phase of the}} study is an analysis of the South Banks, rooted in the literature of sandbank morphology, and performed using high-resolution bathymetry and sedimentary data. Cross-sections of large migrating sandwaves superimposed upon the sandbank were interpreted to generate a map of the sediment transport pathways. Unusually large sandwave migration rates of up to 70 m across a 50 day period were observed {{in one part of the}} Bank. The second, larger phase of the study involved the development of a 2 -D numerical model to simulate the tidal flows in the vicinity of Alderney and across the wider English Channel. The model was elevation-forced using nine tidal constituents at its open boundaries and validated against tidal level and tidal-stream velocity data obtained from port tide-gauges and ADCP deployments. An existing, area-averaged roughness method for parameterising the effects of energy extraction for tidal arrays was incorporated into the model. A numerical sediment model was setup to be coupled and run in parallel with the hydrodynamic computation. An identical 300 MW tidal array parameterisation was applied to the model in 17 different locations to simulate 17 different energy extraction scenarios. The model was run for one-spring neap cycling, lasting 14. 8 days. Outputs from each model run were combined with outputs from a non-extraction baseline model to assess the hydrodynamic impacts of the modelled extraction scenario in the sandbank vicinity. A set of sedimentary model-runs were also performed for a longer 90 -day period with the sediment module activated. A hard-bottom method was used to limit potential erosion depths within the sediment model and to ensure realistic sediment supply. Three difference metrics were used to systematically compare the impact of each extraction scenario upon the South Banks. These were the residual current, the residual sediment transport and the bed-level evolution. The difference metrics were used to rank the 17 extraction scenarios in terms of likely impact upon the South Banks from highest to lowest. The results show that the impact of energy extraction decreases with the distance of array placement from the North-Eastern tip of the South Banks. A propagating eddy shed from the headland is closely related to velocities in this region with energy-extraction decreasing the rotational velocity and life-time of the eddy. The processed modelling outputs are interpreted within the context of the initial morphological analysis to help predict how the sediment transport pathways will be altered. Results suggest that the most favourable locations for maximising power output whilst minimising impacts over the South Banks are two particular regions, T 63 or T 49...|$|R
