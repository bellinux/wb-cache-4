The divided weight of the Ratte included 300 tonnes of armament (the total weight of the guns themselves was 100 tonnes, so turret armour would have weighed 200 tonnes), 200 tonnes of armour and frame and 100 tonnes of track and automotive components, while remaining weight would be distributed to miscellaneous features.

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} is {{a common}} problem in the southeastern United States, especially on sandy soils as found in the Coastal Plain of NC. One of the main causes of soil compaction is equipment traffic in fields. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the amount of traffic occurring in North Carolina fields and the effect that the level of traffic had on soil compaction as measured by soil bulk density. GPS was used to map all traffic on these fields in 2006. Using measurements of <b>tread</b> <b>widths</b> and wheel spacing, a series of processes in a GIS was performed to generate a map indicating the level of traffic that occurred in each area of the field. After all field operations were complete as well as the GIS analysis, fields were sampled for bulk density again. Sample locations were then based on the number of passes that had occurred. Initial results showed that 65 - 85 % of the field’s area was tracked. Bulk density ranged from 0. 5 to 0. 8 g/cm 3 in the organic soil, and from 1. 6 to 1. 8 g/cm 3 in the sandy soils. Initial results show that in the organic soil, areas of the field that were tracked at least four times had significantly higher bulk density in the 0 - 10 cm depth than the areas that received no tracks...|$|R

2500|$|The 1968 Chevelle {{received}} an all-new distinctly sculpted body with tapered front fenders and a rounded beltline. The car adopted a long-hood/short-deck profile {{with a high}} rear-quarter [...] "kick-up". While all 1967 Chevelle models rode a [...] wheelbase, the 1968 coupes and convertibles now rode a [...] wheelbase.

Hardtop coupes featured a semi-fastback, flowing roofline (with a long hood and short deck, mimicking the Camaro (which itself was {{an answer to the}} Ford Mustang). Top-trim models (including the SS 396 and new luxury Concours) featured GM's new Hide-A-Way wiper system. Lesser Chevelles would get that change later. The entry level Chevelle 300 (131 - 132 VIN prefix) was available as a pillared coupe and/or station wagon (Nomad) while the 300 Deluxe and Nomad Custom (133 or 134 VIN prefix) had a 2 door hardtop added to the lineup (fourth and fifth VIN characters will be 37; with the previous 300 Deluxe the hardtop was available with the Malibu and SS396 but not the base 300/Deluxe in the USA not counting those produced for the Canadian market). The Super Sport (SS396 sport coupe, convertible, and El Camino pickup) became series on its own. Chevrolet produced 60,499 SS 396 sport coupes, 2,286 convertibles, and 5,190 El Caminos; 1968 was the only year the El Camino body style would get its own SS396 series designation (13880). [...] Black-accented Super Sports had F70x14 red-stripe tires and a standard 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch Turbo-Jet V8 engine with the special twin-domed hood; 350 and 375-horsepower 396 engines were optional. The SS 396 sport coupe started at $2,899 - or $236 more than a comparable Malibu with its 307-cubic-inch V8. All-vinyl bucket seats and a console were optional. [...] Three luxury Concours options became available in March 1968 for the 4-door sedan, the 4-door sport sedan and consisted of special sound insulation, and a deep-padded instrument panel with simulated woodgrain accents and all-vinyl color-keyed interiors.

50|$|Other touring bikes use 26-inch wheels {{for both}} {{off-road}} and on-road use. Advantages of the slightly smaller wheel include additional strength, worldwide tire availability, and lighter weight. Some touring bicycles, {{such as the}} Rivendell Atlantis and Surly Long Haul Trucker, offer frames designed for 26-inch (ISO 559) wheels or for 700C wheels, with the frame geometry optimal for the selected wheel size. Specially made touring tires for 26-inch wheels are now widely available, especially in developing countries, where 700C {{may be difficult to}} obtain. Hence, on the mass ride from Paris to the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the Fédération Française de Cyclotourisme asked all riders to use 26-inch wheels.Factors that affect rolling resistance include tire air pressure, <b>tread</b> and tire <b>width</b> as well as wheel size.|$|R

50|$|Sheet-of-Light Laser (SL) Systems were {{introduced}} in 2003, and have emerged as the most capable and reliable run-out, bulge and depression measurement methods. SL sensors project a laser line instead of a laser point, and thereby create a very large area-of-interest. Sidewall sensors can easily span an area from the bead area to the tread shoulder, and inspect the complete sidewall for bulge and depression defects. Large radial sensors can span 300mm or more to cover the entire <b>tread</b> <b>width.</b> This enables characterization of RRO in multiple tracks. SL sensors also feature stand off distances large enough to assure no collisions with the tire. Two-dimensional tread void filtering and sidewall letter filtering are also employed to eliminate these characteristics from the runout measurements.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple {{model for the}} behavior of a pneumatic tire when vertically loaded. The model is based on {{the behavior of a}} thick-skinned spherical membrane (like a basketball) being compressed between two flat plates. The model is reasonably accurate for bicycle, motorcycle, truck, general purpose, and early model automobile tires which all have a circular cross-section. However modern automobile tires have a wide aspect ratio when unloaded, have unloaded line contact with the ground across the <b>tread</b> <b>width,</b> and have relatively stiff sidewalls that contribute to the tire’s load carrying capability (and in the case of run-flat tires can totally support the car’s weight). Thus the analysis in this paper is quantitatively representative for tires of initially round cross-section, like a typical motorcycle tire, but provides only a qualitative idea of the tire support mechanism for modern automobile tires...|$|E

In the present research, experiments were conducted to evaluate {{the performance of a}} rectangular Cascade Aeration System with varying flow rates, risers and tread by maintaining constant width of the channel using water collected from reverse osmosis plant. The experiments were carried out with four different risers such as 0. 15 m, 0. 18 m, 0. 225 m and 0. 30 m. Each rise was investigated with five different tread of 0. 60 m, 0. 55 m, 0. 50 m, 0. 45 m and 0. 40 m. Comprehensive experimental investigations were carried out for different hydraulic loading rates of 0. 005 to 0. 035 m 3 /s/m 2. Results obtained from the experiments reveals that increasing dimensionless discharges promotes more aeration, attains a maximum up to dimensionless discharge= 2. 22 and beyond this there was a significant decrease in aeration. In addition, the increased in number of steps significantly enhances air entertainment and surface fall rate in the Stepped Cascade Aeration System. A regression equation was derived by keeping aeration efficiency as response with dimensionless discharge and oxygen saturation concentration as influencing parameters. The dimension less discharge is a function of critical depth of the rectangular channel and step height, whereas oxygen saturation concentration represents the ratio of oxygen deficit and oxygen saturation concentration.
