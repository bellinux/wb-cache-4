5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> with an {{internal}} cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E

25|$|Its main {{armament}} {{consists of}} a 76.2mm D-56T series rifled tank gun, which has an effective range of approximately 1,500 meters and a rate of fire of six to eight rounds per minute. This gun is 42 calibers long. The PT-76 carries 40 rounds for its gun. A typical ammunition load consists of 24 x OF-350 Frag-HE, 4 x subcaliber AP-T, 4 x AP-T and 8 x BK-350M HEAT rounds. The gun is mounted in an oval dish-type circular <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> turret with flat, sloping sides which is mounted over the second, third, and fourth pair of road wheels. All PT-76s have a fume extractor for the main gun {{at the rear of}} the turret.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of autoclave process on the stiffness properties of thermoplastic composite <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> made by automated fiber placement technique (AFP), two short <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> were made out of advanced thermoplastic composite material (carbon fiber/PEEK). Then, the <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> were tested by impulse excitation of vibration to get experimental natural frequencies. Tensile and compression test coupons were made {{out of the same}} material using hand layup and autoclave process, and stiffness properties were characterized experimentally. Furthermore, finite element analysis was performed to extract theoretical natural frequencies using material properties obtained from coupon testing. Comparison between the natural frequencies obtained using the finite element method and experimental modal analysis was conducted. Furthermore, the two <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> were treated inside the autoclave, and changes in the thickness and density were measured. After autoclave treatment, experimental modal analysis was repeated {{to investigate the}} possible changes in natural frequencies. The finite element model was also updated upon the changes in thickness and density of the <b>truncated</b> <b>cones,</b> and consequently, comparison between the theoretical and experimental natural frequencies was carried out again. Also, micrographs of two <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> were taken before and after autoclave treatment to examine the autoclave effect {{on the quality of the}} samples.

25|$|Dating to {{the middle}} of the 2nd {{millennium}} BC, the nuraghe, which evolved from the previous proto-nuraghe, are megalithic towers with a <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> shape; they are widespread in the whole of Sardinia, about one nuraghe every three square kilometers. There has long been controversy among scholars. Theories about their utilization have included social, military, religious, astronomical role, as furnaces or sepulture places, but the modern agreement is that they were defensible homesites that included barns and silos. In ancient times, Greek historians and geographers tried to solve the mystery of the nuraghe and their builders. They described the presence of fabulous edifices, called daidaleia, from the name of Daedalus, who, after building his labyrinth in Crete, would have moved to Sicily and then to Sardinia.|$|E
25|$|An {{internal}} collet {{can be used}} to lock two telescoping tubes together. In {{this case}} the collet {{is in the form of}} a <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> drilled and threaded down the centreline. The collet diameter matches the bore of the inner tube, having the larger end slightly greater than the bore while the smaller diameter is slightly less than the bore. A threaded stud, anchored at its other end to the tube, is then used to pull the collet into the tube. The increasing diameter of the collet forces the inner tube to expand and be pushed against the inner wall of the outer tube thus locking the two tubes together. The inner tube is often slotted to facilitate this expansion.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} version are two-sided bags, either joined {{round the}} edges or folded and joined along two sides. Webbing straps may be stitched to doubler patches {{which are then}} glued or welded to the bag on light duty bags, but on large and heavy duty bags there are usually strips of bag material bonded to the bags which form flat retaining tubes for the webbing which is threaded through the tubes and may be withdrawn for maintenance and inspection. heavy duty open bags are generally conical with a domed top or a reversed <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> top, and may have several straps from the lifting point at the bottom, through the guide tubes on the sides, to a crown ring of webbing or steel at the top, to spread the load evenly over {{the fabric of the}} bag.|$|E

25|$|The 12th century rotunda of the Holy Sepulchre at Santo Stefano, Bologna, and the {{basilica}} at Neuvy-Saint-Sépulchre are imitations of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre although, {{like many of}} the imitations across Europe, they differ markedly in their details, including their domes. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre seems to have had a wooden dome in two shells up to the 12th century, with some interruptions. A choir with a dome was added by the crusaders next to the existing rotunda after their capture of the city. The rotunda itself was covered by a conical structure from the 12th to the early 19th century. Pisa Baptistry was built in 1153 with a <b>truncated</b> <b>cone</b> in clear imitation of the Holy Sepulchre; an outer dome shell was added in the 14th century. The domed baptisteries of Cremona (1176) and Parma (1196) also appear to have been influenced by the rotunda.|$|E
25|$|The head-joint tube is tapered {{slightly}} {{towards the}} closed end. Boehm described {{the shape of}} the taper as parabolic. Examination of his flutes did not reveal a true parabolic curve, but the taper is more complex than a <b>truncated</b> <b>cone.</b> The head joint is the most difficult part to construct because the lip plate and tone hole have critical dimensions, edges, and angles which vary slightly between manufacturers and in individual flutes, especially where they are handmade. Head joint geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone, but there is no clear consensus on a particular shape amongst manufacturers. Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter. Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include: chimney length (hole between lip-plate and head tube), chimney diameter, and radiuses or curvature of the ends of the chimney. Generally, the shorter the hole, the more quickly a flute can be played; the longer the hole, the more complex the tone. Finding a particularly good example of a flute is dependent on play-testing. Head joint upgrades are usually suggested as a way to improve the tone of an instrument.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{interpret}} failure features {{of the failure of}} soil in front of tunnel face, a new three-dimensional failure mechanism is proposed to analyze the limit support pressure of the tunnel face in multilayered cohesive-frictional soils. The new failure mechanism is composed of two <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> that represent the shear failure band and a distributed force acting on the <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> that represents the pressure arch effect. By introducing the concept of Terzaghi earth pressure theory, approximation of limit support pressures is calculated using the limit analysis methods. Then the limit support pressures obtained from the new failure mechanism and the existing approaches are compared, which show that the results obtained from the new mechanism in this paper provide relatively satisfactory results...|$|R

40|$|Packing {{problems}} have been of great interest in many diverse contexts for many centuries. The optimal packing of identical objects has been often invoked {{to understand the nature}} of low temperature phases of matter. In celebrated work, Kepler conjectured that the densest packing of spheres is realized by stacking variants of the face-centered cubic lattice and has a packing fraction of π/(3 √(2)) ∼ 0. 7405. Much more recently, an unusually high density packing of approximately 0. 770732 was achieved for congruent ellipsoids. Such studies are relevant for understanding the structure of crystals, glasses, the storage and jamming of granular materials, ceramics, and the assembly of viral capsid structures. Here we carry out analytical studies of the stacking of close-packed planar layers of systems made up of <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> possessing uniaxial symmetry. We present examples of high density packing whose order is characterized by a broken symmetry arising from the shape of the constituent objects. We find a biaxial arrangement of solid cones with a packing fraction of π/ 4. For <b>truncated</b> <b>cones,</b> there are two distinct regimes, characterized by different packing arrangements, depending on the ratio c of the base radii of the <b>truncated</b> <b>cones</b> with a transition at c^*=√(2) - 1.
