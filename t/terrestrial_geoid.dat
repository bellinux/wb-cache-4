500|$|Because Mars has no {{oceans and}} hence no [...] "sea level", a zero-elevation surface {{had to be}} {{selected}} as a reference level; {{this is called the}} areoid of Mars, analogous to the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>geoid.</b> Zero altitude was defined by the height at which there is [...] of atmospheric pressure. This pressure corresponds to the triple point of water, and it is about 0.6% of the sea level surface pressure on Earth (0.006 atm). In practice, today this surface is defined directly from satellite gravity measurements.|$|E
5000|$|The {{satellite}} {{mission was}} designed to further {{an understanding of the}} earth’s gravitational field, size and shape of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>geoid,</b> deep ocean tides, sea state, current structure, crustal structure, solid earth dynamics, and remote sensing technology. Jerome Rosenburg at NASA Headquarters initiated the GEOS-3 project in 1970. The project was to serve as a stepping stone between the GEOS program and the emerging NASA Earth and Ocean Physics Application Program. GEOS-1 and GEOS-2 had provided useful information about the structure of the earth’s gravitational field, but new technology was deemed necessary to gain a further understanding. [...] The project was initially cancelled due to budgetary concerns after an initial 1-year study, but was re-instated in late 1971. [...] The satellite was launched in April 9, 1975 and remained operational until late July 1979.|$|E

By measuring orthometric heights {{of a few}} GPS stations by dierential levelling techniques, the geoid undulation can be modelled, which enables GPS {{to be used for}} orthometric height determination in a much faster and more economical way than <b>terrestrial</b> meth-ods. The <b>geoid</b> undulation anomaly can be very useful for studying tectonic structure. GPS, levelling and gravity measurements were carried out along a 200 -km-long highly undulating profile, at an average eleva-tion of 4000 m, in the Ladak region of NW Himalaya, India. The geoid undulation and gravity anomaly were measured at 28 common GPS-levelling and 67 GPS-gravity stations. A regional geoid low of nearly) 4 m coincident with a steep negative gravity gradient is compatible with very recent findings from other geo-physical studies of a low-velocity layer 20 – 30 km thick {{to the north of the}} India–Tibet plate boundary, within the Tibetan plate. Topographic, gravity and geoid data possibly indicate that the actual plate boundary is situated further north of what is geologically known as the Indus Tsangpo Suture Zone, the traditionally supposed location of the plate boundary. Comparison of the measured geoid with that computed from OSU 91 and EGM 96 gravity models indicates that GPS alone can be used for orthometric height determination over the Higher Himalaya with 1 – 2 m accuracy.
