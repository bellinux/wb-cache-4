40|$|This paper proposes the {{substitution}} of the current income tax system for a simplified consumption tax (SCT),consisting of a cash-flow tax (CST) with a rate of 26 %, and a tax on wages with a maximum rate also of 26 %. Preliminary estimates indicate that these taxes would maintain tax revenues constant while, at the same time, simplify the tax system and lower administrative and enforcement costs. Moreover, distortions would be diminished as an income tax would {{be replaced by a}} consumption <b>tax.</b> Vertical <b>equality</b> would not be significantly changed, but horizontal equality would improve. The paper also considers two alternatives to the CST: the hybrid tax and the tax on dividends, concluding that the second is the less attractive option. ...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{household}} production model of educational choices, we characterise {{a free market}} situation in which some agents (high wagers) educate their children full-time and spend a sizable amount of resources on them, while others (low wagers) educate them only partially. The free-market equilibrium is iniquitous, both because the households have different resources and because the children have different access to education. Public policy is thus called for, for vertical as well as horizontal equity purposes. Conventional wisdom has it that both objectives could be achieved using price control instruments, i. e. income taxes and price subsidies. We find instead that income <b>taxes</b> reduces <b>equality</b> of opportunity and that price subsidies cannot remedy this. Quantity controls become necessary: a compulsory education package, financed by a redistributive tax system, achieves both types of equity. Redistributive taxation and compulsory education are therefore best seen as complementary policies...|$|R

It was classically liberal in political orientation and opposed the monarchists and clerical elements on the one hand, and the Socialists on the other. Many members had been recruited by the Freemasons. The Radicals were split between activists who called for state intervention to achieve economic and social equality and conservatives whose first priority was stability. The workers' demands for strikes threatened such stability and pushed many Radicals toward conservatism. It opposed women's suffrage for fear that women would vote for its opponents or for candidates endorsed by the Catholic Church. It favored a progressive income <b>tax,</b> economic <b>equality,</b> expanded educational opportunities and cooperatives in domestic policy.

The first act of governor Molinas, assuming office on February 20, 1932, was to re-establish the progressive Constitution of the Santa Fe Province established by the Constituent Assembly of 1921, which had been abrogated by the radical governor Enrique Mosca. He also ensured independence of the judicial system, <b>tax</b> <b>equality,</b> secular education, women's suffrage and right of foreigners' to vote for the election of communal authorities. Molinas' administration also created the Provincial Department of Labour, which ensured the observance of article 28 of the provincial Constitution, concerning the 8 hours day, minimum wages and regulation of child and female labour. Molinas also reduced his salary from 2,500 to 1,800 pesos, suspended payment of the external debt of the province, which permitted Santa Fe's budget to become positive. Henceforth, he subsidized public works under the impulsion of the minister Alberto Casella, leading to increased local employment. He also implemented moderate land reforms, harshly opposed by the conservative and Alvearist radicals, as well as the Sociedad Rural. Finally, he created the Experimental Institute of Agricultural Investigation, a predecessor of the National Agricultural Technology Institute (INTA).|$|E
40|$|The 2013 Supreme Court {{decision}} in United States v. Windsor invalidated Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act and {{cleared the way}} for same-sex married couples to be treated as married for federal tax purposes. The Internal Revenue Service promptly issued a ruling announcing its recognition of same-sex marriage. Academics, policymakers and activists lauded the change as finally achieving of <b>tax</b> <b>equality</b> between gay and straight married couples. This article argues that the claimed <b>tax</b> <b>equality</b> of Windsor is illusory and {{that the only way to}} achieve actual equality is to eliminate taxation on the basis of marital status. Focusing on the taxation of women in same-sex marriages, the article explores what lies beneath the putative equality gains that result from according same-sex married couples the same status as different-sex married couples. The article predicts, based on demographic statistics relating to income levels, wealth holdings, child rearing and employment patterns, that women in same-sex marriages will be less likely than other married people to reap the benefits and more likely to suffer the detriments of being taxed as married. In finding that women in same-sex marriages are at serious risk to suffer adverse consequences from their new tax status as married, the article extends the existing literature that analyzes the ways in which the tax law — though facially neutral in its treatment of heterosexual married couples — privileges traditional marriages in which men are the primary income earners and wealth holders, and adversely affects married women’s incentives and abilities to be workers, income producers and wealth holders. The article argues that the unfavorable tax treatment of women in both same-sex and different-sex marriages stems from the fictitious construction of two individuals as an irreducible economic unit, the same fiction that perpetuates traditional, male-dominated marriage. The article concludes that taxation on the basis of marital status should be curtailed through the abolition of the joint return and other reforms...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} issue of taxation on customer loyalty programs (so called “mileage programs”). We refer to a case in business practice in order to closely observe {{the appropriateness of the}} current taxation system. The Company addressed (hereafter “Company”) maintains both tax-exempt and taxable operations. The controversy arises when the points earned in the tax-exempt business are exchanged for services, provided by the taxable operations. While it is frequently argued that the transactions of such nature should be taxed, we conclude that they are not liable for taxation based on the related laws and regulations. Offers for free service in discussion contravenes the legally defined range of service provided and what’s more, the points earned do not carry monetary value. Furthermore, the current value-added tax laws confine property liable for taxation to goods under the article No. 48. Also, the revenue from service made by mileage (the points) should be excluded from the tax base according to the reinterpretation of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance Case No. 319 (March 29, 2006) However, here arises the controversy. When points are utilized as a means of payments, they are expected to be subject to taxation. The same logic is to be implemented in the light of <b>tax</b> <b>equality.</b> Meanwhile, once value-added tax is imposed on the revenue made by mileage (the points), it would largely impact the industry offering loyalty programs to its customers.

3000|$|And, fifth, as for {{the income}} distribution, the model also predicts a {{positive}} relationship between income <b>tax</b> progressivity and <b>equality</b> of income distribution, and higher inequality of before-tax than after-tax incomes. More precisely, the Gini indices of market and net-of-tax incomes, denoted by G_b [...] and G_a [...] respectively, display a decreasing pattern relative to ϕ (see Table 4, columns 6 and 7). This is a natural result because, as discussed above, increments in income tax progressivity lead to increasing tax rates for more skilled agents and lower tax rates for less skilled. After all, given that tax revenues represent a constant fraction of GDP, a higher progressivity must lead to a reduction in net-of-tax income inequality. In short, income inequality would be maximized under a proportional tax scheme, ϕ = 0, and any increment in personal income tax progressivity would reduce inequality.|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{changes in}} the United States as a {{consequence}} of the Economic Recovery Act of 1981 (ERITA), the <b>Tax</b> <b>Equality</b> and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA). The effects of ERITA, TEFRA, and TRA are demonstrated via measures of pre-tax and post-tax inequality based on gross household income and disposable household income. Thus, the distribution of income, and also the tax payments, consist of components that are attributed to tax changes and components that are driven by the pre-tax income. Typically, most analysts view the distribution of pre-tax and post-tax income based on GINI coefficients. However, this analysis employs the decomposable Generalized Entropy measure, which enables the distribution of the "between group" and "within group" (weighted average) effects of taxation. Moreover, this approach allows for a more accurate assessment of tax progressivity in the long run. This process provides a better framework to evaluate the policy implications of future tax changes. The results illustrate that long-run income tax progressivity has been declining over time. Concurrently, we witness a relative rise in pre-tax and post-tax income inequality over the latter portion of the accounting interval. It is further evidenced that a number of exemptions and the type of tax table used create more equalization within each group, but cross- group equalization is minimal. When decomposed by quintile, the data reveal more cross-group equalization than within-group equalization. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{contribution}} by Gribnau {{is the relationship between}} increasingly complex tax legislation and the principle of equality. He starts with a conceptual analysis of equality. Then the focus shifts to the character of the formal principle of equality. He argues that it is not as empty as is sometimes maintained because it guides the legislature by providing standards with respect to legitimate discriminations. Turning to tax law, the prevailing instrumentalism appears to make tax law vulnerable to unjustified classifications. Especially instrumentalist tax expenditures may be solely a response to pressures of interest groups without respect for the principle of equality. Gribnau argues that, while recognizing the margin of appreciation of the legislature, the courts should more strictly scrutinize the proportionality of the discriminations involved in these (exceptional) cases of arbitrary tax legislation. In 1998, the European Convention on Human Rights was incorporated in British law. However, Boyron doubts whether this document will go far enough in providing the required constitutional environment {{for the development of a}} fully operational principle of equality; more radical changes might be necessary in constitutional law. She argues that the adoption of a written document might be welcome to settle the political differences as regards the content of the principle of equality and many other constitutional principles, since constitutional rules ought to be debated and decided upon by the electorate so as to help facilitate a consensus. This is particularly relevant to the principle of equality in order to define the many choices which this difficult concept entails. Birk starts with the observation that the principle of equality is not a very efficient principle and it does not have very much effect on the tax law as a whole. This goes for Germany and Europe as well. The establishment of equality of the tax burden in Germany is a task which the legislature, the administration, and the courts are equally faced with. The fact that the German legislature is bound by the Constitution to <b>tax</b> <b>equality</b> leads to a constant testing of the legislative measures against the Constitution and, as a result, to a weakening of the legislature`s position. In Germany, in his opinion, experience has shown that it was a good decision to bind the legislature to the basic rights guaranteed in the Constitution. It seems that the confidence in the accuracy of the legislative decisions and in the respect for the constitutional principles is much stronger in the other member states of the European Union than in Germany. In Germany, the legislature is obliged over and over again, to prove the claimed constitutionality before the Federal Constitutional Court.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{examines}} the implementation in Greece {{of a type}} of poll tax, namely the ‘trad ing duty’. In the past, the poll tax was chiefly a fixed tax charge applied to an individual, irrespective of the latter's income, property and consumer expenditure. Similarly, the ‘trading duty’ is a fixed tax levy which runs contrary to modern perceptions of society as a who le regard ing proportional and progressive taxation. Nowadays, a fair d istribution of the tax burden must be characterized by both horizontal and vertical <b>tax</b> <b>equality.</b> The principles of universality of taxation, taxation equality, justice and certainty and the princ ip le that no tax measures should be retroactive are embodied in the Greek Constitution. In Greece, {{the last three years}} have seen the approval of numerous tax laws, non-tax laws containing artic les on tax provis ions and Ministry of Finance decisions and decrees, while, in 2012, for the first time after many decades, all sectors of the economy are ‘in the red’. Despite the gloomy financ ial environment in Greece, in fiscal year 2012 a type of poll tax was imposed as a ‘trading duty’ for traders who filed Natural Person Income Tax (NPIT) returns. The implementation of the ‘trading duty’ allows for an extension from the terms ‘Operating Leverage’ (OL) and ‘Financial Leverage’ (FL) to the term ‘Tax Leverage’ (TL). Thus, when a percentage change in Earnings Before Tax (EBT) trans lates into growth of Earnings After Tax (EAT), then the phenomenon of the magnifying effect may be called Tax Leverage (TL) and it will be due to the possible constancy of the tax burden (e. g. trading duty, poll tax). In this study, through a detailed examp le, financ ial results (Degrees of Operating, Financial and Tax Leverage) determined at different levels of sales volume exhib it similar financial characteristics. Statistically they show linearity and a strong correlation, which create reasonable grounds for introducing a new termino logy in F inance. We consider it a given that OL is determined to a large extent by techno logy and can increase or decrease as a result of decisions relating to the investment budget. Furthermore, FL is positively related to the profitab ility of Assets, when EBIT/Assets>Borrowing Costs. Then, {{on the basis of the}} data and limitations of this study, TL is positively related to the profitab ility of Assets, when EBT/Assets>Tax Costs, while the Degree of Tax Leverage and the size of EAT are directly related accordingly. Lastly, a specific degree of combined leverage can be achieved through a different mix of OL, FL and TL, in order to offset any negative results that may arise from one of the three...|$|E

Taxes are of two kinds, namely direct and indirect. Adam Smith, the famous economist, enunciated four principles of a <b>tax,</b> namely, <b>equality,</b> certainty, convenience and economy. Equality establishes the principles that everybody should pay tax to the State according to his ability. A tax should be certain. Time of payment, manner of payment, and the amount to be paid should be definite and known. Tax payers should be provided convenient method of payment and it should be time saving and less costly to both tax payer and tax authority. / In the modern world, there are uncountable numbers of monetary transactions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the behavior of}} an overlapping dynasties growth model with factor taxation {{to determine how much}} the natives of a country absorbing a flow of immigrants can use shifts in factor taxation or deficit finance to redistribute immigrant income to themselves. In an economy in which government expenditure is a fixed share of net national product, policy-makers can minimize the deadweight loss from factor taxation by equalizing the long-run tax rates on capital and work. However when the native population of a country expect immigrants to arrive in the future they can choose to shift some of the tax burden away from their own sources of income and on to the income of future immigrants without explicitly imposing discriminatory taxes. Instead, because natives are capital owners but immigrants are not they may choose to shift the burden of taxation from capital to labor. Alternatively, by temporarily lowering taxes they can shift the burden of present day government consumption to immigrants that have not yet arrived. Our results suggest that because of the steep dead weight loss incurred when factor <b>taxes</b> deviate from <b>equality</b> the scope for redistribution through intratemporal shifts from capital to labor is very small–the optimal tax on capital drops by approximately a percentage point for each percent inflow of immigrants. Much greater benefits are achieved by shifting taxes across time...|$|R

One must ask if the official fiscal policies, take into account the coordinates of the report psychobehavioral tax? The answer to this question and some comments to address this issue, this paper covered together. The tax will not ever paid with pleasure, but it is known that fiscal equity confers a degree of acceptance by payers of the tax burden. Modern fiscal policies are marked by complicated structure of tax systems, more sophisticated procedures and rush image of politicians that do not retain as little detriment to promote populism reality. Another problem is the invasion of of social security, namely the objective is also looking to be promoted on account of fiscal policy without taking into account the fact that the two policies, the fiscal and social security are still their primary objective. The combination of the two types of, the purely fiscal and social, administrative approach is undoubtedly affected, and the effectiveness of the two policies may be affected taxpayers reactions is recognized in the literature are controversial. Taxpayers are vexed not only the size of the tax burden but also its structure, especially the way the official division of the tax burden between them, depending on how the tax base, depending on the type of taxpayer and according to other criteria. Another coordinated taxation is part of contemporary consumerist polticilor new tax, taxing certain income, especially income individuals is marked by the overall objective of capitalist society, that consumption growth. Fiscal policies are policies the new contemporary consumerism. And this phenomenon influences the distribution of the tax burden among taxpayers, more or less fair. What is tax fairness and how we can quantify? Here's a question that I try to raspunt from equality before the law <b>tax</b> payers. <b>Equality</b> before the <b>tax</b> law is not a primary goal of modern tax policy, it losing ground to tax efficiency goals and its economic and social components. On the other hand though fiscal phenomenon can help to ensure social peace through taxation to keep Sean absolute size of the tax burden and the fact that all are equal before the law, tax law and within given social policies in broadly, social security or insurance in respect restrains can be promoted by themselves and less by fiscal policy...|$|R
5000|$|In Low v. Austin, 80 U.S. 29 (1872), the Supreme Court {{was given}} the {{question}} of [...] "whether imported merchandise, upon which the duties and charges at the custom-house have been paid, is subject to State taxation, whilst remaining in the original cases, unbroken and unsold, {{in the hands of}} the importer." [...] The court, drawing on Brown and the opinion of Chief Justice Taney in the License Cases, 46 U.S. 504 (1847), decided that: The goods imported do not lose their character as imports, and become incorporated into the mass of property of the State, until they have passed from the control of the importer or been broken up by him from their original cases. Whilst retaining their character as imports, a tax upon them, in any shape, is within the constitutional prohibition. The question is not as to the extent of the <b>tax,</b> or its <b>equality</b> with respect to taxes on other property, but as to the power of the State to levy any tax. This doctrine, which became known as the [...] "original package doctrine", would define the interpretation of the Import-Export Clause for over a century until the U.S. Supreme Court redefined its analysis of the Import-Export Clause in Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U.S. 276 (1976). In Michelin, the U.S. Supreme Court launched a sua sponte investigation of the meaning and purpose of the Import-Export Clause, summarizing it thusly: The Framers of the Constitution thus sought to alleviate three main concerns by committing sole power to lay imposts and duties on imports in the Federal Government, with no concurrent state power: the Federal Government must speak with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments, and tariffs, which might affect foreign relations, could not be implemented by the States consistently with that exclusive power; import revenues were to be the major source of revenue of the Federal Government, and should not be diverted to the States; and harmony among the States might be disturbed unless seaboard States, with their crucial ports of entry, were prohibited from levying taxes on citizens of other States by taxing goods merely flowing through their ports to the other States not situated as favorably geographically. Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U.S. at 285-286 The Michelin Court made a lengthy and thorough analysis of the Brown opinion and how it was misread in Low v. Austin, which [...] "held that the Court in Brown included nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes among prohibited 'imposts' or 'duties.'" ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1997. Political ScienceBibliography: leaves [133]- 141 The {{question}} of how resources should be allocated between the sexes is an old one, and one that Canadians have often taken to the courts for resolution. The constitutional entrenchment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in 1982, {{made it possible for}} the judiciary to take an even greater role in the debate over equality rights. In late 1993, Symes v. Regina came before the Canadian Supreme Court and brought gender equality rights to the forefront of public policy debate once again. [...] Practising lawyer Elizabeth Symes argued that by not allowing the cost of her daycare as a tax deduction, the federal government was in violation of her equality rights. Day-care costs, she claimed, were a cost of doing business. The National Action Committee on the Status of Women publicly opposed her position, fearing that if she won, the only women to benefit would be those whose earnings required them to pay income tax. The Canadian Bar Association, however, defended Symes' position on the grounds that if day care were a cost of doing business, it would facilitate the entry of women into the legal profession. The Ministry of National Revenue argued that the issue at stake was one of <b>tax</b> law, not <b>equality.</b> The majority of the Canadian Supreme Court agreed with the government's position - that is the male majority of the Canadian Supreme Court agreed with the government. Given that the two female members of the Court had dissented from the opinion of their male counterparts, there was an accusation that if the judiciary was less male dominated, then women's rights cases would fare better in the courts. [...] This case, which blatantly divided lawyers, feminists, and the Canadian Supreme Court, is perhaps the best example in Canadian history of the political questions which are often raised by feminist judicial action, the women's movement, and male domination of the legal profession. While the specific issues of the case have been dealt with by the courts, the more general questions which it raised will undoubtedly be with us, as a society, for a very long time. If there is a lesson to be learned from Symes v. Regina, it is that Canadian women cannot depend on the courts alone in order to improve their status in relation to men. Now that there is a constitutional guarantee of equality in place, it is more important than ever that women's rights advocates continue to push for more female representation in all branches and all levels of government. Even though a provision for equality rights has been put into writing, it remains the responsibility of every Canadian citizen to ensure that the courts properly enforce this principle...|$|R
