5|$|The Navajo {{may have}} learned to weave from their Pueblo Indian neighbors when they moved into the Four Corners region during the year 1000 A.D. Some experts contend that the Navajo were not weavers until after the 17th century. The Navajo {{obtained}} cotton through local trade routes {{before the arrival of}} the Spanish, after which time they began to use wool. <b>The</b> <b>Pueblo</b> and Navajo were not generally on friendly terms due to frequent Navajo raids on Pueblo settlements, yet many Pueblo sought refuge with their Navajo neighbors in the late 17th century to evade the conquistadors in the aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>Pueblo</b> Revolt. This social interchange is the probable origin of the distinctive Navajo weaving tradition. Spanish records show that Navajo people began to herd sheep and weave wool blankets from that time onward.|$|E
5|$|The early {{farmers from}} the Early Basketmaker II Era, {{lived in the}} Petrified Forest from about 1CE to about 800CE. They {{occupied}} pit houses at fewer than 100 sites, at first on mesas or other vantage points and later {{at the base of}} bluffs and in lowlands, where the soil was better. As climatic conditions worsened for farming between 750 and 900CE, the settlements changed with <b>the</b> <b>Pueblo</b> I Era. Rather than below-ground pits, <b>the</b> <b>Pueblo</b> Builders constructed above-ground houses and storerooms that may have been capable of storing food for more than one year. At the same time, climatic conditions changed again, this time for the better, between 900 and 1275CE. More than 200 pueblo-builder sites have been identified in the park at a wide variety of locations—at the mouths of washes, near seeps, and on moisture-holding sand dunes.|$|E

40|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, <b>the</b> {{nineteen}} <b>Pueblos</b> of New Mexico relied on their confederate council—the All Indian Pueblo Council (AIPC) —to negotiate {{the demands of}} the American political system.

Despite <b>the</b> historic conflicts within <b>the</b> <b>Pueblos,</b> <b>the</b> actions of the AIPC during the twentieth century demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>Pueblos</b> were keen to unite around a political confederation, representing all Pueblos, when their joint interests were threatened.

5|$|In 1846, the United States went to {{war against}} Mexico and sent a naval and land {{expedition}} to conquer Alta California. At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles, the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For {{the next several months}} the Americans were blockaded inside <b>the</b> <b>pueblo.</b> Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from <b>the</b> <b>pueblo</b> hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner's Ranch. Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico. In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual, fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.|$|E

On the mesa behind Chaco Canyon is an ancient road that runs north from Chetro Ketl, then northward along {{the east side of}} Pueblo Alto before joining with the Great North Road. <b>The</b> <b>Pueblo</b> Alto road network functioned between 1050 and 1140. It facilitated access to watering holes, terraced farming areas, and enabled interaction between Pueblo Alto and great houses like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. It also led to a community along Escavada Wash. It may have served an important function in the transport of household goods, construction timber, and people throughout the San Juan Basin. Several road segments appear to be related to a row of Chetro Ketl's exterior rooms, which are thought to have been community storage space.|$|E
5|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the Puye Cliff Dwellings and was {{returning}} to the Albuquerque Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a Tewa Native yerbatero (herbalist) buying a cup of coffee, and struck up a conversation. Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told him that if he wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, then he should go to <b>the</b> <b>Pueblo</b> of Our Lady of the Angels and study at the University of California.

Similarly, Peter Ustinov's 1956 comic adaptation, Romanoff and Juliet, is set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the Cold War. A mock-Victorian revisionist version of Romeo and Juliet final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio, and Paris restored to life, and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris's love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. Shakespeare's R, by Joe Calarco, spins the classic in a modern tale of gay teenage awakening. A recent comedic musical adaptation was The Second City's The Second City's Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People vs. Friar Laurence, the Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet, set in modern times.|$|E
5|$|The Navajo were an Athabaskan {{people who}} {{migrated}} {{from the north}} into the Colorado River basin around 1025 A.D. They soon established themselves as the dominant Native American tribe in the Colorado River basin, and their territory stretched over parts of present-day Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado – in the original homelands of the Puebloans. In fact, the Navajo acquired agricultural skills from the Puebloans before the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>Pueblo</b> civilization in the 14thcentury. A profusion of other tribes have made a continued, lasting presence along the Colorado River. The Mohave have lived along the rich bottomlands of the lower Colorado below Black Canyon since 1200 A.D. They were fishermen – navigating the river on rafts made of reeds to catch Gila trout and Colorado pikeminnow – and farmers, relying on the annual floods of the river rather than irrigation to water their crops. Ute peoples have inhabited the northern Colorado River basin, mainly in present-day Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, for at least 2,000 years, but did not become well established in the Four Corners area until 1500 A.D. The Apache, Cocopah, Halchidhoma, Havasupai, Hualapai, Maricopa, Pima, and Quechan are among many other groups that live along or had territories bordering on the Colorado River and its tributaries.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Smith and rising {{opposition}} in the west, the Mormons decided to relocate their center from Nauvoo, Illinois to the California region outside of the United States border. The plans for the large exodus began and Mormon leadership moved westward leaving Brannan the highest ranking religious leader in New York. As such, he was faced with the large responsibility of evacuating the eastern Mormons to California. Brannan chartered the ship Brooklyn and persuaded the Mormons of New York to join the expedition to California. The Brooklyn set sail for upper California via Cape Horn in January 1846. Brannan {{was in charge of}} the expedition and the highest presiding religious leader on the ship. He brought along an antiquated printing press and a complete flour mill to make colonization easier. While the living conditions aboard the Brooklyn were strenuous for many, Brannan lived lavishly in the ship's officers' quarters. The ship stopped on June 20, 1846 in Honolulu, Hawaii to resupply and be inspected by Commodore Stockton. Brannan expected the inspection to go badly but instead Commodore Stockton spoke to Brannan about the United States planned assault of the Mexicans at Monterey. This information along with Commodore Stockton's quiet encouragement lead Samuel Brannan to the idea of taking the port town of Yerba Buena. Brannan's dreams of colonization and success were underway and after leaving Hawaii, the Brookyln changed routes, landing on July 31, 1846, at the Mexican port town of Yerba Buena. Upon arrival they were met by Commander John B. Montgomery and the Portsmouth who had taken Yerba Buena only a few days before much to Brannan's dismay. The Mormons began colonizing the area (present-day San Francisco) and tripled the population of <b>the</b> <b>pueblo.</b>|$|E
