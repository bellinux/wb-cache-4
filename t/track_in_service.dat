The line was then extended to 25th Avenue on July 29, 1916. The line opened to and fully opening to Coney Island on July 21, 1917. The original surface right-of-way was retained for use by trolley cars to provide local service and protect the company's franchise.|$|E

By 1900, Argentina (16,563 km), Brazil (15,316 km) and Mexico (13,615 km) were the leaders in length of <b>track</b> <b>in</b> <b>service,</b> and Peru, which had been an early leader in railway construction, had stagnated (1,790 km). [...] In Mexico, growing nationalistic fervor led the government to bring {{the bulk of the}} nation's railroads under national control in 1909, with a new government corporation, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México (FNM), that exercised control of the main trunk rail lines through a majority of share ownership.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{built as a}} {{double-track}} structure, but after the elimination of commuter train service it was changed to have only a single <b>track</b> <b>in</b> <b>service.</b> Freight train service continued {{through the creation of}} Conrail in 1976, but the bridge was taken out of service by Conrail in November 1977. It has been locked in the raised (open) position ever since. The bridge is located within the North Jersey Shared Assets Area and is assigned to Norfolk Southern Railway. Conrail continued to serve both sides of the branch with local freight train service until 2002, when {{the eastern side of the}} branch was removed from active service. A three-track trestle bridge over Passaic Avenue, just east of the NX bridge was removed in the mid-2000s to increase roadway clearance. On the west bank of the Passaic, the Newark Industrial Track is still an active freight line.|$|E

40|$|AbstractControl of {{railway noise}} is very {{significant}} part of the urban traffic policy. An increase of railway noise could significantly reduce {{the quality of life of}} citizens. This paper analyzes and suggests necessary measures for managing railway noise and traffic safety by rail inspection and grinding. It considers and suggests inspection methods for early detection of head checking (HC) rail defects. Otherwise, HC defects could lead to rail cracks and breakages that might endanger the traffic safety. In addition, this paper examines the real limits of non-destructive methods for detecting HC defects in <b>track</b> <b>in</b> <b>service.</b> Combining several non-destructive inspection methods and rail grinding are recommended for efficient railway noise control in the urban area...|$|E
50|$|From April 30, 1995 to November 12, 1995, the Manhattan Bridge {{services}} {{were supposed to}} go back to the 1986-1988 service pattern with only the south side (Broadway Line) <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>service.</b> However, the Broadway side was not yet ready. As a result, during middays and weekends, the north side of the bridge was also closed. As a result, Q trains began serving the Broadway Line again. They ran via the Montague Street Tunnel, before switching to the express tracks after Canal Street. This service continued past 57th Street via the BMT 63rd Street Line to 21st Street-Queensbridge, being the first scheduled service to use this connection.|$|R

The station has 11 main line passenger track platforms, of which two are used for S-Bahn services; {{one of the two}} subterranean Stadtbahn has two tracks with side platforms (Dom/Hbf) the other (Breslauer Platz/Hbf) has two out of three <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> and one side platform and an island platform (both in use).

5|$|Renovation {{started in}} November 2001. During this time, Coney Island Terminal {{was given a}} full, $310 million reconstruction, with one {{platform}} at a time for the West End W train remaining open during construction.

The new terminal opened on May 23, 2004, with the restoration of F and Q services, and the moving of W service to tracks 1 and 2. The project completed on May 29, 2005, with full restoration of N service, the replacement of the W route with the D route on the West End Line, and all eight <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>service.</b> The accelerated 42-month schedule, as well as the partial service from the West End Line throughout construction, was largely to minimize impact on the surrounding community.|$|R

50|$|HSR is {{much simpler}} to control {{due to its}} {{predictable}} course. High-speed rail systems reduce (but do not eliminate) collisions with automobiles or people, by using non-grade level track and eliminating grade-level crossings.
