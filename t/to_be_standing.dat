Rennert at the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained an MA in early 1906 and registered {{to write a}} PhD thesis on the jesters in Lope de Vega's plays. A Harrison fellowship covered his tuition fees {{and gave him a}} travel grant of $500, which he used to return to Europe. He spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries, including one in the royal palace; he happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>standing</b> outside the palace on 31 May 1906 during the attempted assassination by anarchists of King Alfonso, and left the country for fear he would be identified with them. After Spain he spent two weeks in Paris, attending lectures at the Sorbonne, followed by a week in London.|$|E
5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>standing</b> still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E
5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>standing</b> on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E

5|$|The {{next night}} on Raw, Orton faced Batista, {{who had become}} World Heavyweight Champion. Orton stated {{on-screen}} that his match with The Undertaker had aggravated a shoulder injury. While sidelined, Orton appeared on Raw and claimed that he was ineligible for the WWE Draft Lottery due to his injury. He was informed by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon that he was indeed {{a candidate for the}} draft, leaving a possibility of a return to SmackDown!. Orton returned to WWE programming for SmackDown! on June 16, announcing that he was the second pick in the 2005 draft lottery. He rekindled his feud with The Undertaker, defeating him at SummerSlam following a distraction from his father. Two months later, Orton and his father Bob Orton defeated The Undertaker in a Handicap Casket match, after the match Randy Orton and his father Bob locked the Undertaker in the casket and, in a move similar to Kane at the 1998 Royal Rumble, chopped holes {{in the top of the}} casket with an axe, poured gasoline over the casket and set it ablaze, kayfabe killing The Undertaker. The following month, Orton replaced the late Eddie Guerrero as a participant in the annual elimination match of Team SmackDown against Team Raw at Survivor Series, after having lost a qualifying match to Rey Mysterio. In the match, Orton was the last remaining wrestler in the match for the third straight year, as he pinned Shawn Michaels to get the victory for Team SmackDown. At the event, The Undertaker returned by emerging from a flaming casket and attacked the SmackDown superstars who came to the ring to celebrate Team SmackDown's victory. On the SmackDown! episode after Survivor Series, The Undertaker interfered in a match between Rey Mysterio and Big Show after Kane interfered. Randy Orton RKO'd the Undertaker, he then struck the Undertaker with a tire iron and set him on the back of the lowrider Mysterio had driven to the ring, he then reversed the lowrider into the SmackDown set, causing an explosion. The feud was finally settled with a Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon, where The Undertaker offered to retire if he lost. On December 16, The Undertaker entered the ring to deliver a promo while one of his druids appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>standing</b> in the ring. The Undertaker sustained an RKO from Orton in a surprise attack. The druid revealed himself to be Orton's father, who gave Orton The Undertaker's urn, which, according to the storyline, allowed whomever held it to control The Undertaker. The Undertaker, however, beat both Ortons in a Hell in a Cell match, ending their nine-month-long feud.|$|E

[...] Wigan's de Zeeuw crossed {{the ball from}} a wide position and Simon Haworth flicked it up and then hit a shot from six yards out past Bartram and into the net, to score what The Independent described as [...] "one of Wembley's great goals". [...] In the 65thminute, de Zeeuw's header was cleared off the line by Gillingham's Nicky Southall, who appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>standing</b> behind the goal line. [...] Wigan's supporters believed that the ball had in fact crossed the line and entered the goal, but the assistant referee ruled otherwise. [...] Gillingham had several chances on goal in the latter stages of the game, but Wigan goalkeeper Derek Stillie prevented any further goalscoring. [...] Shortly {{before the end of}} the game Wigan defender Kevin Sharp, who had earlier been cautioned for dissent, was sent off for a foul on Southall, reducing his team to ten men. [...] The match remained deadlocked at 1–1 after 90minutes and therefore went into a 30-minute period of extra time.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, the NHL and NHLPA honoured Näslund with a tribute and {{ceremonial}} puck drop prior to a game held in Stockholm, Sweden, between the San Jose Sharks and Columbus Blue Jackets. Several months later, the Canucks retired his number 19 jersey prior to a home game against the Tampa Bay Lightning on 11 December 2010. Attending the on-ice ceremony were his wife, three children, parents and sister, as well as former Canucks teammates, coaches and executives. The night included a video tribute highlighting his hockey career, speeches from team personalities and gift presentations from the organization. In honour of Näslund and his wife's past philanthropy in the Vancouver community, the team also announced the establishment of a sports equipment centre for underprivileged children. [...] Prior to the jersey raising, Näslund thanked those involved in his career. Reflecting on his career, he commented, [...] "Young hockey players from northern Sweden never dream of a night like this...To go from sitting up in the press box as a healthy scratch <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>standing</b> here in front of you is quite amazing." [...] By having his jersey retired, he became the third player in team history to receive the honour, after Stan Smyl and Trevor Linden.|$|E

500|$|The title design, {{that was}} awarded Excellence in Title Design at South by Southwest, {{was made by}} Allison and Anthony Brownmoore of Blue Spill {{production}} studio. Kijak's requirement was to [...] "blow people off their seats". According to Anthony Brownmoore, the project was a challenge, since he [...] "was very taken by their [...] look but that can also be quite daunting. To try to make something and be creative with something that's already so mad and so creative". They worked on the title design for months, syncing it to the song [...] "Jade" [...] {{the way that the}} images would pulsate to Yoshiki's drum beats. When creating the background sequences, they used the band's slogan, Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock as an inspiration. They used old photos of the band members, pairing them up with pulsating, moving, otherworldly backgrounds, for example they filmed floating fluorescent paint in a fish tank with a GoPro camera. The scene where Toshi appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>standing</b> on top of a waterfall, was filmed in the couple's own kitchen sink with running tap water, while the camera emerging from the water to show the waterfall was actually filmed in Greece. Adobe After Effects and Smoke was used during the production.|$|E
500|$|On 19 May 2010, The Sporting News named Henrik their 2009–10 Player of the Year. He {{received}} 108 first-place votes {{out of the}} 353 NHL players, {{coaches and}} executives polled. Ovechkin received 86 first-place votes while Sidney Crosby received 72 first-place votes. Henrik was also voted by his countrymen in the league to receive the Viking Award as the NHL's best Swedish player. At the NHL Awards Show the following month on 23 June, Henrik, Ovechkin and Crosby were up for both the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the player deemed by the media {{to be the most}} valuable to his team, and the Ted Lindsay Award, given to the best player as voted by the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA). After losing the Ted Lindsay Award to Ovechkin, Henrik was awarded the Hart, becoming the first Canuck and second Swedish player (after Peter Forsberg in 2003) to win the trophy. Henrik garnered 894 voting points, compared to Ovechkin's 834 and Crosby's 729. He admitted afterwards to feeling like the underdog going into the awards ceremony, noting [...] " [...] are the faces of the sport ... <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>standing</b> next to them as the old guy, it's a strange feeling." [...] He was additionally named to the NHL First All-Star Team; at the same time, twin Daniel was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team. It marked the first time since Phil and Tony Esposito in 1973–74 that two brothers were named post-season NHL All-Stars. They were also chosen to appear together on the cover of EA Sports' European version of the NHL 11 video game.|$|E

Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "The {{moral of the}} story is, if you’re going to build an entire video around a stripper pole, then you better work said pole like a nine-to-five. Drop it like it’s hot. [...] Alas, in the case of [...] "Gimme More," [...] I’ve seen sexier pole work during an afternoon of fly-fishing". Andrei Harmsworth of Metro commented [...] "To her credit, the video is slightly less disappointing than her mimed performance of the track at the Video Music Awards last month but it is still smeared with the same smutty hallmarks". Dose said the video [...] "sucks less than you think" [...] and added [...] "Spears appears lucid, sometimes happy, and awards-worthy editing makes her appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>standing</b> upright competently throughout". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said the lightning effects and digital body enhancement of the video [...] "indicate a predilection toward maintaining an image that no longer reflects reality. It doesn't point to an artist who refuses to evolve, but rather one who doesn't know how—or isn't being allowed to." [...] IGN writer Sketch Longwood called it one of Spears' hottest videos, adding that she [...] "proves to be quite skilled in the art of teasingly slinking around." [...] While reviewing the alternate version of the video in July 2011, Becky Bain of Idolator stated that [...] "Spears's last few videos — particularly the joyfully silly clip for 'I Wanna Go' — more than make up for the travesty that was the pop star's video for 'Gimme More' [...] The stripper concept was a poor choice, the barely-there outfits were ill-fitting, the 'choreography' was a joke, the editing was sloppy." ...|$|E

2500|$|The early {{artists of}} the Insular period often show evangelists from the front who appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>standing,</b> {{although}} a chair is drawn behind them; the human figure was not a focus of interest or skill for these artists.
