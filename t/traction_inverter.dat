5000|$|The ABB {{traction}} system uses a 6-pole brushless WGX560 synchronous alternator directly coupled to the CAT engine. The alternator supplies two traction packages (ABB Bordline CC1500 DE Compact Converters.

5000|$|The {{pantograph}} is of TransTech design. The ABB supplied {{main transformer}} has four secondary taps, switchable to supply 1360 V under all electrification supplies. There {{are two main}} converters, (type MITRAC TC 3360 DP.) one per bogie, which convert the single phase input to a 2800 V intermediate DC link using IGBT based rectifiers. Each DC link powers two traction converters, with each <b>traction</b> <b>inverter</b> powering a separate traction motor. The locomotive uses four [...] MITRAC DR 3700 F fully suspended, bogie mounted traction drives to reduce unsprung mass.|$|E
50|$|The motors {{employ a}} double-star type connection; if a <b>traction</b> <b>inverter</b> is {{inoperative}} (i.e. {{due to a}} failure) the motors use a delta-type connection and are fed by only one inverter.During braking the motors {{can be used as}} generators in order to recover electric energy (regenerative braking). However, since Italian railway power substations are not able to receive energy (they are not reversible), this method only works if there are other trains nearby absorbing current and the line voltage is lower than 4000 V. Otherwise the power is dissipated through a braking rheostat. The vehicle braking logic checks if these conditions are met and then decides to send the current to the line or to the rheostat.|$|E

Power conversion unit consisting of boost converter and <b>traction</b> <b>inverter</b> employed in conventional EV powertrain system exhibits low efficiency on EPA standard driving cycles such as US 06, UDDS, or HWFET. To maintain high efficiency {{over a wide range}} of power and voltage, composite boost converter architecture has been introduced. This dissertation addresses the design optimization of power conversion unit with composite boost converter architecture. Comprehensive loss model including switching loss, conduction loss, and magnetic loss are developed, and the calibration process is proposed to reduce the loss model error over a wide range of power and voltage. Also, weighted loss method is proposed for a design optimization of boost converter on given driving cycles. The weighted loss method reduces computational efforts by a magnitude of three without the loss of optimization result accuracy, relative to the brute-force exhaustive search method. The Si-MOSFET composite boost converter is designed, and experimental results exhibit high efficiency over a wide range of power and voltage. Also, high volumetric and gravimetric power density are demonstrated with a SiC-MOSFET composite boost converter.

Large and bulky DC link capacitors are used at the input of the <b>traction</b> <b>inverter</b> to provide a smooth DC input voltage.

Consequently, BT is preserved successfully from excessive cycling, it being also supported over the mid speed range. Both these goals are achieved by suitable SC sizing, which accounts for both energy and voltage constraints. The proposed energy management is validated through a simulation study, which refers to vehicle acceleration and stop...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{the problem}} of {{interferences}} that involve railway signaling systems {{is becoming more and}} more important in some railway networks. New electrical and electronic applications in power supply increase the electromagnetic compatibility problems in particular signalling systems like the Coded Current Automatic Block (BACC), installed on about 4400 km of Italian conventional railway lines. Remaining in the sphere of a traditional 3 kV d. c. traction system and apart from its interaction with other types of system, interferences with signalling systems can be produced by the <b>traction</b> <b>inverters</b> installed on the board of the roiling stock and by the electrical substation (ESS) converters.

40|$|Locomotive PWM Rectifiers {{employed}} in A. C traction systems represent several megawatts of electrical load. Typically they use multiple rectifiers/converters in parallel {{in order to}} secure high power ratings and high frequency operation. And the rectifiers are supplied from the single-phase A. C. traction transformer with multiple secondaries of high leakage inductance. The switching instants of the PWM rectifiers are phase shifted and interlaced in order to achieve high ripple current cancellation, assuming that the converter loads are balanced. This would ensure the rectifiers to provide better harmonic performance and also redundancy of operation with multiple units in operation. However, in practice, rectifiers may be closely coupled to the <b>traction</b> <b>inverter</b> to an axle or a group of axles and the real power developed will depend upon the traction conditions. Creep and slip can give rise to variations in power and perfect power balance at the rectifiers is an improbable proposition. There is high degree of interest in the recent times to examine the possibility of equipment failures in locomotive systems that degrade gracefully. Failure of one <b>traction</b> <b>inverter</b> would lead to load unbalance for the rectifier modules. Or sometimes, partial failures may result in unbalanced operation which can cause reduced ripple current cancellation and generate switching frequency harmonic current components. This may adversely impact the signalling systems and/or result in over voltage effects due to resonance in the overhead supply system. This paper examines a 4 MW locomotive with three rectifier modules and a device switching frequency of 900 Hz. This results in a 5400 Hz ripple frequency in the mains current. And this paper will consider what may be the most frequently occurring case; that of loss of load in one traction motor due to wheel slip. Current ripple cancellation is partially lost in this case and lower frequency current components can be produced. Traditionally, number of solutions have been {{employed in}} the industry like passive Filters, Active Filters etc., for this type of a problem. However, this paper explores an elegant, attractive and economical solution of using hybrid filters in order to achieve a level of acceptable satisfactory harmonic performance and thereby improving the power quality of the rail systems...|$|E

40|$|Refrigeration {{systems of}} railway <b>traction</b> <b>inverters</b> have {{experienced}} crucial progress recently. The use of assisted convection {{has been one}} of the most significant improvements, being heat pipe based heat sinks (HPHS) the main application. Due to the operating principle of a heat pipe, which lies in evaporation and condensation of a fluid, the HPHS is a very non-linear device. Several variables play a critical role and a simple theoretical analysis by itself does not provide enough information for an accurate model. As a result, in order to evaluate the performance of a HPHS for a generic traction converter, we have developed an experimentation process. It consists of aerodynamic tests in an airport and thermal tests in a self-designed wind tunnel. The objective of this method is the complete characterisation of the HPHS and thereby, the prediction of the behaviour of the refrigeration system for the real operation of a train. During the aerodynamic tests we have deduced the relationship between the air-flow through the HPHS and the train speed. Besides, we have analysed some extra phenomena, such as the double-cavity flow and the air-leakage of the system. The thermal study has allowed us to determine the thermal resistance network, working out the influence of the power losses of the inverter and the air velocity in the overall efficiency of the HPHS. In addition, we have examined transient response and the importance of natural convection. The paper summarizes both series of tests carried out with the system subject to study and presents the main results and conclusions...|$|R
