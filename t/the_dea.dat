5|$|A 1980 US {{indictment}} {{said that}} Francisco Rafael was {{under investigation by}} <b>the</b> <b>DEA</b> for alleged cocaine and heroin distribution in the San Diego area. <b>The</b> <b>DEA</b> had identified {{him as one of}} the cocaine suppliers and set up an undercover operation to arrest him and his associates by purchasing multi-ton shipments of cocaine. He admitted to have worked with drug distributor Ramón Torresillos-Rendón, and that he used him as a mediator for a drug transaction with an undercover federal agent. In court, Francisco Rafael admitted having sent Torresillos-Rendón and four other individuals to sell nine ounces of cocaine to the agent. He was arrested in California on 7 August 1980 and remained under custody until or around 8 September 1980 after paying a US$150,000 bond and promising to appear at every court session. Nonetheless, he fled to Mexico shortly afterwards and did not appear in court on 8 October 1980.|$|E

In addition, McVeigh believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. The attack was planned to take place on April 19, 1995, to coincide with the anniversary of the Waco siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.|$|E

5|$|Noriega {{took great}} care to shape {{perceptions}} of himself. He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information about everybody in the country. Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made money off of every transaction in the country may have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously as a sexual pervert, as a sadist, and a rapist. Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a drug trafficker, a nationalist supporting Torrijos, an ally of Cuba, and an ally of Oliver North and the Contras. He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as <b>the</b> <b>DEA</b> was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E
25|$|In October 2002, the Coalition for Rescheduling Cannabis (headed by Gettman and {{composed}} of an agglomeration of organizations) filed another petition before <b>the</b> <b>DEA.</b> In April 2002, <b>the</b> <b>DEA</b> formally accepted the proposal, which sought federal {{recognition of the}} medicinal value of cannabis, reclassification of the drug, {{and the establishment of}} a legal framework for the production and distribution of medical cannabis. In doing so, <b>the</b> <b>DEA</b> acknowledged sufficient merit in the evidence presented in the petition, which focused on accepted medicinal value rather than relative harm, to warrant additional review rather than dismissal. In 2004, <b>the</b> <b>DEA</b> referred the petition to the Department of Health and Human Services for a full-scale evaluation where, as of May 2006, it remains.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of direct exchange areas (DEA) in zonal method {{is the most}} important task due to the heavy computer cost of multi-integrals together with the existing of singularities. A technique of variable transformation to reduce the fold of integrals, which was developed originally by Erkku (1959) to calculate <b>the</b> <b>DEAs</b> of uniformly zonal dividing cylindrical system, was extended by Tian and Chiu (2003) for nonuniformly zonal dividing cylindrical system with large thermal gradients. In this paper, we further extend the reduced integration scheme (RIS) to calculate <b>the</b> <b>DEAs</b> in three-dimensional rectangular system. The detail deductions of six-, five-, and fourfold integrals to threefold ones are presented; <b>the</b> <b>DEAs</b> in a rectangular system with assumption of gray medium are computed by the Gaussian quadrature integration (GQI) and the RIS comparatively. The comparisons reveal that the RIS can provide remarkable higher accuracy and efficiency than GQI. More interestingly and practicably, <b>the</b> singularities of <b>DEAs</b> can be decomposed and weakened obviously by RIS...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>DEA's</b> use of {{such figures}} is {{questionable}} however. An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association gave the number deaths caused by alcohol in year 2000 as 85,000 - over {{four and a half}} times greater than <b>the</b> <b>DEA's</b> preferred figure. <b>The</b> <b>DEA's</b> argument also overlooks tobacco, causing 435,000 US deaths in year 2000. And, the CDC definition of [...] "drug-induced death" [...] includes suicides using drugs, accidental overdose, and deaths from medically prescribed (not illegal) drugs. An analysis of drug-induced deaths for the 20-year period 1979-1998 found the vast majority attributable to accidental overdose, and suicide by drug taking, which together account for about 76 percent of all such deaths. Taking into account deaths from non-illegal drugs leaves only 21 percent of CDC [...] "drug-induced death" [...] figures actually due to the use of [...] "illegal" [...] drugs.|$|R

In early 1997, Gilani was arrested with another man in a DEA sting operation {{when he tried to}} smuggle heroin into the country from Pakistan. Gilani quickly offered his services as a confidential informant to <b>the</b> <b>DEA.</b> In January 1998, the agency sent him to Pakistan to dispel suspicions amongst his partners about his prior absence, and to gain intelligence on the country's heroin trafficking networks. According to <b>the</b> <b>DEA,</b> Gilani's participation led to five arrests and the seizure of 2½ kilos of heroin. <b>The</b> <b>DEA</b> has insisted that Gilani's 1998 trip to Pakistan was the only one paid for by the agency.|$|E
