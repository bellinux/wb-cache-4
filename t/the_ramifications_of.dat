40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to study <b>the</b> <b>ramification</b> <b>of</b> {{quaternion}} algebras over the function field of a stable elliptic surface, in particular over the field of complex numbers. Over number fields there are criteria for <b>the</b> <b>ramification</b> <b>of</b> quaternion algebras such as the tame symbol formula.

5|$|In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Radovich's favor and {{declared}} the NFL {{was subject to}} antitrust laws, and the implication was that {{the legality of the}} draft and reserve clause were dubious. Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss <b>the</b> <b>ramifications</b> <b>of</b> the Radovich decision. Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|E

We introduce a boundedness condition on <b>the</b> <b>ramification</b> <b>of</b> F along D, and study its main properties, in particular, some specialization properties {{that lead to the}} fundamental notion of cleanliness and to the definition of the characteristic cycle of F.

In sickbay, she has a fever, a dangerously elevated pulse and blood pressure, and a tumorous growth on her back. She resists the ’s (Robert Picardo) treatment and locks herself in his office, finally relenting only to explain to Captain Janeway that she's undergoing the elogium: the Ocampa mating cycle. This process only happens once and usually affects Ocampa between four and five years old—but Kes is not even two. Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and Kes agonize over whether to have children and <b>the</b> <b>ramifications</b> <b>of</b> becoming parents. After discussing children and family with Lieutenant Tuvok (Tim Russ), Neelix decides he's ready to be a father, while Kes has instead decided against it. Ultimately, because the Doctor believes the elogium was artificially induced by the creatures' proximity to the ship, it may come upon her again later in her life when she is ready.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} in 1932, Dallas' sister Eve {{searches}} for Dallas, putting her {{at odds with}} the Gandor family. These stories involved the Daily Days News Information company and the Runorattas' drug plot with Begg, a drug addicted immortal alchemist acquaintance of Maiza's encroaching Gandor turf through his miracle drugs, testing it on innocent bystanders including a young man named Roy Maddock. Eventually Eve is caught up in the turf war involving drugs with the Runoratta family and Gandors, <b>the</b> <b>ramifications</b> <b>of</b> the turf war affecting two lovers: Gandor speakeasy waitress Edith and her boyfriend, revealed to be Roy. The climax of the conflict results in Luck secretly telling Eve where Dallas is to spare her from bloodshed, and with Claire's help, the turf war ends with bittersweet results for Edith and Roy now associated with the Gandors until they finish the debt they compiled in the story albeit in happier terms.|$|E

The Archdemon killed, the leaderless Darkspawn army retreats from Denerim, marking the end of the Fifth Blight. However, if the ritual with Morrigan was not performed, whoever slays the Archdemon also perishes.

In this paper, we prove that <b>the</b> <b>ramification</b> <b>of</b> L/K is bounded by j {{if and only if}} <b>the</b> <b>ramification</b> <b>of</b> E/F is bounded by j.
