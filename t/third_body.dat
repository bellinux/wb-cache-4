5|$|A third {{possibility}} is {{the involvement of}} a <b>third</b> <b>body</b> or a type of impact disruption. More-recent lines of evidence for Phobos having a highly porous interior, and suggesting a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from Mars, point toward an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit, similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon. Although the VNIR spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids, the thermal infrared spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class.|$|E
5|$|The genital {{openings}} (gonopores) of {{both sexes}} are located {{on the underside of}} the <b>third</b> <b>body</b> segment (near the second pair of legs) and may be accompanied in the male by one or two penes which deposit the sperm packets onto the gonopods. In the female, the genital pores open into paired small sacs called cyphopods or vulvae, which are covered by small hood-like lids, and are used to store the sperm after copulation. The cyphopod morphology can also be used to identify species. Millipede sperm lack flagella, a unique trait among myriapods.|$|E
5|$|A city {{councilor}} {{from each}} of the city's nine council districts is elected every two years, each serving a term of two years. Councilors are elected from their own respective districts based on a plurality voting system, and serve on the Tulsa City Council. As a whole, the council acts as the legislative body of city government, which aims to pass laws, approve the city budget, and manage efficiency in city government. In accordance with the mayor-council form of government, the Tulsa City Council and the office of the Mayor coordinate in city government operations. A <b>third</b> <b>body</b> of the government, the city auditor, is elected independently of the city council and mayor to ensure that the auditor can act in an objective manner. The auditor is elected for a term of two years. Phil Wood, a Democrat, held the position for 21 years before being defeated by Republican Preston Doerflinger in the 2009 election. The city serves as the seat of county government for Tulsa County, and lies mostly within Oklahoma's 1st congressional district, with its far northwestern areas in southern Osage County in Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district. Municipal and State laws are enforced in Tulsa by the Tulsa Police Department, an organization of 781 officers as of 2012.|$|E
30|$|One final unclear issue {{regarding}} crosslinked polyethylene is its third-body wear resistance: it {{has been}} supposed that XPE, due to its micromorphology, could be less resistant to such wear than UHMWPE, which may be a problem when <b>third</b> <b>bodies</b> like bone fragments are present in revisions or microparticles of PMMA are present in cemented implants. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there are no laboratory wear tests that report such a problem, {{and there are no}} reports of failures related to the presence of <b>third</b> <b>bodies,</b> so more studies are needed to clearly understand this issue.|$|R
40|$|Orbital period {{changes of}} binary stars {{may be caused}} by the {{presence}} of a <b>third</b> massive <b>body</b> in the system. Here we have searched the archive of the Wide Angle Search for Planets (SuperWASP) project for evidence of period variations in 13 [*] 927 eclipsing binary candidates. Sinusoidal period changes, strongly suggestive of <b>third</b> <b>bodies,</b> were detected in 2 % of cases; however, linear period changes were observed in a further 22 % of systems. We argue on distributional grounds that the majority of these apparently linear changes are likely to reflect longer-term sinusoidal period variations caused by <b>third</b> <b>bodies,</b> and thus estimate a higher-order multiplicity fraction of 24 % for SuperWASP binaries, in good agreement with other recent figures for the fraction of triple systems amongst binary stars in general...|$|R

For example, given two massive bodies in orbits around their common barycenter, {{there are five}} positions in space where a <b>third</b> <b>body,</b> of comparatively negligible mass, could be placed so as to maintain its position relative to the two massive bodies. As seen in a rotating reference frame that matches the angular velocity of the two co-orbiting bodies, the gravitational fields of two massive bodies combined with the minor body's centrifugal force are in balance at the Lagrangian points, allowing the smaller <b>third</b> <b>body</b> to be relatively stationary {{with respect to the}} first two.|$|E

25|$|The {{increasing}} {{tension between}} Berke and Hulagu was {{a warning to}} the Golden Horde contingents in Hulagu's army that they had better escape. One section reached the Kipchak Steppe, another traversed Khorasan and a <b>third</b> <b>body</b> took refuge in Mamluk ruled Syria where they were well received by Sultan Baybars (1260–77). Hulagu harshly punished {{the rest of the}} Golden Horde army in Iran. Berke sought a joint attack with Baybars and forged an alliance with the Mamluks against Hulagu. The Golden Horde dispatched Nogai to invade the Ilkhanate but Hulagu forced him back in 1262. The Ilkhanids then crossed the Terek River, capturing an empty Jochid encampment, only to be routed in a surprise attack by Nogai's forces. Many of them were drowned as the ice broke on the frozen Terek River.|$|E
25|$|Attlee himself {{played a}} {{generally}} low key but {{vital role in}} the wartime government, working behind the scenes and in committees to ensure the smooth operation of government. In the coalition government, three inter-connected committees effectively ran the country. Churchill chaired the first two, the War Cabinet and the Defence Committee, with Attlee deputising for him in these, and answering for the government in Parliament when Churchill was absent. Attlee himself instituted, and later chaired the <b>third</b> <b>body,</b> the Lord President's Committee, which was responsible for overseeing domestic affairs. As Churchill was most concerned with overseeing the war effort, this arrangement suited both men. Attlee himself had largely been responsible for creating these arrangements with Churchill's backing, streamlining the machinery of government and abolishing many committees. He also acted as a concilliator in the government, smoothing over tensions which frequently arose between Labour and Conservative Ministers.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{thermodynamic}} instruments, the meter and the reservoir. A thermodynamic meter is any device which measures any parameter of a thermodynamic system. In some cases, the thermodynamic parameter is actually defined in terms of an idealized measuring instrument. For example, the zeroth law states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a <b>third</b> <b>body,</b> they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This principle, as noted by James Maxwell in 1872, asserts {{that it is possible to}} measure temperature. An idealized thermometer is a sample of an ideal gas at constant pressure. From the ideal gas law pV=nRT, the volume of such a sample can be used as an indicator of temperature; in this manner it defines temperature. Although pressure is defined mechanically, a pressure-measuring device, called a barometer may also be constructed from a sample of an ideal gas held at a constant temperature. A calorimeter is a device which is used to measure and define the internal energy of a system.|$|E

There are no independent military forces on the Isle of Man, although HMS Ramsey is affiliated with the town of the same name. From 1938 to 1955 there was the Manx Regiment of the British Territorial Army, which saw extensive action during the Second World War. In 1779, the Manx Fencible Corps, a fencible regiment of three companies, was raised; it was disbanded in 1783 at the end of the American War of Independence. Later, the Royal Manx Fencibles was raised at the time of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. The 1st Battalion (of 3 companies) was raised in 1793. A 2nd Battalion (of 10 companies) was raised in 1795, and it saw action during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. The regiment was disbanded in 1802. A <b>third</b> <b>body</b> of Manx Fencibles was raised in 1803 to defend the Island during the Napoleonic Wars and to assist the Revenue. It was disbanded in 1811.

2500|$|The reason {{these points}} are in balance is that, at [...] and , the {{distances}} {{to the two}} masses are equal.

The barycenter being both the center of mass and center of rotation of the three-body system, this resultant force is exactly that required to keep the smaller body at the Lagrange point in orbital equilibrium with the other two larger bodies of system. (Indeed, the <b>third</b> <b>body</b> need not have negligible mass.) The general triangular configuration was discovered by Lagrange in work on the three-body problem.|$|E

40|$|Three {{eclipsing binary}} systems with astrometric orbit have been studied. For a {{detailed}} analysis two circular-orbit binaries (VW Cep and HT Vir) and one binary with an eccentric orbit (zeta Phe) have been chosen. Merging together astrometry and {{the analysis of the}} times of minima, one is able to describe the orbit of such a system completely. The O-C diagrams and the astrometric orbits of the <b>third</b> <b>bodies</b> were analysed simultaneously for these three systems by the least-squares method. The introduced algorithm is useful and powerful, but also time consuming, due to many parameters which one is trying to derive. The new orbits for the <b>third</b> <b>bodies</b> in these systems were found with periods 30, 221, and 261 yr, and eccentricities 0. 63, 0. 37, and 0. 64 for VW Cep, zeta Phe, and HT Vir, respectively. Also an independent approach to compute the distances to these systems was used.
