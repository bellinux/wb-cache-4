5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
25|$|He comprehended at last <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to see a}} grisette. Then {{he showed}} me dozens of them. They were like nearly all the Frenchwomen I ever saw—homely. They had large hands, large feet, large mouths; they had pug noses as a general thing, and moustaches that not even good {{breeding}} could overlook; they combed their hair straight back without parting; they were ill-shaped, they were not winning, they were not graceful; I knew by their looks that they ate garlic and onions; and lastly and finally, to my thinking it would be base flattery to call them immoral.|$|E

500|$|The reason I {{added the}} piccolo trumpet and {{classical}} {{section in the}} middle of Let's All Chant' was mainly because I was embarrassed! I thought it was so stupid with that 'Ooh-ah' sound in it <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to add something to lift the track musically. I have a classical background and went to a music conservatory, so I was really feeling embarrassed ...|$|E
500|$|After the Dream Within a Dream Tour {{in support}} of Britney {{finalized}} in July 2002, Spears announced she would {{take a break from}} her career for six months. In November 2002, she revealed that she had started working on her next studio album. She explained, [...] "Well, actually, I just said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> two or three weeks off.

500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to express. The shit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E

For example, in 2008 Fabio Capello appointed four Italians (Franco Baldini as general manager, Italo Galbiati as assistant coach, Franco Tancredi as goalkeeping coach and Massimo Neri as fitness coach); he then appointed Englishman Stuart Pearce, the England Under 21s coach, as an England coach, with Capello stating [...] "From the start I made it clear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> an English coach {{as part of my}} coaching team." ...|$|E
500|$|That {{is one of}} {{my biggest}} records ever, hype-wise, the music itself, I love it to the core. I don’t do songs {{thinking}} this has to be a hit. I do music based on how I feel from my heart and that is typically New Guy. New Guy is like a heart fulfilling type of record and to me, I think it actually hit the major impact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to hit and people are loving it [...] My fans love it.|$|E

500|$|Nigel Kneale {{explained}} in a 1990s interview the background that had led him to formulate Quatermass and the other characters of the original serial in 1953. [...] "I wanted to write some strong characters, but I didn't {{want them to be}} like those horrible people in those awful American science fiction films, chewing gum and stating the obvious. Not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do something terribly 'British', but I didn't like all the flag-waving you got in those films. I tried to get real human interest in the stories, and some good humour." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There was {{a period}} where I felt like I wasn't quite being {{considered}} for the projects <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to work on because maybe people were thinking.

In the next few races I plan to get back all the points I have lost in the opening two rounds." ...|$|E

It’s something that I did with her voice. I mean, a lot or people who hear it, they might not even realize that it's her. I use textures when I do records and I just wanted her voice texture on this record, and she really made this song. Now she's been complaining saying she's been taken off the record, I don't know where that came from.

I decided <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to work with a}} whole bunch of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E
500|$|Parker's {{experience}} {{playing in}} Israel left a positive impression upon him. He {{went on to}} wear jersey number 18 for both Toronto and Cleveland, explaining that: [...] "I played in Israel before I {{came back to the}} NBA, and I had such a great time... two of my sons were born while I was playing overseas and one was actually born in Israel. And I just had such a great experience <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to take something from that experience. The number 18, in Judaism, it means 'chai'... and it's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism. And I thought that was something to take away from Israel and let them know I'm still representing them." ...|$|E

Yankovic later tweeted: [...] "I’m just as confused as you are why 'Another One Rides the Bus' was featured in #TheWalkingDead season premiere, but I’m extremely honored!" [...] Showrunner Scott M.

500|$|Creators Murphy and Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production.

So it just was a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{became friends}} with former Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro in early 1988. They often jammed together, and Peligro invited his friend Flea (bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers) to join. Frusciante and Flea {{developed}} a musical chemistry immediately, with Flea later acknowledging {{that might have been}} the day he first played the bass riff to [...] "Nobody Weird Like Me". Around the same time, Frusciante intended to audition for Frank Zappa's band, but changed his mind before the final try-out as Zappa strictly prohibited illegal drug use. Frusciante said, [...] "I realized <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be a rock star, do drugs and get girls, and that I wouldn't be able to do that if I was in Zappa's band." ...|$|E
