25|$|Callability — Some bonds give <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> {{the right}} to repay the bond before the {{maturity}} date on the call dates; see call option. These bonds {{are referred to as}} callable bonds. Most callable bonds allow <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> to repay the bond at par. With some bonds, <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> has to pay a premium, the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> in its operations. To be free from these covenants, <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.|$|E
25|$|Ordinarily {{seigniorage}} {{is only an}} {{interest-free loan}} (for instance of gold) to <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> of the coin or paper money. When the currency is worn out, <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> buys it back at face value, thereby balancing exactly the revenue received when it was put into circulation, without any additional amount for the interest value of what <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> received.|$|E
25|$|Compare {{this with}} other securities, {{in which there}} is a primary market when an issuer issues the security, and a {{secondary}} market where the security is later traded independently of <b>the</b> <b>issuer.</b> Legally, the security represents an obligation of <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> rather than the buyer and seller; even if <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> buys back some securities, they still exist. Only if they are legally cancelled can they disappear.|$|E

25|$|Bond {{prices can}} become {{volatile}} {{depending on the}} credit rating of <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> – for instance if the credit rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Moody's upgrade or downgrade the credit rating of <b>the</b> <b>issuer.</b> An unanticipated downgrade will cause the market price of the bond to fall. As with interest rate risk, this risk {{does not affect the}} bond's interest payments (provided <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> does not actually default), but puts at risk the market price, which affects mutual funds holding these bonds, and holders of individual bonds who may have to sell them.|$|E
25|$|Call features: The {{ability of}} <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> (on some bonds) {{to call a}} bond early for redemption. This should not {{be mistaken for a}} call option. A Softcall would refer to a call feature where <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> can only call under certain circumstances, {{typically}} based on the underlying stock price performance (e.g. current stock price is above 130% of the conversion price for 20 days out of 30 days). A Hardcall feature would not need any specific conditions beyond a date: that case <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> would be able to recall a portion or the totally of the issuance at the Call price (typically par) after a specific date.|$|E
