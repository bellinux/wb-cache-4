In this study, we aimed to identify molecular changes that reflected the histopathological progression of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and <b>tubular</b> cell <b>damage.</b> A discovery set of renal biopsies were obtained from 48 patients with histopathologically confirmed CKD, and gene expression profiles were determined by microarray analysis. The results indicated that hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (also known as Kidney Injury Molecule- 1, KIM- 1), lipocalin 2 (also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, NGAL), SRY-box 9, WAP four-disulfide core domain 2, and NK 6 homeobox 2 were differentially expressed in CKD. Their expression levels correlated with the extent of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular cell injury, determined by histopathological examination. The expression of these 5 genes was also increased as kidney damage progressed in a rodent unilateral ureteral obstruction model of CKD. We calculated a molecular score using the microarray gene expression profiles of the biopsy specimens.

This set of symptoms {{was not given}} a name until 30 years later, when the nephrologist Oliver Wrong more fully described the disease.Wrong had studied with Dent and chose to name the disease after his mentor. Dent's disease is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the gene CLCN5, which encodes a kidney-specific voltage-gated chloride channel, a 746-amino-acid protein (CLC-5) with 12 to 13 transmembrane domains. It manifests itself through low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, aminoaciduria and hypophosphataemia. Because of its rather rare occurrence, Dent's disease is often diagnosed as idiopathic hypercalciuria, i.e., excess calcium in urine with undetermined causes.|$|E

50|$|Further {{investigation}} and evaluation showed that unmodified cell-free haemoglobin had limitations, such as: an oxygen affinity {{that was too}} high for effective tissue oxygenation; a half-life within the intravascular space that was too short to be clinically useful; and a tendency to undergo dissociation in dimers with resultant renal <b>tubular</b> <b>damage</b> and toxicity. Early studies conducted in experimental animals showed that infusion of free haemoglobin caused also substantial increase in oncotic pressure because of its hyperosmolarity, coagulopathy, and hypertension. The general problem was that solutions of acellular haemoglobin were not as effective at oxygenation as {{packed red blood cells}} because of their high affinity for oxygen. Red blood cells have adapted to release oxygen at an oxygen half-saturation pressure of haemoglobin (P-50) of approximately 26.5 mm Hg, {{as a result of the}} allosteric effects of red bloods cell 2,3-disphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), which shifts the oxyhaemoglobin curve to the right. Without 2,3-DPG, stroma-free haemoglobin has a P-50 of 12-14 mm Hg, not allowing for the adequate release of oxygen to the tissues. This sides effects have been attributed to dissociation of a2b2 tetramer to ab dimers (short intravascular half-life, high oxygen affinity, nephrotoxicity), contamination with RBC stroma and affinity of Hb for nitric oxide (abdominal pain, vasoconstrictive crises). To overcome this problems several types of Hb modification methods (purification, cross-linkage, polymerisation) were developed in the last few decades.|$|E

METHODS [...] In vitro BrdU labelling of renal biopsy specimens was undertaken and labelled cells were detected in routinely fixed, paraffin wax embedded sections by immunohistochemistry. The BrdU LI were calculated as percentages for the three types of tubular cells [...] proximal and distal convoluted tubules and medulla (LI/PCT, LI/DCT, LI/Med) [...] and a total tubular BrdU LI (LI/Tub) was also calculated for each biopsy specimen. Histological features indicative of <b>tubular</b> <b>damage</b> were also scored and a total <b>tubular</b> <b>damage</b> score obtained for each biopsy specimen.

Thus, we examined the renoprotective effect of GW 501516, a PPARd agonist, in a protein-overload mouse nephropathy model and identified its molecular mechanism. Mice fed with a control diet or GW 501516 -containing diet were intraperitoneally injected with free fatty acid (FFA) -bound albumin or PBS(2). In the control group, protein overload caused <b>tubular</b> <b>damages,</b> macrophage infiltration and increased mRNA expression of MCP- 1 and TNFa. These effects were prevented by GW 501516 treatment. In proteinuric kidney diseases, excess exposure of proximal tubular cells to albumin, FFA bound to albumin or cytokines such as TNFa is detrimental. In vitro studies using cultured proximal tubular cells showed that GW 501516 attenuated both TNFa- and FFA (palmitate) -induced, but not albumin-induced, MCP- 1 expression via direct inhibition of the TGF-b activated kinase 1 (TAK 1) -NFkB pathway, a common downstream signaling pathway to TNFa receptor and toll-like receptor- 4.

We showed {{in the current study}} that 24 h of UO led to renal tubular hypoxia in the ipsilateral kidney in mice, with the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 2 a, which lasted for a week after the release of UO. To address the functions of HIF- 2 a in UOmediated protection of renal IRI, we utilized the Mx-Cre/loxP recombination system to knock out target genes. Inactivation of HIF- 2 a, but not HIF- 1 a blunted the renal protective effects of UO, as demonstrated by much higher serum creatinine level and severer histological damage. UO failed to prevent postischemic neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis induction in HIF- 2 a knockout mice, which also diminished the postobstructive up-regulation of {{the protective}} molecule, heat shock protein (HSP) - 27. The renal protective effects of UO were associated with the improvement of the postischemic recovery of intrarenal microvascular blood flow, which was also dependent on the activation of HIF- 2 a.

AngII-induced increase in {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) levels and senescent changes were attenuated by Ghrelin. Ghrelin also inhibited AngII-induced upregulations of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), ameliorating renal fibrotic changes. These effects were accompanied by concomitant increase in mitochondria uncoupling protein, UCP 2 {{as well as in}} a key regulator of mitochondria biosynthesis, PGC 1 α. In renal proximal cell line, HK- 2 cells, Ghrelin reduced mitochondria membrane potential and mitochondria-derived ROS. The transfection of UCP 2 siRNA abolished the decrease in mitochondria-derived ROS by Ghrelin.

It is well established that oxidant production increases during cold renal preservation and mitochondria are a key target for injury.

In order to better translate animal studies, the inclusion of large animal models is necessary to develop safe preclinical protocols. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that addition of MitoQ to cold storage solution preserves mitochondrial function by decreasing oxidative stress, leading to less renal <b>tubular</b> <b>damage</b> during cold preservation of porcine kidneys employing a standard criteria donor model.

Methods: Twenty eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: 4 hour sham (Sham 4), 8 hour sham (Sham 8), 10 minute ischemia 4 hour reperfusion (I/R 4) and 10 minute ischemia 8 hour reperfusion (I/R 8). Blood, urine and kidney samples were collected. Serum creatinine level was analyzed with Jaffe method, while serum and urinary NGAL level were analyzed with direct sandwich ELISA method. Evaluation of kidney damage were measured semi quantitatively in tissue stained with HE. Further evaluation to confirm cellular changes on kidney was performed by electron microscope and immunohistochemistry. Results: Serum NGAL was found significantly correlated with degree of kidney tissue damage (ρSpearman NGAL serum = 0. 701, p < 0. 001), also urinary NGAL (ρSpearman = 0. 689, p < 0. 001). NGAL expression differs significantly between I/R group and sham (t-test, t = - 26635. 056, p < 0. 001), also kidney damage (t-test, t = - 5. 028, p < 0. 001), and serum and urinary NGAL levels (Mann-Whitney, U = 0, p < 0. 001). With cutoff points of 136. 95 ng/mL and 58. 69 ng/mL subsequently for serum and urinary NGAL, it is found that sensitivity = 1, specificity = 1. Conclusion: Elevation of serum and urinary NGAL are significantly correlated with epithelial <b>tubular</b> kidney <b>damage</b> on rat undergoing early ischaemia reperfusion.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{functions}} of the renal metallothioneins (MTs) in rats following ischemic acute renal failure, the expression of MT mRNA and the localization of MT in rats undergoing 60 min of bilateral renal artery clamp ischemia followed by reperfusion was examined by Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis. Induction of maximum at 1 to 3 days followed by a gradual decrease. Histlogically, both MT mRNA and MT were detected in renal tubular cells intensely and specifically in the outer medulla at 1 day after release of the clamp. These findings suggest that MTs protect the tubular cells by scavenging the free radicals, which probably cause renal <b>tubular</b> cell <b>damage</b> by ischemia-reperfusion, and that MTs provide the zinc ions to zinc-requiring apo-enzymes necessary for healing and regenerating renal tubular cells...|$|R
40|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} the association of hemoglobinemia with acute renal failure remain unknown. The difficulties in studying this problem in patients are manifold, consequently {{the bulk of the}} investigation in this area has necessarily involved experimentally produced lesions in the laboratory animal. Largely as a result of such studies a variety of differing and conflicting hypotheses concerning the pathogenesis of this renal lesion have arisen. Perhaps the most favored of these are the suggestions that (a) tubular blockage by precipitated hemoglobin is the primary cause of excretory failure in the affected kidney, and (b) some undefined factor or factors produce a primary reduction in glomerular filtration rate, presumably as a consequence of renal ischemia. Carefully performed studies may be cited in support of either the first (1, 2) or second (3, 4) of these hypotheses. In addition, other explanations for the renal failure have been considered, particularly the role of abnormal back diffusion of <b>tubular</b> fluid through <b>damaged</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial structures and the effect of renal edema in reducing renal blood flow and filtration rate. The establishment of an experimental model of a clinical renal disease in the laboratory animal affords th...|$|R
