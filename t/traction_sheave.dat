40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an elevator system comprising an elevator car, a counterweight, a compensation rope affixed at a first {{end to the}} elevator car and at a second end to the counterweight, and a compensation sheave, the compensation rope being wrapped around the compensation sheave, wherein a <b>traction</b> <b>sheave,</b> drives at least one support means supporting the elevator car and the counterweight, the <b>traction</b> <b>sheave</b> being provided with tension means for inducing {{a variation of the}} tension of the compensation rope...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} elevators, which are {{hydraulic}} and traction, {{have been widely}} used as vertical transportation equipment. EcoSystemTM is a family of AC gearless elevators developed by Montgomery KONE. The compact EcoDiscTM hoisting machine is an AC gearless motor of axial synchronous design with an integrated <b>traction</b> <b>sheave,</b> break flange, and rotor. Compact and light weight, EcoDisc, requires no penthouse or large machine room...|$|E
40|$|Several common {{elevator}} malfunctions {{were diagnosed}} with a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). After acquiring vibration signals of various elevator functions, their energy characteristics and time domain indicators were extracted by theoretically analyzing the optimal wavelet packet, in order to construct a feature vector of malfunctions for identifying causes of the malfunctions as input of LS-SVM. Meanwhile, parameters about LS-SVM were optimized by K-fold cross validation (K-CV). After diagnosing deviated elevator guide rail, deviated shape of guide shoe, abnormal running of tractor, erroneous rope groove of <b>traction</b> <b>sheave,</b> deviated guide wheel, and tension of wire rope, the results suggested that the LS-SVM based on K-CV optimization was one of effective methods for diagnosing elevator malfunctions...|$|E

The main {{task is to}} design the conception of lift frame for the lift machine Sassi Toro with a deflector for a loading capacity of 1000 to 1600 kilos. It´s necessary to make a calculation of <b>traction</b> on driving <b>sheave</b> of machine. On the base of these values {{we are able to}} asses a maximum ropes distance between the driving sheave and deflector...|$|R
40|$|Long moving {{vertical}} {{ropes and}} cables {{are used in}} various engineering systems. In particular, in high-rise structures traction drive elevators they are employed {{as a means of}} car and counterweight suspension and for compensation of tensile forces over the <b>traction</b> <b>sheave.</b> Also, ropes are applied in the elevator governor systems to activate the safety gear in order to bring the car and counterweight safely to rest in the event of emergency and failure of the normal stopping system. An adverse situation arises when the host structure is excited near its fundamental natural frequency and vibrates harmonically. This often results in a passage through resonance conditions in the rope system when the slowly varying natural frequencies of the ropes approach the frequency of the inertial load resulting from the building sway. The nature of such a loading is usually nondeterministic and it is necessary to apply stochastic models to analyze the dynamic responses of the ropes. In this paper a model to describe the lateral dynamic behaviour of a vertical moving rope is developed. The model takes into account the fact that the longitudinal elastic stretching of the ropes is coupled with their transverse motions which results in cubic nonlinear terms. The governing nonstationary nonlinear equations are then solved numerically to investigate the passage through resonance conditions arising during the elevator travel. Then, the methodology to account for the stochastic nature of the building sway is discussed and the differential equations governing the second-order statistical moments of the state vector are developed. The stochastic differential equations are treated numerically to predict the variance of the rope response...|$|E
