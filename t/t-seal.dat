40|$|Comparison metrics can be {{established}} to reliably and repeatedly establish {{the health of the}} joggle region of the Orbiter Wing Leading Edge reinforced carbon carbon (RCC) panels. Using these metrics can greatly reduced the man hours needed to perform, wing leading edge scanning for service induced damage. These time savings have allowed for more thorough inspections to be preformed in the necessary areas with out affecting orbiter flow schedule. Using specialized local inspections allows for a larger margin of safety by allowing for more complete characterizations of panel defects. The presence of the <b>t-seal</b> during thermographic inspection can have adverse masking affects on ability properly characterize defects that exist in the joggle region of the RCC panels. This masking affect dictates the final specialized inspection should be preformed with the <b>t-seal</b> removed. Removal of the <b>t-seal</b> and use of the higher magnification optics has lead to the most effective and repeatable inspection method for characterizing and tracking defects in the wing leading edge. Through this study some inadequacies in the main health monitoring system for the orbiter wing leading edge have been identified and corrected. The use of metrics and local specialized inspection have lead to a greatly increased reliability and repeatable inspection of the shuttle wing leading edge...|$|E
40|$|The Space Shuttle Orbiter wing {{comprises}} of 22 {{leading edge}} panels {{on each side}} of the wing. These panels are part of the thermal protection system that protects the Orbiter wings from extreme heating that take place on the reentry in to the earth atmosphere. On some panels that experience extreme heating, liberation of silicon carbon (SiC) coating was observed on the slip side regions of the panels. Global structural and local fracture mechanics analyses were performed on these panels as a part of the root cause investigation of this coating liberation anomaly. The wing-leading-edge reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panels, Panel 9, <b>T-seal</b> 10, and Panel 10, are shown in Figure 1 and the progression of the stress analysis models is presented in Figure 2. The global structural analyses showed minimal interaction between adjacent panels and the <b>T-seal</b> that bridges the gap between the panels. A bounding uniform temperature is applied to a representative panel and the resulting stress distribution is examined. For this loading condition, the interlaminar normal stresses showed negligible variation in the chord direction and increased values in the vicinity of the slip-side joggle shoulder. As such, a representative span wise slice on the panel can be taken and the cross section can be analyzed using plane strain analysis...|$|E
40|$|LS-DYNA {{simulations}} {{were conducted}} to study the influence of model complexity on the response of a typical Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) panel to a foam impact at a location approximately midway between the ribs. A structural model comprised of Panels 10, 11, and TSeal 11 {{was chosen as the}} baseline model for the study. A simulation was conducted with foam striking Panel 10 at Location 4 at an alpha angle of 10 degrees, with an impact velocity of 1000 ft/sec. A second simulation was conducted after removing Panel 11 from the model, and a third simulation was conducted after removing both Panel 11 and <b>T-Seal</b> 11. All three simulations showed approximately the same response for Panel 10, and the simplified simulation model containing only Panel 10 was shown to be significantly less expensive to execute than the other two more complex models...|$|E
5000|$|The light gray {{material}} which withstood reentry temperatures up to [...] {{protected the}} wing leading edges and nose cap. Each of the orbiters’ wings had 22 RCC panels about 1/4 to 1/2 in thick. <b>T-seals</b> between each panel allowed for thermal expansion and lateral movement between these panels and the wing.|$|R
40|$|There is {{observed}} deviation of endurance in dynamic and static sealings in the hydrau-lic system {{of an airplane}} which is suspected {{to be caused by}} differences in material and quality between different manufacturers. In order to find out and verify these dif-ferences series of comparing tests were conducted on specifically made test equip-ment. The main goal of this Master’s Thesis was to perform the needed tests on the seals and to evaluate the test results. The test system consisted of a hydraulically driven test cylinder which was able to test both the dynamic and static seal. The test cylinder was designed {{in such a way that}} it could be used to test two sealing systems at the same time. The test was conducted in conditions that resembled real life usage. The main points were that pressure, tempera-ture and movement speed were the same as in the original application. Control logic was used to run the test cylinder continuously from one end to the other. During the test the force needed to move the cylinder was monitored. From this force the friction and the deviation of friction behavior in dynamic seal during the test were computed. Leakage was monitored both on the dynamic seal and on the static seal. Pressures, position and temperature were also used as survey measures. Speed of the test cylinder was calculated from position. The system allowed testing of two piston seals, two rod seals and two O-rings simultaneously. Both piston seal and rod seal were <b>T-seals.</b> <b>T-seals</b> consist of a T-shaped elastomer sealing element supported by back-up rings on both sides. The wearing of seals was determined by change of weight before and after the experiment. The possible effect of absorption of fluid on the mass and properties of the sealing was examined with separate tests. The properties of the seals between the two manufacturers differed in the present study and the seals of manufacturer 2 lasted wearing better than the seals of manufacturer 1. This result is based on the leakage during the test, weighting after the test and friction behavior during the test. Also visual observation of the seals supports this finding...|$|R
40|$|The Columbia Accident Investigation Board has {{identified}} {{about a dozen}} shuttle program safety concerns it will address in its final report, in addition to foam shedding from the Lockheed Martin external tank-believed by many board members to be the direct cause {{for the loss of}} Columbia and her crew. As new evidence narrows the location of Columbia's left-wing breach to a lower corner of reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) Panel 8 and its adjoining <b>T-seal,</b> the board is broadening its penetration of other shuttle safety issues. As the board works in Houston, United Space Alliance technicians here at Kennedy last week sent the first six of 22 RCC panels from the orbiter Atlantis left wing to Vought Aircraft Industries Inc. in Dallas for extensive testing to assess their integrity. The move is a key step toward both returning the shuttle to flight with Atlantis and obtaining more data on RCC panels subjected to fewer flights, and less exposure to the weather, than the older panels used on Columbia...|$|E
40|$|The present {{configuration}} of Helium Buffer Seal on the ATD oxygen pump {{consists of a}} pair of opposed carbon rings are forced axially against their containment housings. Leakage occurs through the clearance between the rings and the shaft. The total helium leakage through both sides is approximately 239 SCFM. A reduction in leakage to 50 SCFM will result in less helium storage and consequently permit a substantial increase in payload. Under Phase 1 NASA SBIR, a solid T-Ring seal was analyzed and designed that could satisfy the criteria of reducing leakage to 50 SCFM or less. The design makes maximum use of available length and employs a mid length row of hydrostatic orifaces that feed buffer helium directly into a 2 to 3 mil clearance region. The flow splits into opposite paths to buffer oxygen gas on one side and hydrogen gas on the turbine side. The seal employs opposed hydrostatic tapered land secondary seals that provide friction free support of the primary seal and allows the primary seal to follow rotor excursion and maintain concentric operating clearance. The predicted performance of the <b>T-seal</b> is excellent with operation at a safe film thickness of 2 to 2. 5 mils and leakage less than 50 SCFM...|$|E
