The design objective {{is that the}} peak of the tracking error in time domain must be as small as possible under persistent bounded disturbances. Since the nonlinear L∞-gain optimal <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> cannot be solved directly, the nonlinear L∞-gain optimal tracking problem is transformed into a nonlinear L∞-gain tracking problem by given a prescribed disturbance attenuation level for the L∞-gain tracking performance. To guarantee that the L∞-gain tracking performance can be achieved for the uncertain robotic systems, a sliding-mode scheme is introduced to eliminate the effect of the parameter uncertainties. By virtue of the skew-symmetric property of the robotic systems, sufficient conditions are developed for solving the robust L∞-gain <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> problems in terms of an algebraic equation instead of a differential equation.

In practice, task-space control of redundant robot systems {{is known to be}} susceptive to modeling errors. Here, data driven learning methods may present an interesting alternative approach. However, learning models for task-space <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> from sampled data is an ill-posed problem. In particular, the same input data point can yield many different output values which can form a non-convex solution space. Because the problem is ill-posed, models cannot be learned from such data using common regression methods. While learning of task-space control mappings is globally ill-posed, it has been shown in recent work that it is locally a well-defined problem.
