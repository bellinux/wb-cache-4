5|$|His role {{in shaping}} North Korean {{literature}} was to be pivotal. Cho's early works Mt. Paektu (MR: Paektusan, 1947) and Land (MR: Ttang, 1946) would point out <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> North Korean literature was about to take. These works would soon become models for North Korean literature. Upon his return, he started writing for Chosŏn Sinmun, the Soviet Red Army's Korean-language paper, working as a correspondent and translator. He translated works of such Soviet poets as Mayakovsky, Gribachev, and Jambyl Jabayev.|$|E
5|$|Movements of grey-headed {{flying foxes}} are {{influenced}} by the availability of food. Their population is very fluid, as they move in response to the irregular blossoming of certain plant species. They are keystone pollinators and seed disperses over 100 species of native trees and plants. The grey-headed flying fox is a partial migrant that uses winds to facilitate long-distance movement. It does not migrate in a specific direction, but rather in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> will be the most beneficial at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Apex of the Sun's Way, or {{the solar}} apex, is <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> the Sun travels {{relative}} to other nearby stars. This motion is towards {{a point in the}} constellation Hercules, near the star Vega. Of the 50 nearest stellar systems within 17 light-years from Earth (the closest being the red dwarf Proxima Centauri at approximately 4.2 light-years), the Sun ranks fourth in mass.|$|E

5|$|In Star Wars: Jedi Arena, two Jedi Knights, one {{blue and}} one red, {{face each other}} during lightsaber training. Player one is blue; the red Jedi is either a human- or {{computer-controlled}} opponent. The player controls his or her lightsaber with the paddle controller, defending oneself from the laser blasts coming from the Seeker ball, fired by the opponent. The Seeker will regularly turn wild and fire laser blasts randomly. The objective {{of the game is}} to fire laser blasts from the Seeker at the opponent's shield and finally directly at the opponent by aiming in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> the lightsaber is pointing. The game has four difficulty levels, changing the Seeker's speed; on the highest level, the Seeker is invisible. The game ends when one player has received three direct hits, and the winner becomes a Jedi Master.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the opinion}} of Mearns and White who {{investigated}} the wreck that this was unlikely as the damage was far too limited in scale, nor could it account for the outwardly splayed plates also observed in that area. Bill Jurens points {{out that there was}} no magazine of any kind at the location of the break and that the location of the break just forward of the forward transverse armoured bulkhead suggests that the ship's structure failed there as a result of stresses inflicted when the bow was lifted into the vertical position by the sinking stern section. Furthermore, the current position of the plates {{at the edge of the}} break only reflects their last position, not <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> they first moved.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} Galilean {{satellites}} and the Moon, Io rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter. This synchronicity provides the definition for Io's longitude system. Io's prime meridian intersects the equator at the sub-Jovian point. The side of Io that always faces Jupiter {{is known as}} the subjovian hemisphere, whereas the side that always faces away {{is known as the}} antijovian hemisphere. The side of Io that always faces in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> Io travels in its orbit is known as the leading hemisphere, whereas the side that always faces in the opposite direction is known as the trailing hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Stanton and Pike {{stopped to}} rest, and Reed {{returned}} alone to the group, arriving {{four days after}} the party's departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of Weber Canyon, or forge their own trail in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route. Their progress slowed to about {{a mile and a half}} (2.4km) a day, and all the able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave rocks to make room for the wagons.|$|E
5|$|The Roux Brothers Scholarship {{was founded}} by Albert and Michel in 1984. It is an annual {{competition}} to select a single chef to send out as an apprentice. The first winner was Andrew Fairlie, and winners {{over the years have}} included Sat Bains (1999) and Simon Hulstone (2003). In 1986 the brothers split their restaurant business between them following a disagreement over <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> their joint business should take; Albert took Le Gavroche, while Michel took the Waterside Inn. Michel became a consultant to British Airways for twenty years between 1983 and 2003, and for Celebrity Cruises since 1990. The Roux brothers' catering company was purchased by Compass Group in 1993, with Albert retained as a consultant.|$|E

5|$|The {{object of}} Silent Hill 2 is to guide player character, James Sunderland, through the monster-filled town of Silent Hill as he {{searches}} for his deceased wife. The game features a third-person view, with various camera angles. The default control for Silent Hill 2 has James moving in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> he is facing when the player tilts the analog stick upwards. Silent Hill 2 {{does not use}} a heads-up display; to check James' health, location, and items, the player must enter the pause-game menu to review his status. Throughout the game, James collects maps, {{which can only be}} read if there is sufficient light or when his flashlight is on. He also updates relevant maps to reflect locked doors, clues, and obstructions, and writes down the content of all documents for future reference.|$|E
5|$|While the {{district}} includes {{all of the}} cities and communities in its jurisdiction, some of these cities do not have stations on the BART system. This has caused tensions among property owners in cities like Livermore who pay BART taxes but must travel outside the city to receive BART service. In areas like Fremont, the majority of commuters do not commute in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> BART would take them (many Fremonters commute to San Jose, where there is currently no BART service). This would be alleviated with {{the completion of a}} BART-to-San Jose extension project and the opening of the Berryessa Station in San Jose.|$|E
5|$|Britain's Deviants, in {{the late}} 1960s, played {{in a range of}} {{psychedelic}} styles with a satiric, anarchic edge and a penchant for situationist-style spectacle presaging the Sex Pistols by almost a decade. In 1970, the act evolved into the Pink Fairies, which carried on in a similar vein. With his Ziggy Stardust persona, David Bowie made artifice and exaggeration central—elements, again, that were picked up by the Sex Pistols and certain other punk acts. The Doctors of Madness built on Bowie's presentation concepts, while moving musically in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> would become identified with punk. Bands in London's pub rock scene stripped the music back to its basics, playing hard, R rock 'n' roll. By 1974, the scene's top act, Dr. Feelgood, was paving the way for others such as the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer that would {{play a role in the}} punk explosion. The pub rock scene created small venues where non-mainstream bands could play and they released low-cost recordings on independent record labels. Among the pub rock bands that formed that year was the 101ers, whose lead singer would soon adopt the name Joe Strummer, a performer who has been called the link between pub rock and punk rock. Despite the presence of some shared approaches and values between the two genres, they had an important difference; while pub rock aimed to continue the tradition of earlier rock'n'roll bands, punk rock aimed to break with tradition.|$|E

5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E
5|$|Some of Mighty Jill Offs {{gameplay}} is {{borrowed from}} the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack as a tribute. Players control Jill in only three ways: moving, jumping, and slowly descending. In the air, players may cause Jill to slowly descend by rapidly pushing the jump button while pointing in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> they want her to go. Players can switch direction while they do this. There are three types of obstacles: spikes, fire, and spiders; the latter can move to attack Jill when she comes close. Coming into contact with these obstacles kills Jill instantly, forcing her {{to start at the}} most recent checkpoint—typically located at a change in room. There is only one level in the game, but with several rooms in it. The screen scrolls vertically with Jill as she ascends up the tower. Each room transition is demonstrated by a change in the room's background colour. Jill has infinite lives, allowing players to play as long as they like without having to start the game over.|$|E
5|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of anti-aligned extreme trans-Neptunian objects with orbits that intersect that of Planet Nine {{is the result}} of their resonant dynamics. Objects in mean-motion resonances with a massive planet are phase protected, preventing them from making close approaches to the planet. When the orbit of a resonant object drifts out of phase,} causing it to make closer approaches to a massive planet, the changes in the perturbations the planet exerts on the object alters its semi-major axis in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>that</b> reverses the drift. This process repeats as the drift continues in the other direction causing the orbit to appear to rock back and forth, or librate, about a stable center when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. In the example at right, when the orbit of a plutino drifts backward it loses angular momentum when it makes closer approaches ahead of Neptune, causing its semi-major axis and period to shrink, reversing the drift.|$|E
