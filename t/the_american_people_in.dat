25|$|Preface to Volume 1General PrefaceThe {{entrance}} of the United States of America into the arena of world-politics, the introduction of American influence into Oriental affairs, {{and the establishment of}} American authority in the Philippine archipelago, all render the history of those islands and their, numerous peoples a topic of engrossing interest and importance to the reading public, and especially to scholars, historians, and statesmen. The present work – its material carefully selected and arranged from a vast mass of printed works and unpublished manuscripts – is offered to the public with the intention and hope of casting light on the great problems which confront <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the Philippines; and of furnishing authentic and trustworthy material for a thorough and scholarly history of the islands. For this purpose, the Editors reproduce (mainly in English translation) contemporaneous documents which constitute the best original sources of Philippine history. Beginning with Pope Alexander VI's line of demarcation between the Spanish and the Portuguese dominions in the New World (1493), the course of history in the archipelago is thus traced through a period of more than three centuries, comprising the greater part of the Spanish régime.In the selection of material, the Editors have sought to make the scope of the work commensurate with the breadth of the field, and to allot to each subject space proportioned to its interest; not only the political relations, but the social and religious, economic and commercial conditions of the Philippines have received due attention and care. All classes of writers are here represented—early navigators, officials civil and military, ecclesiastical dignitaries, and priests belonging to the various religious orders who conducted the missions among the Filipino peoples. To the letters, reports, and narratives furnished by these men are added numerous royal decrees, papal bulls and briefs, and other valuable documents. Most of this material is {{now for the first time}} made accessible to English-speaking readers; and the great libraries and archives of Spain, Italy, France, England, Mexico, and the United States have generously contributed to furnish it.In the presentation of these documents, the Editors assume an entirely impartial attitude, free from any personal bias, whether political or sectarian. They aim to secure historical accuracy, especially in that aspect which requires the sympathetic interpretation of each author's thought and intention; and to depict faithfully the various aspects of the life of the Filipinos, their relations with other peoples (especially those of Europe), and the gradual ascent of many tribes from barbarism. They invite the reader's especial attention to the Introduction furnished for this series by Professor Edward Gaylord Bourne, of Yale University – valuable alike for its breadth of view and for its scholarly thoroughness. The Bibliographical Data at the end of each volume will supply necessary information as to sources and location of the documents published therein; fuller details, and of broader scope, will be given in the volume devoted to Philippine bibliography, at the end of the series.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{confidence}} of the Republicans, the nomination of Bryan sparked great excitement through the nation. [...] His program of prosperity through free silver struck an emotional chord with <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> a way that McKinley's protective tariff did not. [...] Many Republican leaders had gone on vacation for the summer, believing that the fight, on their terms, would take place in the fall. [...] Bryan's endorsement, soon after Chicago, by the Populists, his statement that he would undertake a nationwide tour on an unprecedented scale, and word from local activists of the strong silver sentiment in areas Republicans had to win to take the election, jarred McKinley's party from its complacency.|$|E
500|$|MacArthur {{had one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} PR machines of any Allied general during the war, which made him into an extremely popular war hero with <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> late 1943–early 1944, there was a serious effort by the conservative faction in the Republican Party centered in the Midwest to have MacArthur seek the Republican nomination, as they regarded the two men most likely to win the Republican nomination to be the candidate for the presidency in the 1944 election, namely Wendell Willkie and Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York, as too liberal. For a time, MacArthur, who had long seen himself as a potential president was in the words of the U.S historian Gerhard Weinberg [...] "very interested" [...] in running as the Republican candidate in 1944. However, MacArthur's vow to [...] "return" [...] to the Philippines had not been fulfilled in early 1944 and he decided not to run for president until he had liberated the Philippines.|$|E

25|$|At one time, many Bangladeshi Americans {{settled in}} Astoria, but by 2001, many of <b>the</b> Bangladeshi <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Astoria {{had moved to}} Metro Detroit.

500|$|Despite the {{marketing}} attempts, the coin received an overwhelmingly negative reception from the public. Less than two millimeters in diameter {{larger than the}} quarter and struck in the same copper-nickel composition, the Susan B. Anthony dollar was widely confused for that denomination in transactions. Mint Director Hackel noted the difference in weight and design between the two coins and expressed her belief that the dollar would eventually find favor with the public, suggesting that the coin would become [...] "customary to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> time". In the months following its release, complaints mounted and public transportation and many establishments throughout the country began refusing to accept them in payment. On July 13, 1979, California Representative Jerry Lewis introduced a bill to the House of Representatives {{with the intent to}} increase the size of the coin to aid identification. Discussing the bill, which was never passed, Lewis remarked that the Anthony dollar had come to be known derisively as the [...] "Carter quarter", due to its size and association with the President.|$|E
500|$|Observers {{described}} the Reagans' relationship as close, authentic and intimate. During his presidency they {{were reported to}} frequently display their affection for one another; one press secretary said, [...] "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting." [...] He often called her [...] "Mommy" [...] and she called him [...] "Ronnie." [...] He once wrote to her, [...] "Whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When {{he was in the}} hospital in 1981 after an assassination attempt, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent. In a letter to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> 1994, Reagan wrote [...] "I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease... I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience," [...] and in 1998, while he was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him." [...] Nancy Reagan died on March 6, 2016 at the age of 94.|$|E

50|$|The Research on the African-American Family book, {{written by}} Robert B.

It portrays <b>the</b> <b>American</b> lifestyle {{in relation to}} the Civil Rights Movement and illustrates these racial interactions from a woman’s point of view. This collection asks the question “why?” about some basic racial issues in American society. Oil paintings like For Members Only, Neighbors, Watching and Waiting, and The Civil Rights Triangle also embody these themes.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, most polling shows large {{support for}} {{emissions}} trading (often {{referred to as}} cap-and-trade).

A new Washington Post-ABC poll reveals that majorities of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> believe <b>in</b> climate change, are concerned about it, are willing to change their lifestyles and pay more to address it, and want the federal government to regulate greenhouse gases. They are, however, ambivalent on cap-and-trade.|$|R
5000|$|His revised {{statement}} {{was all the}} stronger for its emphatic insistence that posterity would forever endorse <b>the</b> <b>American</b> view of <b>the</b> attack.

In proclaiming the indelibility of the attack and expressing outrage at its [...] "dastardly" [...] nature, the speech worked to crystallize and channel {{the response of the}} nation into a collective response and resolve.|$|R
