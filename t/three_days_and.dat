5|$|Allingham {{also worked}} in Bacton, Norfolk, further up the coast, where night-flying was {{conducted}} {{and was later}} involved in supporting anti-submarine patrols.

5|$|Apollo 17 was {{the last}} of the Apollo program, landing in the Taurus-Littrow region in December 1972. Eugene Cernan {{commanded}} Ronald E. Evans and NASA's first scientist-astronaut, geologist Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt. Schmitt was originally scheduled for Apollo 18, but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing. Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over <b>three</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> spent just over 23 hours of total EVA.|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness {{in the back}} and neck, asymmetrical weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, difficulty swallowing, muscle pain, loss of superficial and deep reflexes, paresthesia (pins and needles), irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. Paralysis generally develops one to ten days after early symptoms begin, progresses for two to <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> is usually complete by the time the fever breaks.|$|E
5|$|In January 1976 {{the band}} {{took a break}} from their live {{performances}} to prepare for recording at Plaza Sound studio. Sessions began in early February 1976 and were completed within a week for $6,400; the instruments took <b>three</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> the vocal parts were recorded in four days. In 2004, Leon admitted that they recorded Ramones quickly due to budget restrictions, but also {{that it was all}} the time they needed.|$|E

5|$|New Washington was looted {{and burned}} on April 20 by Mexican troops, {{and as many}} as 5,000 civilians fled, either by boat or across land. Those {{attempting}} to cross the San Jacinto River were bottlenecked for <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> the vicinity around the crossing transformed into a refugee camp. Burnet ordered government assistance all across Texas for fleeing families.|$|E
5|$|The Go-Getter debuted on January 22, 2007 at the Sundance Film Festival and {{was given}} a limited {{theatrical}} release on June 6, 2008 by Peace Arch Entertainment. Its run lasted just <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> it grossed only US$11,931. Critics were divided {{in reaction to the}} film; some praised the performances, the dialogue and the cinematography, while others thought it was unoriginal, forgettable, and poorly acted.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with the}} four-star rated Rolex Kentucky <b>Three</b> <b>Day</b> <b>and</b> the Burghley Horse Trials, Badminton forms the Rolex Grand Slam of Eventing.

Australian Andrew Hoy nearly took the title in 2007 but lost {{it when he}} had a pole down at Burghley.

5|$|The diversionary attacks went well, with Soviet forces acting {{under the}} {{impression}} that the Poles had targets other than Vilnius. Despite their diversionary intent, these attacks succeeded in their own right, with Generał Józef Adam Lasocki taking Lida in two days despite unexpectedly strong resistance, and Generał Stefan Mokrzecki taking Nowogrodek in <b>three</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> Baranowicze in four.|$|E
5|$|After <b>three</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> {{nights of}} this battle, C Company of the 35th Infantry and A Company of the 29th Infantry moved up astride the Komam-ni road {{during the morning}} of August 20 to bolster A and B Companies on Sibidang. A large {{concentration}} of North Koreans advanced to renew the attack. The US troops directed artillery fire on this force and called in an air strike. Observers estimated that the artillery fire and the air strike killed about 350 North Korean troops, half the attack group.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to escape}} {{under cover of}} {{darkness}} on 14 April, the French squadron was spotted by a number of small British ships stationed close inshore. These ships raised the alarm and the main British squadron followed in pursuit. The rearmost French ship of the line, Hautpoult, was closely followed by the small brig HMS Recruit, which succeeded in delaying Hautpoult long enough that the main British squadron was able to attack and overwhelm her in a running battle that lasted <b>three</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> ended off the coast of Puerto Rico. The British suffered 45 casualties, the French nearly 100. The remainder of the French squadron escaped, with the two surviving ships of the line sailing directly for France, eventually reaching Cherbourg in May.|$|E

5|$|Braithwaite {{was taken}} to Enfield Police Station and interviewed by Det Sgt Dermot McDermott and Detective Constable Colin Biggar. He was held for <b>three</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> was at first denied access to a lawyer, on the {{instruction}} of Det Ch Supt Melvin. He was interviewed eight times over the first two days, and with a lawyer present four times on the third. During the first 30 hours of his detention {{he had nothing to}} eat, and said in court – as did several other suspects – that the heat in the cells was oppressive, making it difficult to breathe.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the amphitheatre was completed, Titus's short reign had already endured a series of disasters: two months after he had succeeded Vespasian, Mount Vesuvius had erupted, {{destroying}} Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, and Oplontis; a fire had burned {{in the city of}} Rome for <b>three</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> three nights causing substantial damage and destroying the Temple of Jupiter that had recently been restored by Vespasian; and there had been an outbreak of plague which was said to be the worst the city had ever endured. To dedicate the amphitheatre and the baths, and probably in an attempt to mollify both the Roman public and the gods, Titus inaugurated the opening of the Colosseum with lavish games which lasted for more than a hundred days.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Society's history, {{when its}} focus was still {{primarily}} literary, membership was considered {{by a committee}} for <b>three</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> then voted upon. By 1908, that model had been abandoned {{in favor of an}} open system in which any student who paid an annual fee could be part of the group. At that time, Philaletheis was governed by a six-member board consisting of a president and vice-president (both seniors), secretary, treasurer, and props manager (juniors), and an assistant props manager (a sophomore). In 1951, the board was vastly expanded to include managers of scenery, lights, sound, makeup, publicity, {{and a number of other}} fields.|$|E

5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-seven British {{prisoners were}} killed and the Germans forced French civilians to bury the bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day. Despite the German efforts, Private William O'Callaghan had survived and pulled Private Albert Pooley alive from among the bodies in the field. The pair then hid in a pig-sty for <b>three</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> nights, {{surviving}} on raw potatoes and water from puddles before being discovered by the farm's owner, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and her son Victor. The French civilians risked their lives caring for the two men, who were later captured by the Wehrmacht's 251st Infantry Division and transferred to a military hospital.|$|E
