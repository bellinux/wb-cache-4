50|$|One way to {{estimate}} wheel diameter {{is to add}} twice the nominal tyre cross-section to the rim diameter. For example, consider a 700c &times; 23 mm tire, which has a nominal cross-section of 23 mm. 700c wheels have a rim diameter of 622 mm. Hence the wheel diameter is (2 &times; 23 mm) + 622 mm = 668 mm which is equal to 26.3 inches (rounded to 1 decimal place). 26 inch mountain bicycle wheels have a rim diameter of 559 mm. This ignores {{factors that contribute to}} the actual rolling radius of the tyre and rim together: the vertical deflection of the tire above the contact patch and the difference between the manufacturer's stated size and the actual <b>tire</b> <b>radius</b> when mounted and inflated.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} many tire and environmental parameters had been studied and {{their effect on}} the maximum critical speed was monitored during driving on a wet road. These parameters are tire deformation tire width, <b>tire</b> <b>radius,</b> wheel load, number of grooves, groove depth, groove width and the (Aspect Ratio). And external parameters, such as water layer thickness, and the dynamic viscosity of the water. The region of the tire road contact is considered as a convergence surfaces, therefore the same mathematical model that used in the conventional bearing, had been implemented, hence Reynolds equation have been solved numerically using the finite difference technique and the results afterward are obtained for the pressure value at each point in the contact region. The results show that increasing the tire deformation, tire width, <b>tire</b> <b>radius,</b> {{the thickness of the}} water layer on the road surface, and dynamic viscosity of water, {{have a negative effect on}} the critical speed of the vehicle (decreasing). While increasing of the wheel load, numbers of grooves, groove depth, groove width and the aspect ratio, have a positive effect on the critical speed of the vehicle (increasing). Generally speaking, the tires with small deformation have a better driving performance for the vehicles compared with that of large deformation during driving the vehicle on wet roads. 1...|$|E

40|$|Road vehicle yaw {{stability}} {{control systems}} like {{electronic stability program}} (ESP) are important active safety systems used for maintaining lateral stability of the vehicle. Vehicle yaw rate is the key parameter {{that needs to be}} known by a yaw stability control system. In this paper, yaw rate is estimated using a virtual sensor which contains kinematic relations and a velocity-scheduled Kalman filter. Kinematic estimation is carried out using wheel speeds, dynamic <b>tire</b> <b>radius,</b> and front wheel steering angle. In addition, a velocity-scheduled Kalman filter utilizing the linearized single-track model of the road vehicle is used in the dynamic estimation part of the virtual sensor. The designed virtual sensor is successfully tested offline using a validated, high degrees of freedom, and high fidelity vehicle model and using hardware-in-the-loop simulations. Moreover, actual road testing is carried out and the estimated yaw rate from the virtual sensor is compared with the actual yaw rate obtained from the commercial yaw rate sensor to demonstrate the effectiveness of the virtual yaw rate sensor in practical use...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of {{the noise}} {{distribution}} is typically crucial for the state estimation of general state-space models. However, properties {{of the noise}} process are often unknown {{in the majority of}} practical applications. The distribution of the noise may also be non-stationary or state dependent and that prevents the use of off-line tuning methods. For linear Gaussian models, Adaptive Kalman filters (AKF) estimate unknown parameters in the noise distributions jointly with the state. The same problem for the particle filtering is less studied. We provide a Bayesian solution for the estimation of the noise distributions in the exponential family, leading to a marginalized adaptive particle filter (MAPF) where the noise parameters are updated using finite dimensional sufficient statistics for each particle. The time evolution model for the noise parameters is defined implicitly as a Kullback-Leibler norm constraint on the time variability, leading to an exponential forgetting mechanism operating on the sufficient statistics. Many existing methods are based on the standard approach of augmenting the state with the unknown variables and attempting to solve the resulting filtering problem. The MAPF is significantly more computationally efficient than a comparable particle filter that runs on the full augmented state. Further, the MAPF can handle sensor and actuator offsets as unknown means in the noise distributions, avoiding the standard approach of augmenting the state with such offsets. We illustrate the MAPF on first a standard example, and then on a <b>tire</b> <b>radius</b> estimation problem on real data...|$|E

The novelty lies in a Bayesian approach to estimate online both the state vector and the parameters representing the process noise statistics using a marginalized particle filter (MPF). Field tests show that the absolute radius can be estimated with submillimeter accuracy. The approach is tested in accordance with regulation 64 of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on a large data set (22 tests, using two vehicles and 12 different tire sets), where tire deflations are successfully detected, with high robustness, i. e., no false alarms.

40|$|We {{comparatively}} {{assess the}} influence of adaptive cruise control (ACC) and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems on highway traffic behaviors. The primary goal is to study the design and implementation of vehicle-vehicle/roadside-vehicle communication, which enhances an ACC system to a CACC one. In addition, the impact of market penetration of ACC/CACC vehicles and controller aggression are also evaluated. Two simulation works are presented. The microscopic work simulates a single ACC/CACC vehicle using MATLAB/SIMULINK. A cut-in scenario and a braking scenario are tested. Vehicle-vehicle communication saves control effort in the former scenario, while shows little effect in the latter. In the macroscopic work we simulate ACC/CACC controlled highway merging with SHIFT language. The results show beneficial effects of communication in terms of braking effort, average velocity, waiting-to-merge queue length, and main lane traffic shock wave caused by merging. The higher the market penetration of controlled vehicles the better the system performs. The aggressiveness of controller has mixed influence, which provides a tradeoff between efficiency and safety. We study the wireless communication among highway vehicles. A vehicle- vehicle Location-Based Broadcast (LBB) communication protocol is designed to meet highway safety applications' communication requirements. The analytical expressions {{of the performance of}} the protocol in terms of probability of transmission failure and channel occupancy are derived with commonly satisfied assumptions. The optimal relation between the performance and design parameters is obtained from the expressions. The sensitivity of the protocol performance is tested for various communication conditions as well as highway traffic conditions. Feasible combinations of the communication and highway traffic parameters are found for certain requirements on protocol performance. The analysis is conducted in accordance to the communication condition in the newly-assigned 5. 9 GHz Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) spectrum. More experiments are done to find out the factors that influence the slip measurements in order to refine our results of friction coefficient estimation. To obtain the circumferential velocity of the wheel, the exact <b>tire</b> <b>radius</b> is needed. The change in the spring constant based on tire air pressure is obtained, and also the increase in <b>tire</b> <b>radius</b> due to the faster velocity is considered. The normal force applied on each wheel due to the vehicle pitch motion resulting from acceleration and deceleration is also estimated using static vehicle model. Brake torque sensor and accelerometer are used to find the normal force. Using the estimated normal force and road force, the tire-road friction coefficient is obtained. The characteristics of the friction coefficient and slip curve are studied on different road conditions with the refined slip measurements. An originally proposed slip-based controller does not seem to work very well in an practical situation due to actuator time delay. However, experimental results show that the existing nonlinear controller with the limited slip assumption shows good performance even in an emergency braking situation. Therefore, instead of using different control algorithm, this research focuses on the control strategies dedicated to emergency situation for the platoon. In order to integrate the benefits from the communication and friction coefficient estimation technique, a safe control strategy is considered in the situation when the platoon of vehicles needs to decelerate rapidly. It is assumed that we have the knowledge of friction coefficients between road and tire and our vehicles are equipped with proper communication methods. Then, the theoretical bounds for the reference trajectory accelerations are calculated that do not cause the actuator saturation using linear vehicle and controller model. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{automobile}} industry is moving fast towards Electric Vehicles (EV); however this paradigm shift is currently making its smooth transition through {{the phase of}} Hybrid Electric Vehicles. There is an ever-growing need for integration of hybrid energy sources especially for vehicular applications. Different energy sources such as batteries, ultra-capacitors, fuel cells etc. are available. Usage of these varied energy sources alone or together in different combinations in automobiles requires advanced power electronic circuits and control methodologies. An exhaustive literature survey {{has been carried out}} to study the power electronic converter, switching modulation strategy to be employed and the particular machine to be used in an EV. Adequate amount of effort has been put into designing the vehicle specifications. Owing to stronger demand for higher performance and torque response in an EV, the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine has been favored over the traditional Induction Machine. The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate the use of a multi level inverter fed Brush Less Direct Current (BLDC) motor in a field oriented control fashion in an EV and make it follow a given drive cycle. The switching operation and control of a multi level inverter for specific power level and desired performance characteristics is investigated. The EV has been designed from scratch taking into consideration the various factors such as mass, coefficients of aerodynamic drag and air friction, <b>tire</b> <b>radius</b> etc. The design parameters are meant to meet the requirements of a commercial car. The various advantages of a multi level inverter fed PMSM have been demonstrated and an exhaustive performance evaluation has been done. The investigation is done by testing the designed system on a standard drive cycle, New York urban driving cycle. This highly transient driving cycle is particularly used because it provides rapidly changing acceleration and deceleration curves. Furthermore, the evaluation of the system under fault conditions is also done. It is demonstrated that the system is stable and has a ride-through capability under different fault conditions. The simulations have been carried out in MATLAB and Simulink, while some preliminary studies involving switching losses of the converter were done in PSIM...|$|E
40|$|Mapping {{stationary}} {{objects and}} tracking moving targets {{are essential for}} many autonomous functions in vehicles. In order to compute the map and track estimates, sensor measurements from radar, laser and camera are used together with the standard proprioceptive sensors present in a car. By fusing information from different types of sensors, the accuracy and robustness of the estimates can be increased. Different types of maps are discussed and compared in the thesis. In particular, road maps {{make use of the}} fact that roads are highly structured, which allows relatively simple and powerful models to be employed. It is shown how the information of the lane markings, obtained by a front looking camera, can be fused with inertial measurement of the vehicle motion and radar measurements of vehicles ahead to compute a more accurate and robust road geometry estimate. Further, it is shown how radar measurements of stationary targets can be used to estimate the road edges, modeled as polynomials and tracked as extended targets. Recent advances in the field of multiple target tracking lead to the use of finite set statistics (FISST) in a set theoretic approach, where the targets and the measurements are treated as random finite sets (RFS). The first order moment of a RFS is called probability hypothesis density (PHD), and it is propagated in time with a PHD filter. In this thesis, the PHD filter is applied to radar data for constructing a parsimonious representation of the map of the stationary objects around the vehicle. Two original contributions, which exploit the inherent structure in the map, are proposed. A data clustering algorithm is suggested to structure the description of the prior and considerably improving the update in the PHD filter. Improvements in the merging step further simplify the map representation. When it comes to tracking moving targets, the focus of this thesis is on extended targets, i. e., targets which potentially may give rise to more than one measurement per time step. An implementation of the PHD filter, which was proposed to handle data obtained from extended targets, is presented. An approximation is proposed in order {{to limit the number of}} hypotheses. Further, a framework to track the size and shape of a target is introduced. The method is based on measurement generating points on the surface of the target, which are modeled by an RFS. Finally, an efficient and novel Bayesian method is proposed for approximating the tire radii of a vehicle based on particle filters and the marginalization concept. This is done under the assumption that a change in the <b>tire</b> <b>radius</b> is caused by a change in tire pressure, thus obtaining an indirect tire pressure monitoring system. The approaches presented in this thesis have all been evaluated on real data from both freeways and rural roads in Sweden. SEFS [...] IVSSVR - ET...|$|E
