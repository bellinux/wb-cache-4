The most common assumption is that the reflection shows the couple in the pose they are holding for Velázquez as he paints them, while their daughter watches; and that the painting therefore shows <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{left his}} brother-in-law's home {{a year later}} and went {{to live and work}} on a sheep farm. The family he lived with were devout Seventh Day Adventists.

The results showed that students’ literacy activities could be grouped into three types: e-literacy, traditional literacy, and creative literacy. Furthermore, results showed that categorization of literacy activities depended on whether the activities were conducted in English or in another language. Gender predicted certain types of literacy activities.

5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco and Fernando Rocchi all {{praise the}} role of Raúl Alfonsín in the {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president, and that he set an example of not using the state for personal gain. De Marco points out that it was a delicate time period, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and led to another coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, though, on <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a necessary evil to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without negotiating with the UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead believe that it was the biggest mistake of Alfonsín's political career.|$|E

25|$|In the film, Max {{periodically}} plays Go {{with his}} mentor, Sol.

25|$|The {{concept of}} the polysporangiophytes, more {{formally}} called Polysporangiophyta, {{was first published in}} 1997 by Kenrick and Crane. (The taxobox at the right represents <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classification of the polysporangiophytes.) The defining feature of the clade is that the sporophyte branches and bears multiple sporangia. This distinguishes polysporangiophytes from liverworts, mosses and hornworts, which have unbranched sporophytes each with a single sporangium. Polysporangiophytes {{may or may not have}} vascular tissue – those that do are vascular plants or tracheophytes.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet {{response}} to the SDI during the period March 1983 through November 1985 provided indications of <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program both as a threat and {{as an opportunity to}} weaken NATO. SDI was likely seen not only {{as a threat to the}} physical security of the Soviet Union, but also as part of an effort by the United States to seize the strategic initiative in arms controls by neutralizing the military component of Soviet strategy. The Kremlin, however, masked their real concerns, advocating that space-based missile defenses would make nuclear war inevitable.|$|E
25|$|From the Medieval flourishing of Kabbalah onwards, {{attempts}} were made to systemise its diverse teachings, especially commentaries on the elusive imagery of the Zohar. Sixteenth century Safed saw the realisation of this aim in the two , comprehensive versions of Kabbalistic theosophy: the quasi-rational linear scheme of Moshe Cordovero, followed by the supra-rational dynamic scheme of Isaac Luria that replaced it. <b>Their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier doctrine from Sefer HaTemunah, of previous Cosmic Shmitah cycles before ours, was that previous cycles refer to spiritual processes, not actual creations; our universe being the first physical creation.|$|E
25|$|In the Roman Empire, {{the first}} fish {{to be brought}} indoors was the sea barbel, which was kept under guest beds in small tanks made of marble.

In 1369, the Hongwu Emperor of China established a porcelain company that produced large porcelain tubs for maintaining goldfish; over time, people produced tubs that approached the shape of modern fish bowls.

2500|$|The early Adventists {{came from}} many {{different}} traditions, and hence there was also diversity on <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit.

50|$|Buddhism {{has been}} said to be {{compatible}} with communism given that both {{can be interpreted as}} atheistic and arguably share some similarities regarding <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> nature and <b>the</b> relationship between matter and mind. Regardless, Buddhists have still been persecuted in some communist states, notably China, Mongolia and Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge.|$|R
25|$|Even as {{tensions}} lessened {{and leaders}} {{on both sides}} adopted more conciliatory attitudes, the border issue remained unresolved. Despite <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous border treaties as unequal ones, Chinese leaders were willing to negotiate {{on the basis of}} the modern boundaries. That left about 35,000km² of territory in dispute, with about 28,000km² in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, 6,000km² elsewhere along the western border, and about 1,000km² along the Argun, Amur, and Ussuri rivers on the eastern border. Border negotiations were eventually resumed in 1987 at Mikhail Gorbachev's initiation. An agreement was reached on the eastern portion of the border on May 16, 1991, several months before the final dissolution of the USSR. Russia inherited most of the former Sino-Soviet border, and ratified the agreement in February 1992, while the other post-Soviet republics negotiated separate border agreements.|$|E
25|$|According to 14th century writer Abdisho bar Berika, the Holy Leaven {{was brought}} to the East by Apostles Thomas and Bartholomew as well as Thaddeus of Edessa and Saint Mari of the Seventy disciples. Abdisho bar Berika also posits a {{challenge}} to Western Christians who do not observe the sacrament of the Holy Leaven: it is necessarily either the case that the apostles disagreed in <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eucharist, or that either the Assyrian Church of the East or the Western Christians have abandoned the practice promoted by all of the apostles. The Church's position is that they have followed the example of the apostles and have changed nothing {{even in the face of}} persecution. As proof of the fact that Western Christians have altered tradition the Church presents that some Western Churches celebrate Eucharist with leavened bread while some use unleavened bread (azymites).|$|E

500|$|Despite this, {{the image}} of Richard as a {{ruthless}} power-grabber remained dominant in the 18th and 19th centuries. David Hume described {{him as a man}} who used dissimulation to conceal [...] "his fierce and savage nature" [...] and who had [...] "abandoned all principles of honour and humanity". Hume acknowledges that some historians have argued [...] "that he was well qualified for government, had he legally obtained it; and that he committed no crimes but such as were necessary to procure him possession of the crown", but he dismisses this view on the grounds that Richard's exercise of arbitrary power encouraged instability. The most important late 19th-century biographer of the king was James Gairdner, who also wrote the entry on Richard in the Dictionary of National Biography. Gairdner stated that he had begun to study Richard with a neutral viewpoint, but became convinced that Shakespeare and More were essentially correct in <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king, despite some exaggerations.|$|E
