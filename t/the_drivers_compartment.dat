50|$|Hood Release, Inside Locking: This {{security}} helps {{protect against}} theft {{by making it}} difficult for a thief {{to gain access to the}} engine compartment. A thief cannot simply reach into <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>compartment</b> and pop open the hood using the standard inside hood release. The hood release can be activated only after being unlocked with the door key. This item is included in the Security Lock Group which is also available on all F-Series pickup models.|$|E
50|$|Besides regular trucks, MOWAG {{has built}} {{several generations of}} long iron {{transport}} trucks. A 8x4-driven four-axle truck with M8TK diesel engine with eight cylinders, 10.8 liters and 500 HP and Allison automatic five-speed transmission, these are characterized by a very narrow central cab, with two seats. They were able {{to carry the load}} on {{the entire length of the}} vehicle using the space on the left and right side of the driver's cabin. <b>The</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>compartment</b> had a front entering door.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, {{the company}} opened the Tulsa {{facility}} {{with the introduction}} of the IC, a new generation of the CS. Branded as a fully integrated conventional, the IC was branded not as an AmTran, but as an International; the company noted the integration of the production of the bus within the Navistar corporate structure. Still based on the International 3800, the International IC was distinguished with its own hood design. <b>The</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>compartment</b> of the AmTran RE received an update, receiving a redesign to the drivers' controls.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>driver</b> of <b>the</b> 7:40, Isaac McQuillan, {{was charged}} with {{manslaughter}} in April 1945 {{for the death of}} a passenger: Samuel Wilson. During the hearing, two passengers testified that they were in <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment.</b> One of <b>the</b> witnesses said there were six passengers in <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{passenger}} compartment was normally luxurious, clad {{in the best}} materials, with seating for between two and most often up to six or occasionally eight persons, made of the finest cotton or silk adorned with brocade. The same material was also most often used to provide complete curtain coverage for the compartment, and was matched by substantial carpet and fine inlaid woodwork. <b>The</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>compartment</b> had leather seats to be durable enough to endure the weather. The division between the two compartments often held jump seats for lighter passengers such as children, and it would often accommodate various compartments for drinks, cigars, make-up, or books.|$|E
5000|$|T-72 Wilk: {{beginning}} in 1986, the Polish T-72 Wilk project was instituted to allow tank repair plants to upgrade T-72 tanks {{within their own}} facilities. In particular, it was proposed that the Soviet-made Volna fire control system {{be replaced by the}} Czechoslovak-made Kladivo FCS or by the Polish SKO-1 Mérida, which was originally designed for T-55AM [...] "Merida". Besides the new FCS, the Radomka passive night vision devices were installed in <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>compartment,</b> as was the Liswarta night sight, Obra laser illumination warning system, Tellur anti-laser smoke grenade launchers, solid or modular metal side skirts and the Polish-developed Erawa-1 or Erawa-2 explosive reactive armour was also fitted. This program was further developed and led to the PT-91.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2013, Blue Bird {{unveiled}} {{a number of}} changes to the Vision conventional at the School Transportation News Expo trade show. Designated as a 2015 model, the updated Vision entered production in October 2013. [...] Distinguished by a redesigned grille with a larger Blue Bird emblem, a number of changes {{were made to the}} exterior lighting. Another distinguishing exterior feature was the roof stripe. In a change made to all Blue Birds, the full-length roof stripe was replaced by a shortened design of a single length. The Volvo-sourced headlamp clusters were replaced with single-piece clear-lens units; the change was intended to simplify beam adjustment. [...] To lower the risk of burned-out lights, all clearance lights on the Vision were changed to LED bulbs (a change also made to the All American). [...] For the interior, <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>compartment</b> saw fewer substantial revisions, with the drivers' seat receiving a height-adjustable seatbelt; another option included a rear-view backup camera.|$|E
50|$|The Semi-Enclosed Tram - All of {{the tram}} except <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> was enclosed.|$|R
25|$|The NPZ {{color scheme}} {{mentioned}} above is generally common today. The second production series (560 100 - 560 141) has the blue window strip extended {{all the way}} to <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment.</b> In addition, numerous examples have logos of the various Swiss S-Bahn systems (Zürich, Basel, Bern, Ostwind, Réseau Express Vaudois, etc.) applied {{to the side of the}} locomotive near <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> and <b>the</b> {{fighting}} compartments {{were not}} separated. As {{well as the}} turret armament, which consisted of an Ordnance QF 2 pounder gun and a coaxial Vickers machine gun, there were two small turrets either side of <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment,</b> each with a Vickers machine-gun. Both of these smaller turrets were permanently manned, which gave the tank a total crew of 6 (Commander, gunner, loader, driver and two machine-gunners).|$|R
5000|$|T-72B3 (Obyekt 184-M3): this upgrade was {{initiated}} in 2010 using old stocks of T-72B tanks held in reserve. In addition to performing a general overhaul of every vehicle, certain tanks were {{equipped with the}} more powerful V-92S2 engines, a new steering system in <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>compartment</b> and older tracks were replaced with the new universal, twin-pin design. The upgrade program focuses instead on improving the tanks firepower, mainly through {{the implementation of the}} Kalina fire control system, albeit in a simplified form. The tank commander retains an upgraded version of the legacy TKN-3MK sight, which is a passive device with a range of only 600 m at night, but is augmented with a monitor that displays thermal imagery from the gunners main sight. The commander also has a new turret control panel. The gunner still has the 1A40-4 FCS with 1K13-49 sight, but these are now part of the auxiliary sighting system to complement the new PNM Sosna-U panoramic multi-spectral sensor, which replaced the TPN-3-49 in its mounting. The Sosna-U is a multi-channel, panoramic sight stabilized in both vertical and horizontal axes with a built-in laser rangefinder and command guidance module used with 9M119M missiles. The most advantageous aspect of the Sosna-U is the Thales Catherine-FC thermal imager which extends the detection and identification range of a tank-sized target to 10,500 m and 2,200 m respectively, at night/day and in all weather combat conditions. The T-72B3 series vehicles also received the new 2A46M5 main gun which has a dispersion value significantly lower than previous generations, and reportedly equivalent to the Rheinmetall Rh120 L/44 cannon. The gun laying and stabilization drives were also replaced with the new 2E42-4 system and the AZ ammunition auto-loader was appropriately modified to accommodate newer generations of long-rod (up to 730 mm) saboted kinetic energy anti-tank ammunition: the Svinets-1 (using a depleted uranium penetrator) and Svinets-2 (sintered tungsten alloy) rounds, which were fielded in 2002 and reportedly capable of defeating 740-800 mm and 660-740 mm of RHA at 2,000 m respectively. Only the most recent T-72B3 tanks however feature this capability. Furthermore, the B3 upgrade includes a new explosion and fire suppression system, as well as an advanced VHF radio system designated R-168-25U-2 AKVEDUK. Entered service on 19 October 2012. First delivered to the 20th Field Army in summer 2013 and its Armored Guards Brigade in October 2013. More than 1,000 such tanks are currently in service.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> was {{upholstered}} in blue leather with grey piping and could seat three people. <b>The</b> <b>driver's</b> seat was adjustable. There were separate heating and ventilation units for each compartment.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> {{is located}} on the left hand side of the front of <b>the</b> hull. <b>The</b> <b>driver's</b> seat is moved forward and to the left in {{comparison}} with its location in the T-54. The compartment is equipped with a single-piece hatch cover opening to the left and two periscopic vision devices. One of them can be replaced by the TVN-1 infrared vision device which is operated together with the infrared headlamp (active night vision), which is mounted on the right track board. A fire-fighting equipment signal panel and a spare parts case are also located in <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|R
50|$|The crew numbers four: driver, commander, gunner and radar operator. <b>The</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> {{is located}} in the nose part of the vehicle. The {{fighting}} compartment is in the center, and the engine compartment is in the rear part of the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|Each power car {{was fitted}} with a <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> to enable <b>the</b> train to be {{controlled}} from either end. The driving controls were electric; brake controls were electro-pneumatic and enabled coupled multiple units {{to be controlled by}} one driver. A safety device {{in the form of a}} dead man's foot pedal was also fitted in <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> cabin. A guard's compartment was located adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> in <b>the</b> end of the power cars.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{the term}} mid-engine has been {{reserved}} for cars that place {{the engine and}} transaxle behind <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> {{and in front of}} the rear axles , as in the Lamborghini Countach or Ferrari Testarossa, but an engine placed in front of <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> but fully behind the front axle line also qualifies as mid-engine.|$|R
50|$|The BM Oplot is {{a further}} {{development}} of the previous Oplot, {{which is based on}} the T-84 main battle tank.

50|$|The Type 1 Ho-Ha carried three Type 97 {{light machine}} guns as {{standard}} armament, {{one on each}} side, just {{to the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> and a third mounted to the rear as an anti-aircraft weapon. All of these weapons had constricted firing arcs, which made firing directly forward or directly rearward impossible.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{it was decided}} to convert these to trailer cars hence 16 power cars were ordered with no {{matching}} trailers. Between March and December 1982 the cars were rewired at Electric Carriage Workshops, and <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>compartments</b> removed and replaced by passenger toilets and luggage space. The reinforced plastic ends remained, albeit with the blue removed.|$|R
50|$|The Allison V730 is a three-speed {{automatic}} transmission used in several makes of transit bus including the RTS, Canadian-produced GM New Looks, and Grumman Flxibles.
