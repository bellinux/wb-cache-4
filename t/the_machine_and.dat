5|$|Ed Roberts and Bill Yates {{finished}} the first prototype in October 1974 and shipped it to Popular Electronics in New York via the Railway Express Agency. However, it never arrived {{due to a}} strike by the shipping company. Solomon already {{had a number of}} pictures of <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> the article was based on them. Roberts got to work on building a replacement. The computer on the magazine cover is an empty box with just switches and LEDs on the front panel. The finished Altair computer had a completely different circuit board layout than the prototype shown in the magazine.|$|E

5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E
5|$|The Turk {{made its}} debut in 1770 at Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, about six months after Pelletier's act.

5|$|Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock {{retains the}} basic {{gameplay}} from previous {{games in the}} Guitar Hero series, where the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of lead, bass, and rhythm guitar parts in rock songs by playing in time to scrolling notes on-screen. The game, in addition to existing single-player Career modes, includes a new Co-Op Career mode and competitive challenges that pit the player against in-game characters and other players. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the first game in the series to include an online multiplayer feature, which is enabled in the PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 versions. Initially the game offers over 70 songs, {{most of which are}} master tracks. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature the ability to download additional songs. The musicians Tom Morello (of the bands Rage Against <b>the</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>and</b> Audioslave) and Slash (of Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver) make appearances both as guitar battle opponents and playable characters in the game. The PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions also include Bret Michaels (of Poison) as a non-playable character.|$|E
5|$|Magi sacrifices {{herself to}} give the fairies a chance, and she tells Crysta to {{remember}} everything she's learned. Zak manages to stop the machine, depriving Hexxus {{the source of his}} power, but he manifests himself within the oil in <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> begins to ignite the forest ablaze. Crysta seemingly sacrifices herself by allowing herself to be devoured by Hexxus and all seems lost, until he begins to sprout limbs and leaves like a tree. Pips {{and the rest of the}} fairies rally to the powers they have been given, which causes the seed that Crysta fed him to start growing wildly. Hexxus is imprisoned by the newly grown tree at the very border of FernGully which bursts into bloom. Crysta appears after the fight, having survived her ordeal and successfully succeeded Magi as a magical fairy. She gives Zak a seed, begging him to remember everything that has transpired and she sadly restores him to his human size. Remembering the seed in his hand, Zak promises to remember his adventure, and buries the seed in the soil before telling Tony and Ralph that things need to change as they leave the forest behind. The seed sprouts new growth for FernGully, as Crysta follows Pips with Batty behind her.|$|E
5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} <b>the</b> <b>machine,</b> <b>and</b> re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, {{and the ability to}} show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E

5|$|The SSEM {{had been}} {{designed}} by the team of Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill. To develop the Mark 1 {{they were joined by}} two research students, D.B.G.Edwards and G. E. Thomas; work began in earnest in August 1948. The project soon had the dual purpose of supplying Ferranti with a working design on which they could base a commercial machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, and of building a computer that would allow researchers to gain experience of how such a machine could be used in practice. The first of the two versions of the Manchester Mark 1‚Äì known as the Intermediary Version‚Äì was operational by April 1949. However, this first version lacked features such as the instructions necessary to programmatically transfer data between the main store and its newly developed magnetic backing store, which had to be done by halting <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> manually initiating the transfer. These missing features were incorporated in the Final Specification version, which was fully working by October 1949. The machine contained 4,050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. To increase reliability, purpose-built CRTs made by GEC were used in the machine instead of the standard devices used in the SSEM.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree that}} Hexxus is imprisoned in is cut down by Tony and Ralph, Zak's superiors. Hexxus quickly begins {{to regain his}} powers by feeding on pollution. He manipulates the humans to drive to FernGully. In FernGully, Zak meets Pips, a fairy envious of Zak's {{relationship}} with Crysta. Zak begins {{to fall in love}} with Crysta, but hides the true reason that the humans had returned. When the signs of Hexxus's resurrection begin to manifest themselves in poisoned trees and rivers, he finally admits that humans are destroying the forest. The fairies mount an attempt to defend their homes, but knowing their fight is hopeless, Zak convinces Batty to aid him in stopping the machine before it destroys them. When Zak makes his presence known to Tony and Ralph, Hexxus takes over <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> begins to wildly destroy the forest.|$|E
5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, he noticed that the machine was unsteady as if someone would have powered it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|E

This time I know I can stop him!}} With only one Chron-o-John pod left, Bernard, Hoagie and Laverne use it to pursue the tentacles to the previous day, while Dr. Fred uselessly tries to warn them of using the pod together, referencing the film The Fly. Upon arriving, the trio exit the pod only to discover that they have been turned into a three-headed monster, their bodies merging into one during the transfer. Meanwhile, Purple Tentacle has used the time machine to bring countless versions of himself from different moments in time to the same day to prevent the Sludge-o-Matic from being deactivated. Bernard and his friends defeat the Purple Tentacles guarding the Sludge-o-Matic, turn off <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>and</b> prevent the whole series of events from ever happening. Returning to the present, Dr. Fred discovers that the three have not been turned into a monster at all but have just gotten stuck in the same set of clothes; they are then ordered by Dr. Fred to get out of his house. The game ends with the credits rolling over a tentacle-shaped American flag, one of the more significant results of their tampering in history.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of milled coinage, hammered coinage, which resulted in a relatively crude product of irregular shape and size, predominated in European mints. In , an Augsburg goldsmith named Max Schwab created a new technique for striking coins, which included the use of rolling mills, presses to cut the coinage blanks and the coinage press. After learning about the invention via the French ambassador, King Henry II dispatched the Comptroller of Finance Guillaume de Marillac and Fran√ßois Guilhem, Master of the Mint in Lyon, to observe the machinery. Schwab's press was turned with a weighted wooden handle, which exerted even pressure across the coinage blank, creating a sharper and more precise strike than hammering. De Marillac requested that Anne de Montmorency send him an engineer capable of creating a similar machine; he sent the engineer Aubin Olivier. Olivier viewed <b>the</b> <b>machine,</b> <b>and</b> introduced his own version to France, to which he later added a segmented collar. This allowed for the expanding metal to fill the collar, creating reeding, designs or edge lettering {{at the same time as}} the obverse and reverse images were struck onto the coin. The segments of the collar were then removed, and the coin ejected. Such lettering was used to aid in detecting coins which were debased by clipping metal from their edges, a problem frequently encountered in hammered coinage. Olivier's method of striking coins was considered costly relative to the previously utilised method, as the upper coinage die often came into contact with the collar on its downward descent, causing expensive damage. Milled coinage was thus abandoned in 1585 in favour of hammering.|$|E
