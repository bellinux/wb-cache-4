"And so, sir, in the lonelier {{and perhaps}} even more disheartening moments which come to any {{national}} leader, I hope {{there will be a}} corner of your mind and heart which takes cheer from the fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> admiring friend, a staunch friend that will be all the way with LBJ." ...|$|E

2500|$|Opponents of gay {{and lesbian}} rights opposed any {{compromise}} with the SJC. Brian Camenker, head of the Parents Rights Coalition, said: [...] "As Martin Luther King pointed out in his letter from the Birmingham jail, there are some laws that are so unnatural <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> obligation to openly defy them. The concept of stable, healthy gay relationships is largely a manufacturing of the gay propaganda machine." [...] He called the decision [...] "complete lunacy" [...] and said: [...] "It's beyond shocking. It's madness. It's four judges basically turning society inside out with no input from anybody else." ...|$|E

'Our niece's position, or {{supposed}} position, is much {{changed by}} our brother Francis's death,' said Miss Lavinia; 'and therefore we consider our brother's opinions as regarded her position as being changed too.

6000|$|... "But, my dear fellow, in that case, why didn't {{you get him}} a pauper's funeral? There {{would have}} been {{something}} poetic in <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> unerring instinct for mediocrity." ...|$|E

6000|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Yes. Since you ask me, more--well, {{not more}} attractive: I do not deny <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{excellent}} appearance--but I will say, richer. More Venetian. Tropical. 'The shadowed livery of the burnished sun.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Good!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I like that! That is {{an honest}} answer {{if ever there}} was one. But tell me why it is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> affection for her. It must have been almost a case of love at first sight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] exclaimed Gust, [...] "there {{is where}} you are wrong. [...] There {{is where you}} are lucky <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> educated man like {{me to tell you}} what to do. You are an ignorant savage, Momulla, and so you know nothing of wireless." ...|$|E
