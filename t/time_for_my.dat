It was directed by then-showrunner Paul Lieberstein, his sixth directing credit of the series. The episode marked the first appearance of Will Ferrell's four-episode arc on the series and {{is also one of}} series star, Carell's last episodes as a regular on the series. Ferrell signed on to appear in Steve Carell's final three episodes, and the first episode without Carell, [...] "The Inner Circle", to make Carell's transition easier. Carell had decided to leave the series, because [...] "I just think it's time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. I just thought it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> character to go". Ferrell initially called the producers and offered to appear in Carell's last season, because he is [...] "a fan and wanted to commemorate Carell’s swan song".

The episode was directed by Paul Feig, marking his 14th credit for the series. On June 28, 2010, {{it was confirmed that}} the seventh season of The Office would be Steve Carell's last.

In January 2011, it was announced that Carell would exit the show early, four episodes {{before the end of the}} season. A few weeks after this announcement came the news that Will Ferrell, who previously starred alongside Carell in , had signed on to appear in a four-episode arc as a Dunder Mifflin branch manager who temporarily takes Michael Scott's position in Scranton.

500|$|Throughout {{the day of}} 2 August the besieged party heard distant cannon {{fire and}} saw people in the town hurriedly loading carts with their belongings. The {{constant}} fire from muskets on the building lessened and finally ceased; it was approached by two men, who told the occupants that the besiegers were defeated and a relief force was expected to arrive in Arrah the following day. The occupants were sceptical, despite visual evidence, and sent out a small party at midnight to reconnoitre the area—they found {{no sign of the}} mutineers and brought in a large quantity of gunpowder and the mutineers' two artillery pieces. They then sent a party under cover of darkness to destroy a number of outhouses which the mutineers had been using as cover. This party discovered a mine dug directly under the foundations of the building by the mutineers, charged and ready to be primed, so this charge was destroyed by them. The following morning at about 7:00am, two members of Major Eyre's expedition arrived at the house and the siege was officially broken. Eyre, in his official report, wrote that Wake's defence of the building [...] "seems to have been almost miraculous." [...] About the outcome of the first relief attempt, he wrote: [...] "I venture to affirm, confidently, that no such disaster would have been likely to occur, had that detachment advanced less precipitately, so as to have given full <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> force to approach direct from the opposite side, for the rebels would then have been hemmed in between the two opposing forces, and must have been utterly routed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nicklaus played {{without much}} {{preparation}} in the 2005 Masters, {{a month after}} the drowning death of his 17-month-old grandson Jake (child of his son Steve) on March 1, 2005. In a written statement, Nicklaus said {{that it was impossible to}} put into words the devastation of his family. Nicklaus later spoke emotionally about the tragedy. He said: [...] "It's been an overwhelmingly difficult and trying <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> entire family. The loss of our precious 17-month-old grandson Jake was devastating." [...] Nicklaus and his son Steve played golf as therapy for their grief following Jake's death. After days of playing, Steve suggested his father return to The Masters. He made that his last appearance in the tournament.|$|E
2500|$|Actor Nick Berry {{was cast}} to play Wicksy with minimal delay. Smith has {{described}} his casting {{as one of}} the fastest on record. [...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately. Berry was whisked into costume and make-up and given a new haircut, which Berry claimed was because the producers wanted to smarten his appearance up. Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday I arrived in Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, whom I had enjoyed watching on the box for some <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> <b>my</b> first few episodes, I walked around with a big smile on my face, grinning at everybody. It was funny." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 August 1961, Diana was baptised at St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham. She {{had three}} siblings: Sarah, Jane, and Charles. Her infant brother, John, died {{shortly after his}} birth one year before Diana was born. The desire for an heir added strain to the Spencers' marriage, and Lady Althorp was {{reportedly}} sent to Harley Street clinics in London to {{determine the cause of}} the [...] "problem". The experience was described as [...] "humiliating" [...] by Diana's younger brother, Charles: [...] "It was a dreadful <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> parents and probably the root of their divorce because I don't think they ever got over it." [...] Diana grew up in Park House, situated on the Sandringham estate. The Spencers leased the house from its owner, Queen Elizabeth II. The Royal Family frequently holidayed at the neighbouring Sandringham House, and Diana played with Princes Andrew and Edward as a child.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2014, August was videotaped {{beating a}} man, and he posted the video on his {{personal}} Instagram account. Although he deleted the video from his profile, the video was later posted to YouTube, and shared by thousands. In the video, a shirtless August walks over {{to a man who}} is kneeling over a bicycle and ruthlessly punches him multiple times ending with a kick to the face. Sources close to him, such as friends, say that the man had money that was to be owed to August, and there was no specific amount of debt mentioned. After the incident had spread, he went to his Twitter account to shed light on the situation, explaining: [...] "I'm just a lil one out here on my own, no mom because she stay taking from me & no father because he wasn't around until all this happened. You guys would only know half of my story, only what's on screen & definitely not behind scenes.

2500|$|On-screen, Sam's {{marriage}} to Ricky ended following {{an affair with}} a yuppie named Clive (Sean Gallagher), and she took a job on a cruise ship. Commenting on her initial departure, Westbrook has said, [...] "My contract was up for renewal and I thought {{it was time for me}} to move on [...] As much as I enjoyed being in EastEnders [...] I was also well aware of the fact that I was in danger of being type-cast forever if I carried on playing Sam. The producers didn't have a problem with me leaving. It was felt that my character had done as much as she could in the space of three years, anyway. During that time Sam had, after all, been involved in a story about under-age sex, run off to Gretna Green to marry Ricky, been evicted from her home, become a squatter, tried her luck as a topless model, fought on a regular basis with Grant and Phil, and gone through a marriage break-up. I think we all agreed that the poor girl was in need of a break [...] In January 1993 I filmed my final scenes and Sam Mitchell, in true EastEnders style, waved goodbye to Albert Square from the back of a London taxi cab [...] Although the producers agreed that it was the right <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> character to move on, they wanted to keep the door open for her to return at a later date, as they knew how popular the Mitchell family were with viewers. I was really pleased that they decided not to kill the character off". Her departure scenes aired on 4 February 1993.|$|E

The essay [...] "And Our Flag Was Still There" [...] was first published in the Los Angeles Times and her views such as [...] "In my lifetime I have seen the flag waved over the sound of sabre-rattling too many <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> comfort" [...] received an angry response from many US commentators.
