50|$|The Discovery Sport will {{initially}} be sold with alloy wheels {{ranging from}} 18 in to 20 in in diameter. Various emergency spare wheels options are available depending on vehicle configuration: a full-size spare wheel mounted internally under {{the floor of}} the trunk, or if the 5+2 seating option is fitted it will be a 'space-saver' spare wheel mounted {{on the underside of the}} car, directly under the boot. It is not possible to have a factory-fitted tow bar with a spare wheel on 5+2 seat vehicles as they mount in the same place under the vehicle, so a <b>tyre</b> <b>repair</b> system of sealant and a compressor is supplied instead.|$|R
5000|$|In motorsports, a {{pit stop}} {{is where a}} racing vehicle stops in the pits during a race for refuelling, new <b>tyres,</b> <b>repairs,</b> {{mechanical}} adjustments, a driver change, as a penalty, or any combination of the above. Not {{all of these are}} allowed in all forms of racing. While the term is still used in motorsports, it also gained popularity with driving in general when embarking on long road trips, suggesting a brief break from driving, as well as a refuelling stop. These [...] "pit stops" [...] grant the travelers a bathroom break, a breakfast/lunch/dinner break, or a chance to take in the local scenery.|$|R

This study assesses the social importance of vegetation through empirical assessment of 44 urban slums in the rapidly developing southern city of Bangalore, India. Vegetation played a major role in supporting nutrition by its role in food consumption, and in promoting health through the planting of species with medicinal use. Trees in slums also formed nodes for social activities including conversing and playing, domestic activities such as cooking and washing dishes, and livelihood activities such as the manufacture of broomsticks and <b>tyre</b> <b>repair.</b> Innovative methods of gardening were widely adopted, with kitchen gardens found planted in plastic bags, paint cans, old kitchen utensils and buckets, indicating the importance given to planting in environments with limited finances. Short and narrow trunked trees with medium-sized canopies and high economic value, such as Pongamia, were preferred. A greater focus on greening in slums is needed, and can provide an invaluable, inexpensive and sustainable approach to improve lives in these congested, deprived environments...|$|R

2500|$|Throughout the race, drivers {{may make}} pit stops to change <b>tyres</b> and <b>repair</b> damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, {{they could also}} refuel). Different teams and drivers employ {{different}} pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over {{the course of a}} race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance, and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have different colours on their sidewalls; this allows spectators to understand the strategies. Under wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one [...] "intermediate", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one [...] "full wet", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres.|$|R

All are tagged with a route number and its corresponding destination. They {{are displayed in}} the front in Marathi and on the side in English. In June 2005, in order to cut costs, BEST decided to hire buses from private operators instead of procuring new buses. These buses would look {{the same as a}} regular bus, but the maintenance and salaries would be taken care of by the private operators. But, till 2013, no buses have been hired by them. The BEST plans to install GPS systems on its buses, to monitor them in realtime. BEST entered into a barter deal with M/s Amnet in 2007 to install three CCTVs in each bus. Amnet also received the rights to advertise in the buses using two LCD screens.To keep this bus fleet roadworthy, a two-tier system of maintenance is followed by Transportation Engineering Department.

50|$|Pneumatic tyres {{were invented}} by John Boyd Dunlop in 1888, {{and were in}} {{widespread}} use on bicycles and some early motorcycle prototypes by 1895. They were used on the first production motorcycle, the 1894-1897 Hildebrand & Wolfmüller, and have been on nearly all production and special motorcycles ever since. During this period tyre sizes were usually 22 to 28 in diameter and 1+1/2 to 2 in wide. The early wheels were spoked, made of all metal, or wood and metal, and used inner tubes to hold air. Flats were a constant problem; largely the fault of poor roads and not necessarily <b>tyres.</b> For easier <b>repair,</b> butt-ended or open ended inner tubes were used on some models, and some brands made rear wheels easier to detach. Spoked wheels with tubes remained standard until the 1970s, when solid, usually alloy, wheels began to appear and eventually dominate street motorcycles, making lighter tubeless tyres practical.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the war, {{the buses}} were quickly repainted in the cream livery (one having escaped being repainted in grey) and the utility buses upgraded. Loadings were heavy in the {{immediate}} post-war period but, in the 1950s, there was a general decline in use of buses, which had its effect on YBS. An increasing number of services were given dispensation for single person operation. Sunday morning services on the Farnham route were withdrawn in 1951. Sydney Hayter died suddenly at the age of 58 in November that year. In 1953 Yellow Bus Services was incorporated as a limited company, with Hayter's widow as the principal director. The South-east Traffic Commissioners granted an application for Yellow Bus Services Ltd to take over the service of buses previously run in the name of Yellow Bus Services by the late Mr Sydney Hayter. By then, only the Farnham and Camberley services remained, together with excursions from the Stoughton base. A&D were pressing YBS to sell their services to them and, in 1954 YBS surrendered their licence to run the Camberley service, allowing A&D a monopoly on that route. In an attempt to increase revenue by diversification YBS built a petrol station on their premises in 1955; this aspect of business expanded over the following years to include car <b>repairs,</b> <b>tyre,</b> battery and accessory sales, together with a paraffin delivery service. The service station was staffed by off-duty drivers and other staff displaced from bus services by the reduction in route miles.|$|R
50|$|After a {{delay of}} 26 minutes, the <b>tyre</b> barrier was <b>repaired</b> {{and the race}} was {{restarted}} {{under the control of}} the safety car. The safety car returned to the pit lane at the end of lap 6, with Luff opening a small lead over Wall and Dumbrell putting pressure on Walsh for third place. Macauley Jones spun at Turn 4 on lap 12, dropping to the back of the field. Canto moved into the top 15 on the same lap, having started in 22nd place. On lap 14, Webb ran wide at Turn 4 and lost places to Richards and Aaren Russell, while Dumbrell passed Walsh for third place at Turn 9. The following lap saw Richards spin at Turn 4 and drop to 24th place; Russell Ingall did the same one lap later and also hit the tyre wall, damaging the front guard on his car and dropping to last place. The first round of pit stops began on lap 21 when D'Alberto came into the pit lane; he was followed by Stanaway on lap 25. Rain began to fall on lap 35 and the leaders came into the pit lane to change to wet tyres on lap 37. After the first round of pit stops was completed, Luff continued to lead while Dumbrell had moved past Wall for second place. Stanaway, Canto and Cameron McConville were all on slick tyres, having made their pit stops before the rain came, while the rest of the field was on wet tyres.|$|R
40|$|In Mpumalanga, {{only about}} 25 per cent of {{households}} have car access, which makes Mpumalanga {{one of the}} provinces with the highest use of public transport by means of bus or taxi in South Africa. Even though the road network in Mpumalanga is extensive, the maintenance and upgrade of this network is a concern, especially for municipal and provincial roads. Deteriorating roads have a direct (such as vehicle operating costs, VOCs) and indirect impact (such as high bus fares) on the road user. This study focuses on the interaction between one bus from Buscor and the pavement surface of one specific bus route, including the associated VOCs generated. The ride comfortability of the bus route was evaluated by interpreting International Roughness Index (IRI), Power Spectral Density (PSD), and vertical accelerations (awz) data, after which the associated vehicle operating costs (VOCs) for the bus were projected. The judgement of ride comfortability in a vehicle {{is an area of}} controversy, and studies on this topic dates back from the 1920 sThe threshold values from ISO (1997), Cantisani, and Loprencipe (2010) were used {{for the purposes of this}} study. The vertical accelerations generated from the surface of the bus route, for a bi-articulated bus were measured with accelerometers. The accelerometers were placed on the bus where the vertical accelerations were expected to be the highest. The identified bus route included different roads with different responsible authorities and roughness levels. A profiler conducted a survey on the route and five different sections were identified. The collected data were analysed with various programs. From the data collected from the accelerometers the PSD, awz, and the speed that the bus travelled on each section could be determined. The IRI data for each section was categorised in three categories, very good to good, fair to mediocre and poor. Anomalies in each section were identified, and the cause of these anomalies determined. The anomalies were analysed with the data, as these values formed part of the route. The impact of road roughness on fuel consumption, <b>tyre</b> wear and <b>repair</b> and maintenance costs were analysed. The calibrated Highway Development and Management System (HDM 4) model was used to predict the fuel consumption, <b>tyre</b> wear and <b>repair</b> and maintenance cost per km of each section of the bus route under consideration. In this analysis, the impact of the vehicle speed proved to be significant, as it affected the PSD values, the awz values and the VOC. The scenario was analysed to improve the riding quality of the two worst sections of the bus route, and by improving the road surface of these two sections, travel time could be reduced and costs could be saved. The scenario of an increase in road roughness was also analysed, to indicate the percentage of increase in costs, if these roads kept deteriorating. The analysis showed a significant increase in repair and maintenance cost, fuel consumption, and tyre wear. The limitations of this study included some correlation issues with the profiler data and the accelerometer data, unidentified bus stops on gravel shoulders, and the suspension system and interior of the bus that were deemed constants and not variables within the scope of this study. Despite these limitations, there are still a number of possibilities with the data collected. Apart for the analyses conducted for the study, recommendations for further refinement include the impact of bus mass on the data (full bus versus empty bus), the suspension type and condition, the interior of the bus, trip duration and congestion, evaluation of driver fatigue, tyre pressure and dynamic wheel loads, and safety. Furthermore, the construction cost of upgrading the two worst sections of the route versus the increase in VOCs because of the deteriorating state of the route could be investigated. In conclusion, the speed played a determining role in the generation of vertical accelerations, therefore user comfort or discomfort, and VOCs. An increase in IRI indicates deteriorating riding quality that affects the comfortability of a ride and the VOCs negatively. IRI can be used to determine the state of the road and qwz gives an indication of the comfortability of a ride.
