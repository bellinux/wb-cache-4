A pint of wine sold in these taverns was taxed 3.5 sous a pint, while the same amount was taxed 12 to 15 sous inside Paris. The tax was hated by the Parisians, and was an important cause of the growing hostility to the royal government before the Revolution.|$|E

All errors and omissions are the responsibility of the authors. Finally, support from DANIDA is gratefully acknowledged. This study examines empirically the causal relationship between border tax rates and evasion in a representative Sub-Saharan African country, Mozambique. By nature, evasion is not easy to measure. The methodology employed here follows an approach used by Fisman and Wei (2004). The approach aligns and compares (at the product level) bilateral trade flow data between Mozambique and its largest trading partner, South Africa. We find that high tax levels are associated with high levels of underreporting of import values and that tax rates have a strong and positive effect on tax evasion in Mozambique. Results also strongly confirm the presence of fraudulent classification of merchandise into lower <b>taxed</b> <b>product</b> categories. In addition, the estimates permit one t...|$|E
40|$|What are {{the effects}} of a per-unit tax on the sales of a good? The answer in {{standard}} economics textbooks is a reduction in quantity and an increase in price. However, the homogeneous-product assumption in such treatments is not always correct because the <b>taxed</b> <b>product</b> is frequently sold under numerous differentiated brands. In general, quantity and price adjustments to a per-unit tax increase may vary differentially by brand, which implies that tax incidence requires a more thorough analysis than the standard one. In this paper we test a popular theoretical prediction that {{the effects of}} a per-unit tax on sales may be different for low quality brands than for high quality brands. We exploit two natural experiments in the beer industry that capture exogenous variations on per-unit charges (excise taxes and shipping costs) to study if quality is an important determinant of equilibrium quantity, prices and advertising expenditures. We find that, when faced with higher per-unit charges, the equilibrium price and quantity of a brand are usually positively associated with its quality level; similarly, higher per-unit charges appear to provide firms with an incentive to shift advertising effort towards brands of higher quality. We discuss implications for public policy and firm profitability...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the article: This paper {{examines}} {{the incidence of}} increased burden of the consumption taxes imposed on beer in the Czech Republic, {{where there was a}} last change of the excise duty on beer and the value added tax rates from 2010. The general assumption is that the increased excise duty burden is borne by consumers. Methodology/methods: The basis of the research is recording of selling prices of the <b>taxed</b> <b>product</b> in the period before the change of tax rates and in the period after the change. Subsequent processing and comparing of identified prices using standard general methods of scientific work is possible to formulate conclusions regarding the values of tax incidence. Scientific aim: The aim is to determine values of characteristics of tax incidence and to compare them with general assumption. Specifically, it will be determined a part of the increased tax burden passed on consumers and how much of the burden bear sellers of beer. Exploration will also be subjected to the time factor and determination of the tax incidence by characteristics of the examined subjects. Findings: The results of the research show that the rate of transfer of increased tax burden on beer in the Czech Republic compared to the theoretical expectations averages only about 1 / 3 of the specified load. In the examination of the tax burden shift the effect of the time factor was recorded in the sense of gradual projection of tax rate change into the consumer prices. Conclusions: Transfer rate grows with the size of the brewery. The dependence of the size of store and transfer of tax rates has not been fully established. Higher level of the burden shift of increased taxes can be seen at restaurants compared to traders due to the characteristics of consumer behavior and market power of the subjects...|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} {{occasional}} ad hoc efforts to influence consumer behaviour by {{the imposition of}} <b>product</b> <b>taxes</b> that reflect external costs imposed by such products that are not initially included in their price. In the spirit of this idea, in 2002 Ireland introduced a 15 Â Euro cent tax on plastic shopping bags, previously provided free of charge to customers at points of sale. The effect of the tax {{on the use of}} plastic bags in retail outlets has been dramaticâ€”a reduction in use in the order of 90 %, and an associated gain in the form of reduced littering and negative landscape effects. Costs of administration have been very low, amounting to about 3 % of revenues, because it was possible to integrate reporting and collection into existing Value Added Tax reporting systems. Response from the main stakeholders: the public and the retail industry, has been overwhelmingly positive. Central to this acceptance has been a policy of extensive consultation with these stakeholders. The fact that a <b>product</b> <b>tax</b> can influence consumer behaviour significantly will be of interest to many policymakers in this area.
