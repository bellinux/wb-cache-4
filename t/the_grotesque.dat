5|$|A polystylist, Shostakovich {{developed}} a hybrid voice, combining {{a variety of}} different musical techniques into his works. His music is characterized by sharp contrasts, elements of <b>the</b> <b>grotesque,</b> and ambivalent tonality; the composer was also heavily influenced by the neo-classical style pioneered by Igor Stravinsky, and (especially in his symphonies) by the late Romanticism associated with Gustav Mahler.|$|E
5|$|The characters' {{contemporary}} {{language and}} Pitar's thorough knowledge of modern-day history, philosophy and science add to <b>the</b> <b>grotesque</b> humor of the novel, while his two friends quote classical Roman literature and Chinese sayings. The {{book was published}} by Viennese publisher FZA Verlag in October 2008. Between 2008 and 2010, several Austrian and German critics and writers published reviews of the novel.|$|E
5|$|In need of work, Poe {{accepted}} {{a job at}} the low salary of $10 per week as assistant editor for Burton's Gentleman's Magazine, despite their negative review of his novel. He also returned to his focus on short stories rather than longer works of prose; Poe's next published book after this, his only completed novel, was the collection Tales of <b>the</b> <b>Grotesque</b> and Arabesque in 1840.|$|E

5|$|The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was {{published}} and widely reviewed in 1838. In {{the summer of}} 1839, Poe became assistant editor of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing {{his reputation as a}} trenchant critic which he had established at the Southern Literary Messenger. Also in 1839, the collection Tales of <b>the</b> <b>Grotesque</b> and Arabesque {{was published}} in twovolumes, though he made little money from it and it received mixed reviews. Poe left Burton's after about a year and found a position as assistant at Graham's Magazine.|$|E
5|$|Hominid {{takes place}} several {{million years ago}} in the Central African {{transitional}} region between rainforest and savanna. The main characters are Australopithecus afarenses, an extinct, mostly tree-dwelling hominid that existed before the use of tools and fire. The story is told through first-person narration by the protagonist, Pitar. In deliberating his social and natural environment, Pitar decides to lead his band to civilization: “Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness, to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on.” His linguistic capacity, thoughts and speech correspond to those of modern man, and he also is knowledgeable about history, politics, philosophy and literature. Intermittent comments made by Pitar concerning a particular prospect or artifact that has not been invented or developed yet add to the humor of <b>the</b> <b>grotesque</b> scenario. Pitar's close friends are Carpediem, who enunciates Latin phrases and quotes the writers of Classical Antiquity, and Lao, who frequently refers to Chinese philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{inscription}} in {{time and}} its emphasis on bodily changes (through eating, evacuation, and sex), <b>the</b> <b>grotesque</b> has been interpreted by some critics as a dimension {{of the body that}} permits to perceive the historicity of man: it is in this reading used as a measuring device.|$|E

40|$|Prospects of ruins feature {{frequently}} within <b>the</b> <b>grotesques</b> or ornamental frescoes of sixteenth-century Italy. What is {{at stake}} in the representations of ruins seems to be at stake on a more general level in <b>the</b> <b>grotesques</b> seen as a compositional device: the visualisation of passages between a form and the formless, or between culture and nature, with change and movement as key concepts. The article addresses how the exploration of transformation, which is fundamental to the representation of ruins in grotesques, is manifested in subject matter, composition, and spatial relations; and how all three are aspects of the telling of time. It is suggested that the prevalence of ruins in <b>grotesques</b> highlights <b>the</b> preoccupation with temporality as a major theme in the visual culture of the period...|$|R
25|$|Dear Dead Days (1959) {{is not a}} {{collection}} of his cartoons (although it reprints a few from previous collections); it is a scrapbook-like compendium of vintage images (and occasional pieces of text) that appealed to Addams' sense of <b>the</b> <b>grotesque,</b> including Victorian woodcuts, vintage medicine-show advertisements, and a boyhood photograph of Francesco Lentini, who had three legs.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the appeals}} and racial {{stereotypes}} of early blackface performance were {{the pleasure of}} <b>the</b> <b>grotesque</b> and its infantilization of blacks. These allowed—by proxy, and without full identification—childish fun and other low pleasures in an industrializing world where workers were increasingly expected to abandon such things. Meanwhile, the more respectable could view the vulgar audience itself as a spectacle.|$|E
25|$|Romanticism's {{celebration of}} {{euphoria}} and sublimity {{has always been}} dogged by an equally intense fascination with melancholia, insanity, crime and shady atmosphere, with the options of ghosts and ghouls, <b>the</b> <b>grotesque,</b> and the irrational. The name “Dark Romanticism” was given to this form by the literary theorist Mario Praz in his lengthy study of the genre published in 1930, ‘’The Romantic Agony’’.|$|E
50|$|Mikhail Bakhtin wrote Rabelais and His World, {{praising the}} author for his {{unbridled}} embrace of <b>the</b> carnival <b>grotesque.</b> In <b>the</b> book he analyzes Rabelais's use of <b>the</b> carnival <b>grotesque</b> throughout his writings and laments the death in modern {{culture of the}} purely communal spirit and regenerating laughter of the carnival.|$|R

25|$|A second {{comic book}} version was {{produced}} by artist Fernando de Felipe, published by S. I. ARTISTS and republished by Heavy Metal Magazine in 1994. This adaptation was intended for a mature audience and places more emphasis on the horrific elements of the story. De Felipe has simplified and taken some liberties with Hugo's storyline. His rendering emphasizes <b>the</b> <b>grotesque</b> in Hugo and excludes {{the elements of the}} sublime that are equally important in the original.|$|E
25|$|Bakhtin’s {{notion of}} {{carnival}} {{is connected with}} that of <b>the</b> <b>grotesque.</b> In the carnival, usual social hierarchies and proprieties are upended; {{emphasis is placed on}} the body in its open dimension, in its connection {{to the life of the}} community. This emphasis on the material dimension which links humans, rather than on the differences and separations between them, allows for the consciousness of the historical dimension of human life: for every death, there is a birth, a renewal of the human spirit. This process allows for progress.|$|E

25|$|In the 1580s, Pilon {{began work}} on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb of Catherine de' Medici and Henry II at the {{basilica}} of Saint Denis. Among these, the fragmentary Resurrection, now in the Louvre, was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel. This work owes a clear debt to Michelangelo, who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine's father at the Medici chapels in Florence. Pilon openly depicted extreme emotion in his work, sometimes {{to the point of}} <b>the</b> <b>grotesque.</b> His style has been interpreted as a reflection of a society torn by the conflict of the French wars of religion.|$|E
25|$|Potters from Italy {{came into}} Seville {{in the early}} 16th century and {{established}} workshops there. They brought with them the maiolica techniques which allowed the artists to represent a much larger number of figurative themes in their compositions. The first Italian potter to move into Spain was Francisco Niculoso who settled in Seville in 1498. Examples of his work can still be admired in situ in the Alcazar of Seville. Under {{the influence of the}} Renaissance style introduced by Italians artists, most azulejos were polychrome tile panels depicting allegorical or mythological scenes, scenes from the lives of saints or the Bible, or hunting scenes. Mannerism and <b>the</b> <b>grotesque</b> style, with its bizarre representations, had much influence on azulejos.|$|E
25|$|But {{his only}} signed {{pictures}} {{of this period}} are the Neptune and Amphitrite of 1516 at Berlin, and the Madonna, with a portrait of Jean Carondelet of 1517, at the Louvre, both of which suggest that Vasari only spoke by hearsay of the progress made by Gossaert in the true method of producing pictures full of mythological nude figures and poesies. It {{is difficult to find}} anything more coarse or misshapen than the Amphitrite, unless it is <b>the</b> <b>grotesque</b> and ungainly drayman who figures for Neptune. In later forms of the same subject—the Adam and Eve at Hampton Court, or its feebler replica at Berlin and Venus and Amor (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels)—there is more nudity, combined with realism of the commonest type.|$|E

6000|$|... § XLV. For observe, the {{difficulty}} which, as I above stated, exists in distinguishing the playful from <b>the</b> terrible <b>grotesque</b> arises {{out of this}} cause; that the mind, under certain phases of excitement, plays with terror, and summons images which, if it were in another temper, would be awful, but of which, either in weariness or in irony, it refrains for the time to acknowledge the true terribleness. And the mode in which this refusal takes place distinguishes the noble from <b>the</b> ignoble <b>grotesque.</b> For <b>the</b> master of <b>the</b> noble <b>grotesque</b> knows <b>the</b> depth of all at which he seems to mock, and would feel it at another time, or feels it in a certain undercurrent of thought even while he jests with it; but the workman of <b>the</b> ignoble <b>grotesque</b> can feel and understand nothing, and mocks at all things with the laughter of the idiot and the cretin.|$|R

25|$|Practices such as these, varying {{from the}} mundane to <b>the</b> <b>grotesque,</b> were {{commonly}} associated with necromancy. Rituals could be quite elaborate, involving magic circles, wands, talismans, and incantations. The necromancer might also surround himself with morbid aspects of death, which often included wearing the deceased's clothing and consuming foods that symbolized lifelessness and decay such as unleavened black bread and unfermented grape juice. Some necromancers {{even went so far}} as to take part in the mutilation and consumption of corpses. These ceremonies could carry on for hours, days, or even weeks, leading up to the eventual summoning of spirits. Frequently they were performed in places of interment or other melancholy venues that suited specific guidelines of the necromancer. Additionally, necromancers preferred to summon the recently departed based on the premise that their revelations were spoken more clearly. This timeframe was usually limited to the twelve months following the death of the physical body; once this period elapsed, necromancers would evoke the deceased’s ghostly spirit instead.|$|E
25|$|While {{traveling}} through Styria, Behmen and Felson encounter <b>the</b> <b>grotesque</b> sight of people {{infected with the}} Black Death and discover that the Holy Roman Empire has been swept by the plague. They enter an unnamed town, trying to conceal their identity as deserters, but are revealed as knights by the crest on Behmen's sword. They are arrested and taken to Cardinal D'Ambroise, who is infected with the plague. The Cardinal asks the knights to escort an alleged witch suspected of causing the plague to a remote monastery, where an elite group of monks reside. These monks can determine if the girl is truly a witch, and if she is found guilty, know a sacred ritual to cancel her powers and stop the plague that is devastating Europe. The two knights agree under the condition she be given a fair trial and that the charges of desertion against them be dropped. The Cardinal agrees and they set out accompanied by a priest, Debelzaq; a young altar boy, Kay von Wollenbarth, who {{wants to become a}} knight like his deceased father; a knight, Johann Eckhardt, whose family was killed by the plague; and the well-traveled swindler Hagamar, who will serve as their guide to the monastery in return for a pardon. The witch, a young girl later identified as Anna from Marburg, shows hatred towards Debelzaq and forms a bond with Behmen.|$|E
