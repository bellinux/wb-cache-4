The overview covers the legal framework for TFC, brief TFC-related information on the selected regions, TFC instruments available in the North-West of Russia, donors supporting TFC in the area and <b>transfrontier</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the border regions of Russia's North-West. Additionally, Tacis Cross-Border Small and Micro Project Facilities (the largest and most developed <b>transfrontier</b> <b>cooperation</b> programmes in the North-West of Russia) are examined in more detail.

40|$|The Okavango basin, {{consisting}} of the Okavango River catchment plus the Okavango Delta, is an important and yet highly vulnerable component of the larger Makgadikgadi basin, which comprises portions of four Southern African countries. Though the Okavango River and its tributaries are vital sources of water in an otherwise arid region, all plans to use water from this system have attracted intense local and international concern. The three underlying principles of state sovereignty, state responsibility and good neighbourliness between states are linked directly to the relationships between states and {{form the basis for}} <b>transfrontier</b> <b>cooperation</b> on all issues. In addition, several other strategic factors will also need to be considered by the basin states when a management plan is developed for the Okavango system. Ultimately, effective management of the Okavango basin and its water resources will depend on close collaboration and mutual trust between the states concerned...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} a first {{critical}} analysis of the Prüm Convention on deepening <b>transfrontier</b> <b>cooperation,</b> amongst others in view of combating terrorism, transfrontier crime, and illegal migration, which was signed by Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Spain on 27 May 2005 and which will enter into force after its ratification by two States. While its scope is clearly {{in the field of}} police cooperation of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice of the EU and EC treaties, it has not been adopted according to the reinforced cooperation procedure available under the Nice Treaty. While it represents a progress in the field of police cooperation against the signatory member states, it shows a number of negative aspects. It represents a regression as compared to the – rather insufficient – provisions which would be applicable to the adoption of such measures under the relevant provisions of the EU and EC treaties as it has been adopted after a process behind hidden doors, and this is reflected in a number of clauses of the treaty which may be considered as poorly drafted or even dangerous. The full (French) version of the convention is published as an annex to the paper. immigration policy; police cooperation; international agreements; European law...|$|E
40|$|This paper first {{provides}} a short introduction of regionalism, i. e. international cooperation, {{and the concept}} of regional policies is presented. Then we introduce the concept of transnational cooperation, which is a process quite distinctive, yet parallel to processes of international regionalism cooperation tending toward supranational integration. Origins of transnational cooperation, i. e. states' regional cooperation across international borders, are discussed. The phenomenon of the process of regionalism and regionalization within Europe is dealt with. This trend is only seemingly opposed to the trend of international regionalism as manifested by integration processes between states. The nature of the state, though, does change since functions are delegated to the supranational and the subnational level. Both of these processes (regionalism and regionalization), as well as transnational cooperation of states, furthers the awareness of subnational regions as political units responsible for their own social and economic development. <b>Transfrontier</b> <b>cooperation</b> has triggered the idea of international subnational regional cooperation. The study provides examples of both phenomenon. Integration processes and the importance of the decision-making process on the supranational level for the well-being of the subnational level tends to cause the subnational regions to join in their own international political organizations to exercise pressure on the international level. Supranational bodies, for their own reasons, have accepted regions as specific partners. This paper provides examples of these international political organizations...|$|E
40|$|The Cross-Border Cooperation (CBC) {{process has}} been {{supported}} by the EU Cohesion Policy umbrella since 1990, when the first multi-annual Programme (1989 - 1993) took place, aiming {{the implementation of a}} strategic orientation of investments, with a special focus on the less developed EU regions, which included the border areas, following the principles of a more balanced European Territory. By then, borders between Member-States accounted for 6. 000 km of land frontier, 15 % of UE land area and 10 % of its population. Yet, their peripheral situation, together with the overall picture of lower levels of socio-economic development led the European Commission (EC) to launch, in 1990, a special initiative for border regions known as INTERREG, in order to promote <b>transfrontier</b> <b>cooperation</b> which included the CBC stand (INTERREG-A). Since then, two other INTERREG-A generations have been concluded (1994 - 1999 and 2000 - 2006), and another is on its way, included in the Territorial Cooperation objective (2007 - 2013), proving the success of this initiative in promoting the European Territorial Integration, in view of the ESDP strategic guidelines to achieve a more balanced EU territory. Indeed, at the present moment, the EU border areas (NUTS III) account for some 60 % of the EU area and 41 % of the EU population, while 37 % of these areas are included in the convergence objective, making their socio-economic support vital to EU territory development. With this in mind, the question remains: isn’t the 1. 8 % of EU allocation funds for the present Cohesion Programme (2007 - 2013) a ‘bad deal ’ for the European Border areas...|$|E
40|$|European Union {{energy sources}} are {{supposed}} to be sufficient to cover expected growth of natural gas demand for the coming decades, but there are not enough opportunities/infrastructure to transport these volumes of gas to European markets. Arbitrary interruptions of Russia gas deliveries towards Europe, the delays in the rehabilitation of its obsolete pipeline network, the interdiction of direct Asian gas exports transit through Russian transport infrastructure, made stringently necessary for European countries to diversify gas suppliers’ portfolio, by avoiding Russian territory. Nabucco pipeline was conceived as an alternative to European Union countries’ high dependence on Russian gas (about 40 % of their consumption is provided by Russia), by connecting European Union countries directly to the huge natural gas resources of Central Asia, on the route Turkey – Bulgaria – Romania – Hungary – Austria. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to make a SWOT analysis of this project, highlighting its strengths and weakness from Romania’s point of view, as well as the opportunities and threats as external factors. The main idea resulting from the analysis is that strengths are prevailing for Romania. The turning to account of this project will ensure the diversification of gas sources and the development of competitive markets which can entail price reduction. It is supposed to be a fair and advantageous option, economically reliable, that will reduce dependence on deliveries of gas from a single source – Russia, ensuring two undeniable prerequisites: accessibility (to new supply sources) and availability (which refers to guarantees of long term sustainability of gas deliveries). The project implementation will allow energy to help to establish new structural links between the EU, Turkey and the Caspian Sea states and will ensure <b>transfrontier</b> <b>cooperation</b> possibilities inside some euro-regions already constituted, by accessing regional development funds at EU level. Its route on Romanian territory (through the plain from the southern part of the country) will be an important advantage in pipeline layout, implying lower costs. Nabucco pipeline will create the opportunity of a better connection of our NTS (National Transport System) to the European gas network. All the countries involved in the project are OTAN members, so that Nabucco can also become a vector for political stability in the Black Sea region. natural gas, infrastructure,, interconnection, energy security, supply diversification, public investment...|$|E
