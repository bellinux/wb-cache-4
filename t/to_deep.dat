5|$|Deep frying {{is popular}} worldwide, with deep-fried foods {{accounting}} {{for a large}} portion of global caloric consumption.

5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky <b>to</b> <b>deep</b> in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period. There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead <b>to</b> <b>deep</b> sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments. During childbirth, administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia, less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more somnolence than trichloroethylene.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less than half a centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow <b>to</b> <b>deep</b> water and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Around 1997, {{a number}} of Rare {{employees}} left to establish separate companies. The first was Eighth Wonder, underwritten by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which did not produce any games before it closed. After Martin Hollis left Rare, he joined Nintendo before founding his own company Zoonami, releasing Zendoku, Go! Puzzle and Bonsai Barber. Other Perfect Dark team members, including David Doak and Steve Ellis, founded Free Radical Design and created the TimeSplitters series. It was acquired by Crytek and renamed Crytek UK before its 2014 closure, with most of its staff moving <b>to</b> <b>Deep</b> Silver Dambuster Studios.|$|E
5|$|As {{the islands}} have no {{harbours}} or anchorages, the phosphate ships were loaded by securing <b>to</b> <b>deep</b> moorings and embarking their cargo via cantilever jetties. During south-westerly wind periods—which are common from November to March—the ships {{had to stop}} loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved. It was common for these ships {{to be allowed to}} drift to save fuel, and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.|$|E

5|$|At 4/189 Loxton {{came in to}} join Harvey, who {{continued}} to attack the bowling, unperturbed by Miller's demise. Ken Cranston came on to bowl and Harvey square drove and then hooked <b>to</b> <b>deep</b> square leg for consecutive boundaries. Yardley then moved a man from fine leg to where the hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to the fielder's former position, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes the time required <b>to</b> <b>deep</b> fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer <b>to</b> <b>deep</b> load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, the United States was {{completing}} a retreat from Vietnam. A staunchly anti-communist Indonesia was {{considered by the}} United States to be an essential counterweight, and friendly relations with the Indonesian government were considered {{more important than a}} decolonisation process in East Timor. The United States also wanted to maintain its access <b>to</b> <b>deep</b> water straits running through Indonesia for undetectable submarine passage between the Indian and Pacific oceans.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Warner Premiere was {{planning}} a direct-to-video sequel <b>to</b> <b>Deep</b> Blue Sea, {{which would be}} released sometime in 2009.

Vocals and keyboards were handled by members of another band, Elmer Fudd, and a few instrumental tracks composed by the band were also included on the album. The album was released in January 1973.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Erroneous examples, {{an unusual}} and {{challenging}} form of learning material, are arguably {{a type of}} desirable difficulty for students that could lead <b>to</b> <b>deeper</b> learning. In {{a series of studies}} we have done {{over the past three years}} involving web-based math instruction, the learning benefits of erroneous examples we have observed occured on delayed tests, as occurs in the desirable difficulties literature. This short paper briefly reviews the literature, summarizes our results, and speculates on how an adaptive version of our materials could better leverage desirable difficulties theory and lead <b>to</b> <b>deeper</b> student learning...|$|R
