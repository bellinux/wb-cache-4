30|$|Different {{materials}} {{systems were}} used to fabricate thin film thermocouples for high-temperature application, such as Pt-PtRh and In 2 O 3 -ITO [6 – 9]. However, thin film form of these materials is susceptible in stability and repeatability issues, especially at high-temperature range in which aeroengines are generally operated. For instance, selective oxidation of rhodium between 800 and 1000  °C results in the drift and degradation of the Pt-PtRh TFTCs [10, 11]. As for ITO-based TFTCs, although In 2 O 3 -based oxides have the characteristics of higher temperature endurance, the unbalanced compensation of oxygen vacancies {{would lead to the}} drift of thermoelectric output and even device failure during high-temperature cycling [12, 13]. Several approaches have been tried to improve the thermoelectric properties of In 2 O 3 -based oxides, such as high-temperature annealing and nitrogen doping [14 – 16]. The high-temperature stability of ITO-based TFTCs is improved; nevertheless, the thermoelectric output of TFTCs is gradually reduced due to oxygen diffusion in ITO films.

In addition, the spreading thermal resistance in the module substrates is considered to find the impact of designing small fraction of thermo elements per unit area. Previous studies are expanded by a full optimization of the electrical and thermal circuits. The optimum condition satisfies both electrical load resistance match with the internal resistance and the thermal resistance match with the heat source and the heat sink. Thermoelectric element aspect ratio and fill factor are found to be key parameters to optimize. The optimum leg length and the maximum output power are determined by a simple formula. The output power density per mass of the thermoelectric material has a peak when thermo elements cover a fractional area of ~ 1 %. The role of the substrate heat spreading for thermoelectric power generation is equally significant as <b>thermoelement.</b> For a given heat source, the co-optimization of the heat sink and the thermoelectric module should be performed.
