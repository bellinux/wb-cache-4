50|$|Citrus × latifolia, {{with common}} names {{seedless}} lime, Bearss lime, Persian lime, and <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime,</b> is a citrus fruit species of hybrid origin, known only in cultivation.|$|E
50|$|The Persian or <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> tree {{grows to}} 15 - 20 ft height, with broad lanceolat leaves and {{slightly}} purple-tinged flowers (with no viable pollen) mostly in January. The fruit has vivid green peel till it ripens to pale-yellow. Its pulp with 10 segments of light greenish-yellow color is normally seedless.|$|E
5000|$|The two popular {{varieties}} of limes grown in Mexico are the Mexican or Key lime (Citrus aurantifolia) and the Persian lime (Citrus latifolia, simply called [...] "lime" [...] in the US); {{the former is}} of Indo-Malayan origin introduced in Mexico by the Spaniards after the 1520s, while the latter, also called the <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime,</b> was introduced from US. Persian lime production in Mexico caters specifically to the US market; {{a substantial increase in}} production has been attributed to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Lime production in Mexico has also expanded consequent to the increase in its per capita consumption in the United States and the European Union (EU).|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} {{advisable}} to graft the plants onto rootstocks with low susceptibility to gummosis, because seedlings generally are highly {{vulnerable to the}} disease.

The Brazilian exports of <b>Tahiti</b> <b>limes</b> have increased {{in the last years}} with a corresponding increased demand for superior quality of fresh fruits, which is affected by mineral nutrients. Therefore, this study evaluated nutrient soil availability and its influence on nutritional status of trees based on the determination of leaf and fruit nutrient concentrations, fruit characteristics, and post harvest quality. Eleven commercial groves with trees older than 4 -yr and differently managed were studied. Plots with six trees in each grove were sampled for soil (0 - 20 cm depth layer), leaf and fruit analyses with three replicates. Correlation coefficients were pair wised established for all variables. The results showed that N leaf concentration was well correlated with green color of fruit peel as measured by a color index (r = - 0. 71 **), and which was optimum with Leaf-N around 22 g kg- 1. Leaf-Ca was inversely correlated with fruit water loss after 14 -day interval from harvest (r = - 0. 54 *) demonstrating that Ca {{plays an important role in}} Tahiti fruit shelf-life. Data also suggested that increased fruit K concentration correlated with increased fruit water losses during storage (r > 0. 58 *) ...|$|R

Of the 167 plots sampled in Colombia, 28 % {{were located in}} the Valle del Cauca, {{followed}} by Boyacá (16 %), Antioquia (15 %), Huila (13 %), Santander (9 %), Caldas (5 %), Cundinamarca (4 %), Cauca (3 %), Nariño (3 %), Quindío (2 %) and, finally, Risaralda (2 %). As for the presence/absence of Cecidomyiidae, {{it was found that}} in Colombia, 53 % of the crops visited presented at least one species. In the tomato crop, it was found that 65 % of the sites visited had P. longifila infestation, while in sweet pepper and <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime,</b> P. longifila was found in 31 % and 75 % of the crops visited, respectively. P. longifila was not found in crops of hot peppers, potatoes or asparagus. The morphological identification determined that the adult from tomato, paprika and <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> are morphologically similar and correspond to P. longifila.|$|E

40|$|The {{so-called}} "quebra-galho" clone of <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> is {{very popular}} in Brazil, because {{the small size of}} the trees is suitable for high-density plantings. These <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> trees are easily recognized because they show bark-cracking symptoms, that have been claimed to be associated with "exocortis" infection. Viroid infection of three "quebra-galho" <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> trees from a farm near Araraquara in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, was assessed by Northern-blot hybridization using viroid-specific probes. Similarly, eight clones of <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> from different origins and available at Topara Nursery, near Chincha, Peru, were also tested for viroids. The four clones that displayed characteristic bark-cracking symptoms were found to be infected with Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd), Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) and Citrus viroid III (CVd-III), whereas the clones that did not show bark-cracking symptoms were either viroid-free or infected only with CVd-III. A study is being conducted to establish if viroids, and in particular CEVd, are indeed the cause of "quebra-galho" bark cracking symptoms. Preliminary observations indicated that 2 -yr old CEVd-infected lime trees at Moncada, Spain showed cracks. 2010 Disponível em: Acesso em: 11 mar. 2011...|$|E

In 2004, citrus huanglongbing (HLB), was first reported in the São Paulo State and the trees in the experiment started to show HLB symptoms in 2009. From July 2010 to May 2012, disease severity was evaluated four times and the bacteria titer quantified once. The numbers of qPCR positive replications were in a range of five to eight. Severity data was used to calculate the area under the disease severity progress curve (AUDSPC). The data were analyzed by Fisher LSD test (5 %). Flying Dragon and Davis A trifoliate oranges, and Swingle citrumelo, had lower values of AUDSPC, differing from Morton citrange, Orlando tangelo, Rangpur lime and Volkamer lemon. The citradia HRS 849 [citradia 1708 (Argentina trifoliate orange x Smooth Flat Sevile) had intermediate behavior. The canopies were removed but the rootstocks are still alive, so, new studies using the rootstock’s new shoots and the roots will be done aiming to quantify Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus titer in them and to confirm the rootstock’s tolerance identified in the canopies...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} 12 rootstock varieties on the development and quality of &# 8216;Tahiti&# 8217; acid lime fruits cultivated in the municipality of Jaíba, MG. Seedlings were planted in an experimental orchard in November 2008, using 8 x 5 meters spacing and drip irrigation. The experiment was conducted using a scion cultivar (<b>Tahiti</b> acid <b>lime,</b> IAC- 5 cultivar) and the following 12 rootstocks: &# 8216;Rangpur&# 8217; lime, &# 8216;Troyer&# 8217; citrange, &# 8216;Carrizo&# 8217; citrange, 1707 hybrid (Rangpur lime x Swingle trifoliate), 1710 and 1697 citrandarins, 1708 citradia, &# 8216;Swingle&# 8217; citrumelo, &# 8216;Cleopatra&# 8217; and &# 8216;Sunki&# 8217; mandarins, &# 8216;Volkamer&# 8217; lemon, and &# 8216;Limeira&# 8217; trifoliate. A randomized block design with five replicates and three trees per plot was used. Trunk diameter of both rootstock and scion, as well as height, diameter, and canopy volume, yield, fruit mass, number of fruits per tree, productivity, production efficiency index, longitudinal diameter, equatorial diameter, total soluble solids, total acidity, and vitamin C content of fruits were evaluated. &# 8216;Volkameriano&# 8217; and &# 8216;Cleopatra&# 8217; rootstocks promoted higher plant vigor and productivity for &# 8216;Tahiti&# 8217; acid lime. However, &# 8216;Limeira&# 8217; trifoliate and &# 8216;Troyer&# 8217; citrange produced less vigor, but increased production efficiency; and can be used as alternative rootstocks for &# 8216;Rangpur&# 8217; lime, as long as adjustments are performed in the planting spacing to increase productivity. In general, no differences in physical and chemical characteristics of fruits for all treatments were found, and fruits remained within commercial standards...|$|R

The larvae {{consumed}} tender foliage, flowers and fruits in tomato, fruits in sweet pepper, and buds in <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime.</b> P. longifila {{was not found}} in asparagus or in potatoes. Its presence in <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> was previously unknown in Colombia. Adults recovered in the laboratory were taxonomically identified using male morphological characteristics such as {{the shapes of the}} genitalia, antenna and wing. P. longifila was found in the Andean region of Colombia. The ecological niche model for populations found in tomato suggests that P. longifila is limited in its distribution by altitude and variables associated with temperature and precipitation. The highest probability of occurrence is in areas where tomato, sweet pepper and the new host, <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime,</b> are grown. Therefore, it is necessary to implement preventive measures, such as planting tomato materials free of P. longifila larvae, in areas where the pest is not yet present but where there is the potential for its development.|$|E
30|$|The larvae of P. longifila {{scrape the}} {{epidermal}} tissues of plant structures using piercing-sucking mouthparts (Gagné 1994). After undergoing three larval stages, the larvae pupate {{in the ground}} (Peña et al. 1989). Because larvae are small (< 1.9 mm, Peña et al. 1989) and the crepuscular habits of adults make them difficult {{to find in the}} field, it is unclear what type of damage P. longifila causes. Our first objective was to characterise the damage caused by P. longifila in host plants. In Colombia, P. longifila feeds on foliar buds, flowers and fruits in tomato, whereas in the United States, it consumes the ovaries, stamens and pistils of <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> flower buds, causing their abortion (Peña et al. 1989). Based on the phytochemical distance of these two host plants, our second objective was to determine whether P. longifila of tomato is a morphologically different species from that reported in <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> in the United States. Because Colombia produces 92, 304 tons of limes annually, representing 20.1 % of all national (Ministerio de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural 2006) and 0.09 % of world lemon and lime production (FAO 2012), and the market for <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> is expanding in Europe and the United States (Ministerio de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural 2006; Aguilar-Niño et al. 2012), our third objective was to determine if P. longifila is also found in <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> in Colombia.|$|E

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on 30 pest risk assessments made by France on organisms which are considered by France as harmful in four French overseas departments, i. e. French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion. In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the full[1] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Prays citri with French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique considered as endangered area. P. citri Millière (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae), the citrus flower moth, is usually found on Citrus. In addition, it has been reported to attack other Rutaceae and species of Sapotaceae (Manilkara zapota, Casimiroa edulis) and Oleaceae (Ligustrum lucidum). Damage may vary depending on the citrus crop attacked. Its major host is Citrus aurantiifolia (lime), but important damage can be inflicted also to Citrus limon (lemon) and occasionally to other citrus fruits, including sweet orange (Citrus sinensis). The larva feeds both internally and externally on flowers, flower buds and fruits; it will occasionally also feed on leaves and young shoots. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [2]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 b). Many statements in the French document are not referenced or supported by verifiable scientific data. The ratings for the probability of entry, establishment and impact given in the pest risk assessment are difficult to interpret, {{due to the lack of}} evidence presented and inconsistent judgments by the assessors. This particularly applies to: the possible introduction pathways, available strategies to control the pest, and the potential economic impact of the pest in the PRA area[3]. Based upon information provided in the pest risk assessment and the relevant literature on the current distribution of the pest and the relative importance of pathways, the Panel judges the probability of entry to be low for fruits but moderate for plants for planting (including potted ornamental plants). The Panel disagrees with the document that the probability of establishment is moderate and considers it to be high, based on the presence of suitable host plants and the climatic adaptability of the pest. The information provided in the pest risk assessment for the economic impact assessment is limited and conflicting, and does not allow a reliable evaluation of the ratings given within this section. A review of the literature by the Panel suggests that the economic importance of this pest varies considerably, depending on the citrus species, cultivars and geographic area. The organism appears to cause economic damage particularly in lemon and lime crops with extended flowering or multiple bloom periods, where flowering may coincide with population peaks of adults. In some areas, repeated control measures may be required to prevent economic damage, whereas in other areas, no control measures are considered necessary. The French document, however, does not provide any information on cultivars of lemon and <b>lime</b> (<b>Tahiti</b> and Mexican <b>lime)</b> grown in the PRA area or on the number of crops produced per year, which makes an accurate judgement by the Panel on the potential economic impacts in lemon and lime difficult. Further information obtained by the Panel suggests that although limited in area, lime represents around 50 % of the citrus area under production in French Guiana and Guadeloupe. In addition, sweet orange represents 82 % of citrus production in Martinique, and damage has also been recorded for that crop, albeit to a lesser extent than for lemon and lime. The conclusion of the French document on Prays citri is that the species qualifies as a quarantine pest for French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique. The Panel agrees that the organism may enter and can establish in the PRA area, and considers that the economic impact of P. citri in the PRA area is highly uncertain, and may range from low to high. Because of the high level of uncertainty, further research is recommended to estimate the direct pest effects on crop yield and quality, and the availability and feasibility of control options under the specific conditions of the PRA area. The Panel, therefore, concludes that P. citri is appropriate for evaluation of pest risk management options for the French overseas departments of French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique, and isthus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /E...|$|R
40|$|Anthracnose {{is a very}} {{limiting}} disease affecting production, as well as postharvest {{quality of}} numerous fruit crops in Colombia. The current management practices for this disease are partially effective due to limited information about the etiology, the inoculum sources, population structure and variation of the pathogen. A total of 293 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from symptomatic tissues collected from <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime,</b> tamarillo and mango orchards. To determine the Colletotrichum species causing the symptoms, amplification, and PCR product analysis for intergenic regions of the ribosomal DNA were conducted. Genetic diversity of the fungal population was assessed with Random Amplified Microsatellites (RAMS). Results of this study indicated that anthracnose in <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> and tamarillo are caused by Colletotrichun acutatum whereas symptoms on mango were induced by the species Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which was also fund in few citrus samples. RAMS data analysis indicated the existence of two distinct species groups, with a low similarity index (35 %). RAM profiles also showed a clear host differentiation of isolates. The C. acutatum population originated from tamarillo exhibited a narrow and homogeneous genetic base, while the C. acutatum population from <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> was more heterogeneous and genetically complex, {{as determined by the}} analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and of Ni-Li coefficient. The C. gloeosporioides population originated from mango and <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> was heterogeneous and highly diverse, with clear host differentiation according to RAM profiles.

30|$|The {{results suggest}} that P. longifila is adapted to the hot and {{temperate}} climates of the Andean region (well established in the Valle del Cauca and the Coffee Region: Caldas, Risaralda and Quindío), {{and even in the}} departments at risk, as in Meta and Caquetá, the species would be on the eastern slope of the Andes. Because the foothills of Meta have 1000 ha cultivated with <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> (10 % of the total Colombian citrus cultivation area) and are seen as an area to increase <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> production for exportation from Colombia (Cleves-Leguízamo et al. 2012), it is necessary to define whether P. longifila causes economic damage to this crop even if molecular analysis reveal the presence of cryptic species.|$|E

The highest yield efficiency of average canopy volume was obtained with Sunki x Jacobson. The <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> yield and morphological development fell in the seventh year (2007) in all rootstocks, due to an infection caused by a mix of isolates of CTV type Madeira and type B 128, isolates which cause stem channeling : type B 31 which causes moderate stem channeling and B 7 and VT isolate...|$|E

30|$|The {{predictions}} of our model {{call for an}} increase in preventive measures, such as monitoring the insect presence in nurseries from where P. longifila larvae could spread (Gagné 1986 b; Sylven and Lövgren 1995).

30|$|This study {{provides}} information on the biology of the gall midge Prodiplosis longifila, {{one of the most}} destructive pests of tomato and paprika in Colombia. P. longifila is reported for the first time attacking reproductive structures of <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> in Colombia. Microscopic preparations of P. longifila males are needed for taxonomic identification; the antennae have 14 flagellomeres with two nodes each, and the male gonopods are oriented dorsoventrally. The insect is distributed between Andean valleys located at 739 up to 2168 masl in The Andes of Colombia. Apparently, unchecked transport of plant material has contributed to the dispersion of the species, so sanitation measures should be implemented in nurseries. Pruning tomato leaves may reduce the population of P. longifila larvae. Besides altitude, the variables that most influence the distribution of P. longifila are temperature, relative humidity and precipitation. The infestation of P. longifila in tomato decreases during periods of high rainfall, possibly because larvae drop from the foliage to the ground, but also because the high concentration of moisture and lack of oxygen in the soil may increase pupal mortality. Prediction models based on tomato crop populations predict the distribution of the species on the foothills of Meta area, located on the eastern slope of the Andes, where 10 % of total Colombian citrus cultivation takes place. Some years ago P. longifila caused economic losses to <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> production in the USA, therefore it is important to further investigate its impact on <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> production in Colombia. However DNA analysis for P. longifila is required to understand if the populations of P. longifila collected from different host plants correspond to a complex of cryptic species rather than a single polyphagous species. These results will be fundamental to develop effective IPM strategies, including biological control programmes.|$|E
30|$|The {{identification}} {{of this new}} Colombian host indicates on one hand that P. longifila is polyphagous and not monophagous, like many other Cecidomyiidae (Hall et al. 2012), and that it adapts to phytochemically unrelated hosts. This adaptation probably occurs by a process of ecological speciation favouring alleles (Lenormand 2012) that allow adaptation to new and abundant hosts (Bourguet et al. 2014). The <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime,</b> for example, {{was introduced in the}} Valle del Cauca (the zone where P. longifila was initially detected) in 1941 (Orduz and Mateus 2012) and P. longifila probably adapted to this host after coming from tomato that was being cultivated in the region. The propensity of this species for polyphagia may permit the expansion to other crops and areas of Colombia, as indicated by our risk map. Gagné and Jaschhof (2014) reported this species in five families and eight species of host plants. It is unknown if P. longifila causes economic damage in <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> in Colombia {{as it did in the}} United States, where it caused losses of up to 25 % (Peña et al. 1987). Because <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> is exported from Colombia, the presence of P. longifila should be investigated further. On the other hand, the {{identification of}} P. longifila was carried out only by morphological characteristics and therefore DNA analysis is needed to understand if the populations of P. longifila collected from different host plants correspond to a complex of cryptic species rather than a single polyphagous species as suggested by Mathur et al. (2012) for the cecidomyiid Dasineura oxycocanna. Crops are usually introduced on purpose by humans and offer a new resource where a pest can evolve from pre-existing local herbivores by ecological speciation (Bourguet et al. 2014).|$|E
30|$|Taxonomic {{identification}} {{was based}} on the morphology of males (Gagné 1986 a; Gagné 1994); the abdomen, antennae and wings were removed from each individual, {{and the rest of the}} body was kept for further molecular identification.

Liberibacter asiaticus in grafted seedlings in the greenhouse and in commercial orchards of sweet orange and <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime.</b> Plants of sweet orange and <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> naturally infected with HLB were protected with screens aphid-proof {{to prevent the spread}} of disease. In greenhouse we used 17 Pêra variety seedlings that were inoculated in 2008 with infected budwood. The detection of HLB in the plants was carried out using conventional PCR. Ten leaves of each plant were collected for DNA extraction and for their full monitoring of the bacterial population by quantitative PCR for a period of 19 months. We observed erratic behavior of the bacterium. Even after the bacterium detection in the plant it was not possible to verify the presence of the etiologic agent in the same place after a few months. In the seedlings the bacterium was not detected in 82. 3 % of the plants in certain months, coinciding with the warmer months of the year in Brazil, despite its presence has being detected at earlier dates. For the plants in commercials orchards,  the detected Ct values were between 18 and 33. The pathogen was even found when the expression of symptoms was small.

Maximum pectinolytic activity was reached in 72 h of growth, the best two fungal strains being A. niger T 0005007 - 2 and A. oryzae CCT 3940. Three types of commercial purified pectin and four of unprocessed pectin (tangerine, orange, <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> and sweet lime rind) {{were used to assess}} the effect of pectin on the production of endo-PG by A. niger T 0005007 - 2. Maximum pectinolytic activity was achieved using 6 and 10 % (w/w) of purified pectin as inducer. Depending on the origin of the commercial pectin used as inducer, maximum endo-PG levels varied from 223 to 876 units per gram of dry medium (one endo-PG unit (U) was defined as the quantity of enzyme which caused a reduction in viscosity of 50 % in a 1 % w/v solution of pectin in 30 min), indicating that care should be taken when choosing this component of the medium. When the crude pectins were used as inducers at the same concentration as purified pectin, maximum endo-PG activities were 250 Ð 300 units/g. However, by increasing the amount of <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> rind to 50 % (w/w) maximum endo-PG was 919 U/g, thus opening up the possibility of a low cost medium for endo-PG production...|$|E

40|$|Los cítricos son capaces de crecer y fructificar en condiciones ambientales muy diversas, desde climas subtropicales relativamente fríos hasta zonas tropicales cálidas. Se han encontrado relaciones estrechas con factores ambientales, entre los que se encuentran un régimen de temperaturas moderadamente bajas, en condiciones subtropicales, y el estrés hídrico en el trópico para activar la floración, lo cual hace que el suministro de agua sea muy importante en la producción. Se evaluó el efecto del sistema de riego localizado de alta frecuencia y la fertilización sobre el rendimiento y calidad del cultivo de lima acida Tahití, en tres localidades de Colombia; Espinal (Tolima) a 335 msnm, Lebrija (Santander) a 1033 msnm y Santo Tomas (Atlántico) a 19 msnm. Las láminas de riego evaluadas se basaron en porcentajes de la evapotranspiración de referencia (ETo) así: L 1 = 50 %ETo, L 2 = 70 %ETo y L 3 = 100 %ETo. Los tres niveles de fertilización fueron: N 1 = según el análisis químico del suelo/requerimientos de la planta, N 2 = doble de la fertilización recomendada en N 1 y N 3 = fertilización utilizada por el productor. La frecuencia de fertilización fue quincenal. Las {{variables}} de respuesta fueron: rendimiento, peso del fruto, diámetro ecuatorial y polar del fruto, grosor de la cáscara, peso y porcentaje de jugo, acidez, sólidos solubles y contenido de vitamina C. //Abstract: Citrus {{is able to}} {{grow and}} flourish {{in a variety of}} environmental conditions from relatively cold climates to subtropical warm tropical areas. It has been found a close relationship between environmental factors, such as moderately low temperatures in subtropical conditions, and water stress in the tropics that trigger flowering, which makes water supply a very important factor associated with yield. The effect of drip irrigation system and high frequency fertilization on crop yield and quality of <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> was evaluated at three locations in Colombia, i. e., Espinal (Tolima) at 335 a. m. s. l., Lebrija (Santander) at 1033 a. m. s. l., and Santo Tomas (Atlántico) at 19 a. m. s. l. Slidesevaluatedirrigationrateswere based onreference evapotranspiration(ETo) as follows: L 1 = 50 % ETo, L 2 = 70 % ETo y L 3 = 100 % ETo. The three levels of fertilization were: N 1 = according to the chemical analysis soil / plant requirements, N 2 = twice the recommended N 1 and N 3 fertilization = fertilizer used by the grower. The frequency of fertilization was fortnightly. The response variables were: yield, fruit weight, equatorial and polar diameter fruit, shell thickness, weight and juice percentage, acidity, soluble solids and vitamin C content. In Espinal, where there were sandy loams with a very low nutrition state and a negative water balance throughout the year, an optimal response was observed in the irrigation sheet with the greatest water applied (L 3), represented mainly in the yield (number and weight of fruits (average 80 g)) and quality production that place it in category C (technical standard Colombian acidfor <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> under NTC 4087), which is acceptable for export. In Lebrija, the optimal water availability of 10 months per year, makes the production of <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> an energetically economic activity, even in soils with characteristics suitable for cultivation, such as sandy soils with high chemical weathering, where the presence of acid pH is not a limiting factor for cultivation. The highest values for size and fruit weight (average 109 g) were achieved with the interaction of treatments L 3 x N 1, placing this production in category B (according to NTC 4087). In Santo Tomás, the production was limited and a productive state was not observed before the fourth year, an age at which the yield had stabilized for other localities, starting on the second year. The low production resulting by the soil conditions (poor soils) and a water deficit during most of the year makes the productive activity of <b>Tahiti</b> <b>lime</b> unprofitable for the region, given the need for high technology investment in irrigation and nutrition...|$|E

Each botanical species {{has a distinct}} flavonoid profile, and as such, this work aimed to develop and apply a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) method to quantify specific flavonoids in different plants and parts. Six flavonoids (isoquercitrin, quercetin, naringin, naringenin, hesperidin and rutin), two isoflavonoids (daidzin and daidzein) and one coumarin (umbelliferone) were targeted. Calibration curves showed good correlations (R 2 > 0. 994) and limits of quantification (&# 8804; 500 ng mL- 1).
