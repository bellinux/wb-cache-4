5|$|The M249 LMG entered {{service in}} 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial {{reactions}} to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when fired from the ground, but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though {{a number of areas}} for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was very weak and broke easily, <b>the</b> <b>sling</b> attachment was awkward, and there were many slots and gaps that accumulated dirt. Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle was a more effective light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|The Mount Washington Observatory {{was built}} on the summit in 1932 through a group {{interested}} in and noting the worth of a research facility at that demanding location. The observatory's weather data have accumulated a climate record since. Temperature and humidity readings have been collected using a sling psychrometer, a simple device containing two mercury thermometers. Where most unstaffed weather stations have undergone technology upgrades, consistent use of <b>the</b> <b>sling</b> psychrometer has helped provide scientific precision to the Mount Washington climate record.|$|E
5|$|To {{indicate}} {{the direction of}} a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose. His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for <b>the</b> <b>sling,</b> and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum. Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare <b>the</b> pubovaginal <b>sling</b> with a new Vicryl mesh rectus fascia (VMRF) <b>sling</b> in <b>the</b> {{surgical}} treatment of low urethral pressure genuine stress incontinence. Fifty-one consecutive women who had a VMRF (n = 27) or a pubovaginal sling (n = 24) procedure between March 1995 and December 1997 were evaluated. The patient-determined subjective success rate of <b>the</b> VMRF <b>sling</b> (85 %) was significantly higher than that of <b>the</b> pubovaginal <b>sling</b> (58 %) in women with low urethral pressure stress incontinence (P= 0. 03). The objective success rates following the VMRF and <b>the</b> pubovaginal <b>sling</b> were 52 % and 50 %, respectively. The prevalence of postoperative symptomatic voiding dysfunction and de novo detrusor instability was 7 % after <b>the</b> VMRF <b>sling</b> and 25 % following <b>the</b> pubovaginal <b>sling</b> (P= 0. 08). <b>The</b> VMRF <b>sling</b> had a higher patient-determined success rate and a lower complication rate than <b>the</b> pubovaginal <b>sling,</b> and should be considered in the surgical management of women with low urethral pressure stress incontinence...|$|R

25|$|A sling {{has a small}} cradle or pouch in {{the middle}} of two lengths of cord. <b>The</b> <b>sling</b> stone is placed in the pouch. The middle finger or thumb is placed through a loop on the end of one cord, and a tab {{at the end of the}} other cord is placed between the thumb and forefinger. <b>The</b> <b>sling</b> is swung in an arc, and the tab {{released}} at a precise moment. This frees the projectile to fly to the target. <b>The</b> <b>sling</b> essentially works by extending the length of a human arm, thus allowing stones to be thrown much farther than they could be by hand.|$|E
