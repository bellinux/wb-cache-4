5|$|In 1888, <b>the</b> <b>Torah</b> and yad Rosenberg {{left with}} King Kalākaua were {{included}} in an exhibition of royal possessions at a bazaar held by King Kalākaua's wife, Queen Kapiolani. After King Kalākaua's death in 1891, his stepson David Kawānanakoa inherited the items. When Kawānanakoa's wife, Abigail Campbell Kawānanakoa, inherited them after David's death, she loaned them {{to members of the}} Hawaiian Jewish community on religious holidays. Her granddaughter, Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawānanakoa, later acquired the items. The yad was bequeathed to Temple Emanu-El in 1959, and formally dedicated for use in Torah readings the next year. <b>The</b> <b>Torah</b> was lost in the 1940s, but was recovered in 1972 when a Honolulu attorney found the scroll in the possessions of a recently deceased client and donated it to the temple. <b>The</b> <b>Torah</b> had been damaged and could not be used in services, but the temple later installed a plaque describing Rosenberg below a glass display case housing <b>the</b> <b>Torah</b> and yad.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 {{the synagogue}} began {{granting}} women some pulpit honors, giving the Sisterhood President gelila, and in 1966 granting married couples hagbaha and gelila (the honors of lifting and re-wrapping <b>the</b> <b>Torah</b> {{after it has}} been read). In the 1970s, women became more involved in the synagogue's political and religious activities: in 1972, the first woman was elected to the board of trustees, and in 1975, the congregation began calling women to <b>the</b> <b>Torah</b> and counting women in the minyan, the latter just two years after the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly voted nine to four in favor of this innovation.|$|E
5|$|Strict {{orthodox}} Judaism forbids {{men from}} cutting their sidelocks, but other hair may be kept as desired. Hair is not cut {{during a time}} of mourning. <b>The</b> <b>Torah</b> in Deuteronomy 14:1 prohibits removing hair in mourning for the dead.|$|E

50|$|A brave priest saved <b>the</b> several <b>Torahs</b> from destruction. It {{laid in the}} {{basement}} of a monastery for decades. Then, an arts dealer bought <b>the</b> <b>Torahs</b> from <b>the</b> church. He then ripped it apart and sold the parchment for canvas to artists. A rabbi, Menachem Youlus from Save a Torah (an organization that brings forgotten Torahs to welcoming congregations) asked the arts dealer for <b>Torah</b> parchment. <b>The</b> man said you have the weekend to assemble all <b>the</b> <b>Torahs</b> and pay for what you have. In the storeroom there were piles of ripped up <b>Torahs</b> and <b>the</b> rabbi assembled twenty-two of them. One of <b>the</b> <b>Torahs</b> was reassembled and found a home at Kol Ami.|$|R

In September 1989 and September 1991, he appeared on the Chabad telethon. On Yom Kippur in 2007 he attended Congregation Beth Tefillah, in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was called to <b>the</b> <b>Torah</b> for the sixth aliyah.|$|E
5|$|Herman Hirsch, a Jewish male from Chicago on {{a pilgrimage}} to the Holy Land, kept an account of President Arthurs maiden voyage. On Friday, March 13, one day into the voyage, Hirsch {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>torah</b> was dedicated and a procession to songs and music accompanied a march over all parts of the ship. Afterwards, Rabbi Aaron Ashinsky of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, officiated at a service held in a chapel provided for the passengers.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Torah,</b> {{although}} disallowing {{the use of}} most insects as food, {{permits the}} consumption of certain locusts; specifically, the red, the yellow, the spotted grey, and the white are considered permissible. In Islamic jurisprudence, eating locusts is considered halal. The Prophet Muhammad {{was reported to have}} eaten locusts during a military raid with his companions.|$|E

5|$|Further unrest was {{triggered}} when an Imperial slave named Stephanus was robbed while travelling near Beth-horon. Troops sent by Cumanus {{to arrest the}} leading men of the nearby villages began plundering the area. One of them, finding a copy of <b>the</b> <b>Torah,</b> destroyed it {{in view of the}} villagers while shouting blasphemies. Angered by this insult to God and to the Jewish religion, a crowd of Jews confronted Cumanus at Caesarea Maritima, demanding that the guilty party should be punished. This time the governor acted decisively and ordered that the soldier responsible should be beheaded in front of his accusers, temporarily restoring the calm.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>Torah.</b> I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, {{and they wanted}} Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based their faith and religious practice on <b>the</b> <b>Torah,</b> five books {{said to have been}} given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented {{only a small fraction of}} the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.|$|E

50|$|In 1881, Rabbi Ziv {{returned}} to Kelm, where <b>the</b> Talmud <b>Torah</b> became an advanced academy for <b>the</b> study of <b>Torah</b> and Musar. Most {{of the students}} who came to study at <b>the</b> Talmud <b>Torah</b> were married. Entry to <b>the</b> Talmud <b>Torah</b> was difficult and restricted to select students from other yeshivas, who had to bring letters of recommendation from their Rosh Yeshiva. Students were chosen after they passed rigorous examinations on Musar. At its peak, <b>the</b> Talmud <b>Torah</b> had a student body of between 30 and 35 members.|$|R
5|$|Kinberg's wife Alice was {{a strong}} feminist, and during the 1980s {{he and his wife}} {{supported}} a number of changes to the liturgy and ritual. These included allowing women to read from <b>the</b> <b>Torah</b> and lead the prayers, and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example, using gender-neutral terms and pronouns for God, and adding references to the Biblical matriarchs in prayers like the Amidah, which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical patriarchs. While most congregation members approved of these changes, a minority resisted them.|$|E
5|$|More of {{his later}} works are the Jewish {{community}} center in Duisburg (1996–1999), and with Rafi Segal, the Palmach Museum in Tel Aviv (1995–2000). The Duisburg Jewish community center {{is located on}} a park, the Garten der Erinnerung designed by Dani Karavan. The community center shares a similar concept to the Page Memorial in its likening to the open pages of a book, and symbolically <b>the</b> <b>Torah</b> of Moses. The Palmach Museum has an angular zig-zag plan positioned around the preservation of trees on the site. It is clad in a local sandstone that was found in excavations for the project. It was exhibited at the Venice Biennale.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the basic}} laws of kashrut are derived from the Torah's Books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Their details and {{practical}} application, however, are set down in the oral law (eventually codified in the Mishnah and Talmud) and elaborated on in the later rabbinical literature. Although <b>the</b> <b>Torah</b> does not state the rationale for most kashrut laws, some suggest that they are only tests for man's obedience, while others have suggested philosophical, practical and hygienic reasons.|$|E

5|$|Private Orthodox Jewish day schools include <b>the</b> <b>Torah</b> Academy of Bergen County (for boys {{in grades}} 9–12) which {{completed}} an $8 million expansion {{project at the}} start of the 2013–14 school year that doubled the size of the school, adding new classrooms and an additional gym to accommodate the record enrollment of 293 students, with room for expansion for the several years ahead. Ma'ayanot Yeshiva High School serves girls in grades 9–12. Yeshivas Heichal HaTorah, another high school, opened in September 2013 at the Teaneck Jewish Center with an initial enrollment of 17 students.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Torah</b> ark had the {{capacity}} to house 50 Torah scrolls and was built on two levels. It was flanked by four Corinthian columns surrounded by baroque woodcuts depicting flowers and birds. The Ark, together with its ornamental gates, were taken from the Nikolayevsky Synagogue in Kherson, Russia, which had been used by Russian Jewish conscripts forced to spend twenty-five years in the Imperial Russian Army. Directly above the Ark was a triangular window with rounded points. To the right and in front of the ark was the cantor's podium, which was designed as a miniature version of the two-level Ark.|$|E
5|$|The synagogue's eight {{valuable}} Torah scrolls {{were saved}} {{due to an}} intervention by Leonardo Grivičić, an entrepreneur and industrialist who lived next door from Mile Budak, a minister in the Ustaša government. He was also close to Poglavnik Ante Pavelić and the Third Reich's ambassador to Croatia, Edmund Glaise-Horstenau. Although Grivičić {{did not have a}} significant political role in the Independent State of Croatia, he was considered trustworthy. On October 9, 1941, he learned about the regime's plan to start the demolition of the synagogue on the following morning. By that evening, Grivičić secretly relayed the information to the synagogue's chief cantor, Grüner, and during the night, <b>the</b> <b>Torah</b> scrolls were moved to safety.|$|E

25|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} in the Inauguration of the Tabernacle, Aaron removed himself for seven days and then officiated for one day. Throughout the seven days, Moses {{transmitted}} to Aaron <b>the</b> <b>Torah's</b> guidelines to train Aaron in the service. Following this example, in subsequent generations, the High Priest removed himself for seven days before Yom Kippur to officiate for one day. And two scholars of the disciples of Moses (thus excluding the Sadducees) transmitted <b>the</b> <b>Torah's</b> guidelines to <b>the</b> High Priest throughout the seven days to train him in the service.|$|R

5|$|According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived {{between the}} times of King Solomon {{and the time of}} Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic {{commentators}} viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept for a hundred years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr {{to be one of the}} prophets. However, Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar (predestination). Ibn Hazm, al-Samaw'al and other scholars put forth the view that Uzair (or one of his disciples) falsified <b>the</b> <b>Torah,</b> and this claim became a common theme in Islamic polemics against the Bible. Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra, an apocryphal text which seems to have been partially known to Muslim readers.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Hurricane Katrina and the {{subsequent}} 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and Beth Israel garnered national attention after {{attempts were made to}} save its Torah scrolls. Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within a mile of Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls. The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued <b>the</b> <b>Torah</b> scrolls and their silver ornaments.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, in {{documents}} {{written in the}} paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nahmanides {{in his introduction to}} <b>the</b> <b>Torah.</b> Word division using spaces was commonly used {{from the beginning of the}} 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.|$|E
25|$|Rabbinic {{writings}} {{indicate that}} <b>the</b> Oral <b>Torah</b> {{was given to}} Moses at Mount Sinai, which, according to the tradition of Orthodox Judaism, occurred in 1312BC. The Orthodox rabbinic tradition holds that <b>the</b> Written <b>Torah</b> was recorded during the following forty years, though many non-Orthodox Jewish scholars affirm the modern scholarly consensus that <b>the</b> Written <b>Torah</b> has multiple authors and was written over centuries.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Torah's</b> {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to <b>the</b> <b>Torah's</b> entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in {{the very nature of}} things. And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbis of the Talmudic era {{conceived}} of <b>the</b> Oral <b>Torah</b> in two distinct ways. First, Rabbinic tradition {{conceived of}} <b>the</b> Oral <b>Torah</b> as an unbroken chain of transmission. The distinctive {{feature of this}} view was that Oral Torah was [...] "conveyed {{by word of mouth}} and memorized." [...] Second, the Rabbis also conceived of <b>the</b> Oral <b>Torah</b> as an interpretive tradition, and not merely as memorized traditions. In this view, <b>the</b> written <b>Torah</b> was seen as containing many levels of interpretation. It was left to later generations, who were steeped in the oral tradition of interpretation to discover those ("hidden") interpretations not revealed by Moses. Instead, Moses was obligated to impart the explanations orally to students, children, and fellow adults. It was thus forbidden to write and publish <b>the</b> Oral <b>Torah.</b>|$|R
