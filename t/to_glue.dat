Prof Dr Carl Clauberg injected chemicals into women's uteruses in an effort <b>to</b> <b>glue</b> them shut. Bayer, then a subsidiary of IG Farben, bought prisoners to use as research subjects for testing new drugs. Prisoners were also deliberately infected with spotted fever for vaccination research and exposed to toxic substances to study the effects.|$|E

25|$|How {{were the}} bricks stuck together? One {{hypothesis}} is that the builders at Mỹ Sơn developed a way <b>to</b> <b>glue</b> bricks together using tree resin native to central Vietnam. Another {{hypothesis is that}} the builders used a sticky mortar made from the same clay as the bricks themselves. The latter hypothesis is supported by chemical tests that have found no trace of any organic substance between the bricks, but instead have found mineral substances similar to those present {{in the core of}} the bricks. Today the mortar that once held the bricks together has largely decayed, and even a strong wind can knock loose bricks from the structures.|$|E
25|$|Males can be choosier than females. As an offering, {{males are}} capable of {{providing}} nuptial gifts secretions, which can be more expensive than female reproductive investment, parental care, where the reproductive costs in males are higher than in females because they invest large quantities of resources and time after egg fertilization, and foraging and nesting sites to the females. Moreover, these factors decrease their subsequent male reproductive opportunities, {{and the availability of}} males. An example of male parental care can be found in belostomatid water bugs, where the male, after fertilizing the eggs, allows the female <b>to</b> <b>glue</b> her eggs onto his back. He broods them until the nymphs hatch 2–4 weeks later. The eggs are large and reduce the ability of the male to fertilize other females and catch prey, and increases its predation risk.|$|E

500|$|The Mygalomorphae, {{which first}} {{appeared}} in the Triassic period, are generally heavily built and hairy, with large, robust chelicerae and fangs. Well-known examples include tarantulas, ctenizid trapdoor spiders and the Australasian funnel-web spiders. Most spend the majority of their time in burrows, and some run silk tripwires out from these, but a few build webs to capture prey. However, mygalomorphs cannot produce the pirifom silk that the Araneomorphae use as instant adhesive <b>to</b> <b>glue</b> silk to surfaces or to other strands of silk, and this makes web construction more difficult for mygalomorphs. Since mygalomorphs rarely [...] "balloon" [...] by using air currents for transport, their populations often form clumps. In addition to arthropods, mygalomorphs are capable of preying on frogs, small mammals, lizards, and snails.|$|E
500|$|The {{last six}} months of {{production}} were spent by Whyte [...] "trying <b>to</b> <b>glue</b> everything together so it made sense as an album." [...] This involved adding intros to some tracks and other motifs to [...] "make it make more sense". Whyte created around one hundred tracks for the album and whittled down the album to a final selection of fourteen. These tracks were sent {{back and forth between}} himself and Warp which Whyte described as a [...] "long process" [...] as he found it difficult having people critique the music he wanted to release. Prior to the release of Glass Swords and any single, Whyte released the EP Sunburst in 2010.

The chorus lines; [...] "Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight" [...] are sung in a very quick and breathless manner by Beyoncé. Bret McCabe noted that her pace could be {{compared to that of}} American singer Donna Summer.

Before the song ends, Beyoncé repeats the chorus lines four times as additional vocals of hers are played in the background.|$|E

Ultimately, a museum in Hollywood allowed the crew to film in a tree-filled section on its grounds. The episode ran into several snags during filming. Director Cliff Bole had trouble {{trying to get the}} crows to [...] "act on cue". Eventually, several ravens were brought in as doubles. Bole later noted, [...] "we got two ravens. One was very good at cawing and one was good at hopping." [...] The ending sequence had to be re-shot several times.

500|$|... "Window of Opportunity" [...] was {{the second}} Stargate SG-1 script by Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie, and their first episode to air. The writing duo's first script, [...] "Scorched Earth", would air three episodes later. Choosing [...] "Ad Infinitum" [...] as the episode's working title, Mallozzi and Mullie {{originally}} pitched [...] "Window of Opportunity" [...] as a darker story from the finished episode. SG-1 would encounter a world whose scientists work feverishly on preventing an imminent apocalypse, but after being {{unable to find a}} solution in time, they initiate a time loop that would trap the SG-1 team. Executive producer Brad Wright however noted the similarities to the [...] episode [...] "Cause and Effect", and writer Robert C. Cooper suggested a lighter direction similar to the feature film Groundhog Day, which O'Neill would briefly reference in the episode. To simplify continuity in the shooting process, Brad Wright encouraged chaos-theory-type fluctuations in the story as early as in the episode's concept meeting.

500|$|The {{following}} Australian {{season he}} became captain of New South Wales following {{the retirement of}} Kippax and the departure of Bradman to South Australia. However, with Australia touring South Africa in 193536, McCabe did not represent his state. However, he was made vice-captain to Vic Richardson for the tour, with Woodfull and Ponsford having retired, and Bradman ill. McCabe enjoyed more success, heading the Test batting figures with 420 runs at 84.00. After scoring 24, 65 and 29 in three warm-up matches, {{all of which were}} won by innings, McCabe hit 149 in the First Test at Durban, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 161 with Bill Brown in gale-force conditions which caused balls to make U-turns in the headwind, forced the umpires <b>to</b> <b>glue</b> the bails to the wickets using chewing gum, to set up a nine-wicket victory. In the following Test in Johannesburg, McCabe made 34 as Australia took a first innings lead of 93. However, Dudley Nourse scored 235 to help the hosts to 491; McCabe removed Nourse and ended with 2/30. Australia were set a Test world record target of 399 in the second innings to achieve victory on a turning wicket, and McCabe told captain Richardson {{that he would not be}} able to bat or run between wickets effectively because of altitude sickness. Regarding McCabe was his most important batsman, Richardson implored him to bat and told him to simply stand his ground and hit boundaries so that he would not have to run. McCabe joined Fingleton at 1/17 before taking the score to 1/85 by the end of the third day. The following morning in poor visibility on a wicket with irregular bounce and lateral deviation, McCabe resumed on 38 and scored a century in the morning session to reach lunch at 138, after Fingleton was dismissed at 2/194. The pair had put on 177 runs for the second wicket, and McCabe had done more than four fifths of the scoring. McCabe had reached his century in only 90 minutes, and continued on despite a storm that brought low dust clouds and hindered visibility, and increasingly irregular bounce and cut off the pitch. Midway through the afternoon, dark clouds gathered, along with thunderstorms and lightning, but this had no effect on the batsman. McCabe pushed the score to 2/274, and with only 125 runs needed with half the day remaining, Australia were on course to meet the target, having already scored 189 in the first half. However, Herbie Wade, the South African captain made an unprecedented appeal against the light due fear [...] "for the fieldsmen's safety" [...] in the face of McCabe's aggressive batting. He finished unbeaten on 189, an innings described by Fingleton as [...] "bordering on miraculous". McCabe struck 24 fours, and was productive square of the wicket, hitting numerous cut shots past point. Fingleton further added that “McCabe never put a foot or his bat in a false position”, and that he “pulverized the South African attack into the dust”. McCabe was unable to maintain such a standard of performance in the remaining three Tests; he scored a duck, 40 and one, as Australia won each by an innings. He ended the series with three wickets at 45.33. However, he scored consecutive centuries in the tour matches, adding 115 and 112 against Border and Orange Free State.|$|E
