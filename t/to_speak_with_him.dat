5|$|The Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to {{join their}} {{exhibition}} basketball squad. Russell, who was sensitive to any racial prejudice, was enraged {{by the fact that}} owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with Woolpert. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.|$|E
5|$|The group bring Tom back {{to their}} camp. Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) and Lourdes (Seychelle Gabriel) operate on Tom. While Tom is in surgery, flashbacks appear, filling in the gaps of his 3 month departure. He is {{apparently}} tortured by the alien “Overlords” while on the spaceship. Later, the Overlords wish <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> They communicate through Karen (Jessy Schram), who was once part of the 2nd Mass. It tells Tom about a “Neutral Zone”, in which survivors can live in peace – detained in a camp run by The Overlords. Tom quickly realizes that negotiation with their invaders {{is out of the}} question, and he immediately refuses. He attacks a nearby Skitter and is knocked unconscious in the process.|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating that she was able <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E
60|$|But {{before he}} {{departed}} he solicited {{an interview with}} the Dominie. The poor man appeared, on being informed a gentleman wanted <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>with</b> some expression of surprise in his gaunt features, to which recent sorrow had given an expression yet more grisly. He made two or three profound reverences to Mannering, and then, standing erect, patiently waited an explanation of his commands.|$|R

The lieutenants then retired, and Jack was left alone with the captain, who signified that he wished <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> further <b>with</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
25|$|On September 9, Abbadon, {{the leader}} of the rebellion, invited Gaius into the {{fortress}} <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> It proved to be a trick, and Gaius was wounded in the confrontation. He had to be carried away by his outraged lieutenants. His forces promptly laid siege to the city and captured the fortress after intense fighting. At first the wound did not seem serious {{and he was able to}} complete the pacification of Armenia, a relatively easy task.|$|E
25|$|Blue Horse’s {{twin brother}} Big Mouth was the elder and became head chief in 1864 upon {{the death of}} Old Chief Smoke. Big Mouth opposed Spotted Tail’s {{leadership}} and criticized his negotiations with Washington politicians. On October 29, 1869, Spotted Tail called {{at the door of}} Big Mouth’s lodge, and asked <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> On his appearance, he was seized by two warriors, who held him fast, while Spotted Tail drew a pistol, placed it against his body, and shot Big Mouth dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{night the}} King collapsed, {{she refused to}} be left alone with him and {{successfully}} insisted that she be given her own bedroom. When the doctor, Warren, was called, she was not informed and was not given the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> When told by the Prince of Wales that the King was to be removed to Kew, but that she should move to Queens House or Windsor, she successfully insisted that she accompany her spouse to Kew. However, she and her daughters were taken to Kew separately from the King and lived secluded from him during his illness. They regularly visited him, but the visits tended to be uncomfortable, as he had a tendency to embrace them and refuse to let them go.|$|E

25|$|In April 2004, {{shortly before}} 2004 election, Robinson {{admitted}} to the theft of an expensive ring from a public auction site. He turned himself in to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and returned the ring shortly after police visited his home and office, wishing <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> While the auction company publicly stated {{that they did not}} wish to pursue charges, Robinson was charged and pleaded guilty. The Crown and defense agreed that he was undergoing major personal stress and mental health issues at the time; Robinson was given a discharge, meaning that he would have no criminal record, but he volunteered for some time at the Burnaby Wildlife Centre as part of a public service commitment. He terminated his candidacy and was replaced by his longtime constituency assistant Bill Siksay, who won the election.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{within a}} matter of hours, the French retake and then lose the city of Rouen. After the battle, Bedford dies, and Talbot assumes direct command of the army. The Dauphin is horrified at the loss of Rouen, but Joan tells him not to worry. She then persuades the {{powerful}} Duke of Burgundy, who had been fighting for the English, to switch sides, and join the French. Meanwhile, Henry arrives in Paris and upon learning of Burgundy's betrayal, he sends Talbot <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Henry then pleads for Richard and Somerset to put aside their conflict, and, unaware of the implications of his actions, he chooses a red rose, symbolically aligning himself with Somerset and alienating Richard. Prior to returning to England, in an effort to secure peace between Somerset and Richard, Henry places Richard in command of the infantry and Somerset in command of the cavalry. Meanwhile, Talbot approaches Bordeaux, but the French army swings around and traps him. Talbot sends word for reinforcements, but the conflict between Richard and Somerset leads them to second guess one another, and neither of them send any, both blaming the other for the mix-up. The English army is subsequently destroyed, and both Talbot and his son are killed.|$|E
25|$|Woodwind and harp {{accompany}} a pensive {{version of}} the 'Dmitriy Motif'. The Pretender dreams of an assignation with Marina {{in the garden of}} her father's castle. However, to his annoyance, Rangoni finds him. He brings news that Marina longs for him and wishes <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> The Pretender resolves to throw himself at Marina's feet, begging her to be his wife and Tsaritsa. He entreats Rangoni to lead him to Marina. Rangoni, however, first begs the Pretender to consider him a father, allowing him to follow his every step and thought. Despite his mistrust of Rangoni, the Pretender agrees not to part from him if he will only let him see Marina. Rangoni convinces the Pretender to hide as the Polish nobles emerge from the castle dancing a polonaise (Polonaise). Marina flirts, dancing with an older man. The Poles sing of taking the Muscovite throne, defeating the army of Boris, and capturing him. They return to the castle. The Pretender comes out of hiding, cursing Rangoni. He resolves to abandon wooing Marina and begin his march on Moscow. But then Marina appears and calls to him. He is lovesick. She, however, only wants to know when he will be Tsar, and declares she can only be seduced by a throne and a crown. The Pretender kneels at her feet. She rejects his advances, and, attempting to spur him to action, dismisses him, calling him a lackey. Having reached his limit, he tells her he will depart the next day to lead his army to Moscow and to his father's throne. Furthermore, as Tsar he will take pleasure in watching her come crawling back looking for her own lost throne, and will command everyone to laugh at her. She quickly reverses course, tells him she adores him, and they sing a duet ("O Tsarevich, I implore you"). Rangoni observes the amorous couple from afar, and, joining them in a brief trio, cynically rejoices in his victory.|$|E

500|$|After {{the meeting}} ended, Lynch pursued Aqil <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> alone. He showed him {{his sword and}} revolver, which Aqil {{examined}} and declared to be the [...] "Devil's invention". Lynch described the weaponry {{at the disposal of}} his men and asked Aqil if he thought it sufficient to make the journey to the Jordan, and Aqil replied that, [...] "You will, if anyone can." [...] Lynch later secured Aqil's accompaniment on the trip to the Dead Sea, through the intervention of an ex-Sharif of Mecca, describing the latter as [...] "our counsellor, sagacious and prudent," [...] and Aqil as, [...] "the bold warrior and the admirable scout." [...] Aqil and his Beni Sakhr allies quashed a party of 'Adwan Bedouin tribesmen when they attempted to rob Lynch's party. Lynch's record of Aqil's feat made him well known in Europe.|$|E
500|$|Romney held {{a series}} of Governor's Conferences, which sought to find new ideas from public {{services}} professionals and community activists who attended. [...] He opened his office in the Michigan State Capitol to visitors, spending five minutes with every citizen who wanted <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> on Thursday mornings, and was always sure to shake the hands of schoolchildren visiting the capitol. [...] He almost always eschewed political activities on Sunday, the Mormon Sabbath. [...] His blunt and unequivocal manner sometimes caused friction, and family members and associates used the idiom [...] "bull in a china shop" [...] to describe him. [...] He took a theatrical approach to governance, staging sudden appearances in settings where he might be politically unwelcome. One former aide later said that willful was too weak a word to describe him, and chose messianic instead. [...] Romney saw a moral dimension in every issue and his political views were held with as much fervor as religious ones; writer Theodore H. White said [...] "the first quality that surfaced, as one met and talked with George Romney over a number of years, was a sincerity so profound that, in conversation, one was almost embarrassed." ...|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between November 2 and December 23, 1981. The plants used in the gardening scenes were brought inside at night {{to keep them from}} freezing. Due to the tight schedule, the cast and crew worked seven days a week with very long hours each day. Although the Australian filmmakers and the crew, who were mostly from Dallas, got along very well {{both on and off the}} set, Beresford and Duvall were at odds during the production. Beresford, in his usual approach, meticulously planned each scene, and Duvall, who preferred a free-form give-and-take on set, felt restricted by the director's methods. Although Duvall regularly acknowledged his talent as a director, he said of Beresford, [...] "He has this dictatorial way of doing things with me that just doesn't cut it. Man, I have to have my freedom." [...] Although he had no problem with Duvall's acting methodology, the actor's temperament infuriated Beresford. While filming one scene with Harper and Barkin, he became so frustrated during a phone conversation with Duvall that he said, [...] "Well if you want to direct the film, go right ahead," [...] and walked off the set. Beresford flew to New York and reportedly was ready to quit, until Duvall flew out <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> After further arguments, the two made amends and returned to work on the film.|$|E

If Rachel had been away, she would have appealed to his mercy, and have thrown herself, in the spirit, on her knees before him. But she could not do this in Rachel's presence.|$|R
