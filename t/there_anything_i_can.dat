500|$|The occupying forces {{apparently}} presumed Princess Andrew was pro-German, {{as one of}} her sons-in-law, Prince Christoph of Hesse, was {{a member}} of the NSDAP and the Waffen-SS, and another, Berthold, Margrave of Baden, had been invalided out of the German army in 1940 after an injury in France. Nonetheless, when visited by a German general who asked her, [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you?", she replied, [...] "You can take your troops out of my country." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing the {{diagnosis}} as an [...] "embuggerance" [...] {{in a radio}} interview, Pratchett appealed to people to [...] "keep things cheerful" [...] and proclaimed that [...] "we are taking it fairly philosophically down here and possibly with a mild optimism." [...] He stated {{he felt he had}} time for [...] "at least a few more books yet", and added that while he understood the impulse to ask [...] "is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do?", in this case he would only entertain such offers from [...] "very high-end experts in brain chemistry." [...] Discussing his diagnosis at the Bath Literature Festival in early 2008, Pratchett revealed that by then he found it too difficult to write dedications when signing books. In his later years Pratchett wrote by dictating to his assistant, Rob Wilkins, or by using speech recognition software.|$|E

[...] "No, no, don't get up," [...] {{he added}} hurriedly, for {{she had tried to}} rise and {{obviously}} was still unable to stand, [...] "just stay where you are, and I'll come and sit near you. Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to help you?" ...|$|E
60|$|FATHER DEMPSEY. I'll say good-night, Mr Broadbent. If <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{do for you}} in this parish, let me know. [He shakes {{hands with}} Broadbent].|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do, I'm sure I'd do it: if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> at all {{you wish}} done.--Would {{you like to}} come up to the house again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you speak}} so, Miss," [...] said Bob, {{grasping}} {{the skin of}} Mumps's neck; [...] "if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you, I should look upon it as a day's earnings." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{gave the}} {{vice-consul}} another pause. At {{the end of}} it he got to his feet. [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you, Miss Claxon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Paul Ruttledge. [Gets {{down from}} his bin.] But you have not told me what you have come here for? Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you, young gentleman? Shall I {{make you}} a pair of slippers, or perhaps' with a smile--'a case for your nose?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>there’s</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do," [...] said Fraser, awkwardly, [...] "or {{be of use}} to you in any way, I hope you’ll let me know—Flower told me {{you were}} all alone, and—" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to {{help the}} thing along, you may count me in," [...] Walters replied, {{and the other members}} of the company who heard the remark pledged {{themselves}} to the same thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't--I can't say I like it, but--" [...] With a burst {{which left}} him feeling large and shining with generosity, [...] "it's {{none of my}} darn business! I'll do <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> for you, if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a lucky escape, Master Aylmer, if one {{can call}} luck what is due to thought and quickness. Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very sorry," [...] he said. [...] "Still, you see, {{you left}} me no {{other means of}} {{stopping}} you. Now, is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, thank you," [...] said I. [...] "I {{have only}} {{waited to see}} that you have {{everything}} you want. Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> order for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't suppose Mrs. Strickland {{wants to}} be bothered with me just now," [...] I said. [...] "Will you tell her how sorry <b>I</b> am? If <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do. <b>I</b> shall be delighted to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{let me know}} if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to help you. We're {{acquainted with}} two or three of your {{engineering}} faculty at the Office. They write in about various things. Do you happen to know Dr. Philgren?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind what}} I think," [...] he said, a little impatiently; [...] "if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{do to help}} you in your trouble I'll do it, but of course <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do nothing unless you {{tell me all about}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Good for him." [...] He {{regarded}} her pleasantly and frankly. [...] "But about yourself? Isn't <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you? Something IS the matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|The man at {{the machine}} looked up, and pleasantly answered: [...] "It is, but the Supervisor is not in yet. Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Austin {{looked at}} him quietly. [...] "I'm afraid I really haven't the faculty of being in two places at once. Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|These two ardent souls confronted {{each other}} in absorbed silence with keener perception, with new daring, with new intimacy, till he {{recalled}} himself with effort. [...] "You must {{let me help you}} if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do. Remember, I'm your big brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I {{hope you}} won't mind my being frank--I've been so worried. It's an unhappy position, isn't it?" [...] Gyp did not answer, and she hurried on. [...] "If <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to help, I {{should be so}} glad--it must be horrid for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They speak Spanish here," [...] {{said the}} consul. [...] "You'll need an interpreter. If <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do, why, I'd be delighted. If you're buying fruit lands or {{looking for a}} {{concession}} of any sort, you'll want somebody who knows the ropes {{to look out for}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At least," [...] said Father Tiebout, [...] "we both foresaw {{the result}} of it. But {{you have had a}} long march. Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> offer you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{must say}} I'm much obliged, and I'm glad you came," [...] {{announced}} the beast. [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do {{in return for}} your kindness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{sufficiently}} thank you, Heysham," [...] I {{said when}} we shook hands. [...] "Now, advise me about those cattle; and is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm not {{inclined}} to be cross-examined,' he burst out, suddenly making up his mind to be angry. 'As a surgeon I daresay your knowledge of cardiac diseases is neither extensive nor peculiar. But {{this was a very}} simple case, and everything was done that was possible. <b>I</b> don't think <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It 's {{five days}} since I {{came out of}} hospital," [...] muttered the little Frenchman, tapping on his chest; [...] "a crisis of this bad atmosphere. I live here, shut up in a box; it does me harm, being from the South. If <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you, monsieur, it will give me pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{shall have}} to see Soames. If <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you I'm always at your service. You must {{think of me as}} a wretched {{substitute}} for my father. At all events I'll let you know what happens when I speak to Soames. He may supply the material himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} {{that you have been}} of some service to these people; and they're my daughter's friends," [...] he said. [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Henry {{turned to}} Mrs. Ferrari as the lawyer closed the door. 'I {{have heard of}} your trouble, Emily, from Miss Lockwood. Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to help you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As you like. Wait a moment." [...] Ferris {{wrote the}} address. [...] "There," [...] he said, {{giving it to}} her; [...] "but isn't <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{get you on}} the train," [...] Downs promised. [...] "I can {{do as much as}} {{that for}} you, anyway. I'll stop and go on to the station with you from here. I'm very sorry about this, Hobson," [...] he continued, {{fingering}} the dispatch. [...] "We shall have to get right along to the station, but if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do after you've left, command me." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had given}} him her hand for good-bye, and he thus for a moment did keep her. Something then, while he seemed to think if <b>there</b> were <b>anything</b> more, came back to him; though {{something}} of which there wasn't too much to be made. [...] "Of course if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do for your friend: I mean the gentleman you speak of--?" [...] He gave out in short that he was ready.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't rub it in,' pleaded Beverley. 'It isn't fair. There's nobody so {{sensitive}} as a reformed floor-knocker. You {{will come up}} or let me come down, won't you? Whenever I have that sad, depressed feeling, I go out and kill a policeman. But you wouldn't care for that. So the only {{thing for you to}} do is to knock on the ceiling. Then I'll come charging down and see if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to help.' ...|$|R
