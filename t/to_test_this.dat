5|$|In {{testing the}} {{transmitter}} proved only barely suitable in the air-to-air role, with short detection ranges {{due to its}} relatively low power. But to everyone's surprise, {{it was able to}} easily pick out the wharves and cranes at the Harwich docks a few miles south of Bawdsey. Shipping appeared as well, but the team was unable <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>this</b> very well as the Heyford was forbidden to fly over water. After this success, Bowen was granted two Avro Anson patrol aircraft, K6260 and K8758, along with five pilots stationed at Martlesham <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>this</b> ship-detection role. Early tests demonstrated a problem with noise from the ignition system interfering with the receiver, but this was soon resolved by fitters at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE).|$|E
5|$|Typically, Othnielosaurus {{has been}} {{interpreted}} like other hypsilophodonts as a small, swift herbivore, although Bakker (1986) interpreted the possibly related Nanosaurus as an omnivore. This idea has had some unofficial support, but little in the formal literature; description of more complete skull remains will be needed <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>this</b> hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>test</b> <b>this</b> hypothesis, {{researchers}} {{examined how}} each species utilized the host ants. The M. schencki, M. sabuleti are parasitized by P. rebeli while the M. salina and M. vandeli are parasitized by the P. alcon. The M. scabrinodis is parasitized {{by both the}} P. rebeli and the P. alcon; however, the P. alcon is {{far more likely to}} parasitize M. scabrinodis than the P. rebeli. Researchers found that in general, P. alcon was far more likely to parasitize the host ant than P. rebeli; however, ant nests that supported the P. alcon were much smaller and supported lower populations than ant nests that supported P. rebeli.|$|E

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>test</b> <b>this</b> idea he {{surveyed}} hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but {{he planned to}} show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing {{that there was an}} astronomical intent to the orientation of {{at least some of the}} alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two solstices, the two equinoxes and four cross-quarter days, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar. While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{crystallize}} in {{the diamond}} cubic crystal system (space group Fdm) and consist of tetrahedrally, covalently bonded carbon atoms. A second form called lonsdaleite, with hexagonal symmetry, {{has also been}} found, but it is extremely rare and forms only in meteorites or in laboratory synthesis. The local environment of each atom is identical in the two structures. From theoretical considerations, lonsdaleite {{is expected to be}} harder than diamond, but the size and quality of the available stones are insufficient <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>this</b> hypothesis. In terms of crystal habit, diamonds occur most often as euhedral (well-formed) or rounded octahedra and twinned, flattened octahedra with a triangular outline. Other forms include dodecahedra and (rarely) cubes. There is evidence that nitrogen impurities {{play an important role in}} the formation of well-shaped euhedral crystals. The largest diamonds found, such as the Cullinan Diamond, were shapeless. These diamonds are pure (i.e. type II) and therefore contain little if any nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change {{that is going to be}} made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>this</b> technology.|$|E

5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces {{regional}} manager Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{that he needs}} to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.). Jim designs several Dwight-oriented challenges as tryouts for the position, and it is inevitably found that Dwight is the most qualified. Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) is forced to bring her child, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, upon overhearing that Phillip has been eating the type of paper which he himself regards as the most flavorful, begins to think that Angela's son is actually his. <b>To</b> <b>test</b> <b>this</b> theory, Dwight offers the child either a check for one million dollars or a beet; Phillip picks the beet. Dwight tells Angela that he will marry her if the child is his, but she denies that this is the case. Dwight then confers with Jim, asking whether he should propose to Angela or his girlfriend Esther, who he thinks is the more logical choice. Jim tells Dwight {{that he needs to}} put aside logic and follow his instincts. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela finally reveals to Dwight that Phillip is indeed his son, explaining that she lied about his parentage in order to test Dwight's feelings for her.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man and LindowIII {{were found}} to have {{elevated}} levels of copper on their skin. The cause for this was uncertain as there could have been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al. proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment. <b>To</b> <b>test</b> <b>this,</b> skin samples were taken from places likely to be painted and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al. may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors. Similarly, green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found {{to be the result of}} a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the acid of the peat bog.|$|E

She wants <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>this</b> theory by having a woman conceive off the island, but Ben refuses to let anyone off the island. When Juliet tells him that nothing else can be done and asks {{to go home and}} be with her sister, Ben informs Juliet that her sister's cancer has come back.
