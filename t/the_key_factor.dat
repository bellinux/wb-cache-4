40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. Little {{research}} {{has yet been}} undertaken in South Africa about commercial banks that are servicing the microenterprise market. The objective for the current research was to investigate <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> {{that should be considered}} by commercial banks in South Africa servicing the microenterprise market. The focus for the study was on identifying <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> and on investigating how <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> were being considered. There are a number of case studies documenting <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> that international commercial banks have considered. However, in South Africa, there are relatively few documented cases, which rightfully confirms that commercial banks providing microfinance to microentrepreneurs are still in a new line of business that is in its early developmental stages. The first part of the current study aimed to identify <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> that required consideration, which have been well documented in a number of research reports. The focus was also laid on international commercial banks that offered microfinance services, especially to microenterprises. The intention was to obtain an overview of how international banks have considered <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> concerned. <b>The</b> second part of the research study aimed to see how South African commercial banks have considered <b>the</b> above-mentioned <b>key</b> <b>factors,</b> using Absa and Capitec banks as case studies. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> identified are <b>the</b> following: the operating model; the delivery model; institutional commitment; product development; funding; technical assistance; human resource (recruitment, retention and remuneration); and operations (credit methodology; loan appraisals; lending methodology; collections; branch network; and support services). The international commercial banks whose case studies are reviewed include: Banco do Nordeste; Bank Rakyat Indonesia; the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe; the Cooperative Bank of Kenya; Banque du Caire; the Agricultural Bank of Mongolia; Hatton National Bank; the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India; and Banco de la Empressa. From the case studies it was seen that some of the commercial banks considered certain factors more than others. The other differentiating <b>factor</b> is how <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> were considered, because the operating context of the different commercial banks differs. In South Africa, Absa and Capitec Bank have also considered <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors,</b> however, <b>the</b> operating model and the delivery model are the biggest differentiator as to how the other factors are considered...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reliability of}} traffic noise measurement techniques and the noise estimates in Hong Kong. A simulation model making use of the Monte Carlo technique is devised to incorporate the uncertainty in traffic noise estimates in Hong Kong. Traffic flow, traffic speed and traffic composition (in terms of percentage of heavy vehicles) are identified as <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> influencing <b>the</b> generation of traffic noise. The new equations for estimating the noise descriptors L 10, Leq, L 50 and L 90 were calibrated {{on the basis of}} the Hong Kong survey results. The effects of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> on traffic noise estimates can be assessed. The probability distribution for each of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> is derived with the use of the survey data. The variation on <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> is due to the sampling error in the survey. The reliability of the traffic noise estimates is obtained from the combined probability distributions of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factors.</b> <b>The</b> reliability analysis gives the traffic noise estimates with a particular probability or vice versa.

5|$|Between 15 and 20 August, the U.S. {{carriers}} {{covered the}} delivery of fighter and bomber aircraft to the newly opened Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. This small, hard-won airfield was a critical point in the entire island chain, and both military sides strategically considered that control of the airbase offered potential control of the local battle area airspace. In fact, Henderson Field and the aircraft based upon it soon resulted in telling effects on the movement of Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands and in the attrition of Japanese air forces in the South Pacific Area. Historically, Allied control of Henderson Field became <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factor</b> in the entire battle for Guadalcanal.|$|E

5|$|What {{followed}} next is {{not entirely}} clear, but Heraclius certainly won a crushing victory over Shahrbaraz {{in the fall of}} 622. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>factor</b> was Heraclius' discovery of Persian forces hidden in ambush and responding by feigning retreat during the battle. The Persians left their cover to chase the Byzantines, whereupon Heraclius' elite Optimatoi assaulted the pursuing Persians, causing them to flee. Thus he saved Anatolia from the Persians. Heraclius had to return to Constantinople, however, to deal with the threat posed to his Balkan domains by the Avars, so he left his army to winter in Pontus.|$|E

5|$|The moral {{defense of}} the attacks on Japanese cities rests on an {{argument}} that they saved lives by shortening the war. The USSBS concluded {{that the effects of}} strategic bombing and blockade would have forced Japan to surrender by the end of 1945 even if atomic bombs had not been used and the Soviet Union had remained neutral. Historian E. Bartlett Kerr supported this assessment, and argued that the firebombing of Japan's major cities was <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factor</b> motivating Hirohito's decision to end the war. American historian Barrett Tillman has also written that area attacks were unavoidable because, owing to the limitations of their bombsight and the high winds common over Japan, the B-29s were incapable of bombing individual targets without also causing widespread damage to surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{predicted}} differences between unbinilium and the other alkaline earth metals is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. The SO interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster—at velocities comparable to the speed of light—than those in lighter atoms. In unbinilium atoms, it lowers the 7p and 8s electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, {{but two of the}} 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The effect is called subshell splitting, as it splits the 7p subshell into more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. Thus, the outer 8s electrons of unbinilium are stabilized and become harder to remove than expected, while the 7p3/2 electrons are correspondingly destabilized, perhaps allowing them to participate in chemical reactions. This stabilization of the outermost s-orbital (already significant in radium) is <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>factor</b> affecting unbinilium's chemistry, and causes all the trends for atomic and molecular properties of alkaline earth metals to reverse direction after barium.|$|E
