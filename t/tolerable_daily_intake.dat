As cumulative poisons, consumption of Pb and Cd in contaminated rice may cause many toxic effects in humans. In the present study, Pb and Cd levels in rice samples from Hubei, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang, and Guangdong provinces in China were analyzed by cloud point extraction and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). The heavy metals in the rice samples were reacted with 8 -quinolinol to form a complex at pH 9. 0 and 40 °C. Analytes were quantitatively extracted to a surfactant-rich phase (Triton X- 45) after centrifugation and analyzed by GFAAS. The effects of experimental conditions, including pH, concentration of reagents, and equilibration time and temperature, on cloud point extraction were optimized efficiently using Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken experimental designs. Under the optimum conditions, good linearity was observed in the concentration ranges of 0. 5 - 5 µg/L for Pb and 0. 05 - 0. 50 µg/L for Cd. The limits of detection were 0. 043 µg/L for Pb with a concentration factor of 24. 2 in a 10 mL sample and 0. 018 µg/L for Cd with a concentration factor of 18. 4 in a 10 mL sample.

Screening-level chemical risk assessment evaluations consider both exposure and hazard. Exposures are increasingly being evaluated through biomonitoring studies in humans.
