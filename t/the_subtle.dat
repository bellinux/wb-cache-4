5|$|Among {{his famous}} {{drawings}} are the Vitruvian Man, {{a study of}} the proportions of the human body; the Head of an Angel, for The Virgin of the Rocks in the Louvre; a botanical study of Star of Bethlehem; and a large drawing (160×100cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist in the National Gallery, London. This drawing employs <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of the Mona Lisa. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to The Virgin and Child with St. Anne in the Louvre.|$|E

5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|When {{hiding in}} the dark is a {{gameplay}} element, light and shadow become important parts of the level design. Usually the player is able to disable certain light sources. Stealth games also emphasize the audio design when players {{must be able to}} hear <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> sound effects that may alert enemies to their actions; noise will often vary as the player walks on different surfaces such as wood or metal. Players who move recklessly will make more noise and attract more attention.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading {{the federal government and the}} people of Florida that <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|Core Design's Fighting Force (1997) was {{anticipated}} {{to redefine the}} genre for 32-bit consoles through its use of a 3D environment. However, it was met with a lukewarm reception. The Dynasty Warriors series, beginning with Dynasty Warriors 2 in 2000, offered traditional beat 'em up action on large 3D battlefields, displaying dozens of characters on the screen at a time. The series to date spans 14 games (including expansions) which players in the West view as overly similar, although the games' creators claim their large audience in Japan appreciates <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> differences between the titles. While critics saw Dynasty Warriors 2 as innovative and technically impressive, they held a mixed opinion of later titles. These later games received praise for simple, enjoyable gameplay but were simultaneously derided as overly simplistic and repetitive. Another best-selling Japanese series, Yakuza, combined elaborate plots and detailed interactive environments with street brawling action. Despite these releases, game reviewers started to pronounce that the genre had died off. By 2002, there were virtually no new beat 'em ups being released in arcades.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> {{variations}} between {{specimens of}} pteranodontid from the Niobrara Formation, most researchers have assigned {{all of them}} to the single genus Pteranodon, in at least two species (P. longiceps and P. sternbergi) distinguished mainly by the shape of the crest. However, the classification of these two forms has varied from researcher to researcher. In 1972, Halsey Wilkinson Miller published a paper arguing that the various forms of Pteranodon were different enough to be placed in distinct subgenera. He named these Pteranodon (Occidentalia) occidentalis (for the now-disused species P. occidentalis) and Pteranodon (Sternbergia) sternbergi. However, the name Sternbergia was preoccupied, and in 1978 Miller re-named the species Pteranodon (Geosternbergia) sternbergi, and named a third subgenus/species combination for P. longiceps, as Pteranodon (Longicepia) longiceps. Most prominent pterosaur researchers of the late 20th century however, including S. Christopher Bennett and Peter Wellnhofer, did not adopt these subgeneric names, and continued to place all pteranodont species into the single genus Pteranodon.|$|E

This enables us to access <b>the</b> <b>subtlest</b> level of mental activity (clear light, [...] od-gsal) and use it for the nonconceptual cognition of voidness - the immediate cause for the omniscient mind of a Buddha. We use <b>the</b> <b>subtlest</b> level of energy-wind, which supports clear light mental activity, to arise {{in the form of}} an illusory body (sgyu-lus) as the immediate cause for the network of form bodies (Skt. rupakaya) of a Buddha.|$|R
5|$|In 1994 Tony Hall, {{the head}} of the BBC's News and Current Affairs, argued that the {{restrictions}} did not allow viewers to make a proper judgment about those subject to the rules, as <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> changes to their voices could not be heard. In particular he cited the example of the appearance of Gerry Adams on the BBC's On the Record in September 1993, in which he spoke about the prospect of peace in Northern Ireland. Hall said Adams was nervous and defensive throughout the interview as the presenter, Sheena McDonald, argued that peace could not be achieved while the IRA continued its violent stance, but that viewers were unaware of these aspects of the discussion. He also said that some countries, such as India and Egypt, had quoted the restrictions to BBC journalists who complained about the over use of censorship by authorities in those countries. Additionally Hall argued that Sinn Féin and the IRA had manipulated the ban by using it as an excuse to decline interviews.|$|E
5|$|In Tantra, {{the fifty}} or fifty-one letters {{including}} vowels {{as well as}} consonants from A to Ksha, of the Devanagari alphabet itself, the Varnamala of bija, {{have been described as}} being the Matrikas themselves. It is believed that they are infused with the power of the Divine Mother herself. The Matrikas are considered to be <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> form of the letters (varna). These letters combined make up syllables (pada) which are combined to make sentences (vakya) and it is of these elements that mantra is composed. It is believed that the power of mantra derives {{from the fact that the}} letters of the alphabet are in fact forms of the goddess. The 50 Matrika Kalas are given in the same account as follows: Nivritti, Pratishtha, Vidya, Shanti, Indhika, Dipika, Mochika, Para, Sukshma, Sukshmamrita, Jnanamrita, Apypayani, Vyapini, Vyomarupa, Ananta, Srishti, Riddhi, Smriti, Medha, Kanti, Lakshmi, Dyuti, Sthira, Sthiti, Siddhi, Jada, Palini, Shanti, Aishvarya, Rati, Kamika, Varada, Ahladini, Pritih, Dirgha, Tikshna, Raudri, Bhaya, Nidra, Tadra, Kshudha, Krodhini, Kriya, Utkari, Mrityurupa, Pita, Shveta, Asita, Ananta. Sometimes, the Matrikas represent a diagram written in the letter, believed to possess magical powers.|$|E
5|$|The most manifestly {{cyclical}} work of {{the three}} sonatas is the Sonata in A major. In the sonata's scherzo, a joyous passage in C major is suddenly interrupted by a fierce downward rushing scale in C-sharp minor, which closely recalls a parallel passage at {{the climax of the}} preceding movement; this is followed in the scherzo by a dance theme whose melody is derived from the Andantino's opening melody. This unique moment {{is one of the most}} explicit, audible cyclic references in the sonata trilogy. Another important cyclic element in the A major Sonata is <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> similarities and connections that exist between each movement's ending and the following movement's opening; the connection between the opening and ending of the sonata as a whole, is even bolder: the sonata ends in a cancrizans of its opening, a framing device which is probably unprecedented in the sonata literature.|$|E
50|$|According to Buddhaghosa, {{the above}} {{ordering}} {{of the four}} types of clinging {{is in terms of}} decreasing grossness, that is, from the most obvious (grossest) type of clinging (sense-pleasure clinging) to <b>the</b> <b>subtlest</b> (self-doctrine clinging).|$|R

5|$|Verses 12.23–31 {{state that}} the lingasharira, which is <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> body that is not visible, glistens in the central region of the body or the heart or the forehead. This shining Shakti (force, energy, power), {{translates}} Bhattacharya, is realised by the knower of Brahman through his concentrated vision. Atman is perceived when the mind located {{in the space between}} the eyebrows, becomes free of all distractions and activities. In this state, the yogin becomes aware of self within, and in the sages, in siddhas and others. If dissolution of the mind in the space between the eye brows does not occur, the yogin should envision absolute bliss, alternatively the full moon inside the mouth. This helps the mind dissolve away distractions and activity, helping it reside in Vishnupada or the Akasha (sky), and brings the yogin closer to moksha or liberation. This is a stage where the feeling of liberation and bliss begins to emerge, the goal of the practice of yoga.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} planes belong to <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> sphere, the fourth {{is on the}} {{threshold}} between <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> and the mental spheres and the fifth and sixth planes are in the mental sphere. The first plane starts from {{the threshold of the}} gross and <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> sphere. The soul here starts experiencing subtle phenomena simultaneously through its gross and subtle senses. It starts hearing subtle sounds and smelling subtle scents, although their nature is far different from their gross equivalents. Eventually it starts perceiving <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> world through its subtle body and so comes to the second plane. Here the soul becomes aware of infinite energy and can perform minor miracles, like stopping moving objects or filling dried wells with fresh water. Being not conscious of the gross world its experience gives rise only to subtle impressions of the sights, scents and sounds of <b>the</b> <b>subtle</b> world. Further involution of consciousness makes the soul experience the third plane. Here the soul can use more aspects of the infinite energy by performing greater miracles, such as giving sight to the blind, or restoring maimed limbs.|$|E
