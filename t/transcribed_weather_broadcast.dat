Of concern to the general aviation industry are: (1) {{the slow pace of}} getting units of the Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) to the field; (2) the efforts of the National Weather Service to withdraw from both the observation and dissemination roles of the aviation weather system; (3) the need for more observation points to improve the accuracy of terminal and area forecasts; (4) the need for improvements in all area forecasts, terminal forecasts, and winds aloft forecasts; (5) slow progress in cockpit weather displays; (6) the erosion of <b>transcribed</b> <b>weather</b> <b>broadcasts</b> (TWEB) and other deficiencies in weather information dissemination; (7) the need to push to make the Direct User Access Terminal (DUAT) a reality; and (7) the need to improve severe weather (thunderstorm) warning systems...|$|R

50|$|<b>Weather</b> {{information}} is <b>broadcast</b> in both official languages which is English first then French. <b>Weather</b> alert <b>broadcasts</b> are inserted within the normal playlist, {{and are available}} in both official languages. Marine forecasts are broadcast, though on a limited schedule. Most marine forecasts are broadcast on the marine frequency, which is not available on most weather radios. One requires a special receiver capable of receiving the marine frequency, which varies by province. Environment Canada formerly broadcast a full marine forecast which included marine alerts; this has since changed between 2007 and 2009. <b>Weather</b> <b>broadcasts</b> also include the UV index for the forecasted day, and for the following day during the UV index season. The index runs from 1 (low) to 10 (extreme).|$|R
40|$|In {{a typical}} <b>weather</b> <b>broadcast,</b> {{observed}} daily temperature {{information such as}} maximum and minimum temperatures are shown and compared to the daily average or “normal”. Such information, however, does not accurately describe {{whether or not that}} particular day is fairly typical for that time of year or truly an unusual occurrence. Thus it is suggested that the presentation of temperature information can be augmented with elementary statistical information in order to give a more meaningful presentation of temperature information without the need to explain the basis of such statistical information. A study of the climatological maximum and minimum temperatures over a 30 -year period for Columbia, Missouri is performed in order to provide the rationale for displaying a "typical" temperature range. This information was incorporated into television <b>weather</b> <b>broadcasts</b> at KOMU TV- 8, which is the campus television station and local NBC affiliate...|$|R
