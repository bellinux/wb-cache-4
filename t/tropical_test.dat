Here, acute effects of the photosystem II-inhibiting herbicides diuron, tebuthiuron, atrazine, simazine, and hexazinone, herbicide breakdown products (desethyl-atrazine (DEA) and 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA)) and binary mixtures, were investigated using three tropical benthic microalgae; Navicula sp. and Cylindrotheca closterium (Ochrophyta) and Nephroselmis pyriformis (Chlorophyta), and one standard test species, Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Ochrophyta), in a high-throughput Maxi-Imaging-PAM bioassay (Maxi-IPAM). The order of toxicity was; diuron > hexazinone > tebuthiuron > atrazine > simazine > DEA > 3, 4 -DCA for all species. The tropical green alga N. pyriformis was up to 10 -fold more sensitive than the diatoms tested here and reported for coral symbionts, and is recommended as a standard <b>tropical</b> <b>test</b> species for future research.

40|$|Abstract. Databases of {{spaceborne}} SAR imagery {{from three}} different types of forest have been compiled {{for the study of}} the relationship between SAR backscatter and biomass density. Imagery of temperate forest at Thetford in the UK, boreal forest at Siggefora in Sweden and tropical forest at Tapajós in Brazil have been acquired from SAR instruments on the ERS- 1, JERS- 1 and SIR-C spaceborne platforms. These data have been combined with biomass density ground data collected on various field campaigns to compare the dependence of backscatter on forest biomass density between the three different forest types. The analysis is complete for the temperate and <b>tropical</b> <b>test</b> sites and will be achieved soon for the boreal test site. preliminary results indicate that L-band HV imagery is most sensitive to forest biomass and that biomass dependencies are comparable for all types of forest.

40|$|Current {{knowledge}} on fate and effect of agricultural pesticides comes is mainly from temperate ecosystems. More {{studies are needed}} in tropical systems {{in order to assess}} contamination risks to nontarget endemic tropical species from the extensive use of pesticides e. g. in banana and pineapple plantations. In this study, acute laboratory toxicity tests with organophosphate pesticides ethoprophos and chlorpyrifos were conducted on two Costa Rican species, cladoceran Daphnia ambigua and fish Parachromis dovii. Tests showed that chlorpyrifos was more toxic than ethoprophos to D. ambigua and P. dovii and that D. ambigua was also more sensitive than P. dovii to both pesticides. Additionally, bioassays were performed by exposing D. magna and P. dovii to contaminated water collected from the field. Chemical analyses of field water revealed that fungicides were generally the most frequent pesticide group found, followed by insecticides/nematicides and herbicides. The bioassays and values obtained from the literature confirmed that D. magna was more sensitive to pesticide contamination than P. dovii and that D. ambigua was more sensitive than D. magna, suggesting that the native cladoceran is a more suitable test species than its temperate counterpart. Species sensitivity distributions showed no significant difference in sensitivity between tropical and temperate fish and the arthropod species exposed to chlorpyrifos in this study. Choline esterase activity (ChE) was measured in P. dovii in laboratory tests in order to assess the applicability of this biomarker. ChE inhibition in P. dovii was observed in the laboratory at levels below the LC 10 of both ethoprophos and chlorpyrifos, confirming that ChE is an efficient biomarker of exposure.

These tropical soils develop due to a complex weathering process, mainly {{as the result of}} chemical breakdown. Accordingly tropical soils exhibit different engineering properties and a clear understanding of these properties are required in the design of road pavements. Standard testing used to characterize soils in Southern Africa, in particular the determination of Atterberg limits and the grain size distribution of particles less than 0. 075 mm, influence bonded and structural water present in and around a soil particle through drying, mixing and dispersion with the use of flocculants. This paper discusses some of the basic concepts of <b>tropical</b> soil <b>testing</b> and presents laboratory test results used to establish and characterize the properties of the soils encountered during project investigations in West and Central Africa. Testing findings are supplemented by visual examination of soil particles under high magnification as well as XRD and XRF analysis. Standard drying methods affect clays and clayey materials the most, and the drying temperature should be kept as low as possible. Both Atterberg limits and hydrometer results are affected by drying temperature. Manipulation prior to testing needs to be carefully controlled as it leads to breakdown of the soil structure resulting in varying Atterberg limit test results...|$|R
