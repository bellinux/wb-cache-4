Ebner stated that [...] "Hacking their site is not really <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> about taking them (the Church of Scientology) down. Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to be up there so that people who are interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting a thousand other opinions." [...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing they used to do when they really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing they actually have to figure out some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 19, 2002, Sierra {{announced}} {{the game was}} also being released for Game Boy Advance, developed by Saffire Corporation. Sierra also revealed the GBA version would feature more stealth and less combat than the GameCube version, and would follow {{the plot of the}} novel a little more closely. On February 24, 2003, they {{announced the}} game would also be released for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows, with Inevitable Entertainment handling the PlayStation and Xbox versions, and The Fizz Factor developing the Windows version. Ken Embery, Sierra's executive producer on the game, stated [...] "the plan all along was to be multiplatform. But we were starting out with GameCube as the lead and were just holding our cards close to our chest before announcing all of our other titles. The PS2 is, of course, the most problematic of all the platforms for developers to deal with and {{we wanted to make sure}} that we had solid prototypes and running proof of concept versions before we made it public. Embery explained the art style of the game was influenced by the Super Mario and Legend of Zelda games, and in that sense, was aimed at a slightly younger audience than the Lord of the Rings films. Tory Skinner, of Vivendi Universal Games, further stated [...] "The Hobbit was written for a younger audience, so it made sense to create a game that would be enjoyable for younger kids, as well as adults. We looked at the different types of game we could do, and an action-adventure game with a heavy emphasis on the action seemed like <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> We didn't want to make the game inaccessible by loading down gamers with hard-core RPG gameplay." ...|$|E

We all agreed that a carriage and horses would be too expensive, and Jone was rather in favor of a dogcart for us if Mr. Poplington would like to go on horseback; but the old gentleman said it would be too much riding for him, and if we took a dogcart he'd have to take another one.
