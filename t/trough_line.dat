Despite the great improvement in computational techniques and numerical weather prediction approaches, so far, in Iran, an acceptable flood prediction method has not yet been introduced. The main aim of this study is to recognize and classify the patterns of synoptic systems leading to torrential rainfalls in a watershed basin located in south-west of Iran. In this research, 20 major floods characterized by high rainfall intensities and severe damage were selected. The pattern, extension, and the direction of movement of the selected synoptic maps from surface to 500 hPa pressure levels were identified. Furthermore, the position of cyclones, anti-cyclones and mid-level <b>trough</b> <b>lines</b> were carefully tracked and classified into different groups. The results show that the major severe floods occurring in Dalaki watershed river basin are mainly influenced by strengthening of the center of Sudan heat low (SHL) and the coincidence moisture feeding by the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.

These observations, along with those available from the World Weather Watch, provide a unique opportunity to carry out numerical weather prediction (NWP) studies over portions of West Africa and the eastern Atlantic ocean utilizing high resolution limited area models. The present study reports on the results of 34 short-range numerical weather prediction experiments, with two simple models, designed to study the westward propagation of African waves. In the time frame of 24 to 48 hours, predictions at 700 mb (the level of maximum amplitude of these waves, and the level of non-divergence) show extremely promising results. These results are comparable to fine-mesh predictions in higher latitudes. Errors in phase speed and vector root mean square (RMS) wind errors are summarized for the third phase of GATE. A second part of this study deals with the problem of specification of the West African squall line with respect to the position of the predicted <b>trough</b> <b>line</b> of the African wave. A body of recent literature provides useful obser-vational statistics relating the position of African waves, certain geographical regions, the time of day and the formation of line squall systems. These studies also provide information on the relative speeds of westward motion of the squall line and the wave trough. The decay of the squall lines during their westward propagation away from the trough is also 8 part of these observational statistics. Based on these observations, an empirical set of selection rules may be defined to specify the squall lines with respect to the predicted motion field. Successful results were obtained in the time frame of 24 to 48 hours for these experiments, the results of which are summarized below. 1...|$|E
40|$|The midocean trough in the North Pacific may form a {{favorable}} {{environment for the}} genesis of some synoptic disturbances. In contrast, the North Pacific anticyclone may hinder the downward penetration of these disturbances into the lower troposphere and prevent the moisture supply to these disturbances from the lower troposphere. Because no thick clouds, rainfall, and destructive surface winds are associated with these disturbances to attract attention, {{they have not been}} analyzed or documented. Actually, the upper-level wind speed within these disturbances is sometimes as strong as tropical cyclones and has the possibility of causing air traffic hazards in the western subtropic Pacific. With infrared images of the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite and the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis data, 25 North Pacific disturbances were identified over six summers (1993 – 98). Two aspects of these disturbances were explored: spatial structure and basic dynamics. For their structure, the disturbances possess a well-organized vortex in the middle to upper troposphere with a descending dry/cold core encircled by the moist ascending air around the vortex periphery; the secondary circulation of the vortex is opposite to other types of synoptic disturbances. Since vorticity reaches maximum values along the midocean <b>trough</b> <b>line,</b> barotrophic instability is suggested as a likely genesis mechanism of the vortex. After the vortex is formed, the horizontal advection of total vorticity results in its westward propagation, while the secondary circulation hinders this movement. Along its westward moving course, close to East Asia, there is a reduction in vortex size and a tangential speed increase inversely proportional to the vortex size. Diminishing its horizontal convergence/descending motion by the upper-tropospheric East Asian high and the lower-tropospheric monsoon low, the vortex eventually dissipates along the East Asian coast. 1...|$|E

This study examines upper fronts that occurred over the continental U. S. during March-April 1996 with the objective of verifying the performance of the NORAPS (Navy Operational Regional Atmospheric Prediction System) data assimilation system using ACARS (ARINC Communications, Addressing, and Reporting System) aircraft observations. ACARS observations are taken every 5 to 8 minutes during level flight, which yields a horizontal resolution along the flight track of less than 100 km and so can resolve the approximately 200 km width scale for upper fronts. The ACARS temperature observations are not currently used in the data assimilation system and so present an independent set of observations. Thirty distinct upper fronts (duration greater than 12 h and temperature gradient greater than 2 deg C/ 100 km) were identified and tracked from the NORAPS analyses during the period of the study. In general, the analyzed temperature gradient was weaker than that observed in the ACARS data. The latter depicted a temperature gradient of 8 deg C/ 100 km for two cases, whereas the analyzed gradient did not exceed 6 deg C/ 100 km.
