5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> may lose sensation.|$|E

5|$|The fibres {{that form}} the spinal {{accessory}} nerve are formed by lower motor neurons located in the upper segments of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> This cluster of neurons, called the spinal accessory nucleus, {{is located in the}} lateral aspect of the anterior horn of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> and stretches from where <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> begins (at the junction with the medulla) through to the level of about C6. The lateral horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla oblongata, from which the cranial component of the accessory nerve is derived.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{anterior}} <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> {{which makes}} up 2/3 of <b>the</b> entire <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> gets its blood supply from <b>the</b> anterior <b>spinal</b> artery.

5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from either side of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury {{is defined as the}} lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E

40|$|Elaborate {{courtship}} displays {{are relatively}} common {{features of the}} masculine reproductive behavior in birds. However, {{little is known about}} their neural and hormonal control. One bird that performs such a display is the golden-collared manakin (Manacus vitellinus) of Panamanian forests. Adult males, but not females, perform a physically intense display requiring substantial neuromuscular control of the wings and legs. We tested the hypothesis that steroid sensitivity is a property of neurons in <b>the</b> manakin <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> Males and females were captured from active courtship leks, treated with drugs to block steroidogenesis, injected with 3 H-labeled testosterone, and <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> were removed and processed for autoradiography. Sex steroid-accumulating cells were widely distributed in <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cords</b> in each of six males and in one of five females. Cells, including presumptive motoneurons, reached their highest density in the ventral horns of the cervical and lumbosacral enlargements, regions associated with motor control of the wings and legs. These results suggest that neurons in <b>the</b> adult manakin <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> can express sex-steroid receptors, but do so less in females than in males. This evidence for androgen sensitivity and sexual dimorphism in <b>the</b> adult avian <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> suggests that sex steroids may control diverse behaviors in male birds in part by acting directly on <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> neural circuits...|$|R

5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E

5|$|The lumbar (or lower back) {{region is}} made up of five {{vertebrae}} (L1–L5), sometimes including the sacrum. In between these vertebrae are fibrocartilaginous discs, which act as cushions, preventing the vertebrae from rubbing together {{while at the same time}} protecting <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> Nerves come from and go to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> through specific openings between the vertebrae, providing the skin with sensations and messages to muscles. Stability of the spine is provided by the ligaments and muscles of the back and abdomen. Small joints called facet joints limit and direct the motion of the spine.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the spinal column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it still does not give images of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.|$|E

5|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump infuses an opioid such as morphine {{directly into}} the fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) between <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> and its protective sheath, providing enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects.

5|$|Dopamine {{plays a role}} in pain {{processing}} {{in multiple}} levels of the central nervous system including <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> periaqueductal gray, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine have been associated with painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.|$|E
5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 mmHg {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. The treatment for shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E

5|$|The brain {{contains}} several motor {{areas that}} project directly to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> At {{the lowest level}} are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.|$|E

The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull.
