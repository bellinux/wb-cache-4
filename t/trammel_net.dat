500|$|Common {{stingrays}} {{are caught}} incidentally by commercial fisheries across {{many parts of}} its range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, bottom longlines, beach seines, and trammel nets. Because of its inshore habitat preferences, this ray is more susceptible to small-scale coastal fisheries than to industrial operations, {{such as in the}} Balearic Islands, where it makes up 40% of the shark and ray <b>trammel</b> <b>net</b> catch. Surveys indicate that common stingrays have declined in the Mediterranean and the northeastern Atlantic, and may have been extirpated from the Bay of Biscay. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened in those two regions, while the species as a whole is listed under Data Deficient. The common stingray is protected within five marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Balearic Islands, and also benefits from a European Union ban on the use of trawls within [...] of the coast.|$|E

A {{total of}} 80 species were recorded for <b>trammel</b> <b>nets,</b> 36 for traps and 28 for longlines. Cephalopods {{accounted for more}} than 90 % of the biomass captured with traps and fish dominated in catches of <b>trammel</b> <b>nets</b> and longlines (64 % and 96 %). Discards, in number of individuals,were higher for <b>trammel</b> <b>nets</b> (57 %), followed by longlines (42 %) and traps (14 %). A larger number of species was identified more than 200 meters from the coastline for traps. A larger number of species was recorded in spring/summer for <b>trammel</b> <b>nets.</b> Catches were higher less than 200 meters from the coastline for longlines. Degradation, as a motive for discards, was very low in longlines. Catches below maturation size per sample day were relatively low for <b>trammel</b> <b>nets</b> and longlines target species and medium for traps.

Coefficient of variation (CV) of CPUE ranged from 210 to 566 for electrofishing and 128 to 575 for <b>trammel</b> <b>netting,</b> depending on season, diel period and species. Mean CV was lowest for <b>trammel</b> <b>nets</b> for humpback chub (P 0004) and tended to be lower for flannelmouth sucker (P 012), regardless of season or diel period. Only one bluehead sucker> 200 mm was collected with electrofishing.

50|$|The smalleye {{stingray}} {{appears to}} be very rare across much of its range, perhaps explained by its possible semi-pelagic habits. It is only encountered with any regularity at the reefs off Tofo Beach, where in 2009 a living individual was captured on film underwater {{for the first time}} by a BBC crew. This species is an occasional incidental catch of demersal longline, bottom trawl, <b>trammel</b> <b>net,</b> and seine net fisheries throughout its range. There is also a record of one being speared by artisanal fishers in Mozambique. The meat, cartilage, and possibly skin are of value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough information to assess the smalleye stingray beyond Data Deficient.

40|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, common {{bottlenose}} dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) adversely {{interact with}} the fisheries, particularly when <b>trammel</b> <b>nets</b> are used. This results in an economic loss to fishermen and incidental catches of dolphins. The first stage to solve the conflict is the evaluation of its nature to describe in which way the presence of <b>trammel</b> <b>nets</b> can influence a bottlenose dolphin population. This is {{the objective of the}} project initiated in October 1999 on the North-eastern coast of Sardinia (Italy). Observations were made by experienced researchers in presence and absence of <b>trammel</b> <b>nets.</b> For each group we recorded on an audio tape: date, start and end time, number of bottlenose dolphin adults and calves, water depth and description of behaviours (focal-group sampling method). Observations were made during daylight hours and during the night with night-vision binoculars. Opportunistic video recordings were also made to document and verify behavioural interaction. A total of 496 sightings were carried out in over 1420 hours of research of dolphins during 478 days at sea. In presence of trammel nets: 218 sightings were recorded in 161 days at sea, in absence of trammel nets: 278 sightings were realized in 317 days of research.

40|$|Trammel nets are {{commonly}} used to sample rare fishes; however, little research has assessed delayed mortality associated with this capture technique. We conducted laboratory experiments to evaluate the effects of capture by <b>trammel</b> <b>net</b> on bonytail Gila elegans, razorback sucker Xyrauchen texanus, and roundtail chub Gila robusta, at 15, 20, and 25 uC. Fish (139 – 288 mm total length) were entangled in a <b>trammel</b> <b>net</b> for 2 h or captured by seine net and then monitored for mortality for at least 14 d. Blood samples were collected immediately after capture, and plasma cortisol levels were quantified as an index of capture-related stress. The cortisol response varied by species, but mean cortisol levels were higher for fish captured by trammel netting (295. 9 ng/mL) relative to fish captured by seine netting (215. 8 ng/mL). Only one fish (of 550) died during capture and handling, but 42 % of the trammel-netted fish and 11 % of the seine-netted fish died within 14 d after capture. In general, mortality after capture by <b>trammel</b> <b>net</b> increased with increased water temperature and at 25 uC was 88 % for bonytail, 94 % for razorback sucker, and 25 % for roundtail chub. Delayed mortality of wild-caught fish captured by <b>trammel</b> <b>net</b> {{has the potential to}} be high, at least under some circumstances.
