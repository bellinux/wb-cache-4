5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{newspapers}} Bosanski vjestnik, Bosna, and Sarajevski cvjetnik, the Vilayet Printing House published around fifty books and booklets in Serbo-Croatian, Ottoman Turkish, and Hebrew. While {{most of these}} publications were concerned with various Ottoman laws and legislation, the printing house also published a number of textbooks. <b>The</b> <b>textbooks</b> for Serb elementary schools in the vilayet were prepared by Miloš Mandić {{on the basis of}} those that were used in Serbia. These include an alphabet book (Буквар), a short Biblical history (Кратка свештена историја), a basal reader (Прва читанка), and the First Knowledges (Прва знања); they were published in 1867 and 1868. Mandić's alphabet book, the printing house's first textbook, was the second Serbian alphabet book using the reformed Serbian Cyrillic. The First Serbian Alphabet Book (Први Српски Буквар), authored by Vuk Karadžić, had been published in Vienna in 1827. The original plan was to print fifteen textbooks for Serb schools, ranging in subject from grammar, arithmetic, geography and religious teaching, but only four were printed. Although they were based on <b>the</b> <b>textbooks</b> used in Serbia, the vilayet's authorities made sure that every mention of Serbs and the Serbian language was erased from them.|$|E

25|$|Kuhn {{states that}} the {{probabilistic}} tools used by verificationists are inherently inadequate for the task of deciding between conflicting theories, since they belong to the very paradigms they seek to compare. Similarly, observations that are intended to falsify a statement will fall {{under one of the}} paradigms they are supposed to help compare, and will therefore also be inadequate for the task. According to Kuhn, the concept of falsifiability is unhelpful for understanding why and how science has developed as it has. In the practice of science, scientists will only consider the possibility that a theory has been falsified if an alternative theory is available that they judge credible. If there is not, scientists will continue to adhere to the established conceptual framework. If a paradigm shift has occurred, <b>the</b> <b>textbooks</b> will be rewritten to state that the previous theory has been falsified.|$|E

This thesis describes {{a case study of}} the history teaching at an upper secondary school class and investigates the attitudes of the pupils, teachers and textbook authors towards history, the teaching of history, <b>textbooks</b> and <b>the</b> use of <b>textbooks.</b> <b>The</b> study also investigates <b>the</b> <b>textbook</b> used in <b>the</b> history class and the attitudes that the authors expose in <b>the</b> <b>textbook.</b> <b>The</b> analyses are based on interviews with the pupils and teacher, the pupils’ responses in a questionnaire, lesson observations, parts of <b>the</b> <b>textbook,</b> and some other teaching materials used in the lessons. In addition to constituting research on attitudes, this study is also linked to cognitive dissonance theory since it highlights dissonance among the attitudes of the teachers, pupils and <b>textbook</b> authors. <b>The</b> study shows that one main dilemma is the fact that <b>the</b> <b>textbook</b> is frequently being used in the classroom, but many pupils find it dull and uninteresting. Other dilemmas are basically explanations for this and are discussed as such. The study also shows that the pupils prefer history lessons that follow certain strategies and that these strategies are only reflected in <b>the</b> <b>textbook</b> to a limited extent. However, these strategies are used to a large extent in the teaching and when other teaching materials are used instead of <b>the</b> <b>textbook.</b> Sometimes <b>the</b> language used in <b>the</b> <b>textbook</b> seems to prevent the pupils from being able to take in the content but they are not given any help to cope with this difficulty.
