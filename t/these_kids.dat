5|$|The mid-1970s saw the {{beginning}} of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids, and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> the optimism to make their own. This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, stated that members of the Swedish Riksdag have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. Charles Small, former director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Anti-Semitism, stated that “Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It’s a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.” Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet and well known for his pro-Israeli stance for decades, has sharply criticised politicians who he says offer “weak excuses” for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. “Politicians say <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying that the behaviour of <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> is in some way our fault.” Much of the anti-semitism in the country has been attributed to the growing Muslim immigrant population.|$|E

500|$|Describing {{the general}} {{tone of the}} show, Teri Fitsell of The New Zealand Herald {{explains}} that [...] "South Park is a vicious social satire that works by spotlighting not the immorality of <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> but their amorality, and contrasting it with the conniving hypocrisy of the adults who surround them." [...] Often compared to The Simpsons and King of the Hill, South Park, according to Tom Lappin of Scotland on Sunday, [...] "has a truly malevolent streak that sets it apart" [...] from these shows; he cites the repeated death of Kenny as an example.|$|E
500|$|The only {{photograph}} {{taken during the}} first night of the riots shows the homeless youth who slept in nearby Christopher Park, scuffling with police. The Mattachine Society newsletter a month later offered its explanation of why the riots occurred: [...] "It catered largely to {{a group of people who}} are not welcome in, or cannot afford, other places of homosexual social gathering... The Stonewall became home to <b>these</b> <b>kids.</b> When it was raided, they fought for it. That, and the fact that they had nothing to lose other than the most tolerant and broadminded gay place in town, explains why." ...|$|E

[...] Prove me wrong, kids. Prove me wrong."

[...] The humor of the show comes from the disparity between the cute appearance of the characters and their crude behavior.

500|$|On December 18, 2007, {{prosecutor}} Hans Mos officially {{declared the}} case closed, {{and that no}} charges would be filed {{due to lack of}} evidence. The prosecution indicated a continuing interest in the Kalpoes and Van der Sloot (though they legally ceased to be suspects), and alleged that one of the three, in a chat room message, had stated that Holloway was dead. This was hotly contested by Deepak Kalpoe's attorney, who stated that the prosecution, in translating from Papiamento to Dutch, had misconstrued a reference to a teacher who had drowned as one to Holloway. Attorney Ronald Wix also stated, [...] "Unless (Mos) finds a body in the bathroom of one of <b>these</b> <b>kids,</b> there's no way in hell they can arrest them anymore." ...|$|E

Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote a satirical, mocking letter ostensibly {{from the point of}} view of Lohan: [...] "Some of <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> are sent to work when they're so young.

Lappas said, [...] "What {{else do you}} say about Anthony Anderson? He had thirteen rebounds in the game. Its great to see Anthony have six points in the game and win. We couldn't have one a game like this in a million years with Anthony Anderson only scoring six points. You don't even notice it now, where when he didn't score before we almost didn't have a chance.

Erik King found the shot of the boy crying in the blood to be the creepiest moment of the first season. He described it as [...] "very uncomfortable to watch, even when you know it's not real and you know <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> are actors." [...] Cinematographer Romeo Tirone tightened the camera's shutter angle when filming these scenes to make them [...] "feel like fragments of memory - subjective, with tight close-ups against an indistinct background.

Parker met with De Silva in Manhattan, New York, where it was decided that he would draft his own script with Gore receiving sole screenwriting credit and Parker's colleague Alan Marshall being enlisted as a producer. Gore travelled to London, England, where he and Parker began work on a second draft script. Their new script became significantly darker than what De Silva had originally intended. De Silva said, [...] "I was really motivated and interested in the joy of what the school represented for <b>these</b> <b>kids,</b> and [...] was really much more interested in where the pain was in going to the school, and so we had our little conflicts based on that area." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has {{often called the}} album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, [...] "I would think all day, for days and days, [...] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in {{different}} ways. I don’t know why <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it." [...] Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, [...] "We named it that because ...

[...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan.
