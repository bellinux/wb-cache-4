Elliott et al. distinguishes between two categories: scattered-near (i.e. typical SDOs) and scattered-extended (i.e. detached objects). Scattered-near objects are those whose orbits are non-resonant, non-planetary-orbit-crossing and have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) less than 3. Scattered-extended objects have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) greater than 3 and have a <b>time-averaged</b> eccentricity greater than 0.2.|$|E

The quantities measured with NMR are <b>time-averaged</b> chemical shifts, as proton exchange is fast on the NMR time-scale. Other chemical shifts, such as those of 31P can be measured.|$|E
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The <b>time-averaged</b> value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E

40|$|Surface waves (SWs) in seismic records {{can be used}} {{to extract}} local {{dispersion}} curves (DCs) along a seismic line. These curves {{can be used to}} estimate near-surface S-wave velocity models. If the velocity models are used to compute S-wave static corrections, the required information consists of S-wave <b>time-average</b> velocities that define the one-way time for a given datum plan depth. However, given the wider use of P-wave reflection seismic with respect to S-wave surveys, the estimate of P-wave <b>time-average</b> velocity would be more useful. We therefore focus on the possibility of also extracting <b>time-average</b> P-wave velocity models from SW dispersion data. We start from a known 1 D S-wave velocity model along the line, with its relevant DC, and we estimate a wavelength/depth relationship for SWs. We found that this relationship is sensitive to Poisson's ratio, and we develop a simple method for estimating an "apparent" Poisson's ratio profile, defined as the Poisson's ratio value that relates the <b>time-average</b> S-wave velocity to the <b>time-average</b> P-wave velocity. Hence, we transform the <b>time-average</b> S-wave velocity models estimated from the DCs into the <b>time-average</b> P-wave velocity models along the seismic line. We tested the method on synthetic and field data and found {{that it is possible to}} retrieve <b>time-average</b> P-wave velocity models with uncertainties mostly less than 10 % in laterally varying sites and one-way traveltime for P-waves with less than 5 ms uncertainty with respect to P-wave tomography data. To our knowledge, this is the first method for reliable estimation of P-wave velocity from SW data without any a priori information or additional data...|$|R

A constant direct current has a zero rate-of-change, and sees an inductor as a short-circuit (it is typically made from a material with a low resistivity).

The most critical factor in the reliable application of <b>time-averaging</b> is {{the resolution of the}} data. The ratio of data to molecular degrees of freedom should be large enough to avoid overfitting of the data by the <b>time-averaging</b> procedure. The use of a free R-factor can aid in determining whether <b>time-averaging</b> can be reliably applied. Good ensembles of structures are obtained using data up to 1. 0 or 2. 0 A resolution.

25|$|The {{numerical}} {{solution of the}} Navier–Stokes equations for turbulent flow is extremely difficult, and due to the significantly different mixing-length scales {{that are involved in}} turbulent flow, the stable solution of this requires such a fine mesh resolution that the computational time becomes significantly infeasible for calculation or direct numerical simulation. Attempts to solve turbulent flow using a laminar solver typically result in a time-unsteady solution, which fails to converge appropriately. To counter this, <b>time-averaged</b> equations such as the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS), supplemented with turbulence models, are used in practical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications when modeling turbulent flows. Some models include the Spalart–Allmaras, –, –, and SST models, which add a variety of additional equations to bring closure to the RANS equations. Large eddy simulation (LES) {{can also be used to}} solve these equations numerically. This approach is computationally more expensive—in time and in computer memory—than RANS, but produces better results because it explicitly resolves the larger turbulent scales.|$|E

40|$|A mathematical/computer {{model was}} {{constructed}} to ex-plore {{the effects of}} changes in rates of taphonomic loss, sed-iment reworking, and burial on <b>time-averaging</b> in fossil de-posits. Using a Monte Carlo algorithm, the main control-ling variables were thickness of the taphonomically active zone (TAZ; the interval where shells {{are likely to be}} de-stroyed), depth of final burial (DFB; below which shells can no longer be reworked into the TAZ), and burial rate. Output included both the decay trajectory of shells above the DFB as well as the frequency distribution of post-mortem shell ages at final burial (entry into the fossil record). Output was justified ergodically as equivalent to <b>time-averaging</b> in a de-posit. The model helps to illuminate several important con-cepts for <b>time-averaging.</b> For example, it clarifies that DFB and TAZ need not be coincident. In fact, the mechanism of shell sequestering (allowing shells to remain in a safe zone between the TAZ and DFB) as a means of shell survival for 100 s or 1000 s of years after death requires that DFB be be-low TAZ. In addition, the model demonstrates the use of a shell’s expected residence times above TAZ and DFB as a means of comparing <b>time-averaging</b> from different settings. Lastly, the model focuses attention on the potential variabil-ity in <b>time-averaging</b> among fossil deposits created under identical conditions due to stochastic variation. These re-sults indicate the useful role of models in developing a pro-cess-based understanding of the nature and controls of <b>time-averaging</b> in fossil accumulations...|$|R
40|$|Many long-run delay {{characteristics}} of computer, communication, manufacturing, and transportation {{systems can be}} specified as <b>time-average</b> limits of sequences of delays in stochastic Petri nets (spn's). We consider spn's with general firing times in which sequences of delays are determined from the marking changes of the net using the method of start vectors. In this setting, <b>time-average</b> limits typically must be estimated using simulation. Previous work on estimation methods for delays has focused on spn's in which there exists a sequence of regeneration points for the marking process. For such nets, point estimates and confidence intervals for <b>time-average</b> limits can be obtained using the regenerative method for simulation output analysis or recently proposed variants of the regenerative method. This paper is concerned with spn's for which regenerative methods are not applicable. We provide conditions on {{the building blocks of}} an spn and start-vector mechanism under which the sequence of delays is an "od-regenerative" process with finite cycle-sum moments. Although the od-regeneration points usually cannot be determined explicitly, the existence of these points implies that <b>time-average</b> limits are well defined and the sequence of delays obeys a multivariate functional central limit theorem. It then follows from results of Glynn, Iglehart, and Mu~noz that methods based on standardized time series can be used to obtain strongly consistent point estimates and asymptotic confidence intervals for <b>time-average</b> limits and functions of <b>time-average</b> limits. In particular, the method of batch means is applicable...|$|R

40|$|In some areas, the {{estimation}} of static corrections for land seismic data is a critical step of the processing workflow. It often requires the execution of additional surveys and data analyses. Surface waves (SWs) in seismic records can be processed to extract local dispersion curves (DCs) {{that can be used}} to estimate near-surface S-wave velocity models. Here we focus on the direct estimation of <b>time-average</b> S-wave velocity models from SW DCs without the need to invert the data. <b>Time-average</b> velocity directly provides the value of one-way time, given a datum plan depth. The method requires the knowledge of one 1 D S-wave velocity model along the seismic line, together with the relevant DC, to estimate a relationship between SW wavelength and investigation depth on the <b>time-average</b> velocity model. This wavelength/depth relationship is then used to estimate all the other <b>time-average</b> S-wave velocity models along the line directly from the DCs by means of a data transformation. This approach removes the need for extensive data inversion and provides a simple method suitable for industrial workflows. We tested the method on synthetic and field data and found that it is possible to retrieve the <b>time-average</b> velocity models with uncertainties less than 10 % in sites with laterally varying velocities. The error on one-way times at various depths of the datum plan retrieved by the <b>time-average</b> velocity models is mostly less than 5 ms for synthetic and field data...|$|R
