5|$|At {{some time}} between 1777 and 1785, the Kitkehahkis again {{abandoned}} and then re-occupied the Republican valley. A Spanish account of 1785 describes a {{village on the}} south side of the Platte in Butler County, not far from the modern town of Linwood, Nebraska; this village was occupied by the Kitkehahkis until about 1785, when <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republican.|$|E

5|$|By 1932, {{the year}} she joined Palestina Opera in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta), Roekiah had become a {{well-known}} stage actress and singer of kroncong music (traditional music with Portuguese influences). She was admired not only for her voice, but her beauty. While with Palestina she met Kartolo, an actor, pianist, and songwriter with the troupe; they married later that year. The new couple soon left Palestina, taking month's hiatus before joining the group Faroka on a tour in Singapore. <b>They</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Indies in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination {{for the old}} country {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Midwest.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, the Patriots {{had some}} success, earning a berth {{to the playoffs}} in 1976—as a wild card team—and in 1978—as AFC East champions. They lost {{in the first round}} both times. In 1985, <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> playoffs, and made {{it all the way to}} Super Bowl XX, which they lost to the Chicago Bears 46–10. Following their Super Bowl loss, <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> playoffs in 1986, but lost in the first round. The team would not make the playoffs again for eight more years. During the 1990 season, the Patriots went 1–15. They changed {{ownership}} three times in the ensuing 14 years, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by Victor Kiam in 1988, who sold the team to James Orthwein in 1992. Orthwein intended to move the team to his native St. Louis, Missouri (where it would have been renamed as the St. Louis Stallions), but instead sold the team in 1994 to its current owner Robert Kraft.|$|E

By November the regiment had eleven officers and 331 other ranks in hospital; twenty-two of those died of the disease. Only two men from the regiment had not been infected in any way.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers {{earned the}} top {{pick in the}} 1958 NBA draft {{and used it to}} select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, {{averaged}} 24.9ppg and 15.0rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 record. After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.|$|E

The couple lived in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania before settling in Minneapolis in 1936 when Jean Piccard joined {{the faculty of the}} University of Minnesota. She received a doctorate in education from the University of Minnesota in 1942, and a certificate of study from the General Theological Seminary in 1973.|$|E

5|$|The stadium {{has hosted}} Premier League {{football}} {{for most of}} its existence; although Sunderland had been relegated {{at the end of the}} season preceding its opening, they won promotion with a then English professional record of 105 league points in their second season there. Sunderland then survived for four seasons in the Premier League before being relegated in 2003. <b>They</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Premier League at the second attempt, and despite being relegated the following season, they made an instant return to the Premier League in 2007 and survived there for a decade.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Falkland Islands on 16March {{just after}} an {{incident}} where gauchos and Indians had butchered {{senior members of}} Vernet's settlement, and helped to put the revolt down. Darwin noted the immense number of organisms dependent on the kelp forests. He received word from Henslow that his first dispatch of specimens had reached Cambridge, with the South American fossils being prized by the expert William Clift as showing hitherto unknown species and features of the Megatherium, and displayed by William Buckland and Clift before the cream of British science, making Darwin's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense {{interest}} once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.|$|E

The attack went in on 4 October, and after overcoming an encounter with a German infantry regiment, the 212th, in no man's land, the Australians successfully managed to capture their objectives. During the battle, the 2nd Battalion lost 10 officers and 144 other ranks killed or wounded, some of which were suffered after an intense German mortar barrage had fallen upon the troops in their form-up point prior to the attack, killing or wounding up to one seventh of the assault force.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few weeks}} {{assigned}} to Western Approaches Command, the 1st DF {{was assigned to the}} Nore Command at Harwich, although some of the ships were transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, where they were tasked for escort and patrol duty. Gipsy was sunk on 21 November after she struck a mine, as did Grenville on 19 January 1940. Unlike the 1st DF, the Second was transferred to Force K in Freetown in West Africa, to help search for German commerce raiders. Some ships were later transferred to Bermuda and the West Indies for escort work and patrolling. <b>They</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UK in January and spent several months refitting.|$|E
5|$|After being commissioned, both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the US Atlantic Fleet. The two operated up and down the American east coast from July until November. On 2 November, as part of the Second Battleship Division, the ships left the Boston Navy Yard for a training voyage to Europe, where they visited the Isle of Portland in the United Kingdom and Cherbourg in France. In January 1911, <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba before continuing to another base in Norfolk. After further maneuvers, the two ships split up; Michigan remained on the east coast, while South Carolina embarked on another trip to Europe. The ship visited Copenhagen (Denmark), Stockholm (Sweden), Kronstadt (Russia), and Kiel (Germany)—the last during Kieler Woche, a large sailing event—before returning in July 1911.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of their victory, Plymouth Argyle {{returned}} to the third tier of English football just one year after being relegated to the fourth tier {{for the first time in}} its history. <b>They</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Third Division two years later before being promoted as champions in 2002, and the club followed that up by winning the Second Division in 2004, to reclaim their place in the second tier of English football after a twelve-year hiatus. For Darlington, there was to be more disappointment in the play-offs four years later under David Hodgson, Platt's successor. They reached the Third Division final in 2000, the last to be played at the original Wembley Stadium, and were defeated 10 again; on this occasion to Peterborough United.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Europeans in the area, {{wildebeest}} used to roam widely, probably in relation to {{the arrival of}} the rains and the availability of good forage. They never made such extensive migrations as the blue wildebeest but at one time, they used to cross the Drakensberg Range, moving eastwards in autumn, searching for good pastures. Then <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highvelds in the spring and moved towards the west, where sweet potato and Karoo vegetation were abundant. They also moved from north to south as the sourgrass found north of the Vaal River matured and became unpalatable, the wildebeest only consuming young shoots of sourgrass. Nowadays, almost all black wildebeest are in reserves or on farms and the extent of their movements is limited.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in the year, the British Invasion—started by the Beatles' {{previous}} U.S. visit—was gathering momentum, and several more UK acts had come to the United States, including The Dave Clark Five, Billy J. Kramer, and Gerry & the Pacemakers. One third of all U.S. top ten hits in 1964 were by British acts. After the tour's final concert in New York, the Beatles were introduced to Bob Dylan, a meeting brought about at the instigation of the New York journalist Al Aronowitz, who arranged for Dylan to visit the Beatles at their hotel before <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UK.|$|E
