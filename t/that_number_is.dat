25|$|The {{prognosis}} of MG {{patients is}} generally good, as is quality of life, given very good treatment. In the early 1900s, the mortality associated with MG was 70%; now, <b>that</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> {{estimated to be}} around 3–5%, which is attributed to increased awareness and medications to manage symptoms. Monitoring of a person with MG is very important, as at least 20% of people diagnosed with it will experience a myasthenic crisis within two years of their diagnosis, requiring rapid medical intervention. Generally, the most disabling period of MG might be years after the initial diagnosis.|$|E

A study published in 2012 concluded that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) relies on the recommendations of an American Medical Association advisory panel. The study led by Dr. Miriam J. Laugesen, of Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, and colleagues at UCLA and the University of Illinois, shows that for services provided between 1994 and 2010, CMS agreed with 87.4% of {{the recommendations of the}} committee, known as RUC or the Relative Value Update Committee.|$|E
