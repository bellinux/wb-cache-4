5|$|According to its May 1853 {{advertisement}} in the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser, {{the institute}} provided instruction {{to the following}} grades during its summer session: fifth grade for $5, fourth grade for $8, third grade for $10, second grade for $12, and first grade (its highest grade) for $15. Boarding, including laundry, meals, and lighting, was $45, and music lessons with use of the piano were $25. An additional fee of 25 cents was charged if a student was suspended. The fifth grade was taught by the institute's Primary Department, and lessons included spelling, reading and elementary arithmetic. The fourth grade was taught by the institute's Junior Department and included courses in writing and preparatory English grammar and geography. The third grade was instructed by the English Department and offered studies in geography and English; and <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> was also taught by the English Department with courses in history and natural philosophy. The school's highest grade, first grade, was instructed by the Classical and Mathematical Department and offered studies in Greek, Latin, French, geometry, algebra, trigonometry, surveying, mensuration, navigation, astronomy, and bookkeeping.|$|E

In 1956, there was another change of president; Studer stepped down {{because he had to}} move and handed the position over to the composer Rudolf Moser.

25|$|Caragiale {{completed}} gymnasium at the Sfinţii Petru şi Pavel {{school in}} the city, and never pursued any form of higher education. He was probably enlisted directly in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>grade,</b> as records do not show him to have attended or graduated the first year. Notably, Caragiale was taught history by Constantin Iennescu, who was later the mayor of Ploieşti. The young Caragiale opted to follow in his uncles' footsteps, and was taught declamation and mimic art by Costache at the latter's theater school in Bucharest, where he was accompanied by his mother and sister. It is also probable {{that he was a}} supernumerary actor for the National Theater Bucharest. He was not able to find full employment in this field, and, around the age of 18, worked as a copyist for the Prahova County Tribunal. Throughout his life, Caragiale refused to talk about his training in the theater, and hid it from the people closest to him (including his wife Alexandrina Burelly, who came from an upper middle class environment).|$|E

25|$|Issei {{and many}} nisei speak Japanese in {{addition}} to English as a second language. In general, later generations of Japanese Americans speak English as their first language, though some do learn Japanese later as a second language. In Hawaii however, where Nikkei are about one-fifth of the whole population, Japanese is a major language, spoken and studied {{by many of the}} state's residents across ethnicities. It is taught in private Japanese language schools as early as <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>grade.</b> As a courtesy to the large number of Japanese tourists (from Japan), Japanese subtexts are provided on place signs, public transportation, and civic facilities. The Hawaii media market has a few locally produced Japanese language newspapers and magazines, although these {{are on the verge of}} dying out, due to a lack of interest on the part of the local (Hawaii-born) Japanese population. Stores that cater to the tourist industry often have Japanese-speaking personnel. To show their allegiance to the US, many nisei and sansei intentionally avoided learning Japanese. But as many of the later generations find their identities in both Japan and America or American society broadens its definition of cultural identity, studying Japanese is becoming more popular than it once was.|$|E

In 1903, the family moved to Arnhem, where he attended primary and secondary school until 1918. Known to his friends and family as [...] "Mauk", he was a sickly child, and was placed in a special school at the age of seven; he failed <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>grade.</b> Although he excelled at drawing, his grades were generally poor.

The Circus Bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them. Lasseter agreed with this new approach, and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton. The characters [...] "Tuck and Roll" [...] were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>grade.</b> Lasseter had come to envision the film as an epic in the tradition of David Lean's 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia.|$|E

500|$|Lisa {{plays the}} {{baritone}} saxophone, and some episodes {{use that as}} a plot device. According to Matt Groening, the baritone saxophone was chosen because he found the thought of an eight-year-old girl playing it amusing. He added, [...] "But she doesn't always play a baritone sax because the animators don't know what it looks like, so it changes shape and color from show to show." [...] One of the hallmarks of the show's opening sequence is a brief solo Lisa plays on her saxophone after being thrown out of music class. The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen said that the session musicians who perform her solos do not try to play at <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> level and instead [...] "think of Lisa as a really good player." ...|$|E

[...] Her elementary school was down the street. They enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides. She played piano, learning from her great-aunt who was a piano teacher. The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church.

[...] The mean way Damien is treated by his fellow students when he joins the school, as well as Damien's reactions to the treatment, were inspired by Parker's experience of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>grade,</b> when he started at a Cheyenne, Wyoming elementary school in the last three weeks of the school year.
