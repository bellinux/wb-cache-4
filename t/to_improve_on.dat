5|$|In 1997–98, Jovanovski {{appeared}} in 81 games, recording nine goals and 23 points. With his contract set to expire following the 1998–99 season, Jovanovski {{was beginning to}} be seen as a disappointment in Florida, failing <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> his successful rookie year.|$|E
5|$|Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri praised {{his team}} for their efforts, {{and said that}} despite a few regrets, they could exit with {{confidence}} from their performance. He commented that the team reaching the final had inspired the city of Turin and the whole of Italy. Allegri added that <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> the season would not mean winning a treble, but remaining within Europe's top 8 teams for the future.|$|E
5|$|The HDMI founders began {{development}} on HDMI 1.0 on April 16, 2002, {{with the goal}} of creating an AV connector that was backward-compatible with DVI. At the time, DVI-HDCP (DVI with HDCP) and DVI-HDTV (DVI-HDCP using the CEA-861-B video standard) were being used on HDTVs. HDMI 1.0 was designed <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> DVI-HDTV by using a smaller connector and adding audio capability and enhanced YCbCr capability and consumer electronics control functions.|$|E

5|$|The {{first session}} on Thursday began in heavy rain. Although some cars {{attempted}} {{to carry out}} wet weather testing, the conditions forced all the teams back to their garages. Once the rain began to slacken off cars returned to the track, but the rain continued throughout the entire session. No one was able <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> their qualifying times from the previous day.|$|E
5|$|Babangida's {{fortunes}} {{started to}} change {{towards the end of}} 1998. Having missed {{the start of the season}} with malaria, Babangida gradually lost his starting line-up position as Morten Olsen was looking <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> the team's inconsistent performances both in the domestic league and in Europe. Babangida started two of his team's opening Champions League games. The European season, however, ended in disappointment as Ajax finished bottom of their group behind Olympiacos, Dinamo Zagreb and Porto. Overall, Babangida appeared in 18 league games for Ajax that season, starting only seven. He didn't feature in the Dutch Cup final where Ajax managed to retain the trophy after beating Fortuna Sittard in the final.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Llandudno to Fred and Rose Southall, he was the middle child of three boys. Southall played youth {{football}} for his school team and the Llandudno Swifts, where he played alongside Joey Jones. He was educated at Ysgol John Bright, though left without any qualifications at age 16. At age 14 he toured Germany with the Llandudno Swifts and was offered {{a chance to play}} for the youth team of Bundesliga outfit Fortuna Düsseldorf, but decided against the move to Germany. The Swifts were a poor side that were regularly beaten heavily, though the near constant barrage of shots he faced enabled Southall <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> his shot-stopping skills.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí was {{inspired}} above all by mediaeval Gothic art, but wanted <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> its structural solutions. Neo-gothic {{was one of}} the most successful historicist styles at that time, above all as a result of the theoretical studies of Viollet-le-Duc. Gaudí studied examples in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in depth, as well as Leonese and Castillian buildings during his stays in León and Burgos, and became convinced that it was an imperfect style, leaving major structural issues only partly resolved. In his works he eliminated the need of buttresses through the use of ruled surfaces, and abolished crenellations and excessive openwork.|$|E
5|$|Game {{development}} {{began by}} late 2008. There was high staff turnover {{from the previous}} Saints Row team with one-fifth of the final 100-person staff having worked on a previous title in the series. They aimed <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> the series by giving the game a coherent tone, and found it in films such as Hot Fuzz and the game's signature sex toy bat. Saints Row: The Third was built using the Havok physics engine.|$|E
5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not {{to go out on a}} second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E

Damon Hill was able <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> his disastrous Friday session before the red flag, improving his time by one second and qualifying fourth as a result. A time posted by Ratzenberger before his fatal crash would have been sufficient for entry into the race starting from the 26th and final position on the grid; Paul Belmondo and Barrichello did not qualify.|$|E
5|$|Since MD 404 is {{the main}} route for {{travelers}} between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches, the road has a high accident rate. <b>To</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> this situation, the Maryland State Highway Administration is planning to widen the two-lane portions of the route into a four-lane divided highway. A portion of the road east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County received $7.7 million for widening {{as a part of}} the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009; this section was widened in 2012. Widening on the remainder of MD 404 between US 50 and Denton is expected to be completed in 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{entered the}} 1995 season after having {{finished}} with an 84 overall record in 1994. That season culminated with a 4523 loss to Tennessee in the 1994 Gator Bowl. Heading into the 1995 season, fans and coaches expected Tech <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> its previous performance. Most commentators, however, expected a season comparable to 1994's: a second-place {{finish in the}} Big East {{and a trip to}} the Gator Bowl. This was borne out by the preseason college football polls. The AP Poll put Tech 24th, while the coaches' poll had Tech 26th.|$|E

5|$|As {{the top ten}} took to {{the track}} for the final part of qualifying, Nico Rosberg was unable to beat his time set in Q2 with his first fast lap. Hamilton however {{improved}} on his time, being more than three-tenths of a second faster than Rosberg. When both drivers were unable <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> their times with their second timed laps, Hamilton took the 44th pole position of his career. Row two was {{taken up by the}} two Finns, Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas, who narrowly beat the two Lotuses of Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado. Both Lotus drivers had emerged from their pit boxes simultaneously for their final timed laps, entering the track side-by-side. The two Red Bulls finished eighth and ninth, splitting the two Force India cars of Nico Hülkenberg and Sergio Pérez.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{suffered}} {{its final}} disappointment {{of the season}} on March 17 as it fell to the Princeton Tigers. Bill Clark remained suspended and Damian Saunders led the team with only 14 points. Duquesne dominated the game early on, taking a 20–11 lead before Princeton came back, eventually leading 28–23 at the half. The Dukes were unable to turn the momentum and continued to fall behind, eventually losing 51–65. The absence of Bill Clark showed on defense, as the Dukes were out-rebounded heavily. The Dukes also failed <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> their issues from the regular season, going only 8 for 18 from the free throw line and 3 for 15 from 3-point range. This loss ended the 2009 season, and all Duquesne could do was look ahead to the next year.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call a special session of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it had not been able <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special session of the legislature. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.|$|E

5|$|England {{travelled}} to Australia and New Zealand {{in early}} 2008 attempting <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> their previous visits. In ten ODI matches in Australia against their hosts previously, England had only managed one win, while against New Zealand they had won just three of fifteen contests. England started badly, losing {{two of their}} warm-up matches by significant margins, and then falling 21 runs short in the Twenty20 match which opened the series. Taylor top-scored for England in their Twenty20 defeat with 34 runs from 32 balls. She made a similar score in the first ODI match against the hosts, but in the second match both Taylor and Edwards were out for ducks in a heavy defeat for England. After the third match of the series was abandoned without any play, Taylor scored her first half-century of the tour, and shared a century partnership with Edwards to help England secure a 2–1 lead in the series, guaranteeing that they would at least draw the five-match contest. After Australia won the last ODI to tie the series, the two sides met at the Bradman Oval to play the only Test of the tour. Taylor and Edwards again enjoyed a successful partnership in England's first innings; Taylor scored 79 runs as the pair put on 159 together. She scored an unbeaten half-century in the second innings to help England to retain the Ashes.|$|E
5|$|Ewbank {{maintained}} through {{training camp}} that second-year Mike Taliaferro was the number-one quarterback and disappointed a sellout crowd at Houston's Rice Stadium by keeping Namath {{on the bench}} at the Jets' season opener. Ewbank felt that Namath might not be ready for several more weeks, but Werblin intervened. Namath saw his first regular season action in the AFL the next week against the Kansas City Chiefs (the former Dallas Texans), and he was starting quarterback the following week against the Buffalo Bills. Namath's performance was inconsistent as he gained pro experience, but he was named AFL Rookie of the Year. The Jets finished the season 5–8–1 again. Beginning in 1966, the Jets began <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> the field behind Namath, who led them to a 6–6–2 record. That season, the NFL and AFL announced a merger, which would be effective in 1970. A championship game (it {{came to be known}} as the Super Bowl), played between the two league champions, would follow each season until the merger took place.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008–09 season a 5–1 {{victory over}} Newcastle United in December gave Liverpool a three-point {{lead in the}} league {{with half of the}} season remaining. They did not win any games in January, and despite good form for the {{remainder}} of the season, were unable to catch Manchester United and finished in second place. In the FA and League Cup as they were eliminated in the fourth round. In the UEFA Champions League, they were again eliminated by Chelsea, this time at the quarter-final stage. The 2009–10 season was a disappointment for Liverpool as they were unable <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>on</b> the previous season's performance, finishing seventh in the league. They lost eleven matches, nine more than the previous season, to finish outside the top four for the first time since 2005. The club also suffered poor form in the UEFA Champions League, they were eliminated in the group stages and subsequently entered the UEFA Cup (now rebranded as the UEFA Europa League). In the Europa League they reached the semi-finals. Their opponents were Spanish team Atlético Madrid, who progressed to the final on the away goals rule after the tie finished 2–2 on aggregate. Benitez left the club by mutual consent at the end of the season and was replaced by Roy Hodgson.|$|E
