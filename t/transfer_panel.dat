40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is driven by}} the desire to find an alternative method of obtaining fresh water. More specifically, fresh water is to be obtained by condensation of atmospheric water vapor on a surface maintained below the dew point by a radiative heat loss from its surface to the night sky. To properly simulate the condensation process, an accurate estimation of the effective sky temperature is required. To estimate the effective night sky temperature an experimental system, consisting of a series of metal plates embedded on a heat <b>transfer</b> <b>panel,</b> a weather station and a control system, was built. The temperature of each plate was controlled using an electric flat-plate heater. A control loop was implemented to ensure that the heat <b>transfer</b> <b>panel</b> was adjusted automatically to always be oriented perpendicular to the wind direction. In addition to the effective night sky temperature, the experimental system was designed to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficient between the plates and ambient air as well as the surface emissivity of the plates. The results obtained from theoretical analyses and preliminary experiments are presented and discussed. Special emphasis was given to mathematical solution of the system of equations that need to be solved to obtain the effective sky temperature. It was shown that, although the solution of the system of equations was straightforward for the direct heat transfer problem, there was a serious difficulty to solve the inverse heat transfer problem to retrieve the desired parameters...|$|E
40|$|HD Radio ™ poses a new {{challenge}} to STLs, requiring the ability to transport an Ethernet channel at 300 kbps along side a 44. 1 kHz sampled AES digital stereo pair and ultimately fit them into a single 300 kHz STL channel. This requirement is only possible with latest generation digital STLs operating with very high efficiency, e. g. 128 QAM. As QAM rates are increased, also is the sensitivity to multipath. “Hitless ” switching enables real time space diversity antenna systems to combat instantaneous multipath fading on microwave paths that commonly occurs in Spring and Fall seasons.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis research is to test the applicability of a novel heat and moisture <b>transfer</b> <b>panel</b> (HAMP) in an office building to control the space humidity. A HAMP is a panel that uses a liquid desiccant to add or remove heat and moisture to or from a space. This thesis research uses the TRNSYS computer package to model an office building in four different cities representing four climatic conditions. The cities are Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; Chicago, Illinois; Phoenix, Arizona; and Miami, Florida; representing cold-dry, cool-humid, hot-dry, and hot-humid climates, respectively. The HAMP is employed in the office building with a radiant ceiling panel (RCP) system. Three other HVAC systems are examined and compared to the system employing the HAMP. The systems are: a conventional all-air system, a RCP system with 100 % outdoor air, a RCP system with a parallel dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), and the RCP system with the HAMP and 100 % outdoor air. In the latter, the HAMP covers 10 % of the ceiling area and uses lithium chloride solution as the liquid desiccant at different temperatures and concentrations. The {{results show that the}} HAMP is able to control the space humidity within the control limits in all climates. The HAMP also shows the ability to provide better humidity control than the other systems as it directly responds to the space latent loads. The HAMP is able to control the relative humidity between 26 % RH and 62 %, 24 % RH and 57 % RH, 27 % RH and 60 %, and 40 % RH and 62 % RH in Chicago, Saskatoon, Phoenix, and Miami, respectively. The HAMP is able to achieve a relative humidity of 35 % in Chicago, Saskatoon, and Phoenix for 14 %, 13 %, and 20 % of the working hours of the year, respectively. It is also able to achieve a relative humidity of 60 % in Chicago, and Miami 10 % and 55 % of the working hours of the year, respectively. The results also show the potential of the RCP system with the HAMP to reduce the total energy consumed by a conventional all-air system in the hot climates by 40 %, and 54 % in Miami and Phoenix respectively, and in the cold climates by 14 % and 23 % in Saskatoon and Chicago, respectively...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} aspect {{in the design}} of buildings is the comfort of the occupants inside the building. Although many factors can affect comfort, the factor of particular interest in this research is the indoor humidity level. High indoor humidity levels can make the indoor air feel stuffy at warm temperatures and reduce the amount of moisture that can be removed from a person’s body, making a person feel warm. On the other hand, low indoor humidity levels can cause health problems such as dry eyes and sore throats. In addition to the comfort implications of improperly maintaining indoor humidity levels, the building itself can suffer from mould growth and rotting materials at high humidity levels. 	 This thesis presents the first research on a novel panel that can simultaneously transfer heat and moisture to/from an occupied space. The panel is referred to as a heat and moisture <b>transfer</b> <b>panel</b> (HAMP). A HAMP is similar in design to a radiant ceiling panel, but uses a liquid desiccant as the heat and moisture transfer medium and the surface of the panel is made of a semi-permeable membrane. A HAMP can be installed into a space and heat and moisture will be transferred between the liquid desiccant and the space air, through the membrane. The main objectives of this thesis are to design a prototype HAMP and to measure the performance of the HAMP under different operating conditions. The performance of the HAMP is quantified by the sensible and latent effectivenesses, as well as the total heat and mass flux between the HAMP and the air in the test section. The results of the experiments show that the HAMP is able to simultaneously transfer heat and moisture with the air in the test section under all operating conditions. The sensible and latent effectivenesses of the HAMP are higher when the air in the test section becomes unstable, due to the natural convection in the duct (sensible effectiveness ≈ 15 %, latent effectiveness ≈ 40 %). These include cases of cooling and/or dehumidification. The sensible and latent effectivenesses of the HAMP are lower when forced convection is dominant in the test section (sensible effectiveness ≈ 5 %, latent effectiveness ≈ 25 %). This occurs during cases of heating and/or humidification. The presence of natural convection in the test section is confirmed with flow visualization photographs. The photographs show laminar boundary layer flow during the stable airflow cases, and the presence of convection roll cells during the unstable airflow cases. The total heat flux increases with an increase in the temperature difference between the panel and the air and the mass flux increases with an increase in the humidity ratio difference between the panel and the air. For a temperature difference of 10 °C, the prototype HAMP can provide ~ 4 W/m 2 of cooling. This is small compared to the actual cooling loads that would be required in a space. The HAMP is able to provide enough moisture transfer to remove the moisture generated by one person (~ 70 g/hr), with ~ 2 m 2 of panel surface area. Although the rate of heat transfer between the HAMP and the airflow is limited, the moisture transfer rates are very good. An analysis of standard heat exchanger correlations typically used to predict the effectiveness of a heat exchanger shows that these methods are not applicable for a HAMP. Instead, new correlations must be developed to predict the sensible and latent effectivenesses of a HAMP. These correlations are not determined in this thesis, but an analysis of the experimental data is presented to show that the effectivenesses are functions of several design parameters such as the number of heat transfer units (NTUexp), the number of mass transfer units (NTUm,exp), the effective Rayleigh number of the air (Ra+), the operating condition factor (H*) and the ratio of NTUexp/NTUm,exp. The experimental results presented in this thesis show that a HAMP can be used to simultaneously transfer heat and moisture with the air in a space, and may be used as a ceiling panel in a space to simultaneously control the temperature and relative humidity of the air. The performance of a HAMP can be determined using two parameters: NTUexp and NTUm,exp. Determining these two parameters is very complicated and involves analysis of several design parameters, such as NTUtheo, NTUm,theo, H*, Ra+ and the ratio NTUexp/NTUm,exp. The experimental data collected in this thesis was used to analyze the relationships between NTUexp and NTUm,exp and these design parameters and is a starting point for future research on developing a correlation for predicting the performance of a HAMP...|$|E
