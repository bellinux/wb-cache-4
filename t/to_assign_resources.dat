40|$|An {{important}} task of business process design {{is the definition}} of what and how members of an organization are involved in the activities of the business processes developed within it. in this paper we analyse the capabilities of BPMN 2. 0, the de-facto standard for business process modelling, in this regard. The conclusion is that, although it provides some mechanisms <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> <b>resources</b> to business process activities, they present several drawbacks. On the one hand, it does not provide a clear way to relate the assignment of resources with a model {{of the structure of the}} organization. On the other hand, it relies on XPath as the default language <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> <b>resources</b> to activities. The consequence is that it has limitations regarding the expressiveness of resource assignment expressions. Furthermore, it makes resource assignment not easy to learn and use since XPath has not been designed for that purpose. To overcome these drawbacks we introduce RAL (Resource Assignment Language), a DSL based on a well-known organizational metamodel that can be used together with BPMN 2. 0. RAL provides more expressiveness to the resource assignments and it uses a high-level sintaxis defined to be used by technically unskilled users...|$|E

We formulate a processor-sharing queuing model for the multi-threaded server architecture to precisely predict service rate for worker threads. In addition, the proposed scheme uses the sleep actuator <b>to</b> properly <b>assign</b> <b>resources</b> based on the calculated service rate.

30|$|The {{capacity}} allocation problem arising at {{the provider}} side involves deciding the optimal placement of running applications on a suitable number of VMs, {{which in turn}} has to be executed on appropriate physical servers. The rationale is <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> <b>resource</b> shares trying <b>to</b> minimize management costs (formed mainly by costs associated with energy consumption), while guaranteeing the fulfilment of SLAs stipulated with the customers. Bin packing is a common modeling abstraction [51], but its NP-hardness calls for heuristic solutions. In [127] the capacity allocation problem is solved by means of a dynamic algorithm, since static allocation policies and pricing usually lead to inefficient resource sharing, poor utilization, waste of resources and revenue loss when demands and workloads are time varying. The paper presents a Minimum Cost Maximum Flow (MCMF) algorithm and compares it against a modified Bin-Packing formulation; the MCMF algorithm exhibits very good performance and scalability properties. An autoregressive process is used to predict the fluctuating incoming demand.|$|R

To achieve them, sufficient resources, like CPU and memory, must be allocated to each application. However, workload fluctuations might arise, and so, resource demands will vary.

Also, due to the complexity and size of current and future systems, self-adaptive solutions are essential.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} RAP, {{a technique}} that can allow cloud SPs <b>to</b> <b>assign</b> <b>resources</b> to applications to meet SLOs. RAP exploits the predictable, bursty workload patterns experienced by enterprise applications. Given traces that capture the workload behavior {{of a set of}} applications, RAP automatically discovers time varying resource allocation plans that globally minimize SLO violations across the applications. In particular, RAP exploits burstiness to suggest plans that use lesser resources to satisfy SLOs than burstiness agnostic techniques. In resource constrained scenarios, RAP balances out SLO violations uniformly across applications thereby reducing the risk of SPs incurring large penalties due to extreme violations. We also show that the approach outperforms the prevalent practice of enforcing resource utilization thresholds.|$|E

On the other hand, for semipersistent scheduling, UEs are granted resources for a longer time interval and these grants need to be reconfigured for the handover.
