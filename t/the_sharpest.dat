5|$|Today some of <b>the</b> <b>sharpest</b> opening {{variations}} {{have been}} analyzed so deeply {{that they are}} often used as drawing weapons. For example, at the highest levels, Black often uses the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez, a line where Black sacrifices a pawn for strong attacking chances, to obtain an endgame where Black is still a pawn down but is able to draw with correct play.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such that the word mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with Müllerian mimicry, a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may have a degree of protection itself, the distinction is not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of mimicry. Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>sharpest</b> contrast here is with aggressive mimicry, where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.|$|E
5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of <b>the</b> <b>sharpest</b> exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E

5|$|Among constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux {{triangle}} has {{the minimum}} area and <b>the</b> <b>sharpest</b> (smallest) possible angle (120°) at its corners. By several numerical measures {{it is the}} farthest from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding the points of an integer lattice, and {{is closely related to}} the shape of the quadrilateral maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within a square while at all times touching all four sides of the square, and has the smallest possible area of shapes with this property. However, although it covers most of the square in this rotation process, it fails to cover {{a small fraction of the}} square's area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within a square, the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.|$|E
5|$|The angles made by {{each pair}} of arcs {{at the corners of}} a Reuleaux {{triangle}} are all equal to 120°. This is <b>the</b> <b>sharpest</b> possible angle at any vertex of any curve of constant width. Additionally, among the curves of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle is the one with both the largest and the smallest inscribed equilateral triangles. The largest equilateral triangle inscribed in a Reuleaux triangle is the one connecting its three corners, and the smallest one is the one connecting the three midpoints of its sides. The subset of the Reuleaux triangle consisting of points belonging to three or more diameters is the interior of the larger of these two triangles; it has a larger area than the set of three-diameter points of any other curve of constant width.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{rigidity}} scenario for complete Riemannian manifolds supporting the Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principle with <b>the</b> <b>sharp</b> constant in R^n (shortly, sharp HPW principle).

However, positive extremals exist in <b>the</b> <b>sharp</b> HPW principle {{if and only if}} (M,g) is isometric to R^n, n= dim(M). (b) When (M,g) has non-negative Ricci curvature, <b>the</b> <b>sharp</b> HPW principle holds on (M,g) if and only if (M,g) is isometric to R^n.

25|$|Over all of Mercury, the {{crispness}} of crater rims and the morphology {{of their}} walls, central peaks, ejecta deposits, and secondary-crater fields have undergone systematic changes with time.
