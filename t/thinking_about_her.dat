Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy.

At Floyd's wedding, Wesley, who is English, tells Liz that he does not want to go back to England, as he does not want to witness the 2012 Summer Olympics, which is scheduled to take place in London, explaining [...] "Did you see the Beijing opening ceremonies? We don't have control over our people like that." [...] The episode's title is a reference to the Emmanuelle series of erotic films.|$|E
500|$|... "Siempre Tú" [...] was {{composed}} by Muñiz in Los Angeles {{along with its}} producers Nico Stadi and Mike Green. It was recorded {{in the same city}} at the Pulse Music Group Studios. The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he started to say phrases [...] "like when you think about your girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which you can tell a person that you miss her, that you are always <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter. [...] "Siempre Tú" [...] was released worldwide on 21 April 2017 through Warner Music Mexico. The accompanying cover artwork shows Muñiz sitting on a chair looking off in the far distance against a backdrop of a street with tall buildings.|$|E
500|$|When {{reviewing}} [...] "Ensign Ro" [...] for Tor.com, DeCandido described Michelle Forbes as [...] "stellar" [...] {{and called}} Ro [...] "one of TNGs best recurring characters". He also {{added that the}} character was [...] "a bit of piss and vinegar {{to add to the}} syrupy mix of homogeneity that the TNG cast tends to be". In his review of [...] "Preemptive Strike", he said that the Ro character arc [...] "comes full circle: once again making a decision that puts her on the outs with Starfleet." [...] He praised Forbes again, saying that she [...] "inhabits the character so completely, from her awkwardness at the reception in her honor to her playing the role of rebel, to her pain at <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> father... to her decision to betray Starfleet and the Enterprise." [...] He did criticise the episode for not wrapping up the Riker-Ro relationship {{in the same way that}} closure had been given to her friendship with Picard. Zack Handlen reviewed [...] "Ensign Ro" [...] for The A.V. Club, and described Ro as [...] "terrific" [...] and said that the role represented [...] "one of the rare times that TNG has managed to have a frustrated character who doesn't immediately seem overly hateful or falsely confrontational". But he criticized the manner in which her opinion changed to be more favourable of Picard and the Enterprise, as he felt that Guinan's intervention was detrimental to the plot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] nodded the doctor. He {{looked at}} Anne {{as if he}} were <b>thinking</b> some things <b>about</b> <b>her</b> that couldn't be {{expressed}} in words. Later on, however, he expressed them to Mr. and Mrs. Barry.|$|R

50|$|Judy Blume {{states in}} her book Places I Never Meant to Be {{this was the only}} book she has written she has voluntarily censored. In the {{original}} draft submitted to her editor, the character Davey masturbates while <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> Wolf. <b>Her</b> editor pointed out the book was likely to be read by many more young readers if the scene was left out. After agonizing over the decision, Blume agreed and removed the passage.|$|R
500|$|Hamasaki's lyrics, all her own, have {{resonated}} {{among her}} fans, who praise {{them as being}} honest and heartfelt and [...] "expressing determination"; in two surveys conducted by Oricon, respondents voted Hamasaki's lyrics as their favorite aspect of her artistry. Steve McClure of The Japan Times noted that Hamasaki has [...] "developed {{a reputation as a}} thoughtful, introspective lyricist"; Barry Walters of The Village Voice comments that Hamasaki's lyrics [...] "pack unlikely insights". Having [...] "trouble voicing her thoughts", Hamasaki uses her lyrics as an outlet; she draws inspiration from her own (and occasionally her friends') experiences and emotions and tries to put them [...] "honestly into words". She has stated that honesty is essential to her lyrics, saying, [...] "If I write when I'm low, it will be a dark song, but I don't care. I want to be honest with myself at all times." [...] This meant that she did not use English lyrics until her album Rainbow, as she felt that she could best express herself in Japanese. As with her musical style, the themes of her lyrics have varied. Her debut album A Song for ×× dealt mostly with themes of [...] "loneliness and confusion", as did her second album Loveppears. Duty likewise expressed feelings of disappointment and confusion. Hamasaki began to take on a more global outlook with her following albums I Am... and Rainbow, branching out to wider themes such as faith and peace. Music critic Tetsu Misaki noted a large change in her lyrics style between her debut album A Song for ×× (1999), which mostly dealt with personal problems, and her following albums Loveppears and Duty. Misaki believed Hamasaki had begun <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> influence on society more, and began writing songs with important messages she wanted to express to her listeners. This was signalled by her not using first person pronouns as much, and instead using the words [...] and [...] more often. As Hamasaki matured, her lyrics began to express more confidence; themes in her later albums included love and the struggles of women. With Guilty, Hamasaki began to compose her lyrics not only as an exposition of her personal feelings but as encouragements for her listeners, an outlook she applied in Next Level as well. In songs such as [...] "Talkin' 2 Myself" [...] and [...] "Mirrorcle World", Hamasaki deals with the [...] "awareness and fighting spirit of surviving in a high-risk age" [...] to encourage listeners; in [...] "Rollin'" [...] (from Next Level), Hamasaki writes, [...] "The age is rolling around/At the speed of heading toward the end/Beyond the border/Disappointment and hope fight with each other". In addition to personal experiences and feelings, Hamasaki bases lyrics on sources such as historical events. The life of Joan of Arc was the inspiration for [...] "Free & Easy", while a story told to her by her friend about a saint named Mary served as the basis for [...] "M"; the September 11 attacks inspired [...] "A Song Is Born".|$|E
2500|$|... "Dōke" [...] was {{originally}} performed in 2002, and [...] "Kono Mune no Kurushimi ga Itooshii Hodo ni Ikite" [...] was performed at Kokia's special [...] concert in late 2004.

Kokia wrote [...] "Hana Utage" [...] on March the 13th, 2007, after performing a concert at Minamihokke-ji in Takatori, Nara. [...] "Hoshikuzu no Vocalize" [...] {{was written on}} November the 23rd, 2008, after <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> grandparents (her grandmother had died several days before, and her grandfather earlier in 2006).|$|E
2500|$|Though {{her works}} entail unusual {{materials}} such as plastic gels, sequins, pools of ink and tinted fluids, but not paint itself, Schumacher’s use of form and colour is said to derive from painterly <b>thinking.</b> <b>About</b> <b>her</b> largescale monochromatic painting [...] "Along the Square", the Marli Hoppe-Ritter Collection observes that the work [...] "brings key questions about painting together—such as the relationship between surface and depth, the effect of colour, and {{last but not least}} the relationship between concrete geometrical form and the representation of visible reality." [...] An essay in the artist's 2012 catalog focusses on Schumacher's use of reflective materials: [...] "Extension of space through mirrored surfaces is patently Schumacherian. The imaginary and real co-mingle in a spatial mirror painting, ensnared by its reflective surfaces and coaxed into dialogue by the entranced viewer." ...|$|E
