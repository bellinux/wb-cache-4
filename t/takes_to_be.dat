25|$|In general, Tacitus {{does not}} fear to praise and {{to criticize the}} same person, often noting what he <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their more-admirable and less-admirable properties. One of Tacitus's {{hallmarks}} is refraining from conclusively taking sides for or against persons he describes, which has led some to interpret his works as both supporting and rejecting the imperial system (see Tacitean studies, Black vs. Red Tacitists).|$|E
25|$|Hauerwas {{believes}} {{that there is a}} difference between the concept of death and the criteria for death. The concept of death “involves a philosophical judgment of a significant change that has happened in a person” and therefore “is a correlative of what one <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the necessary condition of human life, e.g., … the potential for consciousness”. The criteria of death, however, are “those empirical measurements that can be made to determine whether a person is dead, such as cessation of respiration or a flat EEG”. Thus, brain death is a criterion of death that may serve “as a symbol of when it is time to die”. A person must not delay death so long that it is no longer possible to die a good death.|$|E

He knows he can shape and reshape his own self-identity. Nothing binds him to his relationships. Nothing binds him to his past actions. In the end though, he also knows he lacks a consistent understanding of who he is. He lacks a self that resists his own power of reinterpretation. His older friend Judge William, argues that a deeper concept of selfhood is discovered as one commits to one's actions, and takes ownership of the past and present. A concept of oneself, as this particular human being, begins to take form in one's own consciousness.|$|E

However, Natasha really wants to get her father's attention and she chooses to rebel, so that he notices her.

Many of the film's {{aesthetics}} were borrowed from Indian theatre, of which Nagarajan was an artist. The competition sequence between Ganesan and Padmini took about nine <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> filmed. The film presented a mise-en-scène feel, mostly using frontal shots. The actors {{were lined up}} to face the camera and deliver their dialogue. Nagarajan, a former employee of the T. K.

500|$|Later on in {{the same}} essay, she commented that Brandon both {{embodied}} and rejected traditional masculinity, providing a new outlook on {{what it means to}} be a man which excited and thrilled the women in the film: [...] "Brandon’s performance of masculinity, however, can be interpreted as operating on two levels in the narratives: When Brandon tries to establish his male identity with his new buddies, he imitates the kind of overly aggressive macho machismo that John and Tom represent. But Lana falls for Brandon because of his version of masculinity, which contradicts and challenges traditional assumptions about what it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a man and to please a woman. Brandon’s articulation of manhood effectively mocks sexist masculine ideals and appropriates the codes of normative masculinity."

500|$|At World's End {{was meant}} to return it tonally to a {{character}} piece. Sparrow, in particular, is tinged with madness after extended solitary confinement in Davy Jones's Locker, and now desires immortality. Sparrow struggles with what it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a moral person, after his honest streak caused his doom in the second film. This is mainly shown by his increasingly erratic behaviour and Jack's hallucinations, which appeared to be simply his deranged mind in the beginning where dozens of [...] "Jack Sparrows" [...] appeared to crew the ship in his solitary exile, but later the hallucinations grew more important and there were mainly two [...] "Jacks" [...] constantly arguing about which path to follow: the immortality or the mortality. The last hallucination took place while Jack was imprisoned on the Dutchman, where his honest streak won (possibly due to not liking his sea creature-like [...] "future", which comedically dropped his brain and searched for it around the Brig). By the end of At World's End, Sparrow is sailing to the Fountain of Youth, an early concept for the second film. Rossio said in 2007 that a fourth film was possible, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer expressed interest in a spin-off. Gore Verbinski concurred that [...] "all of the stories {{set in motion by}} the first film have been resolved. If there ever were another Pirates of the Caribbean film, I would start fresh and focus on the further adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholar Zofia Burr, {{who calls}} Angelou's poetry [...] "unabashedly public in its ambitions", connects Angelou's lack of {{critical}} acclaim {{to both the}} public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou's popular success, and to critics' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal, performed one. Bloom agrees, stating that Angelou's acclaim has been public rather than critical. Critic James Finn Cotter, in his review of Oh Pray, calls it an [...] "unfortunate example {{of the dangers of}} success" [...] and states that Angelou's fame has [...] "muted the private and personal quality that it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> essential to poetry". Critic John Alfred Avant, {{despite the fact that the}} volume was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, states that Diiie [...] "isn't accomplished, not by any means". Even critics who value poetry as an oral tradition devalue Angelou's poetry; critic Bryan D. Bourn, who praises her for using African oral tradition, states that she [...] "slips into banality when she abandons" [...] them and criticizes her for not catering to poetry critics. Scholar Joanne Braxton asserts that [...] "Angelou's audience, composed largely of women and blacks, isn't really affected by what white and/or male critics of the dominant literary tradition have to say about her work. This audience does not read literary critics; it does read Maya Angelou". Burr condemns Angelou's critics for their narrow view of poetry, which has resulted in their negative reviews of her poetry, and for not taking into account Angelou's larger purposes in her writing: [...] "to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional".|$|E
