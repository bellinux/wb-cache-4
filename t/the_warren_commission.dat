5|$|On November 29, 1963, Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson {{appointed}} Ford to <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission,</b> {{a special}} task force {{set up to}} investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of Lee Harvey Oswald, the accused assassin. According to a 1963 FBI memo released in 2008, Ford was {{in contact with the}} FBI throughout his time on <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> and relayed information to the deputy director, Cartha DeLoach, about the panel's activities. In the preface to his book, A Presidential Legacy and <b>The</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission,</b> Ford defended the work of the commission and reiterated his support of its conclusions.|$|E
5|$|Ford died on December 26, 2006, at {{his home}} in Rancho Mirage, California, of arteriosclerotic {{cerebrovascular}} disease and diffuse arteriosclerosis. He had end-stage coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis and insufficiency, caused by calcific alteration of one of his heart valves. He was 93. Ford died on the 34th anniversary of President Harry Truman's death; he was the last surviving member of <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> and {{was asked}} about the gunfire and whether he knew its source. He said he had not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, but he could not say with any certainty.|$|E
5000|$|Lindenberg {{confirmed}} <b>the</b> official <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> Report of President Kennedy’s death, that {{a single}} bullet had struck Kennedy and Governor John Connally.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1984, Altgens shared {{personal}} details and recollections in letters and telephone conversations {{for the book}} Pictures of the Pain: Photography and the Assassination of President Kennedy (1994). His story would be expanded and highlighted for the 1998 follow-up That Day In Dallas. In his correspondence, Altgens said he expected that some controversy over {{the details of the}} assassination would always exist, but those researchers who tried to sway him from <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commissions</b> conclusion (that Oswald, acting alone, killed Kennedy) had failed to do so.|$|R

5|$|JFK is a 1991 American conspiracy-thriller film {{directed}} by Oliver Stone. It examines {{the events leading}} to the assassination of John F. Kennedy and alleged cover-up {{through the eyes of}} former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner). Garrison filed charges against New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) for his alleged participation in a conspiracy to assassinate the President, for which Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) was found responsible by <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission.</b>|$|E
5|$|After a tour in Vienna, Austria and Russian {{language}} {{training at the}} U.S. Army Russian Institute in Oberammergau, Matlock arrived in Moscow {{for the first time}} in 1961. Initially a Vice Consul, Matlock met with individuals seeking to visit or emigrate to the United States. His most famous case was Lee Harvey Oswald, who applied for a repatriation loan to return to the United States after having previously moved to the Soviet Union. Indeed, according to the records received by <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission,</b> in May 1962, Jack Matlock conducted the exit interview which enabled the Oswald family to leave the USSR and return to the USA.|$|E
5|$|Breyer {{served as}} a law clerk to Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg during the 1964 term (list), and served briefly as a fact-checker for <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission.</b> He was a special {{assistant}} to the United States Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust from 1965 to 1967 and an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in 1973. Breyer was a special counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary from 1974 to 1975 and served as chief counsel of the committee from 1979 to 1980. He worked closely with the chairman of the committee, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, to pass the Airline Deregulation Act that closed the Civil Aeronautics Board.|$|E
50|$|Numerous researchers, {{including}} Mark Lane, Henry Hurt, Michael L. Kurtz, Gerald D. McKnight, Anthony Summers, Harold Weisberg, {{and others}} have pointed out what they characterize as inconsistencies, oversights, exclusions of evidence, errors, changing stories, or changes made to witness testimony in <b>the</b> official <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> investigation, which they say could suggest a cover-up.|$|R
2500|$|I as in Icarus is a 1979 French {{conspiracy}} thriller with Yves Montand as {{a lawyer}} investigating {{the assassination of the}} President. The movie is inspired by the Kennedy assassination and <b>the</b> subsequent <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> investigation. Digging into the psychology of the Lee Harvey Oswald type character, the attorney finds out the [...] "decoy shooter" [...] participated in the Milgram experiment. The ongoing experiment is presented to the unsuspecting lawyer.|$|R
50|$|Her {{career in}} radio started in May 1971, when {{as a guest}} on the {{independently}} owned radio station KLRB, she questioned <b>the</b> 26-volume <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> Hearings. She suggested Lee Harvey Oswald {{might not have been}} the only person involved in the assassination of the president. She became a weekly guest. Shortly after, she became the host of Dialogue: Conspiracy (later renamed World Watchers International). From 1983 to 1988, she hosted the same show on KAZU, a radio station based in Pacific Grove.|$|R
5|$|John F. Kennedy {{was assassinated}} at 12:30p.m. Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC) on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was fatally shot while {{traveling}} {{with his wife}} Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and the latter's wife Nellie, in a Presidential motorcade. The ten-month investigation by <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> of 1963–1964 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald in police custody. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found {{that as many as}} 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Cooper was re-elected, {{securing}} {{his first}} full, six-year {{term in the}} Senate. Newly elected President John F. Kennedy– Cooper's former Senate colleague– chose Cooper to conduct a secret fact-finding mission to Moscow and New Delhi. Following Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Cooper to <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> to investigate the assassination. Cooper soon became an outspoken opponent of Johnson's decision to escalate U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War, consistently advocating negotiation with the North Vietnamese instead. After Cooper's re-election in 1966, he worked with Idaho Democrat Frank Church {{on a series of}} amendments designed to de-fund further U.S. military operations in the region. These amendments were hailed as the first serious attempt by Congress to curb presidential authority over military operations during an ongoing war. Aging and increasingly deaf, Cooper did not seek re-election in 1972. His last acts of public service were as Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976 and as an alternate delegate to the United Nations in 1981. He died in a Washington, D.C., retirement home on February 21, 1991, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E

40|$|A {{third of}} a century has passed since President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and yet no {{adequate}} government investigation of the murder has ever been undertaken. <b>The</b> laughable <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> investigation of 1963 - 64, which found that Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone, killed JFK, was hurried and superficial. The more reliable U. S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations investigation of 1977 - 78, which found that the JFK slaying resulted from a conspiracy of persons whose identities were unknown, was hampered by political bickering, missing documents, fading memories, and unavailable witnesses...|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to his 1950s productions, several of Cartier's later works have also been regarded as influential. His 1962 production of Wuthering Heights was praised by Dennis Potter, then a television critic, who wrote in the Daily Herald newspaper that the production [...] "was like a thunderstorm on the flat, dreary plains of the week's television... The howl of the wind against the windows, the muted pain of Claire Bloom as the wretched Cathy, and the hunted misery of Keith Mitchell as Heathcliff, made this a more than adequate offering of a great work." [...] While Screenonline states that Lee Oswald—Assassin (1966) [...] "could be argued [...] of historical interest only", due to its basis in <b>the</b> flawed <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> report, <b>The</b> Times praised it as being [...] "possibly the first drama-documentary".|$|R

5000|$|As Lifton was methodically {{working through}} <b>the</b> 26-volume <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> report and exhibits, he {{stumbled}} upon {{what would become}} the fulcrum of his narrative, the answer he was looking for. He read, {{according to a report by}} FBI agents Siebert and O'Neill who attended the autopsy and took notes on everything they observed, that it was [...] "apparent that a tracheotomy had been performed...as well as surgery of the head area, namely, in the top of the skull." [...] Since Lifton knew that there was no surgery to the head in Dallas, this was the fact that intensified and focused his research, leading ultimately to the synthesis of the contradictory Dallas/Bethesda evidence to his conclusion that there was intentional fraud, that is, as Lifton puts it, a “medical forgery” to the body of the President.|$|R

5000|$|In 1989, Warren was {{appointed}} {{executive officer of}} the California State Lands Commission. In 1993, while working as executive director of <b>the</b> Lands <b>Commission,</b> <b>Warren</b> encouraged Mobil to pursue a proposal to use land-based horizontal drilling to access offshore oil near Santa Barbara. The proposal, known as the [...] "Clearview project", was opposed by environmentalists. It required approval from the University of California, Santa Barbara, which owned the drilling site. In 1995, the university refused to grant permission for drilling, citing incompatibility with nearby land uses. Mobil abandoned the project the following year.|$|R

25|$|The FBI {{stated that}} three bullets were fired during the Kennedy assassination; <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> {{agreed with the}} FBI {{investigation}} that three shots were fired but disagreed with the FBI report on which shots hit Kennedy and which hit Governor Connally. The FBI report claimed that the first shot hit President Kennedy, the second shot hit Governor Connally, and the third shot hit President Kennedy in the head, killing him. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> concluded {{that one of the}} three shots missed, one of the shots hit President Kennedy and then struck Governor Connally, and a third shot struck President Kennedy in the head, killing him.|$|E
25|$|In September 1964 <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> {{concluded}} that Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald.

I did not see the shots fired. I don't feel that anything I would have said would have had any bearing on their outcome." [...] He described books recent published by <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> critics as [...] "nothing but cheap sensationalism".|$|R

The book became a number one best seller and spent 29 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. The book criticizes in detail the work and conclusions of <b>the</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Commission</b> and {{remains one of the most}} remarkable books about the assassination of President John F.
