Therefore, {{development of a}} model utilizing a spontaneously arising mammary adenocarcinoma in Dark Agouti rats was adopted {{for the study of}} the dynamics of lymphoid cell infiltration during tumour development. Syngeneic rats were inoculated with tumour cell suspensions and the tumours were resected from 5 to 15 days. Serial sections were immunohistochemically stained using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Irrespective of tumour age, ED 2 (macrophages) and W 3 / 25 (CD 4) -positive cells were the most prominent cell infiltrates in tumours. There were no significant differences in cell counts for any marker between 8 -day and 15 -day tumours. However, in 5 -day tumours there were significantly fewer macrophages, OX 19 ⁺ T cells, W 3 / 25 ⁺ cells, OX 8 ⁺ (CD 8) cells and OX 62 ⁺ dendritic cells. Interleukin- 2 α receptor chain expression was low at all examined stages of tumour growth, indicating a lack of <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (TIL) activation and/or possible TIL anergy. B cell staining was absent in all tumours, negating the possibility of these cells mediating coregulatory signals for TIL activation in the micro-environment of established tumours.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{evidence}} suggests that CD 4 + CD 25 + FoxP 3 + regulatory T-cells (Treg) {{may be responsible for}} the failure of host anti-tumour immunity by suppressing cytotoxic T- cells. We assessed the prognostic significance of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in intestinal-type gastric cardiac cancer. Methods <b>Tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (TIL) subsets and tumour infiltrating macrophages (TIM) were investigated in 52 cases using tissue microarrays. The interrelationship between the cell populations (CD 3 +, CD 8 +, CD 20 +, CD 68 +, GranzymeB+, FoxP 3 +) in different compartments and NED-survival was investigated (median follow-up time: 61 months). Results Intraepithelial infiltration with TIL and TIM including Treg was generally low and not related to NED-survival. However, patients with large numbers of FoxP 3 + Treg in the tumour stroma (> 125. 9 FoxP 3 + TILs/mm 2) had a median survival time of 58 months while those with low FoxP 3 + TIL counts (+ TILs/mm 2) had a median survival time of 32 months (p = 0. 006). Patients with high versus low stromal CD 68 + /FoxP 3 + cell ratios in primary tumour displayed median survivals of 32 and 55 months, respectively (p = 0. 008). Conclusion Our results suggest that inflammatory processes within the tumour stroma of gastric intestinal-type adenocarcinomas located at the gastric cardia may affect outcome in two ways. Tumour-infiltrating macrophages are likely to promote carcinogenesis while large numbers of Treg are associated with improved outcome probably by inhibiting local inflammatory processes promoting carcinogenesis. Thus, inhibition of Treg may not be a feasible treatment option in gastric adenocarcinoma. </p...|$|E

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCES UNIVERSITY OF THE WITWATERSRAND, JOHANNESBURG 2014 Breast tumour progression involves complex interactions between malignant cells and the tumour microenvironment. It is increasingly apparent that immunity is a critical determinant for tumour progression. T regulatory (TREG) lymphocytes, which dominate <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> populations, are implicated in facilitating tumour immunoediting processes and suppressing Natural Killer (NK) cell anti-tumour function. To investigate such cellular interaction, experimentation traditionally involves using reductionist 2 -dimensional culture systems that do not recapitulate the spatial dimensions of the in vivo microenvironment. Three-dimensional (3 D) culture systems, conversely, recreate these dimensions, allowing tumour cells to assume a phenotype more representative of the tumour microenvironment. Given that immunity is {{a critical factor in}} determining tumour progression, a novel 3 D culture system was established to investigate the interactions between TREG lymphocytes, NK cells and hormone-dependent (MCF- 7) or hormone-independent (MDA-MB- 231) breast cancer cells. Lymphocyte subpopulations were magnetically isolated, with the efficacy of the sorting procedure verified using flow cytometry. To generate 3 D cultures, cell populations were resuspended in growth factor-reduced Matrigel and cultured for 72 hours. This culture system proved effective for RNA extraction for downstream applications; for immunolocalisation of selected tumour biomarkers (ER-α, TGF-β, MUC- 1 and EGFR) for qualitative analysis; and for acquisition of cytokine data (IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 6, TNF-α, IFN-, CCL 2, CCL 4 and CXCL 8) for quantitative multivariate statistical analysis. Immune mediation was shown to induce the disruption of cell-cell associations, altering the expression of biomarkers and secreted cytokine profiles. Collectively, these results reflect tumour cell subversion of NK cell and/or TREG lymphocyte function to promote tumour progression by generating an inflammatory microenvironment. While hormone-dependent and hormone-independent breast cancer cells differed in their specific response to immune mediation, the mechanisms by which they elicited responses resulted in similar outcomes – that of enhanced evasive and invasive capacity. It is necessary to further elucidate the relationship between the investigated cytokines, biomarkers and immune cells, to understand their interactions and potentially provide more information for therapeutic intervention, given that these factors may contribute to tumours not responding favourably to combined modalities of therapy...|$|E

This study set out to assess the relationship between (123) I-IL 2 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) findings and the presence of IL- 2 receptors (CD 25 staining) on tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes as well as on SCCHN tumour cells in patients suffering from SCCHN. Materials and methods Seventeen consecutive patients (12 men; mean age, 57 years) highly suspected to suffer from SSCHN were prospectively included in the study. All patients underwent planar and whole body (123) I-IL 2 scintigraphy and underwent surgery or had a biopsy taken within 1 week from imaging. Surgical resected primary lesions as well as biopsy material from primary tumours were histologically analysed with respect to the presence and intensity of CD 25 expression on <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and <b>tumour</b> cells (HSCORE).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Whereas the {{presence}} of a lymphoid infiltrate has been associated with a favourable prognosis in colorectal carcinoma, the proliferative and cytotoxic responses of freshly isolated <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are frequently impaired. In mice, tumour induced immune suppression has been associated with a decreased expression of the zeta-chain of the T cell receptor (TCR) -CD 3 complex, and loss of mRNA for granzyme B. AIM: To compare the expression of TCR-zeta and granzyme B in <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>infiltrating</b> normal colonic mucosa and Duke's A and D colorectal carcinomas. SPECIMENS: Paraffin wax embedded normal (n = 10) and malignant colonic mucosa (seven Dukes's A, nine Dukes's D). METHOD: Immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The numbers of TCR-zeta + lymphocytes decreased from normal mucosa to Dukes's D carcinomas. In contrast, granzyme B+ lymphocytes were more frequent in Dukes's A carcinomas than in normal mucosa, but disappeared from advanced stage tumours.

40|$|Abstract Breast Cancer is a {{heterogeneous}} disease, which affects {{one in ten}} women in the UK today. Developments {{in recent years have}} led to earlier diagnosis and improved treatments and survival. However, mortality is still high and metastatic disease remains incurable. The role of the immune system in breast cancer has been questioned for over 100 years and more recently has led to major developments most notably in the form of Herceptin. Current evidence suggests that the immune system is stimulated by tumours to manifest a response. Many breast cancers show evidence of this immune response in the form of <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> However contradictory opinions exist as to whether this response is favourable for the host or not. The significance of the findings of many of these studies is limited by several factors, including small patient numbers and the fact that qualitative rather than quantitative assessments of <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> have been used. The aims of this study were twofold: Firstly, we set out to develop a practical and efficient method for quantifying immune responses in tissue specimens and secondly, the main aim was to establish the significance of this response, by quantifying the <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in a group of patients with breast cancer, using a well designed study. Our patient group was derived from the Greater Glasgow Health Board database, which was established in 1995 to keep a record of all patients diagnosed with breast cancer in greater Glasgow area. We designed a case-control study to include patients, who were matched on the basis of several factors, recognised as having prognostic significance in breast cancer. The hypothesis to be tested was that metastatic relapse would be less likely in women with breast cancers in which a significant immune infiltrate was present, than in women with cancers in which there was no significant immune-cell infiltrate. We established a reliable and efficient method for immune cell quantification, which will be of value in future studies looking at the immuno-phenotype of the cells that comprise the inflammatory cell infiltrate. Additionally we found that most breast cancers show evidence of an immune cell infiltrate and that this response is likely to be protective...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{anti-idiotypic}} {{monoclonal antibody}} 105 AD 7 mimics the tumour associated antigen 791 Tgp 72, expressed on 70 - 80 % of colorectal cancers. Phase I {{studies have shown}} that the vaccine is non-toxic, and a number of patients have been immunised prior to resection of their primary tumours.  AIMS—To assess lymphocyte activation at the tumour site by measuring expression of the α subunit of the interleukin 2  receptor (CD 25).  METHODS—Nineteen patients with primary colorectal cancer were immunised with varying doses of 105 AD 7 prior to resection of their primary tumours. Samples of normal bowel and tumour edge/centre from 16  patients were available for immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal antibody against CD 25. Samples from a matched control group were also stained. Fresh tumours from 14  immunised patients and 31  unimmunised control patients were disaggregated, and the lymphocytes obtained labelled for CD 25. Samples were analysed blindly by flow cytometry.  RESULTS—Median infiltration of lymphocytes expressing CD 25, measured immunohistochemically, was higher in trial patients, as was the ratio of tumour to normal bowel infiltration. Flow cytometric analysis of fresh tumour from immunised patients showed a significantly higher percentage of lymphocytes expressing CD 25 <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> than their matched and unmatched controls.  DISCUSSION—The α subunit of the interleukin 2  receptor is increased on <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> in patients immunised with the colorectal cancer vaccine 105 AD 7.

The correlation between tumour grade {{and the intensity of}} <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was tried to be tested, to assume a putative linkage between them. Thirty-four cases of histologically proven primary oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) of different grades of differentiation were assorted to groups 1 – 3. Three-micron sections of tissue were cut and captured on electrically charged slides (Vision BioSystem, Mount Waverley, Australia) and stained using monospecific antibody against FoxP 3 + Treg phenotype (dilution 1 : 40, Mouse monoclone No: 236 A/E 7, Ab 20034, IgG 1; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Automated protocols were employed for staining and scoring of staining intensity using Bond™ system (Vision BioSystem). Significant difference in staining intensities (Tregs) was noted among the histologic grades of tumour, where well-differentiated OSCC had significantly low expression of FoxP 3 + Tregs in comparison with moderately and poorly differentiated tumours. A significant linear correlation was established between tumour grade and the intensity of TILs, where high grade tumours (poor differentiation) were more markedly infiltrated. There was also a significant positive correlation between FoxP 3 + Tregs and TILs in cases studied. The correlation of these three variables noted in the study (FoxP 3 + Tregs, tumour grade and TILs) and their significance in a meta-analysis may prove useful in targeting patients with high-risk neoplasms for more aggressive treatment protocols and management strategies. 1600 - 071...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Microsatellite {{instability}} is one {{of three}} molecular pathways described in the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma. The presence of microsatellite instability in patients with colorectal cancer has implications for prognosis and family counselling. Deficiency in mismatch repair genes leads to microsatellite instability and this can be reliably demonstrated in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue by methods, which include immunohistochemistry for the detection of mismatch repair proteins. Local data show a disproportionately large number of younger patients with colorectal cancer compared to that documented in Caucasians. Colorectal cancer in younger ages is often attributed to deficient mismatch repair. The objective of this study therefore, was to determine the proportion of colorectal cancers associated with the microsatellite instability pathway through detection of the mismatch repair proteins on immunohistochemistry. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study of 80 colorectal adenocarcinoma resection specimens received over a three-year period from January 2009 to January 2012. The mismatch repair gene mutation expression was analysed by immunohistochemical staining for products of mismatch repair genes. Associated clinical and pathologic characteristics were reviewed and documented. Results: The proportion of deficient mismatch colorectal cancer in the study was 19. 4 % [95 % CI 11. 7 %- 30. 4 %]. There was a significant but weak association between mismatch repair gene protein expression and tumour grade, and <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (<b>tumour</b> grade Cramer’s V= 0. 263, p= 0. 031; <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> Cramer’s V= 0. 246, p= 0. 044). Mismatch repair gene protein expression outcome showed significant but moderately strong association with the anatomic site of tumour, and tumour histological type (anatomic site Cramer’s V= 0. 469, p= 0. 001, tumour histological type Cramer’s V= 0. 469, p= 0. 001,). Conclusions: The study provides preliminary data of the contribution of the deficient mismatch repair molecular pathway of colorectal cancer in Kenya...|$|R
40|$|Melanoma-associated antigens may be {{the driving}} force behind the {{lymphocytic}} infiltrates in melanomas and the occurrence of melanoma regression. To investigate the clinical relevance of melanoma differentiation antigens (MDAs) as T-cell targets, the relationship between the presence and localization of T-cell subsets and the expression of MDAs was studied by immunohistochemistry and the diversity of CD 8 + T cells in regressive melanomas was assessed using laser-assisted microdissection. While MDA expression as well as T-cell subset distribution, as assessed by immunohistochemical analysis, was heterogeneous within and between lesions, they were histologically independent phenomena. In four lesions studied in detail by PCR analysis of microdissected T cells, a limited T-cell diversity and evidence for clonally expanded <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were found. However, no major differences in T-cell diversity, as assessed by PCR analysis, between peri-and intra-tumoural areas became apparent, this despite the known clinical significance of the specific localization of a T-cell infiltrate. T cells of clonal origin did not show preferential localization to regressive tumour areas. Moreover, clonally related cells were found in two lesions with a non-brisk infiltrate, while in two lesions with a brisk infiltrate (clinically, a good prognostic factor) no evidence for clonally expanded <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was found. These data support the notion that specific immune reactivity and homing of specific cells to the tumour can occur in melanoma patients. However, they also show that the presence of clonally expanded T cells in the tumour is not necessarily associated with an effective anti-tumour immune response and may, for instance, represent regulatory cells. It appears that the clinical impact of an anti-tumour immune response is largely decided at the tumour site, where micro-environmental conditions dictate the functional state of the T cells. Full understanding of these processes can only be achieved by performing more dynamic analyses of the local host-tumour interaction...|$|R
40|$|In 31 {{patients}} with {{carcinoma of the}} breast the phenotype and activation status of <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (TILs) was analysed by flow cytometry. The predominant cells, in all patients, were T lymphocytes and {{in the majority of}} cases CD 8 + (cytotoxic/suppressor) T lymphocytes were present in greater numbers than CD 4 + (helper) T lymphocytes. There was no relationship between the degree of lymphocytic infiltration and either tumour stage or grade but there appeared to be an inverse correlation with the levels of oestrogen receptor (ER) in the tumour (P less than 0. 01). Both populations of T cells had significantly higher numbers of cells carrying HLA DR (class II major histocompatibility antigen) than the equivalent populations in peripheral blood from the same patient group (P less than 0. 001). The transferrin receptor was found on similar numbers of CD 8 + T cells in peripheral blood and among the <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> while more of the CD 4 + T cells <b>infiltrating</b> the <b>tumour</b> were found to carry this receptor (P = 0. 034). The Tac (CD 25) antigen was also on similar numbers of CD 8 + T cells from both peripheral blood and the tumour but was on fewer of the CD 4 + T cells in the tumour with respect to peripheral blood (P = 0. 029). In both TILs and blood lymphocytes, the Tac antigen was consistently present on greater numbers of CD 4 + T lymphocytes than on the CD 8 + T lymphocytes (P less than 0. 001) and as this is a component of the interleukin 2 (IL- 2) receptor this may be of relevance to the use of IL- 2 in TIL cancer therapy...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: CD 25 is the a-subunit of the membrane-bound interleukin- 2 receptor, {{which is}} mainly {{expressed}} by regulatory T cells (Tregs). Normally these cells regulate immune system activity and prevent autoimmunity. Imbalanced function or number of Tregs, either enhanced or decreased, {{might lead to}} tumour development and autoimmunity, respectively. In the present study we hypothesized the presence of CD 25 + cells among <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (TILs) that are normally associated with feline injection site sarcoma (FISS). To this end we analyzed CD 25 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in 18 cases of FISS and in 15 cases of post-injection panniculitis (PIP). Materials and Methods: Sections (4 mm) were immunolabelled using the avidinebiotin technique for CD 25 (MAb). Labelling was evaluated semiquantitatively for percentage of positivity (10 fields at 40) and the expression was considered as: percentage ! 20...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC) are frequently <b>infiltrated</b> by <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (TILs) which may demonstrate specific anti-tumour cytotoxicity. We have used a panel of family-specific primers in reverse-transcriptase (RT) -polymerase chain reactions (PCR) to determine the TCR Vβ repertoire of TILs in the primary and metastatic tumours in patients with OSCC. We observed a diverse and heterogeneous usage of the TCR Vβ genes by TILs in the primary tumours, a scenario not unlike normal oral mucosal lymphocytes. In one patient with a longstanding history of OSCC, the repertoire was restricted. Restricted TCR Vβ gene usage also occurred in TILs of metastatic tumours. Within individual patients, discrepancies of TCR Vβ gene usage were also observed between TILs in the primary OSCC and those in metastatic lymph nodes. Work is ongoing to determine the clonality and functional significance of these TILs...|$|R
40|$|The {{sentinel}} node is {{the first}} lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumour and is usually the first site of metastases. Today, the sentinel node is used for tumour staging. Here, we focus on its immunological role and investigate lymphocytic function in sentinel nodes, identified intraoperatively by peritumoural dye injection, from 15 patients with colon cancer. <b>Tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> sentinel and nonsentinel lymph node cells and peripheral blood leukocytes were studied by flow cytometry, proliferation assays and interferon-γ secretion after activation with autologous tumour homogenate. Whereas tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes were nonresponsive in the proliferation assays, lymphocytes from sentinel nodes proliferated dose dependently and secreted interferon-γ upon stimulation with tumour homogenate. The responses were of varying magnitude and tended to be weaker in metastatic sentinel nodes. Sentinel node lymphocytes represents an enriched source of tumour reactive lymphocytes, and {{may be useful in}} future trials of adoptive immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Metastasis of {{colorectal}} carcinomas rarely {{occurs in}} cirrhotic livers. Our {{study investigated the}} influence of activated Kupffer cells from cirrhotic rat livers on hepatic colonization and FasR-mediated apoptosis of colon cancer cells. A rat colon cancer cell line, RCN- 9, was used to inoculate rat livers. Treatment with conditioned media of Kupffer cells isolated from CCl 4 -induced cirrhotic rat livers (cirrhotic KCM) significantly reduced the incidence of hepatic colonization of RCN- 9 cells. In vitro cytotoxicity of Kupffer cells and <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (TILs) on RCN- 9 cells was evaluated using [3 H]-release assay. RCN- 9 cells were resistant to cytotoxicity mediated by cirrhotic Kupffer cells, but were sensitized to TIL-mediated killing after treatment with cirrhotic KCM. The specific killing induced by TILs was FasR-mediated, as it was inhibited by ZB 4, an antagonistic anti-FasR antibody. In agreement, cirrhotic KCM increased recombinant Fas ligand-induced apoptosis of RCN- 9 cells, and up-regulated FasR expression on RCN- 9 cells as evaluated by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. These findings suggest that Kupffer cells in cirrhotic livers sensitize metastatic colon cancer cells to FasR-mediated apoptosis by up-regulating the receptors, which thus prepare them to be eliminated by <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of the main prognostic factors in different age groups was evaluated in 1226 patients operated on for primary breast cancer, {{in order to identify}} those in¯uenced by age and/or menopausal status. Patients were divided into the following groups: 1) 40 years of age and under; 2) premenopausal over 40 years of age; 3) postmenopausal under 75 years of age and 4) 75 years of age and over. Our findings showed that the youngest patients had the worst prognostic pattern, which improves as age increases and is the best in patients over 75 years of age. Some of the parameters investigated (tumour size, histologic and nuclear grade, <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> p 53 and Ki 67) were found to be in¯uenced by age, some (necrosis and oestrogen receptors) were induced by menopausal status and/or age, some (vascular invasion, ploidy, S-phase and progesterone receptors) showed significant differences in different age groups but there was no consistent relation with patient age or menopausal status, and others (node status, ErbB 2 /Neu and Cathepsin D) were not induced by age or menopause...|$|R
40|$|Perforin (PFP) is a {{cytotoxic}} protein {{released from}} killer cells. PFP immunoreactivity in human peripheral blood <b>lymphocytes</b> (PBL) and <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (TIL) was investigated immunocytochemically {{with the aid}} of an anti-PFP monoclonal antibody. PFP was detected in the cytoplasm of 10 % of PBL. We performed a double staining of PFP+ cells with Leu 11 b/CD 16, Leu 2 a/CD 8, or Leu 3 a/CD 4 and showed that PFP was produced by 9 % of CD 8 + cells and 18 % of CD 16 + cells but not by CD 4 + cells. In 28 colorectal cancer tissues, PFP immunoreactivity was observed in the <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>infiltrating</b> to the <b>tumour</b> stroma. The PFP+ cells were most numerous in Dukes A and decreased in number according to the progression of tumours. The PFP+ cells in TIL exhibited the same phenotypes as those in PBL but the PFP+ cells were more numerous in CD 8 + cells than in CD 16 + cells at all stages. This study represents the first evidence that PFP is mainly secreted from CD 8 + cells in tumour tissues. It is hypothesised that the {{decrease in the number of}} PFP+ cells in accordance with tumour progression may reflect the suppression of the hosts local immunity...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the expression of}} CD 70 as biomarker for prognosis in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We also examined the prognostic value of <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (TILs) in our study cohort. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue originating from the oropharynx of 78 patients was immunohistochemically stained for CD 70, CD 3, CD 8 and FoxP 3. Expression of CD 70, CD 3, CD 8, FoxP 3 and HPV status was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics. Overall survival (OS) was determined by a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test whereas the Cox proportional hazard model was used for multivariate analysis. CD 70 expression demonstrated no influence on OS. <b>Tumours</b> heavily <b>infiltrated</b> by TILs were linked with better outcome, for {{the total number of}} TILs {{as well as for the}} CD 3 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cell count. A Cox proportional hazard model proved that solely CD 8 (+) infiltrating T cells exhibit a positive effect on OS (HR = 0. 30, 95 % confidence interval 0. 13 - 0. 72). Our results demonstrate that CD 8 (+) TILs constitute an independent prognosticator in patients diagnosed with OSCC. Further validation of the prognostic value of CD 8 (+) TILs in OSCC is warranted and could provide us with a better insight into the immunological status of these malignancies...|$|R
40|$|Aims: An early {{adenocarcinoma}} of the {{ascending colon}} {{was confined to}} a mass of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The first description of an adenocarcinoma of colon differentiating as dome epithelium is presented. Methods and results: A plaque-like carcinoma was identified opposite the ileocaecal valve in an asymptomatic 56 -year-old man with {{a family history of}} colorectal cancer. Malignant epithelium was confined to a mass of GALT filling but limited to the submucosa, Characterization of the neoplasm was undertaken by means of mucin histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and assessment of DNA microsatellite instability status. The malignant epithelium comprised well differentiated columnar cells with a microvillous brush border and expressing MUC 1, but no goblet cells or expression of MUC 2. The demonstration of focal clusters of intraepithelial B-lymphocytes supported the presence of functioning M-cells within the malignant neoplasm. The cancer was DNA microsatellite stable despite the finding of <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Conclusions: There is evidence for the origin of colorectal neoplasia from dome epithelium in both experimental models and microreconstruction studies of early adenomas in nonpolypotic human colorectal mucose, It is suggested that the lymphocyte-rich subset of colorectal cancer that expresses MUC 1 but not MUC 2 may be differentiating as dome epithelium of gut-associated lymphoid tissue...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) {{status is}} {{strongly}} related to clinical outcome in melanoma patients. In this study we investigated the possible association between the presence of activated and/or suppressive <b>Tumour</b> <b>Infiltrating</b> <b>Lymphocytes</b> (TILs) and SLN status in clinically stage I/II melanoma patients. METHODS: Diagnostic primary melanoma samples from 20 patients with a sentinel lymph node metastasis were compared to melanoma samples from 20 patients with a negative sentinel lymph node, who were matched for gender, age and Breslow thickness. Presence of activated Granzyme B positive (GrB+) TILs, presence of suppressive (FoxP 3 +) TILs and MHC class I antigen expression on tumour cells were analysed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: FoxP 3 and MHC-I expression had no direct bearing {{on the presence of}} melanoma metastases in the SLN. Whereas the presence of activated GrB+ TILs in the primary melanoma had no predictive value for SLN status either, their absence was strongly associated with the presence of metastasis in the SLN (p= 0. 001). While both GrB+ and FoxP 3 + TILs could be detected in SLN metastases, a majority did not display MHC-I expression. CONCLUSION: These data support a role for cytotoxic T cells in the prevention of early metastasis of melanoma to the draining lymph nodes...|$|R
40|$|Endogenous {{histamine}} {{has been}} shown to effect growth mechanisms in experimental mammary carcinomas via H 2 membrane receptors (Cricco et al, 1994). Both H 1 and H 2 binding sites are present in human mammary glands but only 75 % malignant carcinomas express H 2 receptors (Lemos et al, 1995). The presence of mast cells around tumour tissue raises questions concerning the source of histamine in breast tumour tissue. While cimetidine, an H 2 antagonist, {{has been shown}} to influence the presence of <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (TIL) in colorectal cancer (Adams and Morris, 1994, 1997) that was not found to be the case in breast cancer (Ng et al, 1995). In recent studies tumour cell proliferation, as measured by Ki- 67 antibody labelling, has been seen as an additional prognostic indicator in breast cancer (Railo et al, 1993, 1997; Ferno, 1998; Schauer et al, 1998). We investigated the possibility that cimetidine may influence tumour proliferation by blocking the growth-promoting effects of histamine. No relationship between preoperative cimetidine administration and tumour cell proliferation was seen overall. A weak correlation was seen between tissue histamine content and mast cell count which was not influenced by cimetidine. Tumour cell proliferation correlated well with other prognostic indicators such as grade and differentiation. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
