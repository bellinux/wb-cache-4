25|$|At the {{shopping}} mall, Kohta develops feelings {{for the police}} officer trainee, Asami Nakaoka, after helping her subdue an angry mall survivor. He spends some quality time with her, and convinces her to join the group. Unfortunately, the friendship is short-lived when Asami becomes trapped while attempting to save a boy in the parking lot. She shouts for Kohta <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that she will not become a zombie and cause pain to others around her. Kohta kills her and later finds himself in shock, but he is set straight by Shizuka, who uses a psychology trick of ordering him around like a sergeant.|$|E
500|$|The 2014 movie Children of War {{tries to}} capture this horror on film. The film By Mrityunjay Devvrat {{starring}} [...] Farooq Sheikh, Victor Banerjee, Raima Sen, among others {{is meant to}} [...] "send shivers down the viewers' spine. We want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> repulsive that no one even entertains the thought of pardoning rapists, let alone commit the crime. The shoot took its toll on all of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{originally}} planned a voice-over {{to reveal that}} the satellites seen after the prologue are nuclear weapons, and that the Star Child would detonate the weapons {{at the end of}} the film. However, he decided this would create associations with his previous film Dr. Strangelove, and decided not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> obvious that they were [...] "war machines". A few weeks before the release of the film, the U.S. and Soviet governments had agreed not to put any nuclear weapons into outer space.|$|E

500|$|Discussing {{plans for}} the season, Morgan noted that [...] "the Millennium Group is a much deeper organization" [...] than seen in the first season, adding that [...] "they're {{considering}} [...] for {{a candidate for the}} group (and) trying to show him that at the millennium there's going to be an event - either fire and brimstone or harmonic convergence". Wong spoke about how the character of Catherine Black changed, saying [...] "there's a different relationship between Frank and his family this season because of the separation ... I think that will not only bring some kind of heartfelt drama but humor into it". Wong also stated [...] "we don't want to have the audience expect to see a serial killer every week. ... We would like <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that it's a surprise to them, just like it is a surprise when you watch The X-Files".|$|E
500|$|In Maine, {{the trail}} extends into even harsher environments, and sub-alpine and alpine growth descends to lower elevations. Alpine {{growth in the}} state ranges from around [...] in the Mahoosuc Range to below [...] {{in parts of the}} Hundred-Mile Wilderness, where nearly every area higher than [...] is {{evergreen}} forest. These forests include more species of evergreen, as well. In addition to the white pine, spruce and hemlock prevalent further south, Maine has many cedar trees along the trail. Near the northern terminus, there are even some tamarack (larch), a coniferous, pine-needled deciduous tree, which provides displays of yellow in the late fall after the birches and maples have gone bare. The hemlocks in Maine are also notable, as the woolly adelgid, which has ravaged populations further south, has not come into the state yet, and may be unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> far north due to the cold climate.|$|E
500|$|Despite his radical views, Haywood {{emerged from}} the trial with a {{national}} reputation. Eugene Debs called him [...] "the Lincoln of Labor." [...] Along with his colorful background and appearance, he {{was known for his}} blunt statements about capitalism. [...] "The capitalist has no heart," [...] he often said, [...] "but harpoon him in the pocketbook and you will draw blood." [...] Another time, he began a speech by noting, [...] "Tonight I am going to speak on the class struggle and I am going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> plain that even a lawyer can understand it." [...] Yet Haywood also had a flair for dangerous hyperbole that, when quoted in newspapers, was used to justify wholesale arrests of IWW strikers. [...] "Confiscate! That's good!" [...] he often said. [...] "I like that word. [...] It suggests stripping the capitalist, taking something away from him. [...] But there {{has got to be a}} good deal of force to this thing of taking." ...|$|E

500|$|To help {{differentiate}} the Bennet sisters, Durran viewed Elizabeth as the [...] "tomboy", clothing her in earthy colours {{because of her}} love of the countryside. For the other sisters, Durran remarked, [...] "Jane was the most refined and yet it's still all a bit slapdash and homemade, because the Bennets have no money. One of the main things Joe wanted was for the whole thing to have a provincial feel. Mary is the bluestocking: serious and practical. And then Lydia and Kitty are a bit Tweedledum and Tweedledee {{in a kind of}} teenage way. I tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that they'd be sort of mirror images. If one's wearing a green dress, the other will wear a green jacket; so you always have a visual asymmetry between the two." [...] In contrast to the 1940 film, the 2005 production displayed the Bennet sisters in worn-down but comfortable dresses that allowed the actors better moveability.|$|E
500|$|Dig Me Out {{was written}} in nearly two months and {{recorded}} from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: [...] "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> you can hear both things at once". Goodmanson {{also noted that the}} fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production. He explained: [...] "The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so you can hear the bass line. With no bass there, you can just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".|$|E
500|$|Hironobu Sakaguchi {{likened the}} {{development}} of Chrono Trigger to [...] "play around with Toriyama's universe," [...] citing the inclusion of humorous sequences in the game {{that would have been}} [...] "impossible with something like Final Fantasy." [...] When Square Co. suggested a non-human player character, developers created Frog by adapting one of Toriyama's sketches. The team created the End of Time to help players with hints, worrying that they might become stuck and need to consult a walkthrough. The game's testers had previously complained that Chrono Trigger was too difficult; as Horii explained, [...] "It's because we know too much. The developers think the game's just right; that they're being too soft. They're thinking from their own experience. The puzzles were the same. Lots of players didn't figure out things we thought they'd get easily." [...] Sakaguchi later cited the unusual desire of beta testers to play the game a second time or [...] "travel through time again" [...] as an affirmation of the New Game + feature: [...] "Wherever we could, we tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that a slight change in your behavior caused subtle differences in people's reactions, even down to the smallest details... I think the second playthrough will hold a whole new interest." [...] The game's reuse of locations due to time traveling made bug-fixing difficult, as corrections would cause unintended consequences in other eras.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow we'll have {{to locate}} all over again," [...] said Snap. [...] "And {{if we want}} to be comfortable, we'll have to put up another cabin. But we needn't <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> quite <b>so</b> {{complete}} as that other one was." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cook's {{original}} recipes {{called for}} [...] "Absolut Citron, {{a splash of}} Triple sec, a drop of Rose's lime and just enough cranberry <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> oh <b>so</b> pretty in pink." [...] Although Absolut Citron was not introduced anywhere officially until 1988, it was test marketed in Miami.|$|R

2500|$|Yamauchi {{said in an}} {{interview}} with Edge that Gran Turismo 5 could have some compatibility with the PlayStation Portable version.

2500|$|Nearly {{thirty years}} {{after the release of}} Blaze of Glory, Harvard {{professor}} Stephen Burt described it as [...] "true to the wordy awkwardness... of the nerd stereotype, and yet true to the visceral power, the sexual charge, in guitar-based Anglo-American pop. The songs, and the people depicted in the songs, attempted to have fun, to act on instinct, but they knew they were too cerebral <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so,</b> except with like-minded small circles of puzzle-solvers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In between, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi {{left the}} country for exile in January 1979 after strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country, and on February 1, 1979 Ayatollah Khomeini {{returned}} to Tehran to a greeting of several million Iranians. The final collapse of the Pahlavi dynasty occurred shortly after on February 11 when Iran's military declared itself [...] "neutral" [...] after guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting. Iran officially became an Islamic Republic on April 1, 1979, when Iranians overwhelmingly approved a national referendum <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Bucknall was {{promoted}} to Lieutenant General on 31 August 2010. He was appointed Deputy Commander of the International Security Assistance Force—second in command of 130,000 troops from 48 countries—and United Kingdom National Contingent Commander, Kabul—overall commander of all British forces in Afghanistan—succeeding General Sir Nick Parker. While in Afghanistan, Bucknall emphasised that a continued effort was required to maintain the momentum in improving the security situation in the country, saying [...] "progress is not irreversible, we are yet <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so.</b> But we are certainly on the right track". In February 2011 he became Commander of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a conference}} Quinn said, [...] "I {{used to go}} to game events and feel like I was going home ... Now it's just like... are any of the people I'm {{currently}} in the room with ones that said they wanted to beat me to death?". One such threat, reported in The New Yorker, proposed that: [...] "Next time she shows up at a conference we... give her a crippling injury that's never going to fully heal... a good solid injury to the knees. I'd say a brain damage, but we don't want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> she ends up too retarded to fear us." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Chestertown is a {{treasure}} hidden in plain sight," [...] said Richard Moe, {{president of the}} National Trust for Historic Preservation. [...] "A small, historic and relatively unspoiled Eastern Shore town, Chestertown {{had the good sense}} to hang on <b>to</b> what <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> special. The result is a vibrant community that offers travelers an ideal retreat." ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{also common}} to read society-related comics in newspapers. The editor aims <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a dig at a social issue {{but does not}} want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> directly, <b>so</b> they use comics to convey the message in a humorous way. The typical example was the comic talking about {{unauthorized}} building work of Henry Tang Ying-yen.|$|R
50|$|Chapter 11: Friedan {{notes that}} many housewives have sought {{fulfillment}} in sex, {{unable to find}} it in housework and children; Friedan notes that sex cannot fulfill all of a person's needs, and that attempts <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> do <b>so</b> often drive married women to have affairs or drive their husbands away as they become obsessed with sex.|$|R
2500|$|Motion capture {{was used}} to capture the {{character}} animations in the game. LucasFilm partner Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) generated the animation. The size of each character presented issues during development and developers had {{to find ways to}} adjust the moves, based on the opponent. For example: Chewbacca will throw lower punches when fighting Princess Leia. Each character averaged around 1,200 polygons, roughly twice the count of similar fighting games. In developing the button combo system the staff wanted buttons to have context with the character's movements. [...] "We want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that when you hit the left button, you really hit with your left arm combo." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Butler started Future Fossil Records, and {{released}} his first full-length album [...] "I Feel A Bit Normal Today". [...] In 2001, he released Kilopop!'s [...] "Un Petit Gôuter", a fictional European band's [...] "Best Of". [...] "I've {{always been a}} songwriter, {{and over the years}} I've been asked to write Waitress-y type tunes for other singers...but none of them were ever used. [...] I had quite a pile of these, plus some fun co-writes lying around gathering dust...so I invented a fake European band that supposedly had had 'hits' with these tunes. [...] I wanted to be a success in Europe, and since this didn't happen in reality, I decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> in fantasy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1890s, the {{establishment}} of an Australian Federation from the six colonies was debated. One of the points of discussion was the extent that railways would be a federal responsibility. A vote <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> was lost narrowly, instead the new constitution allows [...] "the acquisition, with the consent of a State, of any railways of the State on terms arranged between the Commonwealth and the State" [...] (Section 51 xxxiii) and [...] "railway construction and extension in any State with the consent of that State" [...] (Section 51 xxxiv). However, the Australian Government is free to provide funding to the states for rail upgrading projects under Section 96 ("the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit").|$|E
