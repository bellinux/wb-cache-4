50|$|Many {{airlines}} and aircraft operators state {{a list of}} conditions that must be satisfied so that a safe landing can be carried out. If {{one or more of}} these conditions cannot be satisfied then a go-around should be considered in some cases and must be carried out in others. This list is usually written in <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>manual</b> which has to be approved by the relevant aviation authority (CAA in the UK, FAA in the United States). The operator's list of conditions is not exhaustive; pilots use their individual judgment outside of this scope.|$|E
50|$|There {{had been}} {{at least one major}} {{accident}} with the PZB90 in place - on 26 June 2000 an S-Bahn train left Hannover-Langenhagen station for a single-track section with an oncoming train. The PZB halted the train but the driver released the train ("Freitaste") without double-checking with the train director. The investigative report notes that there had been 22 similar recorded occurrences until that time when a driver related the PZB halt to a different cause than having overrun a main signal - the report concludes that <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>manual</b> should be changed in that double-checking with train director should not only be required on a main signal overrun but explicitly on all PZB-related stops.|$|E

5000|$|Whilst the TCAS is {{programmed}} {{to assume that}} both crews will promptly follow the system's instructions, <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>manual</b> did not clearly state that TCAS should always take precedence over any ATC commands. The manual described TCAS as [...] "a backup to the ATC system", which could be wrongly interpreted to mean that ATC instructions have higher priority. This ambiguity was replicated in the Tu-154 Flight Operations Manual, which contained contradictory sections. On the one hand, chapter 8.18.3.4 emphasized {{the role of the}} ATC and describes the TCAS as an [...] "additional aid", whilst chapter 8.18.3.2 forbade manoeuvers contrary to the TCAS. The BFU recommended that this ambiguity should be resolved in favor of obeying TCAS advisories even when these were in conflict with ATC instructions.|$|E

5000|$|The French inquiry {{found that}} the {{aircraft}} was flying at a height [...] "below the safety altitude obtained from the correct application to theToulouse - Perpignan route of the general instructions contained in <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>manual</b> of Derby Aviation." [...] The charts that mayhave been on board the aircraft, says the report, could {{have led to the}} calculation, on account of lack of uniformity in the heightspresented, of differing safety altitudes. [...] "It is not possible, however," [...] said the report, [...] "to establish what charts were effectively used by the crew; in fact the airline has not fixed the type of chart to be used by the pilot for the purpose of applying the formula specified in the operations manual." [...] The report noted that the flight plan was not completed in accordance with French regulations,which were based on ICAO recommendations. The filed plan had specified only the point of departure, the en-route beacon at Dunsfold and the destination. According to French regulations it was mandatory to indicate the points at which airwayswere crossed and the points at which flight information region boundaries were crossed, and if necessary certain radio fixes should have been indicated, The report noted that, [...] "as opposed to the British regulations, the French regulations require the filing of a flight plan when the flight is to be made in instrument flight rules." ...|$|E

5000|$|Infobae {{described}} the judicial {{resolution in the}} following terms:In the resolution, the judge reiterated that the determining factors allowing the accident to occur were [...] "the lack of effective control and subsequently taking measures by the responsible persons of the firm LAPA S.A. at the decision-making level, {{with respect to the}} aspects relevant to flight security."In this way he placed responsibility on the airline directors for having completed [...] "in a negligent manner" [...] the responsibilities of their posts, including contracting the pilot Gustavo Weigel, allowing the development of his career path at the business.The judge highlighted [...] "the constant and permanent contact and direct participation that Deutsch and Boyd had in the politics of advancement in the business" [...] and he reproached them for [...] "the lack of effective control that might have made it possible for the pilots to overcome the errors committed."The accused face million-dollar asset seizures and charges that have accrued to them from the commercial court that conducted the public examination of the airline.As for the members of the Air Force, they will be tried for neglecting to observe the law pertaining to content control of <b>the</b> <b>Operations</b> <b>Manual</b> of the airline industry and the norms for training airplane pilots.Accordingly, the judge reiterated that Lentino was accused of not having completed his principal duty adequately, namely running control checks on the psychophysiological fitness of pilots.The crime of which the ex-officials stand accused carries a penalty of up to two years of prison, and special incarceration can double the time when the offense is committed while in public office.The final judgement of the case was delayed by motions filed by the defense of several accused in order to slow the jury trial process, all of which were finally rejected weeks later by the Federal Court in Buenos Aires.|$|E
