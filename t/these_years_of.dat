25|$|From 1834 to 1843, in {{the period}} known as Spain's third bourgeois revolution, the country was ruled under the liberal {{government}} of the Progressive Party (Partido Progresista). After <b>these</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> progressivist domination, the Moderate Party (Partido Moderado) gained control. It held power continuously during the so-called Década moderada ("Moderate decade", 1843–1854) {{under the leadership of}} General Ramón María Narváez, the Duke of Valencia, using the executive office to advance its economic goals and maintain public order. The Moderates were {{to the right of the}} opposing Progressive Party, but also characterized themselves as liberal.

25|$|The {{decision}} was made to demolish the medieval church in 1716. A new church designed by the architect Francis Smith of Warwick would be built in a neoclassical style. The construction of the new church was funded by public subscription, the Conduit Lands Trust and the Lichfield Corporation. After five years of construction the church was completed in 1721. <b>These</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> construction were probably overseen by Samuel Johnson who would have experienced his early childhood in the house facing onto the church. The church body was built in brick while the medieval tower was retained (without its spire) and encased in stucco. The new church consisted of a chancel, an aisled nave with north south and west galleries and a west tower.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Boeing built a {{large number}} of B-17 and B-29 bombers. Boeing ranked twelfth among United States {{corporations}} in the value of wartime production contracts. Many of the workers were women whose husbands had gone to war. In the beginning of March 1944, production had been scaled up in such a manner that over 350 planes were built each month. To prevent an attack from the air, the manufacturing plants had been covered with greenery and farmland items. During <b>these</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> war the leading aircraft companies of the U.S. cooperated. The Boeing-designed B-17 bomber was assembled also by Lockheed Aircraft Corp. and Douglas Aircraft Co., while the B-29 was assembled also by Bell Aircraft Co. and by Glenn L. Martin Company.|$|E

He served as Inspector General of Havana during the American occupation. He was mustered out of the Army in May 1899. He officially retired from the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia in 1909 with the rank of major general.|$|E

25|$|During {{the three}} Punic Wars, Rome {{directly}} entered into permanent {{relations with the}} Berber people. In the third war's aftermath, however, Rome turned its attention to the eastern Mediterranean. The fall of the Roman Republic (510-44 BC) led to the Roman civil wars, whose intermittent military actions and political strife indirectly amplified {{the significance of the}} Berber kings. Amid the oscillating demands and shifting fortunes, Berber alliances were sought by rival Roman factions. Berber relations with Rome became multivalent and fluid, characterized variously as a working alliance, functional ambivalence, partisan hostility, veiled maneuvering, and fruitful intercourse. Nevertheless, during <b>these</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> Roman civil conflict the political status of the Berber kings continued to erode. From being independent sovereign (Masinissa), the kings had become long-term allies; later their political alliance was required, and eventually they were reduced to Roman clients.|$|E
25|$|After having {{resigned}} as Prime Minister of France, he left politics. He {{was aware that}} the link between himself and public life was broken forever, and he never made the slightest attempt to renew it. The greater {{part of the year}} he spent at his residence at Val Richer, an Augustine monastery near Lisieux in Normandy, which had been sold {{at the time of the}} first Revolution. His two daughters, who married two descendants of the illustrious Dutch family of De Witt, so congenial in faith and manners to the Huguenots of France, kept his house. One of his sons-in-law farmed the estate. And here Guizot devoted his later years with undiminished energy to literary labour, which was in fact his chief means of subsistence. Proud, independent, simple and contented he remained to the last; and <b>these</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> retirement were perhaps the happiest and most serene portion of his life.|$|E
25|$|Births have {{declined}} for three consecutive years, {{and are now}} 7% below the peak in 2007. This drop has continued through 2010, according to data released by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics in June 2011. Numerous experts have suggested that this decline is largely a reflection of unfavorable economic conditions. This connection between birth rates and economic downturns partly {{stems from the fact}} that American birth rates have now fallen to levels that are comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Teen birth rates in the U.S. are at the lowest level in U.S. history. In fact, teen birth rates in the U.S. have consistently decreased since 1991 through 2011, except for a brief increase between 2005 and 2007. The other aberration from this otherwise steady decline in teen birth rates is the 6% decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009. Despite <b>these</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> decrease, U.S. teen birth rates are still higher than in other developed nations. Racial differences prevail with teen birth and pregnancy rates as well. The American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teen birth rate.|$|E

She eventually formed a lasting {{working relationship with}} Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose thought that the sessions were [...] "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write {{about what happened in}} school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left RCA Records when she was 14. She later recalled: [...] "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture <b>these</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through".|$|E
500|$|But most of all, McGovern {{was known}} for his {{continued}} opposition to the Vietnam War. In March 1969, he became the first senator to explicitly criticize the new president's policy there, an action that was seen as a breach of customary protocol by other Senate doves. The diversion during <b>these</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> much of Food for Peace's aid to South Vietnam, instead of other badly stricken countries around the world, greatly upset him. By the end of 1969, McGovern was calling for an immediate cease-fire and a total withdrawal of all American troops within a year. In October 1969, McGovern was a featured speaker before 100,000demonstrators in Boston at the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam, and in November he spoke before 350,000 at Moratorium/Mobilization's anti-war march to the Washington Monument. Afterward, he decided that radicalized peace demonstrations were counterproductive and criticized anti-war figures such as Rennie Davis, Tom Hayden, Huey Newton, Abbie Hoffman, and Jerry Rubin as [...] "reckless" [...] and [...] "irresponsible".|$|E
500|$|There {{is little}} record of Johnson's life {{between the end}} of 1729 and 1731; he most likely lived with his parents when {{experiencing}} bouts of mental anguish and physical pains. After <b>these</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> illness, his tics and gesticulations associated with TS became more noticeable and were [...] "commented on by many observers". To further complicate Johnson's life, his father was deeply in debt by 1731 and had lost much of his standing in Lichfield. An usher's position became available at Stourbridge Grammar School, but Johnson's lack of a degree saw him passed over, on 6 September 1731. Instead, he stayed at the home of Gregory Hickman, Cornelius Ford's half brother, writing poetry. It was there that he heard the devastating news that Cornelius had died in London, on 22 August 1731; later, in his personal [...] "Annales", he pointed to that moment {{as one of the most}} important of his life.|$|E

500|$|The anime {{series has}} been {{compared}} with a similar series that involved gender swapping—Rumiko Takahashi's Ranma ½. In a review at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews, the reviewer wrote, [...] " [...] rather aggravating to watch at times, but {{seems to have no}} problem raising smiles whenever it wants to, either. The characters, as they are, bring much of the believability of the show, despite the alien elements. It's very much down to earth and pleasant to look at, if nothing else. The rather soft and detailed art style does help, of course, as does the generally great animation quality." [...] The conclusion of the anime was positively reviewed by Erica Friedman, who is the president of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the anime's conclusion as [...] "so normal - so much like a thing that might have actually happened in real life...that it kind of just went under the radar. So - after all <b>these</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> watching crappy unresolved restart endings we FINALLY get a real ending and it's a yuri ending where the girl remains a girl and get the girl and...thud. Nothing." [...] The anime was given an overall score of 7/10 by Friedman.|$|E
