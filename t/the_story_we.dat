But Miss Arrow assures them that it is Arachne, since she is an expert of weaving illusion. Back in <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>we</b> see that Miss Arrow is right: Arachne has trapped Peter in her giant web. MJ is suspended in a cocoon and will die unless Peter pledges to be with Arachne, to share her darkness forever ("Love Me or Kill Me*"). They fight, and eventually Peter agrees to be with Arachne if it means saving MJ. Arachne has a sudden change of heart, realizing {{that there is still}} humanity left in the curse of the spider. She finds her own humanity and spares MJ's life. Arachne spares Peter of a life with her, as she knows he will always only love MJ and will never truly be hers; but in realizing his humanity, she has found her own and is released of her burden of darkness in the shadows. Peter watches as Arachne ascends into the heavens by the same piece of thread she used to take her life. With his suit at the Daily Bugle, MJ sees Peter and finally realizes his secret. She agrees to stand by him as sirens begin wailing and Peter swings away ("Finale").|$|E

[...] According {{to the first}} two games' writer Sam Lake, he [...] "did want to switch to Mona [...] but it was problematic. In the end, Max frames those {{sequences}} with his narration, saying that he doesn’t know exactly what happened, or what Mona did, {{but it must have}} been something like this. In other words, when you are playing Mona, you are actually experiencing Max’s guess of the events". Regarding Mona's possible survival at the end of Max Payne 2, Rockstar's Dan Houser stated that Max Payne 3 would [...] "not continue that aspect of <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>We</b> toyed with figuring out some way, or doing something clever, and then [...] 'No, no, just move on from that bit of the story.'

[...] While his parents overcame cancer, he began to focus on the concept of a young man saving a loved one from a life-threatening disease. He shared the concept with Handel, his undergraduate school roommate at Harvard University. Handel earned a Ph.D in neuroscience from New York University but was uncertain about a future in neuroscience. He recalled the discussion, [...] "Darren and I just started talking about <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>We</b> kept wanting to talk more about it as the story kept getting bigger.

500|$|Some reviewers {{claim that}} the game's {{portrayal}} of women is misogynistic. Chris Plante of Polygon felt that the supporting female characters were constructed on stereotypes, and wrote that the game's [...] "treatment of women is a relic from the current generation". Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times considered the satirical portrayals of women uncreative, and added that violent and sexist themes hurt the game experience. Edge noted that while [...] "every female in the game exists solely to be sneered, leered or laughed at", it treated its all-male lead characters {{in a similar vein}} through their stereotyped tendencies towards violence. Dave Cook of VG247 reinforced the sentiment that the female characters were constructed on stereotypes in an editorial: [...] "They're either there to be rescued, shouted at, fucked, to be seen fucking, put up with, killed, heard prattling away like dullards on their mobile phones or shopping". [...] Sam Houser, Rockstar Games co-founder, felt that the development team sometimes overlooked their portrayal of women in Grand Theft Auto games, but that the weight towards male characters [...] "fit with <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>we</b> wanted to tell".|$|E

That is simply a matter of adding the avanzar and the avanzo in ritorno. Quick calculations show the avanzar (@ q = 4, for 40 miles) is 28.4 miles (= 71 × 40/100) and the avanzo di ritorno (@ q = 2 for 28.4 miles alargar), is 2.84 × 24 = 68.16.

40|$|A {{cross-cultural}} {{and global}} journey through narrative, this volume reveals <b>the</b> underlying <b>stories</b> of our cultures, societies and personal experiences. Stories are, after all, the invisible web of our lives, {{each of us}} spinning it further every day. The authors provide a comprehensive view of stories big and small, intentional and unintentional narratives and the position of authorship within storytelling. Topics reflect a myriad of disciplines from history, philosophy, literature, theology, psychology, linguistics, education, cultural and gender studies, social sciences, education, art and design, film and theatre (to name but a few) coupled with a richness and variety that is fuelled by the trans-global selection of authors, allowing the reader to traverse the world as they read. This is a truly interdisciplinary endeavour united in one common interest: a passion for <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> create, <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> share, <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> hear and <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> that inspire us...|$|R

2500|$|The use of splitscreens {{were created}} in {{response}} to the amount of phone calls in the first episode, with Hopkins using {{it as a way to}} show the viewer where to pay attention. Editor David Thompson said, [...] "Splitscreens are great, boxes are even cooler" [...] and began editing in asymmetrical boxes to the Pilot episode. The [...] "boxes" [...] were first used as a necessity during the scene where Jack calls Kim's ex-boyfriend, Vincent. Surnow explained, [...] "It became an artistic element. [...] It made sense in <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>we</b> were telling." [...] Joel Surnow came up with the idea for the onscreen ticking clock. [...] "Jack's Theme" [...] was the first theme that Sean Callery wrote for the series with having only read the script. Callery received the 24th cut of the 24 pilot on April 24, 2001, which was the final cut of the episode. The first cut of the Pilot episode was not received well by test groups, prompting the editors to move scenes, including moving the introduction of the David Palmer character closer to the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|The Silver Surfer debuted as an {{unplanned}} {{addition to}} the superhero-team comic Fantastic Four #48 (March 1966). The comic's writer-editor, Stan Lee, and its penciller and co-plotter, Jack Kirby, had, by the mid-1960s, developed a collaborative technique known as the [...] "Marvel Method": the two would discuss story ideas, Kirby working from a brief synopsis to draw the individual scenes and plot details, with Lee finally adding the dialogue and captions. When Kirby turned in his pencil art for the story, he included a new character he and Lee had not discussed. [...] As Lee recalled in 1995, [...] "There, {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>we</b> had so carefully worked out, was a nut on some sort of flying surfboard". He later expanded on this, recalling, [...] "I thought, 'Jack, this time you've gone too far'". Kirby explained that the story's agreed-upon antagonist, a god-like cosmic predator of planets named Galactus, should have some sort of herald, and that he created the surfboard [...] "because I'm tired of drawing spaceships!" [...] Taken by the noble features of the new character, who turned on his master to help defend Earth, Lee overcame his initial skepticism and began adding characterization. The Silver Surfer soon became {{a key part of the}} unfolding story.|$|E

[...] Despite speculation {{that it would be}} the intro to the album, Gaskarth clarified that it was [...] "more of an ending to <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>We</b> pulled a [...] Tarantino." [...] On February 14, while on tour, the band played a new song entitled [...] "Time-Bomb". On February 16, Gaskarth stated that the [...] "record's definitely not coming out in March" [...] due to the [...] "restructuring" [...] of Interscope Records and a number of records have been pushed back, Dirty Work being one of them. In a later interview, Gaskarth presumed [...] "a bunch of people got fired. We {{just wanted to make sure}} we didn't get caught up in that shit storm essentially, so we decided to hold off on putting the record out." [...] "Time-Bomb" [...] was made available for streaming on February 26. In March, the band went on a UK tour alongside Yellowcard and Young Guns. In mid-March, Barakat stated in an interview with AbsolutePunk that All Time Low will [...] "hopefully be releasing the track-listing shortly, maybe even clips of every song."

40|$|Our {{culture has}} a {{dominant}} narrative about children: they are (and should stay) innocent of sexual desires and intentions. At the same time, children are officially, tacitly, {{assumed to be}} heterosexual. Curiouser is a book about this narrative {{and what happens when}} it takes an unexpected, or queer, turn—when <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> of childhood must confront a child whose play does not conform to the ideal of child (a) sexuality. The contributors to Curiouser examine the ostensibly simple representations of children that circulate through visual images, life narrative, children’s literature, film, and novels. At issue in these essays are <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> tell to children, <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> tell about children, and <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> tell ourselves as children—stories that ultimately frame what is normative and what is queer. From the fiction of Horatio Alger, Henry James, Djuna Barnes, and Guy Davenport to the spectacles of Michael Jackson, Calvin Klein, and The Exorcist; from the narrative structure of pedophilia to evangelical Christianity; from punk tomboyism to queer girl-scouting: these scholars of childhood and sexuality scrutinize queer childhood energies in an impressive range of cultural forms...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} effects of oral storytelling on collective memory {{and the influence of}} new media on the storytelling process. The inquiry focuses on how retelling and reinterpreting folk stories updates and changes a community’s interpretations of the past to fit with current beliefs and expectations. I illustrate this through analyzing a range of retellings of traditional tales from the nineteenth century to the present through the lenses of memory studies, folklore, and performance studies. Through this analysis I unpack some of <b>the</b> ways <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> tell affect <b>the</b> ways we see the past—whether real or imagined—and conversely, the ways that changing interpretations of the past affect <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>we</b> tell...|$|R
