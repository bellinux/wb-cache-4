5|$|Angie's storylines mostly {{deal with}} her family—husband Nick Bolen (Jeffrey Nordling) and son Danny Bolen (Beau Mirchoff)—and their {{attempts}} to escape their mysterious past, which is explored throughout the season. Although critics initially welcomed the character as a diverse addition to the cast, they grew frustrated with <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> her storyline as the season progressed. Critics compared Angie to Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), a character whose lagging storyline was slow in developing during the series' second season.|$|E
5|$|The Indian {{government}} has {{taken steps to}} alleviate some of the current gender inequalities. In 1992, the government of India established the National Commission for Women. The Commission was meant to address many of the inequalities women face, specifically rape, family and guardianship. However, <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> change in the judicial system and the aforementioned cultural norms have prevented the full adoption of policies meant to promote equality between men and women.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the game's {{graphics}} were good, enjoyed Uematsu's score, and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems. Alongside this, unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace, its convoluted interface, bugs and glitches, and <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> the story. It was generally seen as a great disappointment both as an MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series. Later, {{as part of an}} interview concerning the game's later development, 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned the game into something more playable.|$|E

Crop rotations with perennial systems are possible, but the full rotation will necessarily take longer. <b>The</b> <b>slower</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> rotation—compared with annual crops—could allow a greater buildup of pathogens, pests or weeds in the perennial {{phase of the}} rotation.|$|R
50|$|Those aged {{people think}} that the cost of living is {{relatively}} low in Guangdong compared with Hong Kong (although the cost of living in mainland is still increasing). In addition, the conditions of housing's and community's environment in mainland is better than Hong Kong and <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> life is more suitable for the elderly.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, West {{attracted}} {{media attention}} after he publicly complained about <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> a {{game between the}} Red Sox and Yankees. He also worked the game that year in which Albert Pujols hit his 400th career home run. West has worked several no-hitters, including a 2012 perfect game by Félix Hernández. As of 2016, he has the longest tenure of any MLB umpire. West has appeared in six World Series, three All-Star Games, nine League Championship Series (LCS), eight League Division Series (LDS) and two Wild Card Games.|$|E
5|$|In this {{political}} instability, the colonists requested help from Alvarado; Their request initiated {{a period of}} negotiations between Alvarado and Francisco de Montejo, which resulted in Montejo attempting to renounce his governorship claim over Honduras-Higueras in favour of Alvarado, and Alvarado considering the transfer of his own governorship of Chiapas to Montejo in exchange. Permission was sought from the Crown, which refused the exchange and required Montejo to take up his governorship of Honduras-Higueras. News of this refusal, due to <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> communications with Spain, arrived after Alvarado launched his relief expedition.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E
5000|$|Makes crop {{rotation}} more difficult. Crop rotations with perennial systems are possible, but the full rotation will necessarily take longer. For example, a perennial hay crop. like alfalfa is commonly rotated with annual crops or other perennial hay crops after 3-5 years. <b>The</b> <b>slower</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> rotation—compared with annual crops—could allow a greater buildup of pathogens, pests or weeds in the perennial {{phase of the}} rotation.|$|R
5000|$|In 1906, Seddon died. Joseph Ward, his {{replacement}} (after {{a period of}} stewardship by William Hall-Jones), {{did not have the}} same charismatic flair. Increasingly, the Liberals found themselves losing support on two fronts [...] - [...] farmers, having obtained their goal of land reform, were gradually drifting to the conservative opposition, and workers, having become dissatisfied at <b>the</b> <b>slowed</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> reform, were beginning to talk of an independent labour party.|$|R
50|$|The Gutland {{has a lower}} {{altitude}} {{above sea}} level and a flatter landscape than the Oesling. Geologically, the Gutland is predominantly a large Jurassic-Triassic sandstone formation, part of the Lorrainian system; the Oesling is predominantly Devonian schist and quartz. Both are wooded, but the Oesling's forests are more numerous and thicker, a testament to <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> human development in the Oesling. Most of the Gutland is fertile agricultural territory (hence the name).|$|R
5|$|After heavy {{damage from}} Cyclone Bonita in 1996, the {{government}} of Madagascar initiated a disaster response system that was used during Gretelle; there was quick response but efforts were hampered by damaged infrastructure and disrupted transportation. The storm had cut communications in some areas, but by January29, or five days after landfall, telephone service was restored to Manakara. Following the storm, the Madagascar government coordinated the distribution of emergency rice rations and other relief items. On January27, the government launched a fundraiser on television that raised over ₣130million (FMG, $30,000 USD). The southern portion {{of the country was}} declared a disaster area. A plane of relief supplies flew from the capital Antananarivo to Manakara along the southeast coast, where trucks distributed the items to the affected areas. A radio station based out of the country criticized <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> relief, citing the lack of available boats after many were destroyed. In addition, there were reports that government aid was being stolen by looters.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this and the report of a committee investigating <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> the Court of Chancery, the Judicature Commission was formed in 1867, and given a wide remit to investigate reform of the courts, the law, and the legal profession. Five reports were issued, from 25 March 1869 to 10 July 1874, with the first (dealing {{with the formation of}} a single Supreme Court of Judicature) considered the most influential. The report disposed of the previous idea of merging the common law and equity, and instead suggested a single Supreme Court capable of using both. In 1870 the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherly, attempted to bring the recommendations into law through an Act of Parliament, but did not go to the trouble of consulting the judiciary or the leader of the Conservatives, who controlled the House of Lords. The bill ran into strong opposition from lawyers and judges, particularly Alexander Cockburn. After Hatherly was replaced by Lord Selborne in September 1872, a second bill was introduced after consultation with the judiciary; although along the same lines, it was far more detailed.|$|E
5|$|The twin {{impacts of}} hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel {{prompted}} officials in Mexico {{to declare a}} state of emergency in 155municipalities in Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chihuahua. The nation's Health Ministry sent medical crews across the country to affected areas in an effort {{to prevent the spread of}} disease; the agency also suggested residents boil their water. Officials opened shelters in Tamaulipas for residents whose houses were damaged, housing about 2,000people in the weeks following the storm. The Mexican food bank sent about 800tons of food to the hardest-hit parts of the country in Guerrero, Veracruz, and Sinaloa. In addition, the Mexican Red Cross delivered 186tons of food to Veracruz alone. Volunteers delivered about 600blankets and various cleaning supplies to the town of Pánuco. Following the storms, the National Civil Protection Coordination received the authority to prevent housing construction in areas at risk for mudslides and flooding; the law had passed in 2012, but initially lacked the authority to enforce it. Some residents in Tamaulipas complained at <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> receiving aid. In response, the Gulf Cartel brought relief items to Aldama, with one columnist for El Universal suggesting that this was to gain favor with local residents.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of Trumpism and the victory of fast {{emotions}} over <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> reasoning and education, Dick Pels hails the unique perspective encouraged by science; <b>the</b> ability to <b>slow</b> down, freeze-frame, and dissect things, liberated from the demands of urgency, immediacy and publicity.

50|$|By {{the end of}} {{that decade}} the {{challenge}} had begun to take its toll. Exhausted, and diagnosed with Chronic fatigue syndrome, Nicholson resigned from his position at the LRC and took up a lecturing post at the Durban campus of the University of Natal where he taught evidence, civil procedure and professional practice. <b>The</b> <b>slower</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> life in academia allowed him to spend time following his other pursuits - music and sport and to recover his health.|$|R

5000|$|The Geisha {{one-shot}} comic {{marked a}} dramatic shift in Watson's style, bringing in stylistic influences from European creators such as François Avril and Dupuy and Berberian, but retaining <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> <b>pacing</b> <b>of</b> long-form Manga.

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{limitations}} of educational video games is that they leave little room for spontaneous play. A child may be involved and have some degree of control in a game but ultimately cannot control {{the direction in which}} the game will go, hindering the notion of self-directed play as a means for learning. It has been noted that educational video games can help students focus; however, once the game has ended many find it hard to adapt back to <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> receiving information in the classroom.|$|R
2500|$|Junior {{high school}} spans grades 7 through 9 {{and is the}} last half of {{compulsory}} education. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> elementary school, junior high students typically have a single goal in life: to score high on the national senior high school entrance exams at the end of 9th grade. Consequently, the pressure on students from teachers and parents is intense, because there will be only one test per year.
