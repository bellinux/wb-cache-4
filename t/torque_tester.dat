A digital display is {{used to measure the}} output signal from the transducer and calculates that reading into a torque value that is displayed on screen. In most cases the display and transducer are contained together inside a housing. This is known as a “Desktop Torque Tester”.

50|$|Norbar has {{manufactured}} <b>torque</b> <b>testers</b> {{for almost}} {{as long as they have}} manufactured wrenches. The earliest types employed a simple spring balance attached to a pivoted bar. The next evolution was to utilise a hydraulic cell and hydraulically activated gauge. The 'Static Torque Meter' was much more compact than the earlier versions and were easier to use because this system avoided the needle fluctuations of the spring balance type. This product enjoyed a near 50 year life span before finally being rendered obsolete by electronic measurement methods.|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis The {{amount and}} {{distribution}} of slip agents, erucamide, and behenamide, {{on the surface of}} high-density polyethene, is determined by integral characteristics of slip agent structure and polymer morphology. A suite of surface analysis techniques was applied to correlate physicochemical properties with slip-additive migration behaviour and their surface morphology. The migration, surface morphology and physicochemical properties of the slip additives, crystallinity and orientation of polyethene spherulites and interaction between slip additives and high-density polyethene influence the surface characteristics. Experimental The high-density polyethene closures were produced with erucamide and behenamide separately and stored until they produced required torque. Surface composition was determined employing spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The distribution of additives was observed under optical, scanning electron and atomic force microscopes. The surface energy, crystallinity and application torque were measured using contact angle, differential scanning calorimeter and a <b>torque</b> force <b>tester</b> respectively. Results and discussion Each slip additive produced a characteristic amide peak at 1645 cm - 1 in infrared spectroscopy and peaks of oxygen and nitrogen in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, suggesting their presence on the surface. The erucamide produced placoid scale-like structures and behenamide formed denticulate structures. The surface erucamide and behenamide responsible for reducing the torque was found to be 15. 7 µg/cm 2 and 1. 7 µg/cm 2...|$|R
50|$|A torque sensor, torque {{transducer}} or {{torque meter}} is a device for measuring and recording the torque on a rotating system, {{such as an}} engine, crankshaft, gearbox, transmission, rotor, a bicycle crank or cap <b>torque</b> <b>tester.</b> Static torque {{is relatively easy to}} measure. Dynamic torque, on the other hand, is not easy to measure, since it generally requires transfer of some effect (electric, hydraulic or magnetic) from the shaft being measured to a static system.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>torque</b> <b>tester</b> [...] is {{required}} during the packaging design process. It {{could be used}} as a destructive tester to identify if there is any material weakness of the packaging during the screwing process. It also allows to define the torque tolerances of the capping machine. The lower torque limit is considered as the minimum pressure of the cap to avoid any leak of the product. This torque test needs to be combined with a leak test with secure seal analyzer. The higher torque limit is the maximum torque the customer can apply to open or close the product's cap.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} devoted to the static {{friction}} torque of electromagnetic clutch. The torque maximization is also investigated by optimizing the geometrical shape of armature. For the purpose of designing and optimizing electromagnetic clutch, torque prediction is a very important factor. We construct an axi-symmetric FEM model to analyze static friction torque and use a <b>torque</b> <b>tester</b> to evaluate real torque. In this work, analytically predicted torque is compared with the experimental one to discuss the rationality of numerical process. The analytical result agrees well with experimental data, which proves the validity of the mathematical process.

40|$|The {{design of}} a novel apparatus, the Glen Withy <b>torque</b> <b>tester</b> (GWTT), for {{measuring}} horizontal shear properties in equine sport surfaces is described. Previous research has considered the effect of vertical loading on equine performance and injury but only limited discussion has concerned the grip or horizontal motion of the hoof. The horizontal support of the hoof by the surface must be sufficient to avoid excess slip without overloading the limb. The GWTT measures the torque necessary to twist an artificial hoof that is being pushed into the surface under a consistently applied vertical load. Its output was validated using a steel surface, then {{was used to test}} two sand and fibre surfaces (waxed and non-waxed) through rotations of 40 – 140 °, and vertical loads of 157 – 1138 N. An Orono biomechanical surface tester (OBST) measured longitudinal shear and vertical force, whilst a traction tester measured rotational shear after being dropped onto the surfaces. A weak, but significant, linear relationship was found between rotational shear measured using the GWTT and longitudinal shear quantified using the OBST. However, only the GWTT was able to detect significant differences in shear resistance between the surfaces. Future work should continue to investigate the strain rate and non-linear load response of surfaces used in equestrian sports. Measurements should be closely tied to horse biomechanics and should include information on the maintenance condition and surface composition. Both the GWTT and the OBST are necessary to adequately characterise all the important functional properties of equine sport surfaces...|$|E

Author {{corporate}} affiliation: Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio""February 2000. "Final report. July 27 - 29, 1998 This report {{documents the}} results of a series of tests in which several different types of performance-based brake testers (PBBTs) were compared side-by-side (i. e. a round robin test) in their ability to accurately measure brake forces (BFs) and wheel loads (WLs) of commercial vehicles (CVs), and to then predict the vehicle deceleration capability for a 32. 2 km/hr on-road stopping test. The PBBTs consisted of five roller dynamometers (RD), two flat plate (FP) testers, and one breakaway <b>torque</b> <b>tester</b> (BTT). A PBBT that can also meet a set of functional specifications could be used for law enforcement by safety inspectors once performance-based criteria are codified. In the test program, specific ratios of BF to WL were imposed on both a 5 -axle combination tractor semi-trailer and a two-axle straight truck, in both the fully laden and unladen conditions. In each loading condition, the overall vehicle braking capability was set to achieve a proposed minimum requirement of 0. 4 g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. In addition, the brakes on specific individual wheels were set to provide a BF/WL of 0. 25 and 0. 35, for a steer and a non-steer wheel, respectively. The vehicles were also instrumented to record stopping distances and decelerations from on-road stopping tests performed from 32. 2 km/hr. In general, nearly all of the PBBTs were able to accurately measure the CVs' brake forces. Only one of the FP-type testers experienced erratic performance during the round robin. In contrast several of the PBBTs had difficulty in reporting the accurate gross vehicle weight. In some cases, particularly with the portable PBBTs the reported wheel loads for axles 2 and 4 (the lead axle on the tandem set) of the 5 -axle vehicle were very high, leading to an under-prediction of the vehicle deceleration capability. Calibration checks of the PBBT weighing mechanisms indicated that all could meet the functional specifications. As such, it was concluded that accounting for the redistribution of axle loads due to the vehicle suspension and the geometry of the PBBT ramp would require special test procedures or remote entry of vehicle or axle weights for use in law enforcement. The repeatability of all the PBBTs was good, meeting the acceptability criteria in more than 93 percent of the test casesSubject code: XQCSSubject code: NVHSubject code: NVGBBSubject code: DZNHSubject code: DEFSubject code: WVOSubject code: D...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Flexible {{pavements}} {{consist of}} multilayers, which form the pavement structures. Since {{the strength of}} the bond at interface between layers plays a significant role in improving the structural integri-ty and the performance of pavement structures, tack coat materials and methods used for their application during construction are important in providing an adequate bond strength between pavement lifts. Tack coat is a bituminous liquid asphalt (a mixture of water, asphalt binder, and an emulsifying agent) and usually applied to provide a bond between pavement lifts. The absence of the tack coat adhesion at the interface between layers leads to increased stresses in the pave-ment structure. An inspection procedure to monitor the performance of the interlayer bond dur-ing the pavement use phase and identifying bond failures is critical to improve pavement man-agement systems and develop more effective pavement design strategies. In this study, two dif-ferent devices were developed at Oregon State University to evaluate the tack coat performance in the field. First, the wireless Oregon Field Tack Coat Tester (OFTCT) device was developed to predict the long-term performance of the in-situ tack coat bond strength and to evaluate the impact of pave-ment surface cleanliness before tack coat application on bond strength. Correlations between OFTCT field test results and the results of laboratory shear tests conducted with cores taken from the field were investigated to determine the effectiveness of the OFTCT tests. A new heat-ing system (an adjustable heat gun and environmental chamber) was developed to reduce the tack coat’s curing time in the field and control temperature during testing. The results indicated that the OFTCT device can be successfully utilized in the field to differentiate between clean and dusty surfaces before tack coat application. By using wireless sensors controlled by a laptop, practicality of the device was improved to reduce the testing time. The correlation between OFTCT and laboratory shear test results was determined to be statistically significant (R² = 0. 5189). OFTCT was able to identify the tack coats with high and low interlayer shear strength (ISS). Second, a new low cost field test device, Oregon Field <b>Torque</b> <b>Tester</b> (OFTT), was developed to evaluate the long-term post-construction tack coat performance of pavement sections. Correla-tions between OFTT field test results and the results of laboratory shear tests conducted with cores taken from the field were investigated to determine the effectiveness of the OFTT tests. The peak torque values at failure measured by the OFTT were observed to be highly correlated with the measured lab shear strengths. To conclude, both of the developed devices are expected to be adapted as field tests to evaluate the performance of tack coats in the field and to mitigate pavement distresses observed on roadways...|$|E
