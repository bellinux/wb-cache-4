25|$|One major {{difference}} between these two approaches is the agent's responsibility. Positive consequentialism demands that we bring about good states of affairs, whereas negative consequentialism requires that we avoid bad ones. Stronger versions of negative consequentialism will require active intervention to prevent bad and ameliorate existing harm. In weaker versions, simple forbearance from acts tending to harm others is sufficient. An example of this is <b>the</b> <b>Slippery</b> <b>Slope</b> Argument, which encourages others to avoid a specified act {{on the grounds that it}} may ultimately lead to undesirable consequences.|$|E

50|$|Different {{writers have}} {{classified}} <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> arguments in different and often contradictory ways, {{but there are}} two basic types of argument that have been described as <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> arguments. One type has been called <b>the</b> causal <b>slippery</b> <b>slope,</b> and <b>the</b> distinguishing feature of this type is that the various steps leading from p to z are events with each event being the cause of the next in the sequence. The second type might be called <b>the</b> judgmental <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> with <b>the</b> idea being that the 'slope' does not consist of a series of events but is such that, for whatever reason, if a person makes one particular judgment they will rationally have to make another and so on. The judgmental type may be further sub-divided into conceptual <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes</b> and decisional <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes.</b>|$|R

[...] Potter explained, [...] "The industry has always tried to make Americans think that government-run systems are {{the worst thing that could}} possibly happen to them, that even if you consider that, you're heading down on <b>the</b> <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> towards socialism.

2500|$|During the campaign, a {{controversy}} arose when Barbour chose {{to speak at}} the Blackhawk Rally, a fundraiser for the Blackhawk [...] "council school" [...] in Blackhawk, Mississippi. Such [...] "council schools", also referred to in Mississippi lexicon as [...] "academies", were established by the White Citizens' Council movement in reaction to the demands for racial integration by the Civil Rights Movement. The Blackhawk rally was hosted by the Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC). A photograph of Barbour with CCC members appeared on the CCC webpage, and some commentators and pundits demanded that Barbour ask for his picture to be removed from the site, but Barbour refused. Barbour stated that [...] "Once you start down <b>the</b> <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> of saying, 'That person can't be for me,' then where do you stop? ... I don't care who has my picture. My picture's in the public domain." [...] Barbour's Democratic opponent, then-governor Ronnie Musgrove, declined to be critical, stating that he had also attended Blackhawk rallies in the past, and would have done so that year except for a scheduling conflict. Historically, both Democrats and Republicans have participated in Blackhawk rallies.|$|E

40|$|Any {{suggestion}} of altering the genetic makeup {{of human beings}} through gene therapy is quite likely to provoke a response involving some reference to a 'slippery slope'. In this article the author examines the topography of {{two different types of}} <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> argument, <b>the</b> logical <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> and <b>the</b> rhetorical <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> argument. <b>The</b> logical form of the argument suggests that if we permit somatic cell gene therapy then we are committed to accepting germ line gene therapy in the future because there is no logically sustainable distinction between them. The rhetorical form posits that allowing somatic cell therapy now will be taking the first step on a <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> which will ultimately lead to the type of genocide perpetrated by the Nazis. The author tests the validity of these lines of argument against the facts of human gene therapy and concludes that because of their dependence on probabilities that cannot be empirically proven they should be largely disregarded in the much more important debate on moral line-drawing in gene therapy...|$|R
50|$|Ropes were lowered {{along the}} trail to help the {{travelers}} balance and continue up <b>the</b> <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes.</b> After 1897 a tramway was built so that wealthy travelers could ease their last 600 feet up the Pass. The tramway was powered by two horses, and it cost 1 ½ cents a pound to hire. Historians have estimated the builder of the tramway was making $150 per day by his development. On {{the other side of}} the Pass was Emerald Lake. To travel down the mountain, the travelers faced a descent of 1300 feet over the horizontal distance of approximately 9 miles. The crest through the mountain and the path down it, were often filled with snow all year round, making the trek more difficult.|$|R

One of them, it was evident, must leave the trail, but Ingleby felt that the question which that one would be was by no means decided yet.

This face was mature in a terrifying, ageless way. There was no anger in it, nor was it even pitiless. It seemed to have glazed as hard and passionlessly as his eyes. Something came to her of her wonderful mother's tales of the ancient Saxons, and he seemed to her one of those Saxons, and she caught a glimpse, on the well of her consciousness, of a long, dark boat, with a prow like the beak of a bird of prey, and of huge, half-naked men, wing-helmeted, and one of their faces, it seemed to her, was his face. She did not reason this. She felt it, and visioned it as by an unthinkable clairvoyance, and gasped, for the flurry of war was over.

50|$|How {{the animals}} {{at the site}} died is unknown, {{but there is no}} {{evidence}} that humans were involved. The current theory is that approximately 68,000 years ago, at least 19 mammoths from a nursery herd were trapped in a steep-sided channel during a flash flood and drowned and/or were buried by mud. A camel was also trapped and killed during this event. Later floods buried the remains. A second event took place sometime later. During this event, an unidentified animal associated with a juvenile saber-toothed cat (genus Smilodon) died and was buried. The third event claimed the lives of a bull mammoth, two juvenile mammoths, and an adult female. Approximately 15,000 years after the nursery herd was trapped, these animals also appear to have been victims of rising water, unable to escape due to <b>the</b> <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes</b> of <b>the</b> surrounding channel.|$|R
40|$|A growing {{literature}} {{in law and}} public policy harnesses research in behavioral economics to justify {{a new form of}} paternalism. Contributors to this literature typically emphasize the modest, non-intrusive character of their proposals. A distinct {{literature in}} law and public policy analyzes the validity of “slippery slope” arguments. Contributors to this literature have identified various mechanisms and processes by which <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes</b> operate, as well as the circumstances in which the threat of such slopes is greatest. The present article sits at the nexus of the new paternalist literature and <b>the</b> <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes</b> literature. We argue that the new paternalism exhibits many characteristics identified by the slopes literature as conducive to <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes.</b> Specifically, <b>the</b> new paternalism exhibits considerable theoretical and empirical vagueness, making it vulnerable to slopes resulting from altered economic incentives, enforcement needs, deference to perceived authority, bias toward simple principles, and reframing of the status quo. These slope processes are especially likely when decisionmakers are subject to cognitive biases – as the new paternalists insist they are. Consequently, soft paternalism can pave the way for harder paternalism. We conclude that policymaking based on new paternalist reasoning should be considered with greater trepidation than its advocates have suggested...|$|R

60|$|The slow minutes passed. Smoke {{centered}} {{his soul}} on the dull hurt of a hang-nail {{on one of}} his fingers. He should have clipped it away that morning--it was hurting then--he decided; and he resolved, once clear of the crevasse, that it should immediately be clipped. Then, with short focus, he stared at the hang-nail and the finger with a new comprehension. In a minute, or a few minutes at best, that hang-nail, that finger, cunningly jointed and efficient, might be part of a mangled carcass {{at the bottom of the}} crevasse. Conscious of his fear, he hated himself. Bear-eaters were made of sterner stuff. In the anger of self-revolt he all but hacked at the rope with his knife. But fear made him draw back the hand and to stick himself again, trembling and sweating, to <b>the</b> <b>slippery</b> <b>slope.</b> To the fact that he was soaking wet by contact with the thawing ice he tried to attribute the cause of his shivering; but he knew, in the heart of him, that it was untrue.|$|E
6000|$|Yet let me {{confess that}} I am greatly {{attracted}} by such fine phrases as the Will of God, the Hand of God, the Great Commander.

But I feel that there is a great danger in doing this sort of thing unguardedly. Many people would be glad for rather trivial and unworthy reasons that I should confess a faith in God, and few would take offence. But the run of people even nowadays mean something more and something different when they say [...] "God." [...] They intend a personality exterior to them and limited, and they will instantly conclude I mean the same thing. To permit that misconception is, I feel, the first step on <b>the</b> <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> of meretricious complaisance, is to become in some small measure a successor of those who cried, [...] "Great is Diana of the Ephesians."

60|$|That evening, by {{the last}} delivery, he received, under the Dover postmark, a letter that was not from Miss Teagle. It was a {{slightly}} confused but altogether friendly note, written that morning after breakfast, the ostensible purpose of which was {{to thank him for}} the amiability of his visit, to express regret at any appearance the writer might have had of meddling with what didn't concern her, and to let him know that the evening before, after he had left her, she had in a moment of inspiration got hold of the tail of a really musical idea--a perfect accompaniment for the song he had so kindly given her. She had scrawled, as a specimen, a few bars {{at the end of her}} note, mystic, mocking musical signs which had no sense for her correspondent. The whole letter testified to a restless but rather pointless desire to remain in communication with him. In answering her, however, which he did that night before going to bed, it was on this bright possibility of their collaboration, its advantages for the future of each of them, that Baron principally expatiated. He spoke of this future with an eloquence of which he would have defended the sincerity, and drew of it a picture extravagantly rich. The next morning, as he was about to settle himself to tasks for some time terribly neglected, with a sense that after all it was rather a relief not to be sitting so close to Sir Dominick Ferrand, who had become dreadfully distracting; at the very moment at which he habitually addressed his preliminary invocation to the muse, he was agitated by the arrival of a telegram which proved to be an urgent request from Mr. Locket that he would immediately come down and see him. This represented, for poor Baron, whose funds were very low, another morning sacrificed, but somehow it didn't even occur to him that he might impose his own time upon the editor of the Promiscuous, the keeper of the keys of renown. He had some of the plasticity of the raw contributor. He gave the muse another holiday, feeling she was really ashamed to take it, and in course of time found himself in Mr. Locket's own chair at Mr. Locket's own table--so much nobler an expanse than <b>the</b> <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> of the davenport--considering with quick intensity, in the white flash of certain words just brought out by his host, the quantity of happiness, of emancipation that might reside in a hundred pounds.|$|E
