We isolated a mutation, rtt 100 - 1, that increases the transposition of genomic Ty 1 elements 18 - to 56 -fold but has little effect on the transposition of related Ty 2 elements. rtt 100 - 1 was shown to be a null allele of the FUS 3 gene, which encodes a haploid-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase. In fus 3 mutants, the levels of Ty 1 RNA, protein synthesis, and proteolytic processing were not altered relative to those in FUS 3 strains but steady-state levels of TyA, integrase, and reverse transcriptase proteins and Ty 1 cDNA were all increased. These findings suggest that Fus 3 suppresses Ty 1 <b>transposition</b> <b>by</b> destabilizing viruslike particle-associated proteins. The Fus 3 kinase is activated through the mating-pheromone response pathway by phosphorylation at basal levels in naive cells and at enhanced levels in pheromone-treated cells. We demonstrate that suppression of Ty 1 transposition in naive cells requires basal levels of Fus 3 activation. Substitution of conserved amino acids required for activation of Fus 3 derepressed Ty 1 transposition. Moreover, epistasis analyses revealed that components of the pheromone response pathway that act upstream of Fus 3, including Ste 4, Ste 5, Ste 7, and Ste 11, are required for the posttranslational suppression of Ty 1 <b>transposition</b> <b>by</b> Fus 3.

40|$|The {{widespread}} occurrence among eukaryotes {{of sex and}} {{of mobile}} DNA sequences requires an evolutionary explanation, since both appear to reduce individual fitness. Both phenomena have been hypothesized to provide fitness advantages to populations, but such explanations require rather than explain the initial establishment of mobile elements and genes for sex. Genes encoding sexuality may invade asexual populations as molecular parasites, whose success then allows mobile elements to spread as parasites of sexual genomes. The prediction that mobile elements can invade only sexual populations was tested using isogenic sexual and asexual populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the retrotransposon Ty 3. Active Ty 3 elements more consistently invaded sexual than asexual populations. In subsequent experiments involving selection on media containing ethanol as a carbon source or $ beta$-glycerophosphate as a limiting phosphorus source, <b>transposition</b> <b>by</b> galactose-induced Ty 3 elements produced none of the mutations involved in adaptation to these media, and conferred no adaptive advantage among competing populations. The mean copy numbers of two mobile elements were unchanged by long-term sexual or asexual propagation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii populations, because <b>transposition</b> <b>by</b> these elements occurred very rarely or {{had no effect on}} fitness.
