Each individual living organism is formed by their temporary combination. They stand to it in the relation of the particles of water to a cascade, or a whirlpool; or <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould,</b> into which the water is poured. The form of the organism is thus determined by the reaction between external conditions and the inherent activities of the organic molecules of which it is composed; and, as the stoppage of a whirlpool destroys nothing but a form, and leaves the molecules of the water, with all their inherent activities intact, so what we call the death and putrefaction of an animal, or of a plant, is merely the breaking up of the form, or manner of association, of its constituent organic molecules, which are then set free as infusorial animalcules.|$|E

40|$|From the {{standpoint}} of infectious etiology there exists a curious paradox, {{in regard to the}} organisms of blastomycosis. A dis-ease, which is both clinically and pathologically an entity, ap-pears to be caused by a group of organisms comprising at least four distinct types which vary in their morphology from a bud-ding yeast form, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> type having aerial hyphae with fruit organs, and reproducing by endosporulation. Obviously it is difficult to reconcile this state of affairs with our views of the specific infective capacity of single types of bacteria for the clinical entities that they produce. In order to conform to this view Ricketts (1901) regarded the several types as more closely related than their diverse morphology might indicate. Yet there are others who take the position that these types are really distinct species and therefore find difficulty in explaining their relationship to the disease. On the ground that these organisms comprise a more or less homogeneous group as Ricketts believed, there would seem to be no good reason why more than one type should not be isolated from the same case of the disease. It is entirely conceivable that one might find a different type of organism in the young lesion than in the old, inasmuch {{as it is in the}} latter that they have been under the perpetual assault of the immunologic forces of the host. Such a situation would amount to a dissociation of types within the host tissue, in which event one should be able to isolate them...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPolymer extrusion, {{in which}} a polymer is melted and {{conveyed}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> or die, forms the basis of most polymer processing techniques. Extruders frequently run at non-optimised conditions and can account for 15 – 20 % of overall process energy losses. In times of increasing energy efficiency such losses are a major concern for the industry. Product quality, which depends on the homogeneity and stability of the melt flow which in turn depends on melt temperature and screw speed, is also an issue of concern of processors. Gear pumps {{can be used to}} improve the stability of the production line, but the cost is usually high. Likewise it is possible to introduce energy meters but they also add to the capital cost of the machine. Advanced control incorporating soft sensing capabilities offers opportunities to this industry to improve both quality and energy efficiency. Due to strong correlations between the critical variables, such as the melt temperature and melt pressure, traditional decentralized PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control is incapable of handling such processes if stricter product specifications are imposed or the material is changed from one batch to another. In this paper, new real-time energy monitoring methods have been introduced without the need to install power meters or develop data-driven models. The effects of process settings on energy efficiency and melt quality are then studied based on developed monitoring methods. Process variables include barrel heating temperature, water cooling temperature, and screw speed. Finally, a fuzzy logic controller is developed for a single screw extruder to achieve high melt quality. The resultant performance of the developed controller has shown it to be a satisfactory alternative to the expensive gear pump. Energy efficiency of the extruder can further be achieved by optimising the temperature settings. Experimental results from open-loop control and fuzzy control on a Killion 25 mm single screw extruder are presented to confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|Continuous casting is the {{dominating}} {{process to}} cast steel. Liquid steel is continuously fed from a tundish <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> through a casting nozzle. The flow {{conditions in the}} mould {{are influenced by the}} flow pattern inside the casting nozzle as well as the level of steel in the tundish. The flow into the mould is regulated by a stopper rod or a slide gate. The surface of the strand solidifies quickly in the mould and it is important to maintain a constant level of steel to avoid surface defects. A new physical model that simulates continuous casting has been developed. A physical model of this type is unique. The scale of the model is a commonly used full-scale casting machine at slab casters, except the dimension of the tundish. It is possible to generate different types of flow conditions at simulation in the model. Water and liquid steel has similar kinematic viscosity and water is therefore often used for simulation of the continuous casting process. This simulation has been performed using an alloy with a low melting point. The alloy has besides the low melting point, similar physical properties as steel. Measurements with a compact laser vibrometer have been performed to examine the possibility to quantify the volumetric flow of alloy in the model. The compact laser vibrometer measures the vibrations {{on the surface of the}} casting nozzle as the alloy flows through during simulation. The flow of alloy in the model is determined by the velocity of the pump. A calibration of the pump was done to specify the volumetric flow at a specific pumping velocity. This provides the possibility to examine the signal from the sensor during controlled circumstances. The investigation was performed during simulation at specific single phase flows. It was found that the compact laser vibrometer shows a trend of increasing frequency at higher flow rates. A background noise was created by the engine of the pump and measurements were done to be able to exclude this type of disturbance. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate mould growth resistance of different types of wood products which include the sheathing and framing within full scale wall assemblies. Secondary objectives were to investigate the difference in mould growth resistance between borate-treated and untreated wood products as well as provide information about mould growth under different temperature and humidity conditions for treated and untreated wood products. The objective of the study is to better understand mould growth, and to examine the effects of varying high moisture conditions on wooden products and the mould growth which may result. More importantly this will be examined on full scale wall assemblies; to date mould growth studies have only been performed within a laboratory on small samples of materials. Moreover, this study recreates the conditions which evidently cause mould growth on full scale wall assemblies. Tests were performed within a climate chamber on three full scale wall assemblies. The original scope of this study included an examination of the sheathing and framing components within a full scale wall assembly, however this study will focus mainly on the sheathing. Results of this study indicate that the relative humidity conditions needed for mould growth on wood are higher than originally believed (i. e., significantly greater than 80 %RH). During the first eight weeks of test number one the relative humidity at the surface of the sheathing was held constant at 95 % and little mould growth was observed on the untreated sheathing (mould growth index of 3 or less); little or no mould growth on the treated sheathing (mould growth index of 1 or less). The second and third tests demonstrated that the presence of liquid water greatly accelerated the time to germinations, the amount of mould growth (up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> growth index of 6), and the rate of mould growth. All three tests clearly showed that borate-treatment reduced the amount of mould growth; however, the concentration of borate-treatment, and the types of materials treated, does affect the resistance of mould growth. Furthermore, there was some evidence to suggest Borate treatments of the plywood increased the time to germination significantly, from a few weeks to 16 weeks in this study, but once mould growth was initiated, the rate of mould growth was similar to that of the untreated plywood. Two mathematical models to determine mould growth were examined: Viitanen and WUFIBIO (Sedlbauer). Viitanen?s model predicted time to germination and rate of growth rate well for untreated plywood, and WUFIBIO predicted time to germination but not the growth rate. It was also found both models err on the side of caution in predicting mould growth. Recommendations include improvements to the test method and producers, and for future work...|$|E
40|$|The {{submerged}} entry nozzle (SEN) is used {{to transport}} the molten steel from a tundish <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>mould.</b> The main purpose of its usage is to prevent oxygen and nitrogen pick-up by molten steel from the gas. Furthermore, to achieve the desired flow conditions in the mould. Therefore, the SEN {{can be considered as}} a vital factor for a stable casting process and the steel quality. In addition, the steelmaking processes occur at high temperatures around 1873 K, so the interaction between the refractory materials of the SEN and molten steel is unavoidable. Therefore, the knowledge of the SEN behaviors during preheating and casting processes is necessary for the design of the steelmaking processes  The internal surfaces of modern SENs are coated with a glass/silicon powder layer to prevent the SEN graphite oxidation during preheating. The effects of the interaction between the coating layer and the SEN base refractory materials on clogging were studied. A large number of accretion samples formed inside alumina-graphite clogged SENs were examined using FEG-SEM-EDS and Feature analysis. The internal coated SENs were used for continuous casting of stainless steel grades alloyed with Rare Earth Metals (REM). The post-mortem study results clearly revealed the formation of a multi-layer accretion. A harmful effect of the SENs decarburization on the accretion thickness was also indicated. In addition, the results indicated a penetration of the formed alkaline-rich glaze into the alumina-graphite base refractory. More specifically, the alkaline-rich glaze reacts with graphite to form a carbon monoxide gas. Thereafter, dissociation of CO at the interface between SEN and molten metal takes place. This leads to reoxidation of dissolved alloying elements such as REM (Rare Earth Metal). This reoxidation forms the “In Situ” REM oxides at the interface between the SEN and the REM alloyed molten steel. Also, the interaction of the penetrated glaze with alumina in the SEN base refractory materials leads to the formation of a high-viscous alumina-rich glaze during the SEN preheating process. This, in turn, creates a very uneven surface at the SEN internal surface. Furthermore, these uneven areas react with dissolved REM in molten steel to form REM aluminates, REM silicates and REM alumina-silicates. The formation of the large “in-situ” REM oxides and the reaction of the REM alloying elements with the previously mentioned SEN´s uneven areas may provide a large REM-rich surface in contact with the primary inclusions in molten steel. This may facilitate the attraction and agglomeration of the primary REM oxide inclusions on the SEN internal surface and thereafter the clogging. The study revealed the disadvantages of the glass/silicon powder coating applications and the SEN decarburization. The decarburization behaviors of Al 2 O 3 -C, ZrO 2 -C and MgO-C refractory materials from a commercial Submerged Entry Nozzle (SEN), were also investigated for different gas atmospheres consisting of CO 2, O 2 and Ar. The gas ratio values were kept the same as it is in a propane combustion flue gas at different Air-Fuel-Ratio (AFR) values for both Air-Fuel and Oxygen-Fuel combustion systems. Laboratory experiments were carried out under nonisothermal conditions followed by isothermal heating. The decarburization ratio (α) values of all three refractory types were determined by measuring the real time weight losses of the samples. The results showed the higher decarburization ratio (α) values increasing for MgO-C refractory when changing the Air-Fuel combustion to Oxygen-Fuel combustion at the same AFR value. It substantiates the SEN preheating advantage at higher temperatures for shorter holding times compared to heating at lower temperatures during longer holding times for Al 2 O 3 -C samples. Diffusion models were proposed for estimation of the decarburization rate of an Al 2 O 3 -C refractory in the SEN. Two different methods were studied to prevent the SEN decarburization during preheating: The effect of an ZrSi 2 antioxidant and the coexistence of an antioxidant additive and a (4 B 2 O 3 ·BaO) glass powder on carbon oxidation for non-isothermal and isothermal heating conditions in a controlled atmosphere. The coexistence of 8 wt% ZrSi 2 and 15 wt% (4 B 2 O 3 ·BaO) glass powder of the total alumina-graphite refractory base materials, presented the most effective resistance to carbon oxidation. The 121 % volume expansion due to the Zircon formation during heating and filling up the open pores by a (4 B 2 O 3 ·BaO) glaze during the green body sintering led to an excellent carbon oxidation resistance. The effects of the plasma spray-PVD coating of the Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) powder on the carbon oxidation of the Al 2 O 3 -C coated samples were investigated. Trials were performed at non-isothermal heating conditions in a controlled atmosphere. Also, the applied temperature profile for the laboratory trials were defined based on the industrial preheating trials. The controlled atmospheres consisted of CO 2, O 2 and Ar. The thicknesses of the decarburized layers were measured and examined using light optic microscopy, FEG-SEM and EDS. A 250 - 290 μm YSZ coating is suggested to be an appropriate coating, as it provides both an even surface as well as prevention of the decarburization even during heating in air. In addition, the interactions between the YSZ coated alumina-graphite refractory base materials in contact with a cerium alloyed molten stainless steel were surveyed. The YSZ coating provided a total prevention of the alumina reduction by cerium. Therefore, the prevention of the first clogging product formed {{on the surface of the}} SEN refractory base materials. Therefore, the YSZ plasma-PVD coating can be recommended for coating of the hot surface of the commercial SENs. QC 20111014 </p...|$|E
