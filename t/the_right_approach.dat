25|$|Let's Plays {{can also}} be seen harming a game's {{distribution}} particularly for short, linear, narrative-driven games, since viewers can witness the entire game from a Let's Play recording without purchasing it and have no incentive to purchase the title. For the art game That Dragon, Cancer, its developer Ryan Green noted that while there were Let's Plays of the game, several which commented emotionally on the game's topic, some of these playthroughs had simply played through the game without added commentary, and provided no links to where players could learn more about the title. Green and his team at Numinous Games had used YouTube's ContentID to have some of these videos taken down, a result that brought some complaints and which Green admitted later was not <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>approach</b> to address the issue. Green requested that with games such as That Dragon, Cancer, that those creating Let's Play use the playthrough of the game to initiation conversations with their viewers, and that viewers could show their appreciation of the game by tipping the developers in lieu of purchasing the full title.|$|E

500|$|Cooper's {{style of}} underplaying before the camera {{surprised}} {{many of his}} directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, [...] "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't {{going to be any}} good. But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking." [...] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, [...] "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>approach.</b> On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures." [...] His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, [...] "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with." ...|$|E
500|$|Revolution Software and THQ {{announced}} Broken Sword: The Angel of Death on August 17, 2005. According to Charles Cecil, the Broken Sword {{was originally}} {{planned to be}} a trilogy, but that {{after the release of}} Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon, the demand from fans for a sequel was overwhelming. Though The Sleeping Dragon benefited commercially from being released on console as well as PC, this approach required certain development compromises as the PC version was held back by the constraints of the console versions. As a result, The Angel of Death was written for PC only [...] "so as to really push the boundaries in terms of the technology and graphics." [...] As a series' first, Revolution was not the only developer, but was co-developed by Revolution and Sumo Digital. Cecil believed that because of the requirement for ever larger team sizes, it was no longer possible to maintain a large development team to write single original titles, resulting in Revolution closed the production side in order to concentrate on design, and Sumo to concentrate on production. It is the first game to be amBX enabled. Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon was criticised for featuring a high number of action elements. Cecil stated that he aimed to put the player under pressure. While he still stood behind this principle, he thought the action elements were not <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>approach.</b> The Sleeping Dragon was also criticised for using a high number of crate puzzles, resulting in Cecil reducing the number of them.

40|$|The {{abortion}} debate, {{as presented}} by the prolife and prochoice perspectives, should end, as it leads neither to solution nor to compromise. Rather, we need to reconsider how to understand the moral issues involved in this controversy for they touch on how we understand ourselves as a people, how we understand women’s experience of pregnancy, and how such understanding affects what is considered important {{to us as a}} community. We need {{to move away from the}} “rights ” perspective (from both fetal and maternal rights) in order to open other possibilities of understanding this issue. Ipropose that a more informed under standing of the nature of pregnancy itself can give a way to revisit this difficult and seemingly intractable moral controver sy and begin a more fruitful dialogue. The Inadequacy of <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Approach</b> for Abortion First, I suggest that, although there are certain appeals, <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>approach</b> has a number of limitations. <b>The</b> <b>rights</b> ap proach takes a relatively simplistic, linear view of pregnancy, with the view of fetus and woman as distinct beings. It argues for personhood of the fetus in the prolife camp and right of privacy and against the obligation of women to use their bodies to support fetal life in the prochoice camp (Meilaender, 1989). <b>The</b> <b>rights</b> <b>approach</b> is simplistic in that it ignores the com plexity of the woman-fetus relationship and supports the belief that taking sides for either the woman or the fetus will solve the problem. Second, the notion that an unwanted pregnancy is a problem to be solved is also questionable. Undergirding the problem solving approach is a technological attitude, an attitude that values diagnosis of specific causes in order to provide intervention which may alter or correct the problem. Such an approach is appropriate and necessary for problems that are technical in nature (Braine & Lesser, 1988). The unwanted pregnancy, how ever, is not such a situation.

40|$|AbstractAn {{anomalous}} right {{coronary artery}} (RCA) {{with a high}} anterior take-off from ascending aorta is an uncommon and technically challenging vessel to cannulate. There {{are only a few}} reports in the literature describing this anomaly. Some of them consider it as a “very rare” or even “extremely rare” anomaly. Here we present a case of anomalous RCA arising from antero-left part of the ascending aorta, 3 cm above sinotubular junction. It was impossible to cannulate the anomalous vessel from the femoral approach by two experienced operators, despite using various catheters. The vessel could easily be engaged from <b>the</b> <b>right</b> radial <b>approach</b> at first attempt. We conclude that in patients with anomalous high RCA take-off from anterior or especially left-anterior part of the ascending aorta, we suggest to switch to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> radial <b>approach</b> and not to lose much time on the femoral one. <Learning objective: The aim of this case is to show superiority of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> radial <b>approach</b> in engaging anomalous RCA coming high from ascending aorta.
