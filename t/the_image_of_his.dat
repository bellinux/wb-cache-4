5|$|Andrew's sketch {{leads to}} the {{identification}} of the kidnapper as Joanne Ostler (Gillian Jacobs), a MIT neurologist who was previously believed deceased. Joanne tricks Ben into helping her complete an unfinished equation by using <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother, who died in the car accident. Meanwhile, Walter suddenly remembers that he heard about the lights from former mathematician Dashiell Kim (Randall Duk Kim), an old bunkmate at St. Claire's Hospital who disappeared under similar circumstances. To discover the child's whereabouts, Olivia encourages Walter to return to St. Claire's. The visit does not go well, and Walter is held by hospital administrator Dr. Bruce Sumner (William Sadler), who remains unconvinced of Walter's sanity.|$|E
5|$|The {{tolerance}} of violence within mainstream American {{culture is the}} central theme of the record, which takes a critical look at the roles gun culture, conservative American Christianity, and traditional family values play in the glorification of violence. A substantive portion of the album analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson's view that <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> crucifixion became the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against {{the credibility of the}} Bible's content, for the purpose of Holy Wood, he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he could relate. He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain by entities such as the Vatican.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 10th century {{no attempt}} was made to use a human to symbolize God the Father in Western art. Yet, Western art {{eventually}} required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for symbolizing the Father using a man gradually emerged around the 10th century AD. A rationale for the use of a human is the belief that God created the soul of Man in <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> own (thus allowing Human to transcend the other animals).|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale in Cairo {{announced}} he had uncovered new evidence the Great Sphinx {{may have been}} the work of the little-known Pharaoh Djedefre (2528–2520BC), Khafra's half brother and a son of Khufu. Dobrev suggests Djedefre built the Sphinx in <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god Ra in order to restore respect for their dynasty. Dobrev also notes, like Stadelmann and others, the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid to the temples was built around the Sphinx suggesting it was already in existence at the time.|$|E
25|$|Insurgent {{activity}} was in decline {{by the end}} of 1992, and Fujimori took credit for this abatment, claiming that his campaign had largely eliminated the insurgent threat. After the 1992 auto-coup, the intelligence work of the DINCOTE (National Counter-Terrorism Directorate) led to the capture of the leaders from MRTA and the Shining Path, including notorious Shining Path leader Abimael Guzmán. Guzmán's capture was a political coup for Fujimori, who used it to great effect in the press; in an interview with documentarian Ellen Perry, Fujimori even notes that he specially ordered Guzmán's prison jumpsuit to be white with black stripes, to enhance <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> capture in the media.|$|E

50|$|In a {{critical}} analysis of John's vision, April De Conick's 2006 essay outlines that the hayyot in Ezekiel are perhaps not original with the author of Revelation. De Conick suggests that John may have drawn from other merkabah-related texts and by subtly working with images already known to his audience, he reshaped them for his own purposes. With John blending and transforming <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sources, it {{has given way to}} different interpretations.|$|R

The presiding deity, Varadharajaperumal is housed in the santum in standing posture, facing east. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> consort, Sreedevi (also called Thirumaamagal Nachiyar) and Bhoodevi are housed in the same shrine.|$|R
25|$|Groza {{continued}} to improve <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own government while strengthening {{the position of}} the Communist Party with a series of political reforms. He proceeded to eliminate any antagonistic elements in the government bureaucracy and, in the newly acquired Transylvanian territory, removed three city prefects, including that of the region's capital, Cluj. The prefects removed were immediately replaced by government officials directly appointed by Groza, so as to strengthen loyalist elements in local government in the region. Groza also promised a series of land reform programs to benefit military personnel which would confiscate and subsequently redistribute all properties in excess of one hundred and twenty five acres in addition to all the property of traitors, absentees, and all who collaborated with the wartime Romanian government, the Hungarian occupiers during Miklós Horthy and Ferenc Szálasi's régimes, and Nazi Germany.|$|E
500|$|After the underwhelming {{election}} results, Quisling's {{attitude to}} negotiation and compromise hardened. A final attempt {{to form a}} coalition of the right in March 1934 came to nothing, and from late 1933, Quisling's Nasjonal Samling began to carve out its own form of national socialism. With no leader in Parliament, however, the party struggled to introduce the constitutional reform bill needed to achieve its lofty ambitions. When Quisling tried to introduce the bill directly, it was swiftly rejected, and the party went into decline. In the summer of 1935, headlines quoted Quisling telling opponents that [...] "heads [...] roll" [...] {{as soon as he}} achieved power. The threat irreparably damaged <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> party, and over the following few months several high-ranking members resigned, including Kai Fjell and Quisling's brother Jørgen.|$|E
500|$|Albert Victor's posthumous {{reputation}} {{became so}} bad that in 1964 Philip Magnus called his death a [...] "merciful act of providence", supporting the theory that his death removed an unsuitable {{heir to the throne}} and replaced him with the reliable and sober George V. In 1972, Michael Harrison was the first modern author to re-assess Albert Victor and portray him in a more sympathetic light. In recent years, Andrew Cook has continued attempts to rehabilitate Albert Victor's reputation, arguing that his lack of academic progress was partly due to the incompetence of his tutor, Dalton; that he was a warm and charming man; that there is no tangible evidence that he was homosexual or bisexual; that he held liberal views, particularly on Irish Home Rule; and that his reputation was diminished by biographers eager to improve <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother, George.|$|E

Although the actor said his behavior resulted from his frustration over being unable to remember where he had parked <b>his</b> car, <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> erratic appearance and behavior were published by the media; Falk was seldom seen in public after the incident.|$|R

500|$|Arthur Murphy {{anonymously}} {{wrote in}} the Monthly Review: [...] "Sir John most probably acquired his notions of language at his master's desk: he admired the phraseology of deeds and parchments, whereof, to speak in his own manner, he read so much, that in consequence thereof, he has been chiefly conversant therein and by {{the help of the}} parchments aforesaid, missed the elegance above mentioned, and uses works, that in them we sometimes meet with, and being bred and attorney, he caught the language of the said trade, whereof he retains so much, that he is now rendered an incompetent critic thereby, and in consequence thereof." [...] Steevens, under the name [...] "Philo Johnson" [...] claimed in the European Magazine: [...] "the great solid principle that secures its condemnation, is the spirit of malevolence to the dead, which breathes all through it. Sir John Hawkins, with all the humanity and very little of the dexterity of a Clare-Market butcher, has raised his blunt axe to deface <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friend." ...|$|E
500|$|Endubis, {{the first}} known Aksumite king to mint coins, focused almost entirely on his image on both the obverse and reverse. The images were {{of his head and}} upper half of his chest in profile, wearing a regnal {{headcloth}} or helmet and abundant jewelry. [...] In addition to inscribing his regnal name, Endybis also noted his [...] "bisi name, a practice continued by his early successors, but often missing in later coins. The bisi name was a sort of tribal affiliation or [...] "ethnikon" [...] (i.e. a reference to the king's lineage) that was different for every king. Endybis also emphasized his religion through the pre-Christian symbol of the disk and crescent as a propaganda method (a purpose which the coins already served). A second motif used by Enybis and continued by following coins was that of two (though sometimes one in later years) ears of barley or wheat around <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head in profile. Though no inscriptional evidence exists, given its prominent position around the image of the king, the two ears of barley (or wheat) may have been representative symbols of the Aksumite state. Though later coins would be smaller, Endybis chose the Roman aureus to standardize Aksumite coin weights against, with gold issues at half-aureus around 2.70grams (more precisely, the theoretical weight may have been 2.725g).|$|E
500|$|American {{musician}} Shawn Colvin guest {{starred in}} the episode as Rachel Jordan, a character that she would later return to voice in the episode [...] "I'm Goin' to Praiseland" [...] (2001) from season twelve. In that episode, she stays at the Flanders' house with Ned, and leaves briefly after he attempted to mold her in <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> deceased wife. At {{the end of the}} episode, however, she returns and has a date with him. Colvin told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that being raised in Carbondale, Illinois meant she did not have to do much research for the guest appearance: [...] "It's just very isolated [...] There was church music and that was about it. [...] I didn't have to dig too deep for the role. I suppose the whole 'Simpsons' thing is kind of like a hick town." [...] Colvin has shown a segment of her guest role on The Simpsons during some of her concerts, including one at Cape Cod Melody Tent in 2007. She has also performed the song that she sings in [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" [...] in concert. The Wisconsin State Journal reported that during her 2001 concert at Barrymore Theatre, the [...] "loudest audience response came after she sang a ditty that she performed as a character on The Simpsons."

Nixon knew Democrats {{could not afford to}} oppose his renunciation of BW programs in light of rising opposition to the use of non-lethal chemicals in Vietnam and other events such as the Skull Valley sheep kill in Utah. Thus, the idealistic language Nixon used in his November statement was only part of the story. Besides the issue of proliferation raised by Meselson, the specter of growing dissent over Vietnam loomed large, as did the fact that the U.S. had never ratified the Geneva Protocol. In the end, Nixon was motivated to ban biological weapons in the United States by a host of issues.|$|E
2500|$|To raise <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new capital, Constantine and his successors, {{especially}} Theodosius the Great, brought {{works of}} art {{from all over the}} empire to adorn it. The monuments were set {{up in the middle of}} the Hippodrome, the spina. Among these was the Tripod of Plataea, now known as the Serpent Column, cast to celebrate the victory of the Greeks over the Persians during the Persian Wars in the 5th century BC. Constantine ordered the Tripod to be moved from the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, and set in middle of the Hippodrome. The top was adorned with a golden bowl supported by three serpent heads, although it appears that this was never brought to Constantinople. The serpent heads and top third of the column were destroyed in 1700. Parts of the heads were recovered and are displayed at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. All that remains of the Delphi Tripod today is the base, known as the [...] "Serpentine Column".|$|E
2500|$|The most {{remarkable}} finding was {{the corpse of}} George Leigh Mallory at a height of [...] The lack of extreme injuries indicated he had not tumbled very far. His waist showed severe rope-jerk mottling, showing the two had been roped when they fell. Mallory's injuries were such that a walking descent was impossible: his right foot was nearly broken off {{and there was a}} golf ball-sized puncture wound in his forehead. Even though his unbroken leg was on top of the broken one, as if to protect it, Mass. General Hospital neurosurgeon Dr. Elliot Schwamm believes it not possible that he would have been conscious after the forehead injury. There was no oxygen equipment near the body, but the oxygen bottles would have been empty by that time and discarded at a higher altitude to relinquish the heavy load. Mallory was not wearing snow goggles, although a pair was stored in his vest, which may indicate that he was on the way back by night. However, a contemporary photograph shows he had two sets of goggles when he started his summit climb. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife Ruth which he intended to put on the summit was not in his vest. He carried the picture throughout the whole expedition—a sign that he might have reached the top. Since his Kodak pocket camera was not found, there is no proof of a successful climb to the summit.|$|E
