5|$|The Jean and Johnnie {{dance was}} an {{important}} part of Barbadian culture until it was banned in the 19th century. This was a popular fertility dance performed outdoors at plantation fairs and other festivals, and was functional in that it allowed women <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> to men, and more rarely, vice versa. The dance was eventually banned because the dance was associated with non-Christian African traditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodywork}} for {{the concept}} car displayed in 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal, a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low-volume, niche models for various manufacturers, including Bentley.

The concept also featured electrically operated scissor doors and a transparent engine cover <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> the V12 engine.|$|E
50|$|He is not averse, however, <b>to</b> <b>showing</b> <b>off</b> {{his voice}} by prolonging top notes or embellishing the written score with a liberality that might {{surprise}} 21st-century listeners who are imbued {{with the modern}} notion that a composer's work is sacrosanct. For some inexplicable reason he eschews on disc {{one of the key}} vocal ornaments at the disposal of all thoroughly schooled 19th-century bel canto singers: the trill.|$|R

5|$|The kulintang {{is played}} by {{striking}} the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. When playing the kulintang, the Maguindanao and Maranao would always sit on chairs while for the Tausug/Suluk and other groups that who play the kulintangan, they would commonly sit on the floor. Modern techniques include twirling the beaters, juggling them in midair, changing {{the arrangement of the}} gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding very rapid fire strokes all in an effort <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> a player's grace and virtuosity.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} negotiations, {{there was still}} no {{resolution}} within the Kennedy Administration of the question of whether to pursue a comprehensive or partial ban. In an effort to achieve the former, Britain proposed reducing the number of mandated inspections to allay Soviet concerns, but Harriman believed such a reduction would have to be paired with other concessions that Khrushchev would be able <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> within the Soviet Union and to China. Withdrawing PGM-19 Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey would have been an option, had they not already been removed {{in the wake of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he would be willing to make concessions on the Berlin question.|$|E

5|$|In 1702, King William III died, and Anne became Queen. Anne {{immediately}} offered John Churchill a dukedom, which Sarah initially refused. Sarah {{was concerned}} that a dukedom would strain the family's finances; a ducal family {{at the time was}} expected <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> its rank through lavish entertainments. Anne countered by offering the Marlboroughs a pension of £5000 a year, for life, from Parliament, as well as an extra £2000 a year from the Privy Purse, and they accepted the Dukedom. Sarah was promptly created Mistress of the Robes (the highest office in the royal court that could be held by a woman), Groom of the Stole, Keeper of the Privy Purse, and Ranger of Windsor Great Park. The Duke accepted the Order of the Garter, as well as the office of Captain-General of the army.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{visitors}} typically {{enter the}} house from the High Street to the south, passing through the gatehouse, across the lower courtyard into the hall of the main building. Plas Mawr's gatehouse was only the third such entrance building {{to be built in}} North Wales, despite gatehouses being an important part of English Elizabethan architecture, designed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> the house and provide a suitably dignified entry for visitors. Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's. Originally, the gatehouse would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn.|$|E

5|$|The Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex {{was built}} in 1909, inaugurating {{a new era in}} history. Most Indiana cities within 200 miles of Detroit became part of the giant {{automobile}} industry after 1910. The Indianapolis speedway was a venue for auto companies <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> their products. The Indianapolis 500 quickly became the standard in auto racing as European and American companies competed to build the fastest automobile and win at the track. Industrial and technological industries thrived during this era, George Kingston developed an early carburetor in 1902; in 1912, Elwood Haynes received a patent for stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|The {{dress code}} of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technological demo designed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> the graphical {{capabilities of the}} GameCube. The full motion video footage had scenes seen in later trailers and commercials for the game, but were never used in the final release. This footage includes Luigi running from an unknown ghost in the Foyer, ghosts playing cards in the Parlor, ghosts circling around Luigi, and Luigi standing outside the mansion with lighting flashing. Soon after its creation, Nintendo {{decided to make the}} demo into a full-fledged video game. A year later, Luigi's Mansion was later shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the GameCube console. A newer version of the game, more closely related to the final version, was later revealed at Nintendo Space World 2001.|$|E

5|$|The race {{itself was}} much like its Greek counterpart, {{although}} there were usually 24 races every day that, during the fourth century, took place on 66 days each year. However, a race consisted of only 7 laps (and later 5 laps, so {{that there could be}} even more races per day), instead of the 12 laps of the Greek race. The Roman style was also more money-oriented; racers were professionals and there was widespread betting among spectators. There were four-horse chariots (quadrigae) and two-horse chariots (bigae), but the four-horse races were more important. In rare cases, if a driver wanted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> his skill, he could use up to 10 horses, although this was extremely impractical.|$|E
5|$|Top Hat began filming on April 1, 1935 {{and cost}} $620,000 to make. Shooting ended in June {{and the first}} public previews were held in July. These led to cuts of {{approximately}} ten minutes, mainly in the last portion of the film: the carnival sequence and the gondola parade which had been filmed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> the huge set were heavily cut. A further four minutes were cut before its premiere at the Radio City Music Hall, where it broke all records, went on to gross $3 million on its initial release, and became RKO's most profitable film of the 1930s. After Mutiny on the Bounty, it made more money than any other film released in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in February 2008, US forces began {{returning}} {{political and}} military control of Anbar Province to Iraqis. On 14 February, 1st Battalion 7th Marines withdrew from Hīt. Two days later, American and Iraqi forces conducted a joint heliborne operation meant <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> the Iraqi security forces. More significantly, in late March, both Iraqi Army divisions in Anbar Province, the 1st and 7th Divisions, were sent south {{to participate in the}} Battle of Basra. Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to the Iraqi Army. On 26 March 2008, B Squadron of the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours, after trying to call him out and receiving no response they stormed the house, they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight. With Helicopter support, they pressed on and the SAS chased their targets into another house who used civilians as hostages who were then accidentally killed beside the terrorists, One SAS operator was killed.|$|E
