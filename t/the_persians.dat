5|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the battlefield the Athenians had triumphed in a tough battle against the Thebans. The other Greeks fighting for <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> had deliberately fought badly, according to Herodotus. The Thebans retreated from the battle, but in a different direction from <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> allowing them to escape without further losses. The Greeks, reinforced by the contingents who had not taken part in the main battle, then stormed the Persian camp. Although <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> initially defended the wall vigorously, it was eventually breached; <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> packed tightly together in the camp, were slaughtered by the Greeks. Of <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> who had retreated to the camp, scarcely 3,000 were left alive.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> had {{the sympathy}} of several Greek city-states, {{including}} Argos, which had pledged to defect when <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> reached their borders. The Aleuadae family, who ruled Larissa in Thessaly, saw the invasion {{as an opportunity}} to extend their power. Thebes, though not explicitly 'Medising', was suspected of being willing to aid <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> once the invasion force arrived.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> landed their army {{at three}} {{separate}} locations, disembarked, and made straight for Eretria. <b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> then began besieging the city. Rather than passively besieging the city, <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> {{seem to have}} vigorously attacked the walls. Herodotus reports that the fighting was fierce and both sides suffered heavy losses. However, after six days of fighting, two eminent Eretrians, Euphorbus and Philagrus, opened the gates for <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b> Once inside the city, <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> plundered the city, burning the temples and sanctuaries in revenge for the burning of Sardis. Those citizens who were captured were enslaved, as Darius had ordered.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> {{preferred}} a {{battle in the}} open sea, where they could better utilize their superior seamanship and numbers. For the Greeks, the only realistic hope of a decisive victory was to draw <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> into a constricted area, where their numbers would count for little. The battle at Artemisium had seen attempts to negate the Persian advantage in numbers, but ultimately the Allies may have realised that they needed an even more constricted channel in order to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b> Therefore, by rowing into the Straits of Salamis to attack the Greeks, <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> were playing into the Allies' hands. It seems probable that <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> would not have attempted this unless <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> were confident {{of the collapse of}} the Allied navy, and thus Themistocles's subterfuge appears to have {{played a key role in}} tipping the balance in the favor of the Greeks. Salamis was, for <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> an unnecessary battle and a strategic mistake.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{then moved}} {{north along the}} Ionian coast towards Samos, before {{abruptly}} turning west into the Aegean Sea. The fleet sailed next to Naxos, in order to punish the Naxians for their resistance to the failed expedition that <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> had mounted there a decade earlier. Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains; those that <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> caught were enslaved. <b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> then burnt the city and temples of the Naxians.|$|E

5|$|The second {{theory is}} simply that the battle {{occurred}} because <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> finally moved to attack the Athenians. Although this theory has <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> moving to the strategic offensive, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> by assuming that, seeing <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> advancing, the Athenians took the tactical offensive, and attacked them. Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply {{that there was some}} kind of Persian activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the battle. It is also possible that both theories are correct: when <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> sent the cavalry by ship to attack Athens, they simultaneously sent their infantry to attack at Marathon, triggering the Greek counterattack.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} sailed on to Euboea, {{and to the}} first major target, Eretria.

The Eretrians made no attempt to stop <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged.

5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> proved largely {{successful}} {{during the}} first stage of the war from 602 to 622, conquering much of the Levant, Egypt, several islands in the Aegean Sea and parts of Anatolia, the ascendancy of emperor Heraclius in 610 led, despite initial setbacks, to a Status quo ante bellum. Heraclius' campaigns in Persian lands from 622 to 626 forced <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> onto the defensive, allowing his forces to regain momentum. Allied with the Avars and Slavs, <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> made a final attempt to take Constantinople in 626, but were defeated there.

5|$|After {{staying at}} Eretria {{for a few}} days, <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> made {{their way down the}} coast towards Attica. <b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> dropped the {{captured}} Eretrians off on the island of Aegilia, before landing at the bay of Marathon in Attica. The Persians' next target was Athens. However, the Athenians had marched out from Athens to meet <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> and blocked the exits from the plains of Marathon. After several days of stalemate, the Athenians finally resolved to attack <b>the</b> <b>Persians,</b> winning a famous victory at the ensuing Battle of Marathon. After the battle, the remaining Persians fled to their ships, picked up the Eretrians from Aegilia, and then sailed back to Asia Minor, thereby ending the campaign, and the first Persian invasion of Greece.|$|E
5|$|After the engagement, the Allies {{received}} news of {{the defeat}} of the Allied army at Thermopylae. Since their strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, and given their losses, the Allies decided to withdraw to Salamis. <b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> overran Boeotia and captured the now-evacuated Athens. However, seeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet, <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> were later defeated at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC. Fearing being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia, leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece. The following year, however, saw an Allied army decisively defeat <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> at the Battle of Plataea, thereby ending the Persian invasion.|$|E

5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{year of the}} revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The {{available}} land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, and the Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. <b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its centre. The Ionians sought to defend Miletus by sea, leaving the defense of Miletus to the Milesians. The Ionian fleet gathered at the island of Lade, {{off the coast of}} Miletus. <b>The</b> <b>Persians</b> were uncertain of victory at Lade, so attempted to persuade some of the Ionian contingents to defect. Although this was unsuccessful at first, when <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> finally attacked the Ionians, the Samian contingent accepted the Persian offer. As the Persian and Ionian fleets met, the Samians sailed away from the battle, causing the collapse of the Ionian battle line.

5|$|In 610, {{during the}} Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, Heraclius became the emperor of the Byzantine Empire, after overthrowing Phocas. Meanwhile, the Sasanian Empire conquered Mesopotamia and in 611 they overran Syria and entered Anatolia, occupying Caesarea Mazaca (now Kayseri, Turkey). Heraclius, in 612, managed to expel <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> from Anatolia, but was decisively {{defeated}} in 613 when {{he launched a}} major offensive in Syria against <b>the</b> <b>Persians.</b> Over the following decade <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> were able to conquer Palestine and Egypt. Meanwhile, Heraclius prepared for a counterattack and rebuilt his army. Nine years later in 622, Heraclius finally launched his offensive. After his overwhelming victories over <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> and their allies in the Caucasus and Armenia, Heraclius, in 627, launched a winter offensive against <b>the</b> <b>Persians</b> in Mesopotamia, winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Nineveh thus threatening the Persian capital city of Ctesiphon. Discredited by these series of disasters, Khosrow II was overthrown and killed in a coup led by his son Kavadh II, who at once sued for peace, agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territories of the Byzantine Empire. Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem with a majestic ceremony in 629.|$|E
25|$|Besides <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> {{territorial}} {{and political}} ambitions in <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> Gulf, in <b>the</b> period 1888-1903 the British government was worried equally about French intrigues, and Russian and German naval and economic {{interests in the}} region.
