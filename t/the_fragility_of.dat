His morality is nuanced, weighing both sides of an issue. When leaving the confrontation with Baxter, he questions his use of his medical knowledge, {{even though it was}} in self-defense, and with genuine Hippocratic feeling. While shopping for his fish supper, he cites scientific research that shows greater consciousness in fish, and wonders whether he should stop eating them. As a sign of his rationalism, he appreciates the brutality of Saddam Hussein's rule as described by the Iraqi professor whom Perowne treated, at the same time taking seriously his children's concerns about the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints and}} {{drawings}} department encompasses works on paper. The {{origins of the}} collection were the 8,600works in the Royal Collection (Cabinet du Roi), which were increased via state appropriation, purchases such as the 1,200works from Fillipo Baldinucci's collection in 1806, and donations. The department opened on 5 August 1797, with 415pieces displayed in the Galerie d'Apollon. The collection is organized into three sections: the core Cabinet du Roi, 14,000royal copper printing-plates, and the donations of Edmond de Rothschild, which include 40,000prints, 3,000drawings, and 5,000illustrated books. The holdings are displayed in the Pavillon de Flore; due to <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> the paper medium, only a portion are displayed at one time.|$|E

40|$|Osmotic {{fragility}} and erythrocyte dimensions {{were measured}} in 40 normal males {{between the ages}} of 18 and 78 years. The principal independent variables correlating with osmotic fragility were mean cell haemoglobin concentration and the age of the donor.

Following the ousting of President Ngô Đình Diệm in 1963, South Vietnam's top army generals {{continued}} to vie with each other for control of the country’s military-dominated government instead of combating the emerging forces of the National Liberation Front, also known as the Viet Cong. <b>The</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> the South Vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield, where its military experienced great setbacks against the Viet Cong. Taking advantage of Saigon's political instability, Communist leaders in Hanoi began preparing for war. Even though key members of North Vietnam's Politburo disagreed on the best strategy to reunite their country, they ultimately went ahead to prepare for armed struggle against South Vietnam and their American supporters.|$|E

Despite this tragedy, Syaoran manages to become friends with other characters across his journey. Furthermore, Sakura once again develops feelings for Syaoran who {{at the same time}} starts falling for her again. The development of the characters' relationship demonstrates how while modern society depends on already existing one, a severed one can be reformed if people have the will. At the same time, Syaoran has to say goodbye to the people he met as a result of having to continue travelling. Despite also losing these new founds friends, these actions will help Syaoran grow into a young man.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Congress of London's {{verdict in}} 1830, the Dutch {{continued}} to resist Belgian independence {{for much of}} Leopold I's early reign. On 2 August 1831, days after Leopold's coronation, the Dutch launched an invasion known as the Ten Days' Campaign. The 50,000-strong Dutch force crossed the border and rapidly pushed the small Belgian army {{back as far as}} Leuven. Faced with a military disaster, the Belgian government appealed to the French for support. Without international support of their own and faced with an entire French army under General Étienne Gérard, the Dutch withdrew on 12 August. In 1832 the French pushed the Dutch out of Antwerp, their final garrison in Belgium. Much of the city was destroyed in the fighting. Sporadic skirmishes along the border continued until 1839, when the Dutch signed the Treaty of London. The Ten Days' Campaign revealed <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> the Belgian position, and although the Dutch finally recognized the independence of Belgium, the Belgians were forced to give up some disputed territories, including Zeelandic Flanders and the Duchy of Limburg. Part of Luxembourg, equivalent to the modern state, remained as a semi-independent protectorate of the Dutch until 1890.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{evaluation}} of the seismic vulnerability of a high-voltage vertical disconnect switch, {{one of the most}} vulnerable elements of electric substations. The main objective of the research is to evaluate <b>the</b> seismic <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apparatus using a new effective method. By combining standard reliability methods for time-invariant problems with the response surface technique, this original procedure called ‘‘EFA’’ (Effective <b>Fragility</b> Analysis) permits <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>fragility</b> curves using a very limited number of numerical simulations. On the basis of experimental tests, to determine the mechanical characteristics of the disconnect switch components (ceramic, joints, etc.) <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> curves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equipment analyzed are carried out.

40|$|A liquid {{storage tank}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} structures in industrial complexes dealing with chemicals, and its structural damage due to an earthquake may cause a disastrous event such as the leakage of hazardous materials, fire, and explosion. It is thus essential to assess <b>the</b> seismic <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> liquid storage tanks and prepare for seismic events in advance. When a liquid storage tank is oscillated by a seismic load, the hydrodynamic pressure caused by the liquid-structure interaction increases the stress and causes structural damage to the tank. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> seismic <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure can be estimated by considering the various sources of uncertainty and calculating the failure probabilities in a given limiting state. To accurately evaluate <b>the</b> seismic <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> liquid storage tanks, a sophisticated finite element analysis is required during their reliability analysis. Therefore, in this study, FERUM-ABAQUS, a recently-developed computational platform integrated with commercial finite element and reliability analysis software packages, is introduced to perform the finite element reliability analysis and calculate the failure probability of a liquid storage tank subjected to a seismic load. FERUM-ABAUS allows for automatic data exchange between these two software packages and for <b>the</b> efficient seismic <b>fragility</b> assessment <b>of</b> a structure. Using this computational platform, <b>the</b> seismic <b>fragility</b> curve <b>of</b> a liquid storage tank is successfully obtained. clos...|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Peloponnesian War, the militaristic city-state of Sparta had been able to impose a hegemony over the heartland of Classical Greece (the Peloponessus and mainland Greece south of Thessaly), the states of this area having been severely weakened by the war. This state of affairs was resented by many of the Greek city-states, which had traditionally been ferociously independent, and led directly to the Corinthian War of 395–387 BC. Sparta emerged from this conflict with its hegemony intact, though only as a result of Persian intervention, which led to the so-called King's Peace. <b>The</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> Spartan dominance had been demonstrated however, and in the next decade, the Thebans would revolt against Sparta. The Spartans were unable to successfully quell the revolt, leading to de facto Theban independence. Then, after several years of desultory conflict, the Thebans finally met the Spartans in open battle at Leuctra (371 BC), and under the leadership of Epaminondas inflicted an unprecedented defeat on the Spartan army, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I in the process.|$|E
5|$|Toshack's {{performance}} in the First Test at Trent Bridge was a quiet one, taking a wicket in each innings. He was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 32 with Johnston, scoring 19runs, his best at Test level to date in just 18minutes. Toshack's best Test performance was his 5/40 in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's when Miller was unable to bowl after being injured, including the wickets of Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, captain Yardley and Alec Coxon. During this performance, he employed two short legs and a silly mid-off. He had a moderately successful Third Test, taking figures of 3/101 in the only Test that Australia did not win. His knee injury flared again in the Fourth Test after taking an ineffective 1/112 in the first innings, {{he was unable to}} bowl in the second innings of an Australian win. He made a recovery and it was hoped that {{he would be able to}} play in the Fifth Test, but he injured again himself in the lead-up match against Lancashire. He was taken to London for cartilage surgery, ending his tour and his Test career. An inept batsman with an average of 5.78 in first-class fixtures, Toshack managed a Test average of 51 on the 1948 tour after being out only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in an uninhibited tenth-wicket stand with Johnston. Due to <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> his knee, Toshack was used sparingly in the tour games, playing in only 11 of the 29 non-Test matches on the tour. Toshack totalled 50 wickets at the average of 21.12 for the tour.|$|E
