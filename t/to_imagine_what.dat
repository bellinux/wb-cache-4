I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and tried <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack to Nier {{is largely}} {{composed}} of melancholy acoustic pieces which heavily feature vocals by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer {{for the band}} freesscape, and had previously worked on video games such as Etrian Odyssey. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, where she tried <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the rooms}} {{on the first floor}} and many {{of the rooms}} {{on the second floor of}} Boldt Castle are {{furnished}} , but mostly with modern pieces. The basement is mostly unfinished, with a pool, bowling lanes, many compartments, and a long passage to the Power House. Most of the rooms from the second floor to the top floor have been left unfurnished, but there are exhibits in some of these rooms and hallways showing pictures and artifacts of the Thousand Islands region during the era in which the Boldts lived. These rooms are also left unfurnished to give the visitor an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> the castle looked like before modern improvement. At the edge of the island, a monument stone triumphal arch, originally intended by George Boldt to be the entrance way for boats, has been fully restored. The bridge connecting the two sides would have been raised and lowered as required.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> it is like to see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of {{what it is like to}} see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe {{promoting}} their film Stargate. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like Stargate {{if he did not}} believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> {{it would be like to}} wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, [...] "I think I have an idea for our next film." ...|$|E

But, in spite of the unforeseen [...] strains and stresses, the constitution has worked, on the whole, much as we thought it would.

30|$|In the {{sections}} that follow, we present multiple models {{of professional development}} of educators that we feel partially address our aspirational values. While there are other models, we attempted to present a spectrum of possibilities within connected and connectivist approaches here, ones that, to different extents, promote some degree of heutagogy and transformative learning, and ones that address equity to varying degrees and from different lenses. Models we share include some that are institutional versus ones that are mostly extra-institutional; models that are fully online versus ones that are hybrid, and models showing a range of learner agency, time flexibility, and equity emphasis. None of these models alone achieves all we aspire towards, but offers a starting point <b>to</b> <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> a future of educator development could be.|$|R

500|$|Women debtors were {{housed in}} rooms over the tap room. The {{rooms in the}} barracks (the men's rooms) were [...] square and [...] high, with a window, wooden floors and a fireplace. Each housed two or three prisoners, and as the rooms were too small for two beds, prisoners had to share. Apart from the bed, prisoners were {{expected}} to provide their own furniture. The anonymous witness complained in 1833: [...] "170persons have been confined at one time within these walls, making an average of more than four persons in each room—which are not ten feet square!!!

[...] By the time Freak Out! was edited and shaped into an album, Wilson had spent $25–35,000 of MGM's money. In Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that [...] "Wilson was sticking his neck out. He laid his job on the line by producing the album. MGM felt that they had spent too much money on the album." ...|$|E
500|$|Based on the premiere, Merrill Barr of Forbes {{felt that}} the show [...] "has grown up a lot since its first year, and with the start of season three, it's hard <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> {{complaints}} any fans could possibly still have. If you want overall continuity, you got it. If you want people with super powers going crazy, it's there. If you want an ensemble cast that brings the broadcast television corner of the MCU to life, then look no further. The point is, with the new season of S.H.I.E.L.D., it's everything one could ask from the show." [...] Vulture's Scott Meslow stated that the premiere was [...] "riddled with [...] visual signifiers, highlighting the ways Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has gradually become sharper, sleeker, and more reliant on the bones of its comic-book source material." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{concept for}} Forever {{came from a}} {{conversation}} between series creator Matt Miller and his five-year-old son about death. After the conversation, Miller began <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> life {{would be like if}} a person was immortal but everyone else, including that person's own children, were mortals. [...] He created a character who viewed immortality as a curse because of the pain of seeing family and friends die and who would attempt {{to find a way to}} end his immortality. [...] That concept informed Miller's decision to make his character a doctor-turned-medical examiner who used his occupation for research into his immortality and Miller's decision to structure the series as a procedural. [...] The details about the character's immortality and his ability and his desire to end it would serve as the series' main story arc.|$|E
500|$|Miller is {{considered}} one of the founders of psycholinguistics, which links language and cognition in psychology, to analyze how people use and create language. His 1951 book Language and Communication {{is considered}} seminal in the field. His later book, The Science of Words (1991) also focused on language psychology. He published papers along with Noam Chomsky on the mathematics and computational aspects of language and its syntax, two new areas of study. Miller also researched how people understood words and sentences, the same problem faced by artificial speech-recognition technology. [...] The book Plans and the Structure of Behavior (1960), written with Eugene Galanter and Karl H. Pribram, explored how humans plan and act, trying to extrapolate this to how a robot could be programmed to plan and do things. Miller is also known for coining Miller's Law: [...] "In order to understand what another person is saying, you must assume it is true and try <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> it could be true of".|$|E
500|$|The Softwire is {{actually}} a story that Haarsma began imagining in his childhood. As a teenager, he worked at his parents' ceramic factory during the summers, hauling fifty pound molds around in the extreme heat of a kiln room. To Haarsma, it felt similar to what the children of his books might feel as slaves. In addition to these experiences, {{there is a more}} prominent influence on the premise of The Softwire—that is, there is a mystery of a journey to a new, unknown place to start a new life. Growing up, Haarsma dreamed of moving to the United States; and in his twenties, he actually did. While there, living in New York, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles, Haarsma [...] witnessed immigrants struggling to get by. He tried <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> caused them to risk everything, and to move to another country, and to have a chance at something better. It is this journey (and struggle) that is prevalent in The Softwire.|$|E

5000|$|Askew {{was educated}} at Eton and Christchurch, Oxford. [...] "It was {{difficult}} {{from his own}} vague allusions in latter years <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> in <b>what</b> orgy of extravagance this mild, scholarly person might have dissipated his youthful fortunes and become estranged from his family." [...] In 1896 he published Pros and Cons, a compilation of views {{on both sides of}} topical political controversies, which went through several editions. Becoming a socialist, he went to live in Germany, where he knew Friedrich Engels. Trotsky's life of Lenin mentions him as a London associate.|$|R
500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Katie Hasty from HitFix praised the choreography, calling it [...] "eye-popping", and labelled the video as [...] "classy, contained, and borderline claustrophobic". She complimented Farahmand for directing a risky concept and {{commented that the}} tracking shots were like [...] "an inhale and exhale with each new take". Furthermore, she felt that the video was representative of The xx's sound, calling it [...] "morose and hypnotic, just like the band, the aural equivalent of a mumblecore movie", and opined {{that the end of}} the video showed how [...] "love goes". Chris Ryan from MTV also found the video similar to the band's musical style, and commented that the slight changes in its pattern [...] "suggest unrest under the surface -- much like the band's pristine, subtly menacing sound". He also noted that while [...] "it's often hard <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> visuals would go well" [...] with The xx's songs, the music video for [...] "Islands" [...] "trumps anything we could have ever imagined".|$|E
500|$|The vocals {{and lyrics}} were {{provided}} by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer for the band freesscape, and had previously worked on video game projects such as the Etrian Odyssey arrange albums. The Monaca team had met her when considering her for a prior project, and Okabe {{wanted to work with}} her on Nier. She was approached {{a few months after the}} initial meeting in Autumn 2008 to be the vocalist for the soundtrack. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Scottish Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Scottish Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, and wrote [...] "Song of the Ancients" [...] in an entirely fictional language. She wrote that song by listening to songs in as many languages as possible and jumbling them up together. For the other languages, she tried <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.|$|E
500|$|When {{creating}} {{the character of}} Adam Jensen, DeMarle wanted {{to give him a}} well-defined personality, and this necessitated balancing it with the narrative's player-driven nature. One of the biggest challenges was {{creating the}} various dialogue choices, as she needed <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> a character would say if they were hostile when she might normally portray them as benign. Multiple layers of dialogue were created within these variances to create different atmospheres within the narrative. There was standard dialogue with minor characters, more complex dialogue with major characters in quests, and what DeMarle termed [...] "conversation boss fights", dialogue tied to the gameplay where social skill could help the player reach an objective. When creating characters, the team drew inspiration from the character portrayals in the Metal Gear series. When designing the corporate side, DeMarle particularly cited the backgrounds of Howard Hughes, Richard Branson and Bill Gates as inspiration for the powerful CEO figures in the narrative of Human Revolution. She also noted the way in which corporations had gained greater power than governments in the narrative, something that paralleled political comments on corporate power at the time.|$|E

5000|$|Emerald Budgies was {{described}} in the blurb as [...] "a darkly comic tale of drug addiction and betrayal". It {{was first published in}} England, in 2000, under the nom de plume Lee Maxwell (her middle names). She had wanted to throw off her previous public image but, on the promotional tour that followed, she said she felt like an imposter in a spy movie. [...] "I started thinking, maybe I don't want to be this new person, maybe it's not so bad being Karyn Hay." [...] Kate Camp described Emerald Budgies as ‘raw, thoughtful and very funny’. Chris Knox said it 'was not for the queasy... Imagine 1980s Doris Lessing crossed with Bret Easton Ellis and you’re some way <b>to</b> <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> this book reads like'. For Denis Welch it was, “A relentlessly bleak — if extremely funny — vision of modern life with no redemption whatsoever for anyone anywhere [...] [...] [...] There are times when Emerald Budgies makes Trainspotting look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.’ [...] Emerald Budgies won the NZSA Hubert Church Best First Book Award for Fiction in the 2001 Montana Book Awards. and Hay was awarded a Frank Sargeson Fellowship in 2004.|$|R

" Using examples from Freakonomics, I argue that some of the questions the book addresses are "uninteresting" because it is impossible <b>to</b> even <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> a good answer would look like.
