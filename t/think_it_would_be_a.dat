25|$|Finding the French escort to be {{substantially}} larger than anticipated, {{and that it}} was manoeuvring to intercept them, Forrest called his captains together for a conference aboard his ship. The three captains met on the quarterdeck of Augusta, whereupon Forrest stated 'Well, gentlemen, you see that they have come out to engage us.' Suckling replied 'I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pity to disappoint them', to which Langdon agreed. Forrest then closed the discussion by saying 'very well, go onboard your ships again', which Langdon and Suckling proceeded to do, the conference having lasted just half a minute.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the game, the Miller {{brothers}} eventually pursued other projects. Robyn Miller said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> detriment to always, {{for the rest of our}} lives, be creating Myst-like projects. [...] We're going to change, evolve and grow, just like any person does in any manner." [...] Robyn would leave Cyan to form a new development company called Land of Point; Vander Wende would also leave to pursue other projects. The next video game entry in the Myst franchise would be 2001's , which was not developed by Cyan nor published by Brøderbund. Presto Studios took over development; Ubisoft acquired Brøderbund's entertainment library from The Learning Company and published the Myst sequels.|$|E

500|$|Windsor's final episode on 10 September 2010 did not {{end with}} the usual EastEnders theme tune. Instead the {{occasionally}} used [...] "Julia's Theme", a piano version of the theme, was reworked specially for the broadcast, and given the name [...] "Peggy's Theme". The theme {{was created by the}} original theme tune composer, Simon May, who was reportedly thrilled to write the theme tune for Windsor. He added more piano to the theme and gave it a [...] "more melancholy feel". May composed the theme not knowing what would happen on screen, but when Kirkwood brought a rough edit of the episode, May noted that the music fitted perfectly first time, saying it was [...] "remarkable and very moving." [...] The theme features as the lead track on the album The Simon May Collection and was also released as an EP available to download immediately after the episode. He revealed: [...] "All the actors and crew had made a really special couple of shows. My main purpose was to bring something to the table, and I didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> single. [...] But when everybody heard the track they said 'you've got to release that as the single because it's something special'." ...|$|E
500|$|Before 20th Century Fox gave Alien vs. Predator the greenlight, Aliens writer/{{director}} James Cameron {{had been}} working on a story for a fifth Alien film. Alien director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lot of fun, {{but the most important thing}} is to get the story right." [...] In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's film Prometheus (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator, Cameron believed the film would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise" [...] and ceased work on his story, [...] "To me, that was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf. It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." [...] After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, Cameron remarked that [...] "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." [...] Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, [...] "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step." [...] Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to Aliens.|$|E

500|$|In February 2009, Lovato {{started to}} work and {{recorded}} on her second album, right after filming from the first season of Sonny with a Chance. In April 2009, Lovato explained about the album's process and collaborating with songwriters from the album including Jon McLaughlin and The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett. According to Lovato, the album's writing process was nearly finished in just two weeks, noting that she [...] "basically went from full time acting mode to full time album mode". As she wanted to accomplish more [...] "John Mayer-ish type of songs", she contacted Mayer's management in order to collaborate him, citing {{him as one of}} her biggest musical influences. Mayer accepted the offer, of which Lovato said, [...] "I was completely shocked [...] It was more of a pipe dream. I didn't ever <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reality, but it came true. He was taking a chance on working with a younger artist in the pop realm." [...] The two wrote three songs together, [...] "World of Chances", [...] "Love is the Answer" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Love Me". Lovato said that it was intimidating to work with him as she was worried that he would not like her lyrics, and she would get [...] "super excited" [...] whenever he complimented her. [...] "World of Chances", the first song she wrote with Mayer, was the only of these songs to make the album's final cut. The song was inspired by Lovato's first experience of love and heartbreak.|$|E
