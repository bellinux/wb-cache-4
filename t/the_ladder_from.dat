5|$|The third {{match was}} The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) in a Ladder {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. The goal is to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the title belts suspended above the ring. The Hardys had the advantage {{for most of the}} match, but as Jeff was climbing the ladder to try and grab the belts, Benjamin botched a springboard attempt. Benjamin kicked <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> underneath Jeff, however, to gain control. The Hardys regained the advantage by pushing the ladder as The World's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it, causing Benjamin to fall to the floor. Jeff Swanton bombed Haas as Matt climbed the ladder to get the belts and win.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high {{platform}} at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur {{to be closer to}} him. She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.|$|E

In 1974, he was ordained to the rank of preaching elder. Armstrong taught that the Bible endorsed [...] "ranks" [...] in the ministry, and elders could progress up <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> local elder to preaching elder to pastor to evangelist.

500|$|Barbara Gittings (July 31, 1932– February 18, 2007) was a {{prominent}} American activist for LGBT equality. She organized the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) from 1958 to 1963, edited the national DOB magazine <b>The</b> <b>Ladder</b> <b>from</b> 1963–66, and worked closely with Frank Kameny in the 1960s on the first picket lines that brought attention to the ban on employment of gay people by the largest employer in the US at that time: the United States government. Her early experiences with trying {{to learn more about}} lesbianism fueled her lifetime work with libraries. In the 1970s, Gittings was most involved in the American Library Association, especially its gay caucus, the first such in a professional organization, in order to promote positive literature about homosexuality in libraries. She {{was a part of the}} movement to get the American Psychiatric Association to drop homosexuality as a mental illness in 1972. Her self-described life mission was to tear away the [...] "shroud of invisibility" [...] related to homosexuality, which had theretofore been associated with crime and mental illness.|$|E
500|$|With {{much of the}} {{criticism}} placed on the club during his first year, the scrutiny turned to Watts {{during the next few}} seasons as it was deemed that he was not living up to his potential or the public's expectations. This was partly due to Watts displaying a lack of urgency and work-rate on the field according to former players Wayne Carey, Garry Lyon and coach Mick Malthouse. He played the early parts of his career in different positions, which Garry Lyon wrote led to an instability in his game and was a reason for why he, at times, lacked confidence and self-belief in his abilities. He was often very quickly scrutinised when he played poorly, and was the first to player to be blamed when the team played a bad match, which led to Paul Roos questioning why the public had such a fixation with Watts' form. He was also plagued with being known as the [...] "great white hope" [...] {{as soon as he was}} drafted and due to the club trailing near the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> 2009 to 2015 and experiencing failed rebuilds, Watts was symbolically seen as a poster boy for Melbourne's failures during this period.|$|E
2500|$|These {{variations}} among [...] "people of color" [...] reflect African-American {{society of the}} Upper South, but also invite the viewer to contemplate the mixed racial ancestry of those portrayed. Several elements hint at or symbolize relations to an unseen wealthier white father—the mulatto children, <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> the Negro quarters up to a larger house next door and, symbolically, the rooster high in the tree near the taller house and hen on the Negroes' house roof. Both proponents and detractors of slavery perceived this painting as supporting their world views, because the Negroes seem cheerful enough, but their house is dilapidated.|$|E

2500|$|The dual of a RC Cauer {{network is}} a LR Cauer network which is {{required}} for the Z' impedance as shown in the example. [...] Adjustment is a bit problematic with this equaliser. [...] In order to maintain the constant resistance, the pairs of components C1/L1', C2/L2' etc., must remain dual impedances as the component is adjusted, so both parts of the pair must be adjusted together. [...] With the Zobel Bode equaliser, this is a simple matter of ganging two pots together - a component configuration available off-the-shelf. [...] Ganging together a variable capacitor and inductor is not, however, a very practical solution. [...] These equalisers tend to be [...] "hand built", one solution being to select the capacitors on test and fit fixed values according to the measurements and then adjust the inductors until the required match is achieved. [...] The furthest element of <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> the driving point is equalising the lowest frequency of interest. [...] This is adjusted first as it will also have an effect on higher frequencies and from there progressively higher frequencies are adjusted working along the ladder towards the driving point.|$|E

60|$|Early in {{the morning}} she crept down <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> the loft; her father had looped his cot up against the cabin wall and gone out.

60|$|Well, then, what is rank, {{and what}} is conspicuousness? At once we think of kings and aristocracies, and of world-wide celebrities in soldierships, the arts, letters, etc., and we stop there. But that is a mistake. Rank holds its court and {{receives}} its homage on every round of <b>the</b> <b>ladder,</b> <b>from</b> the emperor down to the rat-catcher; and distinction, also, exists on every round of the ladder, and commands its due of deference and envy.|$|E
60|$|Here the {{explanation}} is really a very simple one. There is, in fact, {{only one way to}} amass a huge fortune in business or railway management. One must begin at the bottom. One must mount <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> the lowest rung. But this lowest rung is everything. Any man who can stand upon it with his foot well poised, his head erect, his arms braced and his eye directed upward, will inevitably mount to the top.|$|E

Many, including a lot of British Indian Army PoWs, jumped overboard. However, as {{it became clear that the}} ship would survive, many others stayed aboard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better come out, now," [...] he said, not ungently, [...] "and {{get into}} a safe place before folks begin to be about much. Or wait--I'll put the ladder up first." [...] He brought <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> the kitchen where he {{exchanged}} a fleeting joke with his wife, still at her work of clearing the breakfast things away, and set it against the wall under the trapdoor of the loft.

60|$|Shortly {{after they}} had settled {{themselves}} they heard something descending <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> above. They hoped that it would continue on down the well and fairly held their breath as the sound approached {{the door to the}} storeroom. Their hearts sank as they heard the door open and from between cracks in the vessels behind which they hid saw a yellow-slashed Wieroo enter the room. Each recognized him immediately, the girl indicating the fact of her own recognition by a sudden pressure of her fingers on Bradley's arm. It was the Wieroo of the yellow slashing whose abode was the place of the yellow door in which Bradley had first seen the girl.|$|E
60|$|A {{white man}} had ascended <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> the deck noiselessly, and had listened quietly to this short colloquy. Then {{he stepped out}} on the bridge {{and began to walk}} from end to end, holding up the long cherrywood stem of a pipe. His black hair lay {{plastered}} in long lanky wisps across the bald summit of his head; he had a furrowed brow, a yellow complexion, and a thick shapeless nose. A scanty growth of whisker did not conceal the contour of his jaw. His aspect was of brooding care; and sucking at a curved black mouthpiece, he presented such a heavy overhanging profile that even the Serang could not help reflecting sometimes upon the extreme unloveliness of some white men.|$|E

60|$|The {{bottom of}} the floor {{was covered with a}} fine dust, which had sifted down in the course of ages from the inside coating of the mound, but it was not deep enough to conceal a bar of gold, and, with his lantern and his foot, the captain made himself sure that not a piece was left. Then his whole soul and body thrilled with a wild purpose, and, moving <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> the centre of the floor, he stooped to brush away the dust. If there should be a movable stone there! If this stone should cover a smaller cavity beneath the great one, what might he not {{discover}} within it? His mind whirled before the ideas which now cast themselves at him, when suddenly he stood up and set his teeth hard together.|$|E
60|$|During this talk, Israel's curiosity had {{prompted}} him to dart up <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> the main-deck, and stand right in the gangway above, looking out on the strange craft. Meantime the order {{had been given to}} drop a boat. Thinking this a favorable chance, he stationed himself so that he should be the foremost to spring into the boat; though crowds of English sailors, eager as himself for the same opportunity to escape from foreign service, clung to the chains of the as yet imperfectly disciplined man-of-war. As the two men who had been lowered in the boat hooked her, when afloat, along to the gangway, Israel dropped like a comet into the stern-sheets, stumbled forward, and seized an oar. In a moment more, all the oarsmen were in their places, and with a few strokes the boat lay alongside the cutter.|$|E

Each of us has formed a mental picture of the Capronian seacoast from Bowen's manuscript, and it is not likely that any two of these pictures resemble each other, or that any of them resemble the coast as we shall presently find it. I have in view three plans for scaling the cliffs, and the means for carrying out each is in the hold. There is an electric drill with plenty of waterproof cable to reach from the ship's dynamos to the cliff-top when the Toreador is anchored at a safe distance from shore, and there is sufficient half-inch iron rod to build a ladder from the base to the top of the cliff. It would be a long, arduous and dangerous work to bore the holes and insert the rungs of <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>from</b> the bottom upward; yet it can be done.|$|E
