25|$|Trustee: A person (either an individual, a {{corporation}} {{or more than}} one of either) who administers a trust. A trustee is considered a fiduciary and owes the highest duty under the law to protect <b>trust</b> <b>assets</b> from unreasonable loss for the trust's beneficiaries.|$|E
25|$|In South Africa, in {{addition}} to the traditional living trusts and will trusts there is a ‘bewind trust’ (inherited from the Roman-Dutch bewind administered by a bewindhebber) in which the beneficiaries own the <b>trust</b> <b>assets</b> while the trustee administers the trust, although this is regarded by modern Dutch law as not actually a trust. Bewind trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantages.|$|E
25|$|Because under a {{discretionary}} trust, no one beneficiary {{could be}} said to have title to any <b>trust</b> <b>assets</b> prior to a distribution, this made discretionary trusts a powerful weapon for tax planners.

40|$|The {{concept of}} using legal {{structures}} to protect property {{from those who}} might otherwise have some claim to it is an idea with deep roots. The trust device is one such legal structure, and its evolution as an asset protection device has not been without controversy. The recent and noticeable break with the traditional denial of self-settled trust protections is one such area of modern controversy, but not the only notable recent development. The self-setted <b>asset</b> protection <b>trust</b> movement is accompanied by the recent completion of two major law reform projects. The drafting and recommendation for state adoption of a Uniform Trust Code is one such project. The Restatement (Third) of Trusts is the second. Taken together, these developments have recently affected and will undoubtedly continue to influence the evolution of <b>trust</b> <b>asset</b> protection. This article considers these developments and their potential impact on the future course of <b>trust</b> <b>asset</b> protection. Among the observations presented {{is the idea that}} the UTC holds a significant place in the development of <b>trust</b> <b>asset</b> protection - not so much because of the conclusions its drafters reached as to particular rules, but more because of the express invitation the UTC presents to state legislatures to ponder their own trust protections and corresponding placement in the modern asset protection community. Finally, this article provides insights into both the current and evolving status of <b>trust</b> <b>asset</b> protection by relating the noted reform projects to several trust protection developments seen in the last decade or so. That exploration proceeds from a recognition of interest group politics as related to the UTC movement. The discussion progresses to an evaluation of potential ideological influences on the future course of <b>trust</b> <b>asset</b> protections. Along the way, consideration is given to the federal influences on that course. Those influences are at least in part derived from the potential repeal of estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes, recent bankruptcy reform legislation, and the status of the federal/state Medicaid program. Among the observations presented is the idea that these ideological and federal concerns push in multiple directions, often {{at the same time and}} in a conflicting manner, with a very uncertain but potentially significant effect on the future evolution of <b>trust</b> <b>asset</b> protection...|$|R

25|$|The {{trustees}} {{administer the}} affairs attendant to the trust. The trust's affairs may include prudently investing {{the assets of}} the trust, accounting for and reporting periodically to the beneficiaries, filing required tax returns and other duties. In some cases dependent upon the trust instrument, the trustees must make discretionary decisions as to whether beneficiaries should receive <b>trust</b> <b>assets</b> for their benefit. A trustee may be held personally liable for problems, although fiduciary liability insurance similar to directors and officers liability insurance can be purchased. For example, a trustee could be liable if assets are not properly invested. In addition, a trustee may be liable to its beneficiaries even where the trust has made a profit but consent has not been given. UKHL 2] However, in the United States, similar to directors and officers, an exculpatory clause may minimize liability; although this was previously held to be against public policy, this position has changed.|$|E

2500|$|Asset protection: Trusts {{may allow}} {{beneficiaries}} to protect assets from creditors as the trust may be bankruptcy remote. For example, a discretionary trust, {{of which the}} settlor may be the protector and a beneficiary, but not the trustee and not the sole beneficiary. In such an arrangement the settlor {{may be in a}} position to benefit from the <b>trust</b> <b>assets,</b> without owning them, and therefore in theory protected from creditors. In addition, the trust may attempt to preserve anonymity with a completely unconnected name (e.g., [...] "The Teddy Bear Trust"). These strategies are ethically and legally controversial.|$|E
2500|$|When <b>trust</b> <b>assets</b> {{are mixed}} up with {{property}} of the trustee, or other people, the general approach of the courts is to resolve the issues in favour of the wronged beneficiary. For example, in Re Hallett's Estate, a solicitor sold £2145 worth of bonds he was meant to hold for his client and {{put the money in}} his account. Although money had subsequently been drawn and redeposited in the account, the balance of £3000 was enough to return all the money to his clients. According to Lord Jessel MR, a fiduciary [...] "cannot be heard to say that he took away the trust money when he had a right to take away his own money". Again, in Re Oatway, a trustee who took money and made a deposit with his bank account, and then bought shares which rose in value, was held by Joyce J to have used the beneficiary's money on the shares. This was the most beneficial result possible. When <b>trust</b> <b>assets</b> are {{mixed up with}} money from other beneficiaries, the courts have had more difficulty. Originally, by the rule in Clayton's case, it was said that the money taken out of a bank account would be presumed to come from the first person's money that was put in. So in that case it meant that when a banking partnership, before it went insolvent, made payments to one of its depositors, Mr Clayton, the payments made discharged the debt of the first partner that died. However, this [...] "first in, first out" [...] rule is essentially disapplied in all but the simplest cases. In Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Vaughan Woolf LJ held that it would not apply if it might be 'impracticable or result in injustice', or if it ran contrary to the parties intentions. There, Vaughan was one of a multitude of investors in Barlow Clowes' managed fund portfolios. Their investments had been numerous, of different sizes and over long periods of time, and each investor knew that they had bought into a collective investment scheme. Accordingly, when Barlow Clowes went insolvent, each investor was held to simply share the loss proportionately, or pari passu. A third alternative, said by Leggatt LJ to generally be fairer (though complex to compute) is to share losses through a [...] "rolling pari passu" [...] system. Given the complexity of the accounts, and the trading of each investor, this approach was not used in Vaughan, but it would have seen a proportionate reduction of all account holders' interest at each step of an account's depletion. A significant topic of debate, however, is whether the courts should allow tracing into an asset which has been bought on credit. The weight of authority suggests this is possible, either through subrogation, or on the justification that the assets of a recipient who pays off a debt on a thing are [...] "swollen". In Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Homan, however, the Court of Appeal held that pensioners of the crooked newspaper owner, Robert Maxwell, who had their money stolen, could not have a charge over the money in whose overdrawn accounts their money was deposited. It was said that when money was put into an overdrawn account, it was simply exhausted, and even if the money had been later used for the company's purposes, the law must end the tracing exercise. This result was doubted by the Privy Council in Brazil v Durant International Corporation, as Lord Toulson advised that backwards tracing is possible if there is [...] "a coordination between the depletion of the trust fund and the acquisition of the asset which is the subject of the tracing claim, looking at the whole transaction, such as to warrant the court attributing the value of the interest acquired to the misuse of the trust fund." ...|$|E

2500|$|The duty of {{care was}} codified in the Trustee Act 2000 section 1, as the [...] "care and skill that is reasonable" [...] to expect, {{regarding}} any special skills of the trustee. In practice this means that a trustee must be judged by what should be reasonably expected from another person in such a position of responsibility, being mindful not to judge decisions {{with the benefit of}} hindsight, and mindful of the inherent risk involved in any property management venture. As long ago as 1678, in Morley v Morley Lord Nottingham LC held that a trustee would not be liable if £40 of the trust fund's gold was robbed, so long as he otherwise performed his duties. Probably one of the main parts of the {{duty of care}}, in managing trust property, will relate to a trustee's investment choices. In Learoyd v Whiteley, Lindley LJ elaborated the general prudent person rule, that in investments one must 'take such care as an ordinary prudent man would take if he were minded to make an investment for the benefit of other people for whom he felt morally bound to provide'. This meant a trustee who invested £5000 in mortgages of a brick field and four houses with a shop, and lost the lot when the businesses went insolvent, was liable for the losses on the brick field, whose value must have known to be bound to depreciate as bricks were taken out. Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co Ltd suggests investments must be actively monitored, particularly by professional trustees. This duty was broken when the Barclays corporate trustee department, where <b>trust</b> <b>assets</b> held 99 per cent of a company's shares, failed to get any information or board representation before a disastrous property speculation. In making investments, TA 2000 section 4 requires that [...] "standard investment criteria" [...] must be observed, essentially along the lines of modern portfolio theory about diversification of investments to reduce risk. Section 5 suggests advice be sought on such matters if needed, but otherwise may invest anything that an ordinary property owner would. Additional restrictions, however, may be imposed depending on the how courts view the purpose of the trust, and the scope of a trustee's discretion.|$|E

5000|$|In 1900, {{and again}} in 1904, the Catholic Bureau applied to use <b>trust</b> <b>assets</b> from certain tribes to educate some of their {{children}} in Catholic schools.
