5|$|Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) {{decided to}} draft {{legislation}} {{to make the}} Hinomaru and Kimigayo official symbols of Japan in 2000. His Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, wanted the legislation {{to be completed by}} the 10th anniversary of Emperor Akihito's enthronement. This {{is not the first time}} legislation was considered for establishing both symbols as official. In 1974, with the backdrop of the 1972 return of Okinawa to Japan and the 1973 oil crisis, Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei hinted at a law being passed enshrining both symbols in the law of Japan. In addition to instructing <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>to</b> teach and play Kimigayo, Kakuei wanted students to raise the Hinomaru flag in a ceremony every morning, and to adopt a moral curriculum based on certain elements of the Imperial Rescript on Education pronounced by the Meiji Emperor in 1890. Kakuei was unsuccessful in passing the law through the Diet that year.|$|E

25|$|Public {{education}} in the Romanian language (officially called Moldovan language in Transnistria) is done using the Soviet-originated Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet. The usage of the Latin script was restricted to only 6 schools.

These schools were later registered as private schools and reopened. This process may have been accelerated by pressure from the European Union.|$|E
25|$|The {{contracts}} {{called for}} starting every month {{a new class}} of 100 students for three months of instruction. The schools would provide the instructors, classrooms, laboratories, dormitories, food services, and health and recreational facilities. Textbooks, classroom supplies, and an engineering slide rule (usually a K Log-Log Duplex Decitrig) were also supplied. (The slide rule in its holder strapped on the belt was a standard part of students’ uniform of the day.) The contracts required <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>to</b> provide all of this under a flat-rate per student-month.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2001 census, 77% of Crimean {{inhabitants}} named Russian {{as their}} native language; 11.4% – Crimean Tatar; and 10.1% – Ukrainian.

After that, Lombardi asked <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>to</b> avoid using Lambeau, however both Southwest High and West High played there until a west side high school stadium was built in the late 1970s. In 1973, the WISAA Championship game was played there, the last at Lambeau, between Wisconsin Rapids Assumption and Marquette University High School.

25|$|His speech, {{usually called}} Pro restaurandis (or instaurandis) scholis (For the {{restoration}} of the schools), was probably delivered in 297 CE or 298 CE in the forum at Augustodunum or Lugdunum (modern day Lyon before the governor of the province. The purpose was to ask the governor if Eumenius may dedicate his salary (or a large part of it) to rebuild the schools at Autun. He praises the emperors (Constantius Chlorus and his colleagues of the tetrarchy) and sets forth the steps necessary to restore <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>to</b> their former state of efficiency, stressing that he intends to assist the good work out of his own pocket. He cites the imperial letter of Constantius granting him his position and salary at length, and it is from the address of that letter that the name of the oration's author is preserved.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Kinsale in 1601 saw {{the defeat}} of Hugh O'Neill, despite his {{alliance}} with the Spanish, and the ultimate victory in the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland came with his surrender to crown authority in 1603. In consequence, the system of education and patronage that underpinned the professional bardic schools came under pressure, and the hereditary poets eventually engaged in a spat - the Contention of the bards - that {{marked the end of}} their ancient influence. During the early 17th century a new Gaelic poetry took root, one that sought inspiration in the margins of a dispossessed Irish-speaking society. The language of this poetry is today called Early Modern Irish. Although some 17th-century poets continued to enjoy a degree of patronage, many, if not most, of them were part-time writers who also worked on the land, as teachers, and anywhere that they could earn their keep. Their poetry also changed, with a move away from the syllabic verse of <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>to</b> accentual metres, reflecting the oral poetry of the bardic period. A good deal of the poetry of this period deals with political and historical themes that reflect the poets' sense of a world lost.|$|E

500|$|By 1964, {{international}} educators such as Alec Peterson (director of the Department of Education at Oxford University), Harlan Hanson (director of the College Board Advanced Placement Program), Desmond Cole (director of United Nations International School in New York) and Desmond Cole-Baker (head of the International School of Geneva) {{founded the}} International Schools Examination Syndicate (ISES). Cole and Hanson brought experience with college entrance examinations in the United States, and Hanson, in particular, brought his experience {{from a long}} relationship with the College Board. According to Peterson, [...] "the breakthrough {{in the history of}} the IB" [...] came in 1965 with a grant from the Twentieth Century Fund, which commissioned Martin Mayer, author of <b>The</b> <b>Schools,</b> <b>to</b> produce a report on the feasibility of establishing a common curriculum and examination for international schools that would be acceptable for entry to universities worldwide. This led to conferences involving Ecolint, United World College of the Atlantic (UWC Atlantic College), and others in the spring and fall of 1965, at which details about the curriculum for the Diploma Programme were discussed and agreed upon.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, {{the boys}} were {{evacuated}} to the seaside town of Cleveleys, Lancashire, where they shared accommodation with a primary school. Chetham's was damaged by an explosion in December 1940, {{when most of the}} windows were shattered and the roof set alight. The boys relocated to Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire, in 1943, although thirteen boys attending grammar school moved to Buxton College. By 1944 the governors believed {{that it would not be}} appropriate for the school to return to Manchester, and it was proposed the site become a religious education centre. However, after years of discussion, it was decided to return the school to Manchester. The Education Act 1944, which stipulated that schools should be classified as primary or secondary, complicated matters, since Chetham's went across the middle. [...] It was decided in 1950 that Chetham's should become a grammar school, and this change took place two years later. In 1950, Chetham's amalgamated with Nicholls' Hospital School, a similar school based in Ardwick which had been established in 1863. While it could take up to 100 boys, by the end of the war there were only 22 and it was considered beneficial for <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>to</b> merge.|$|E
