Parker's title character, who is {{supposed}} to be the modern day Romeo, was a Compton youth with both tenderness and toughness. Despite a troubled script, Parker's rap performance earned comparisons to Will Smith from Nathan Lee of The New York Times. In 2007, he had a small role in Pride, about an African American swim team. Parker was tasked with depicting the visual expectations of an athletic proficiency <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>new</b> to him but very familiar to the audience.|$|E

The order carried an estimated retail price of $3.7 billion, though the actual price Skybus would have paid had not been announced. Additionally, the aircraft were going to come with a 12-year maintenance agreement <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>new</b> for Airbus and Skybus was the launch customer for this service plan which helped them manage maintenance costs. Additionally, the aircraft would have been equipped with the latest in EFB (electronic flight bags) and HUD (heads up display) technology, as well as TCAS II terrain and traffic avoidance technology which is integrated in with an EGPWS technology box that protects from terrain collision. Skybus planned to lease aircraft of the same type until the new aircraft were to begin delivery in late 2008.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} part of the decade, sales were strong, thanks in no small part to the company's history of {{building}} small cars, which came into vogue in 1961. In both 1960 and 1961, Ramblers ranked in third place among domestic automobile sales, up from third on the strength of small-car sales, even in the face of a lot of new competition. Romney's strategic focus was very successful as reflected in the firm's healthy profits year after year. The company became completely debt-free. The financial success allowed the company to reach an agreement on August 26, 1961 with the United Auto Workers for a profit sharing plan <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>new</b> in the automobile industry. Its new three-year labor contract also included generous annual improvement pay increases, as well as automatic cost-of-living raises. However, in 1962, Romney resigned to run for Governor of Michigan. His replacement was Roy Abernethy, AMC's successful sales executive.|$|E

500|$|Evolve was {{inspired}} by hunting games Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter. Members of Turtle Rock Studios, including Robb and Ashton, thought that the gameplay of these hunting games, such as [...] animal-tracking, was seldom incorporated in an action game. As a result, {{they came up with}} the original concept of Evolve in which, if players failed at hunting the animals, they could be attacked by their targets. Instead of typical big game animals such as elephants and lions, the team imagined it to be a [...] "King Kong", which changed to an alien monster. The team picked a sci-fi setting, allowing them to add creative and unrealistic things into the game. The team also took the concept of boss battles, and expanded upon it by using the concept as a key idea when developing Evolve. The team envisioned Evolve as a video game version of Predator. The goal of Evolve was to create an experience <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>new</b> to video game players.|$|E

[...] Against the audience's expectation, Vala and Tomin are shown as a seemingly functioning normal couple, and Vala makes several efforts to save him despite his deep indoctrination. Throughout season 10, Vala has {{to come to terms}} with her maternal feelings for Adria (as adult played by Morena Baccarin), well knowing from the beginning that Adria embodies a destructive entity that must be fought. Black believed Vala had to [...] "try her best to connect with her daughter in the hope of finding ways to humanize her", despite her own lack of maturity.

500|$|Early in 1951, {{while on}} tour in Rome, Ferrier learned of her father's {{death at the}} age of 83. Although she was upset by this news, she decided to {{continue}} with the tour; her diary entry for 30 January reads: [...] "My Pappy died peacefully after flu and a slight stroke". She returned to London on 19 February, and was immediately busy rehearsing with Barbirolli and the Hallé a work <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>new</b> to her: Ernest Chausson's Poème de l'amour et de la mer. This was performed at Manchester on 28 February, to critical acclaim. Two weeks later Ferrier discovered a lump on her breast. She nevertheless fulfilled several engagements in Germany, the Netherlands and at Glyndebourne before seeing her doctor on 24 March. After tests at University College Hospital, cancer of the breast was diagnosed, and a mastectomy was performed on 10 April. All immediate engagements were cancelled; among these was a planned series of performances of The Rape of Lucretia by the English Opera Group, scheduled as part of the 1951 Festival of Britain.|$|E
500|$|... "Fourth of July", {{one of the}} album's slower ballads, {{was also}} written solely by Carey and Afanasieff but was not {{released}} as a single. The song was perceived to have jazz influences and was compared to some of Carey's older work such as [...] "Vanishing" [...] and [...] "The Wind". The next two tracks on the record, [...] "Breakdown" [...] and [...] "Babydoll", were described as [...] "the album's backbone, its real declaration of independence" [...] by Nickson. [...] "Breakdown" [...] was written by Carey and Puffy and included rap verses from Wish and Krayzie Bone from Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Author Chris Nickson wrote that [...] "'Breakdown' showed Mariah treading forcefully into territory <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>new</b> for her and making it her own." [...] For [...] "Babydoll", Carey teamed up with Elliott. The track was recorded in Atlanta, where Elliott resided, and included background vocals from Carey's long-time friend, Trey Lorenz. [...] "Babydoll" [...] was described as [...] "a vocally driven piece", with strong jazz harmony provided by Cory Rooney. Other songs that incorporated R influence into ballads were [...] "Whenever You Call" [...] and [...] "Close My Eyes", which were personally important to Carey due to their lyrical content.

It had been many, many years since I had written by myself so <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>new</b> and scary", Twain said. Twain found writing the music quite simple, as it only occupied two lines of sheet music. The lyrics then flowed as Why Not? with Shania Twain progressed.

The concept frightened her: [...] "Sharing that song with other people, exposing, and basically allowing myself to be vulnerable the and judged, it scared {{the heck out of}} me."

500|$|Caesar held {{both the}} Dictatorship and the Plebeian Tribunate, but alternated between the Consulship and the Proconsulship. His powers {{within the state}} seem to have rested upon these magistracies. The Dictatorship of Caesar was {{fundamentally}} different from the Dictatorship of the early and middle republic, as he held the office for life, rather than for six months, and he also held certain judicial powers which the ordinary Dictators had not held. In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers, which made his person sacrosanct, allowed him to veto the Roman Senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. Since Tribunes were always elected by the Plebeian Council, Caesar had hoped to prevent the election of Tribunes who might oppose him. In 46 BC, Caesar gave himself the title of [...] "Prefect of the Morals" [...] (praefectura morum), which was an office <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>new</b> only in name, as its powers were identical {{to those of the}} Censors. Thus, he could hold Censorial powers, while technically not subjecting himself to the same checks that the ordinary Censors were subject to, and he used these powers to fill the senate with his own partisans. He also set the precedent, which his imperial successors followed, of requiring the senate to bestow various titles and honors upon him. Coins bore his likeness, and he was given the right to speak first during senate meetings.|$|E
500|$|In September 2006 Pope Benedict XVI gave {{a speech}} on the {{question}} of the [...] "reasonableness" [...] of the Christian faith, to the University of Regensburg in Germany.

[...] The citation attracted severe criticism from Muslims around the world, including the parliament of Pakistan which condemned the Pope for his comments, and which sought an apology from him. [...] Following the speech, on 17 September Choudary led a protest outside Westminster Cathedral, where he told reporters [...] "Whoever insults the message of Mohammed is going to be subject to capital punishment." [...] The Daily Mail reported him as saying: [...] "I am here [...] have a peaceful demonstration, but there may be people in Italy and other parts that would carry that out." [...] The Metropolitan Police investigated his comments, but concluded that [...] "no substantive offences" [...] were committed during the demonstration. The Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, who had called for action to be taken against Choudary, said: [...] "It is quite disgraceful. It sends out a message to Muslim extremists that we, as a country, do not have the moral courage to stand up to them." ...|$|E
