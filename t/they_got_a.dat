5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} 2007, London {{suffered}} a foot injury {{and was unable to}} compete, and Kendrick was mainly used as a singles wrestler on Raw where he lost to the likes of Umaga and Mr. Kennedy. London made his return on February 4 in a loss to Santino Marella and Carlito. London and Kendrick returned as a tag team on the March 17 episode of Raw in a loss to Umaga when Kendrick walked out on London. The two reunited on Raw on March 31 with commentator Jim Ross explaining the two worked out their differences, and <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> win against the then-World Tag Team Champions, Cody Rhodes and Hardcore Holly. On April 14, they lost a number one contendership match to the team of Carlito and Marella. They competed sporadically on Raw in the following months, defeating Lance Cade and Trveor Murdoch, before receiving a World Tag Team title shot against Holly and Rhodes on the May 26 episode of Raw. They lost when Holly pinned London following an Alabama slam.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of castles {{in relation to}} high status features, such as fish ponds, was a statement of power and control of resources. Also often found near a castle, sometimes within its defences, was the parish church. This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, {{one of the most}} important institutions of medieval society. Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military could be used for display. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England– comprising a moat and several satellite ponds– forced anyone approaching a water castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway. Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer around the castle, ensuring <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.|$|E

25|$|Middlesbrough {{were drawn}} {{at home to}} non-league Barrow in the third-round of the FA Cup. Middlesbrough went into the game without a win in eight league games. They named a strong line-up while giving Josh Walker his first Boro start as he lined up in the centre of midfield. The game saw Middlesbrough {{dominate}} in chances, but poor finishing meant they only won 2–1, with both of the home side's goals coming from Afonso Alves – his first goals for over two months – and both assisted by Stewart Downing. Middlesbrough's failures in front of goal meant <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> late scare as Barrow pulled a goal back after more bad defending at a set piece, but they failed {{to take a chance}} to level the game late on. A sour moment of the game saw Jérémie Aliadière injured and ruled out for two months.|$|E

25|$|Del Martin {{has written}} that the Daughters of Bilitis was a feminist {{organization}} from the beginning, focusing {{on the problems of}} women as well as problems of the female homosexual; however, in the mid-1960s feminism became a much higher priority to many {{of the women in the}} organization. In 1966, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon joined the National Organization for Women, and urged readers of The Ladder to do the same, even reporting <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> family discount. The historian Martin Meeker points to the 1966 DOB convention that was a 10-day affair joining the DOB with the North American Conference of Homophile Organizations (NACHO) as the turning point where women's issues in the DOB began to have more importance to its members than gay issues. It was the largest convention DOB had yet organized, publicized in mass media all over San Francisco, attended by a large panel of nationally known speakers, and many of the presentations focused on topics that were exclusively male-centered.|$|E
25|$|A sequel {{was planned}} but was later cancelled. Zack Snyder {{stated that he}} would only be {{producing}} the sequel instead of reprising {{his role as the}} director due to working on Watchmen when he announced the film. The script of Army of the Dead was written by Zack Snyder and Joby Harold. Filming for Army of the Dead was to start once <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> director as the producing studios had approved the script. Also according to Deborah Snyder, the film was set in Las Vegas, and the town had to be contained to stop the outbreak of zombies. The film's producing studios were Universal Studios (who released the first) and Warner Bros. Entertainment (who released most of Snyder's films since 300) and the film was set to be directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr., director of The Thing, the 2011 prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 cult classic of the same name.|$|E

Pangos led the team with 31 points, while Olynyk and Harris added 21 and 17 points, respectively. Gonzaga then went back on the road to play at #22 Oklahoma State, where <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> 69–68 win.

25|$|At the Battle of Magnano on 5 April 1799, Pijon {{commanded}} 1,900 {{men of the}} 56th Line and 253 troopers of the 18th Cavalry Regiment in Victor's division.

After a struggle, they overcame their opponents and killed Mercandin. However, the Austrian army commander Pál Kray launched a powerful counterattack which broke Victor's division and forced Grenier to retreat. During the confused French withdrawal, the Austrians got across Pijon's line of retreat near Villafontana. Pijon ordered a bayonet attack {{to break out of}} the trap, but it was repulsed. At this, the cohesion of the 56th Line collapsed and the regiment disintegrated. Some officers who tried to rally the demoralized soldiers were shot down by their own men. In the confusion, Pijon was fatally wounded, possibly by friendly fire. Most of the 56th Line's soldiers were soon rounded up and captured.|$|E
25|$|Jackson intercepted another {{pass on the}} Raiders' next {{drive and}} {{returned}} it 25 yards to Oakland's 45-yard line, making Jackson the first player ever to record 2 interceptions {{in the first half}} of the Super Bowl. However, the Buccaneers were unable to take advantage of the turnover and were forced to punt. Fortunately for Tampa Bay, <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> big assist from their punter Tom Tupa, who managed to pin Oakland all the way back at their own 11-yard line with his punt. The Raiders could not move the ball either, losing 1 yard on 3 plays with their ensuing drive. Tampa Bay punt returner Karl Williams then returned Shane Lechler's punt 25 yards, giving the Buccaneers great field position at Oakland's 27-yard line. Aided with Pittman's gains of 6 and 19 yards, the Buccaneers scored their first touchdown on a 2-yard run from fullback Mike Alstott, increasing their lead 13–3. Then with 3:45 left in the half, Tampa Bay drove 77 yards, assisted by a pair of catches by Alstott for 28 total yards. Johnson finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Keenan McCardell to give the Buccaneers a 20–3 halftime lead.|$|E
25|$|The Galaxy again {{finished}} {{first in the}} Western Conference in 1999, with a final record of 20–12, with a win in the CONCACAF Champions Cup, but they lost to D.C. United again 2–0. The 2000 season had the Galaxy in second in the Western Division, at 14–10–8. Despite this, they lost to the Kansas City Wizards after a tied aggregate and a sudden death game. 2001 was another successful year for Los Angeles, winning the Open Cup and scoring 1,000 all-time points, and with Cobi Jones scoring the 300th goal, but again they fell short by being defeated by Landon Donovan and the San Jose Earthquakes. Again the club clinched first in the Western Conference with a 16–9–3 record, their fifth time being first. In 2002, the Galaxy won their first MLS Cup in four tries by defeating the New England Revolution 1–0. 2003 was a poor year, with LA finishing fourth because {{they were forced to}} play away games due to stadium construction, though <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> good rhythm and finished 9–12–9. The Galaxy bounced back by gaining second with an 11–9–10 record. They lost to the Wizards in the final, 0–2. With 2005 came one of the Galaxy's most recognized players, Landon Donovan. The club won the Open Cup again ending with a record of 13–13–6 to cap off their first decade. The Galaxy has a distinction of making the playoffs in all of the league's first ten seasons.|$|E
