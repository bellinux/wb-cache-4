5000|$|In 1993, the Wave Radio (which {{has since}} become known as [...] "Wave Radio I") was introduced. It was smaller than the Acoustic Wave, and used two 2 1/2" [...] drivers.

Revised drivers were used, as well a 66 cm <b>tapered</b> <b>waveguide</b> for each speaker which terminated {{at the rear of}} the unit.A headphone jack was added, as well as Boselink compatibility and MP3 playback.

40|$|Haney, Michael W. In {{high-performance}} computing (HPC) systems, Moore's Law governs {{the density of}} integration and the switching speed of transistors on a chip. Moreover, optical interconnects are gradually becoming the majority of signal transmissions because of the higher bandwidth capacity, the low costs of polymer waveguides, and the immunity to electromagnetic interference. Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) advances have enabled architecture that connects chips via an opto-electronic circuit board and a bridge chip to affect high-density inter-chip interconnects. This thesis uses FDTD simulation software to optimize the coupling efficiency between the bridge chip and the opto-electronic circuit board with microlens arrays. The {{two parts of the}} design are separated by the coupling design from a VCSEL to a waveguide and the coupling design from a transmission waveguide to a receiver waveguide. Also, the coupling design from a transmission waveguide to a receiver waveguide is separated by two different <b>tapered</b> <b>waveguide</b> couplers (the 45 o <b>tapered</b> <b>waveguide</b> coupler and the 37. 3 o <b>tapered</b> <b>waveguide</b> coupler).

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis concerns the design and fabrication of <b>tapered</b> <b>waveguide</b> lasers to allow efficient, high-power diode-pumping and produce diffraction-limited, near-symmetrical output, whilst maintaining a monolithic design compatible with integrated optical circuits. The design rules required for efficient operation of a <b>tapered</b> <b>waveguide</b> are derived, and applied to the fabrication of tapered waveguides by thermal ion exchange (TIE) in Nd-doped borosilicate glass. Ti:sapphire pumped laser operation of these waveguides indicates efficient (40 %) and low-loss (0 : 2 dBcm- 1) operation, {{comparable to that of}} a channel waveguide fabricated within the same substrate. Parabolic and linear taper shapes are compared, and the linear shape is found to provide superior operation at wide taper expansions (up to 250 μm, over a length of ~ 22 mm), and hence is more suited to end-pumping with multi-watt broad-stripe-diodes. Broad-stripe-diode end-pumping is also investigated, and the laser performance is characterised, indicating a need to control the refractive index profile to maximise the overlap of the multimode-pump and single-mode laser. Field-assisted ion exchange is therefore investigated to improve the overlap of the diode-pump and laser modes in a <b>tapered</b> <b>waveguide.</b> Waveguides produced by this technique are shown to exhibit the desired step-like index profile, but require further optimisation to improve the laser performance. Low-loss (0 : 1 dBcm- 11) operation of a <b>tapered</b> <b>waveguide</b> laser is {{reported in}} a hybrid Nd-doped/undoped borosilicate glass. The hybrid glass is proposed as a useful substrate for reducing the quasi- 3 -level reabsorption loss of Yb 3 +-doped lasers. As an initial step towards this goal, channel waveguides are fabricated in standard Yb 3 +-doped phosphate glass, which exhibit efficient (50 - 75 %) and moderate-loss (0 : 6 dBcm- 1) laser operation. The design requirements for a power scalable diode-side-pumped <b>tapered</b> <b>waveguide</b> laser are also investigated, and YVO 4 is proposed as a suitable substrate material due to its high absorption coefficient. The indiffusion of Nd, Gd and Ti is characterised for the first time, and the fabrication of the first Nd-indiffused waveguide in YVO 4 is reported.

40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} {{the design of}} a wavelength de-multiplexer based on a tapered photonic crystal waveguide. The <b>tapered</b> <b>waveguide</b> is generated by reducing the width of the channel which, in turn, provides a gradual change in the effective index for the guided modes. Depending on the wavelength, the grading effect enables the propagating beam to be trapped at different spatial positions along the waveguide.

40|$|Lasers {{based on}} planar optical waveguides have {{recently}} generated interest {{for use as}} high-average-power sources, due {{to a combination of}} attractive features including high optical gain, good thermal-power handling and compatibility with the geometry of high-power diode pump sources [1, 2].

For devices of a few centimetres in length, adiabatic expansion can be achieved up to widths of a few hundred microns.
