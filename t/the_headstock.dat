5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator are all situated on <b>the</b> <b>headstock.</b> Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium scoreboard has never {{had the ability to}} display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{months without}} {{maintenance}} during the strike {{had taken their}} toll on many coal mines. Denton Colliery had flooded {{to the extent that}} it was no longer workable and the Denton Colliery Co. went into voluntary liquidation in 1929. <b>The</b> <b>headstock</b> was demolished in 1932 and the shaft was finally filled and capped in 1974.|$|E
25|$|A clip-on tuner clips {{on to an}} instrument—such as onto <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> of {{a guitar}} or the bell of a trombone. A {{vibration}} sensor built into the clip tranmits the instrument vibrations to the tuning circuitry. The absence of a microphone makes these tuners immune to background noise, so musicians can tune in noisy environments, including while other musicians are tuning. The clip-on tuner was invented in 1995 by Mark Wilson of OnBoard Research Corporation, which marketed it as The Intellitouch Tuner Model PT1.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>headstocks,</b> now {{encased in}} concrete, are 610mm deep wrought iron girders of similar construction {{to the deck}} girders. Cast iron piles 2.4m and 1.2m sections and bolted through either internal or external flanges are used to support <b>the</b> <b>headstocks.</b> <b>The</b> piles are 610mm in diameter with 25mm thick wall. Attempts have been made, unsuccessfully, to fill the piles with concrete.|$|R
5000|$|... 15 July 1855 - Four {{men were}} being wound {{out of the}} mine when they were thrown over <b>the</b> <b>headstocks</b> (<b>the</b> {{machinery}} {{at the top of}} the shaft which brings the cage up and down the shaft). Nine men were killed in the incident.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>headstocks</b> of <b>the</b> pit {{appear in}} the opening scenes of the 1960 film of the book. The film, {{directed}} by Freddie Francis, won the 1960 Academy Award for Best Cinematography.|$|R
25|$|A counter faller {{under the}} thread {{was made to}} rise {{to take in the}} slack caused by backing off. This could be used with the top faller wire to guide the yarn to the correct place on the cop. These were {{controlled}} by levers and cams and an inclined plane called the shaper. The spindle speed was controlled by a drum and weighted ropes, as <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> moved the ropes twisted the drum, which using a tooth wheel turned the spindles. None of this would have been possible using the technology of Crompton's time, fifty years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Crompton {{invented the}} {{spinning}} mule in 1779, so called {{because it is}} a hybrid of Arkwright's water frame and James Hargreaves' spinning jenny {{in the same way that}} mule is the product of crossbreeding a female horse with a male donkey (a female donkey is called a jenny). The spinning mule has a fixed frame with a creel of cylindrical bobbins to hold the roving, connected through <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> to a parallel carriage with the spindles. On the outward motion, the rovings are paid out through attenuating rollers and twisted. On the return, the roving is clamped and the spindles reversed to take up the newly spun thread.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 Guild {{released}} {{the first official}} Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300guitars. In 1993 Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer—the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998—as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> (May's original one has a sixpence).|$|E
5000|$|Similarly to Madeira, Burnside Electric Guitars were Guild {{electric}} guitar designs (typically of super-Strat delineation) that were manufactured outside the United States. <b>The</b> <b>headstocks</b> on these guitars read [...] "Burnside by Guild." [...] Both brands were discontinued {{in the early}} '90s.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} day. At Brinsley pit the white steam melted slowly in the sunshine of a soft blue sky; the wheels of <b>the</b> <b>headstocks</b> twinkled high up; the screen, shuffling its coal into the trucks, made a busy noise.|$|R
50|$|Valued among collectors, <b>the</b> <b>headstocks</b> from 1957-1960 {{featured}} a reverse painted plastic overlay {{similar to the}} Kelvinator logo. The guitars {{featured a}}rt deco patterns. It was difficult to get players to take Kay’s high end entry seriously, and Kay discontinued the Gold line in 1962.|$|R
500|$|The {{concert was}} filmed by 26 cameras, {{including}} a camera on <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> of Mick Thomson's guitar and a [...] "first person" [...] {{point of view}} of several band-members. The show was edited in part by band member Shawn Crahan who watched all of the footage recorded from the show. Disasterpieces was met with positive critical reception, with many citing the quick editing and high sound quality as strong points. In 2005, the DVD was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA and is the band's highest-selling DVD to date, shipping at least 400,000 units as a longform video.|$|E
500|$|The scoreboard, {{which has}} a [...] high {{definition}} LED screen, {{is located in the}} middle of the concourse; visitors entering or leaving the park through the stadium's right-field entrance on Fifth Avenue pass under it. Excluding the neck and the borders of the body and headstock, the surface of the guitar is composed of LED screens. Overall, the guitar measures , its body display is , <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> display is , and the six tuning pegs are [...] each. Whereas the scoreboard at Greer was capable of displaying only basic in-game information such as the line score, count, and brief player statistics, the new version can display colorful graphics and animations, live and recorded video, instant replays, the batting order, fielding positions, expanded statistics, and photographs.|$|E
500|$|In early 1966 Harrison and Lennon each {{purchased}} Epiphone Casinos (McCartney {{had owned}} one since 1965), which they used on Revolver. Harrison also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album. He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design {{that included the}} word [...] "Bebopalula" [...] above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, [...] "Rocky", on <b>the</b> <b>headstock.</b> He played this guitar in the Magical Mystery Tour film and throughout his solo career. In mid-1968 he acquired a Gibson Les Paul that he nicknamed [...] "Lucy". Around this time, he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200, which he used for early demos of [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps". In late 1968 Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype, made especially for him by Philip Kubicki (who years later would start his own business, Factor), a Fender master builder who also crafted a prototype Stratocaster for Jimi Hendrix. In August 2017, Fender released a [...] "Limited Edition George Harrison Rosewood Telecaster" [...] modeled after a Telecaster Roger Rossmeisel originally created for Harrison.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{though they}} {{continue}} to make various series of guitars, sometime in the late 1990s, Jackson began dropping the series labels from <b>the</b> <b>headstocks</b> of their imported models. Since Fender took control, all imported models say [...] "Jackson" [...] on their headstock with no mention of a series.|$|R
5000|$|Rakers were {{installed}} on the outer face of each pile. Manufactured from 125mm wrought iron, they are secured to the wrought iron [...] "helmet" [...] {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>headstocks.</b> Several are detached due to corrosion while others show extensive loss of material at the inter-tidal zone.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>headstocks</b> {{were painted}} black and {{featured}} the [...] "Gibson" [...] logo in gold script. Most models feature a black pickguard, though closer inspection reveals that some pickguards only appear black and are {{actually a very}} dark tortoiseshell pattern. A few early basses were equipped with a bright red tortoiseshell pickguard.|$|R
500|$|Disasterpieces was {{recorded}} at the now defunct London Dockland Arena in England on February 16, 2002, {{it was one}} of the final dates on the band's European tour which was subsequently their final tour until 2004. The concert was shot with 26 different cameras under the direction of Matthew Amos and documents the show, backstage action and an in-store signing in Paris, France. In addition to operated cameras each band member had an individual camera which was attached to the side of their masks, apart from Mick Thomson whose camera was attached to <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> of his guitar. The concept behind these cameras was to allow the viewer to see the show from the band member's point of view. However they did cause some discomfort and problems for some band members. Bassist Paul Gray removed his after four songs, explaining that [...] "they gave us this big [...] pack to wear around our waist. So when I was jumping around, the thing started sliding down my leg". Also during the song [...] "Spit It Out" [...] DJ Sid Wilson had his camera stolen when he was in the crowd, however it was returned at the end of the show, all of this is documented on the DVD.|$|E
2500|$|Another patent naming Van Halen as {{inventor}} is [...] for <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> {{design for}} the EVH Wolfgang guitars.|$|E
2500|$|Wolf {{was made}} with an ebony {{fingerboard}} and featured numerous embellishments like alternating grain designs in <b>the</b> <b>headstock,</b> ivory inlays, and fret marker dots made of sterling silver. The body was composed of western maple wood which had a core of purpleheart. Garcia later had Irwin (who ultimately left Alembic {{to start his own}} business) replace the electronics inside the guitar, at which point he added his own logo to <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> alongside the Alembic logo. The system included two interchangeable plates for configuring pickups: one was made for strictly single coils, while the other accommodated humbuckers. Shortly after receiving the modified instrument, Garcia commissioned another custom guitar from Irwin with one caveat: [...] "Don't hold back." ...|$|E
50|$|Brinsley {{used to be}} a major mining village. The only {{remainder}} of this heritage are <b>the</b> <b>headstocks.</b> They are not only of significance for the area but are also <b>the</b> only <b>headstocks</b> left of this kind. After the final closure of Brinsley Pit they had been moved to a museum but have recently been restored and brought back to near their original place. The Friends of Brinsley Headstocks have worked on turning the area into a nature reserve. There are several farms in the area that have gone organic. The countryside is often explored by leisure walkers with walks organised by D.H. Lawrence Heritage.|$|R
50|$|Clipstone Colliery was a {{coal mine}} {{situated}} {{near the village}} of the same name on the edge of an area of Nottinghamshire known as “The Dukeries” {{because of the number of}} stately homes in the area. The colliery was owned by the Bolsover Colliery Company and passed to the National Coal Board in 1947. <b>The</b> <b>headstocks</b> and powerhouse are grade II listed buildings.|$|R
50|$|All {{members of}} the CBH class are liveried in a CBH Group {{two-tone}} mid blue / light blue design. Numbering is in mid blue, striping and lettering is in white, and the solebars and handrails are picked out in white. Underframes are painted black, with black and white safety stripes on <b>the</b> <b>headstocks</b> and access steps picked out in yellow.|$|R
2500|$|During the Grateful Dead's 1974 European tour, Wolf {{was dropped}} on several occasions, {{one of which}} caused a minor crack in <b>the</b> <b>headstock.</b> Following filming of The Grateful Dead Movie (in which the guitar is {{prominently}} visible) a month later, Garcia returned it to Irwin for repairs. Throughout its absence, Garcia predominantly played several Travis Bean guitars, including the TB1000A (1975) and the TB500 (1976-1977). On September 28, 1977, Irwin delivered the refurbished Wolf back to Garcia. The wolf sticker which gave the guitar its name had now been inlaid into the instrument; it also featured an effects loop between the pick-ups and controls (so inline effects would [...] "see" [...] the same signal at all times) which was bypassable. Irwin also put a new face on <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> with only his logo (he later claimed to have built the guitar himself, though pictures through time clearly show the progression of logos, from Alembic, to Alembic & Irwin, to only Irwin).|$|E
2500|$|Gibson guitars {{released}} a guitar model in 2008 called the Robot Guitar—a customized version {{of either the}} Les Paul or SG model. The guitar is fitted with a special tailpiece with in-built sensors that pick up {{the frequency of the}} strings. An illuminated control knob selects different tunings. Motorized tuning machines on <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> automatically tune the guitar. In [...] "intonation" [...] mode, the device displays how much adjustment the bridge requires with a system of flashing LEDs on the control knob.|$|E
2500|$|The Hare Krishna mantra {{appears in}} a number of famous songs, notably those by Boy George in Bow Down Mister, the Beatles (in the lyrics of George Harrison and John Lennon), and has been at the number 1 spot on the UK singles charts on more than one occasion, through Harrison's solo single [...] "My Sweet Lord". Harrison put a Hare Krishna sticker on the back of <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> of Eric Clapton's 1964 Gibson ES-335; the sticker also appears on Gibson's 2005 {{reproduction}} of the guitar.|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} of a [...] "matched headstock" [...] varies between manufacturers and players - for example, <b>the</b> <b>headstocks</b> of Gibson guitars are nearly always black, and it is debatable whether a black-bodied Gibson has a matching headstock. Generally, a guitar is only considered to have a matching <b>headstock</b> if <b>the</b> guitar is usually produced without matching body and headstock finishes.|$|R
50|$|Black <b>headstock</b> {{rather than}} <b>the</b> matched <b>headstock</b> and body colour of the originals and first reissues.|$|R

2500|$|Gibson {{has issued}} two {{signature}} Les Paul guitars for Joe Perry of Aerosmith. The first {{was developed in}} 1996 and was customized with an active mid-boost control, black chrome hardware, and a translucent black finish. It was replaced in 2004 by a second, more visually distinctive Les Paul, the [...] "Boneyard" [...] Les Paul. This guitar is characterized by Perry's custom [...] "Boneyard" [...] logo on <b>the</b> <b>headstock</b> and a figured maple top with a green tiger finish, and is available with either a stopbar tailpiece or a Bigsby tailpiece.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson used {{hundreds}} {{of photographs of}} the late blues guitarist's instrument to produce the limited-edition Bloomfield signature. The company produced one hundred Bloomfield models with custom-aged finishes and two hundred more with the company's VOS finishing in 2009. They reproduced the tailpiece crack on the aged version, plus the mismatched volume and tone control knobs and the [...] "Les Paul"-engraved truss rod cover on both versions, while including a toggle switch cover. <b>The</b> <b>headstock</b> was characterized by the kidney-shaped Grover tuning keys installed on the guitar before Bloomfield traded for it.|$|E
50|$|Christian Olde Wolbers Signature: A Dinky with a {{distinct}} camouflage graphic on both <b>the</b> body and <b>headstock.</b> <b>The</b> black ebony neck lacks inlays. This signature model comes with one humbucking pickup and no others.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A hybrid {{high-speed}} precise {{machining centre}} headstock model {{based on two}} computation methods: the finite {{element method and the}} finite difference method is presented. The model allows one to calculate precisely <b>the</b> <b>headstock’s</b> indices on <b>the</b> basis of which its optimal operating characteristics can be determined. The presented modelling methods allow one to evaluate a design from thermal, stiffness and durability points of view. The bearing units and cooling system influence on machine tool preciseness has been described...|$|R
50|$|Their pickguards come in Mint Green or Brown Shell colors. Jazzmasters {{featured}} bound necks with block pearloid inlays from 1966 {{until the}} end of their original run in 1977; <b>the</b> <b>headstocks</b> were also larger ("CBS-style") in this era. They have featured matching <b>headstocks</b> (<b>headstocks</b> painted <b>the</b> same color as the body) at several points throughout the guitar's history.
