5|$|While recent discoveries {{have made}} it more {{difficult}} to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton, or are clear descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical for Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to their descendants. Such modifications, originating in the most recent common ancestor of a certain <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group,</b> are called the synapomorphies of such a group.|$|E
5|$|While {{the layout}} of {{internal}} genital ducts and openings of the female genitalia depends upon the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group</b> that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects have a system of receptacles and ducts in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts of the female join {{together to form a}} common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') which leads to the vagina.|$|E
5|$|In botany, a tree is a {{perennial}} plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, {{the definition of}} a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group</b> but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.|$|E

5|$|Paratheria is an {{obsolete}} {{term for}} a <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group</b> including the xenarthran mammals (sloths, anteaters, and armadillos) and various groups thought {{to be related to}} them. It was proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths, anteaters, armadillos, and pangolins, usually classified as placentals, from both marsupial and placental mammals, an arrangement that received little support from other workers. When teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in Argentina in the 1980s, they were thought to be related to xenarthrans, leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals. However, by the early 1990s, gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans, and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals.|$|E
5|$|Isopods are detritivores, browsers, {{carnivores}} (including {{predators and}} scavengers), parasites, and filter feeders, and may occupy {{one or more}} of these feeding niches. Only aquatic and marine species are known to be parasites or filter feeders. Some exhibit coprophagia and will also consume their own fecal pellets. Terrestrial species are in general herbivorous, with woodlice feeding on moss, bark, algae, fungi and decaying material. In marine isopods that feed on wood, cellulose is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. Limnoria lignorum, for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the mycelia of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing the nitrogen in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house symbiotic bacteria in the hindgut which aid in digesting cellulose. There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Ascomycota, {{commonly}} known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, constitute the largest <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group</b> within the Eumycota. These fungi form meiotic spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an ascus. This phylum includes morels, a few mushrooms and truffles, unicellular yeasts (e.g., of the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Candida), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Claviceps. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called anamorphic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest teleomorphs in the Ascomycota. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes {{have been used for}} elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., Neurospora crassa).|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{standardised}} procedure for monitoring ecosystem and community change by generating a combined data matrix based on species abundance data from different <b>taxonomic</b> <b>groups,</b> and to validate this approach using three typical data sets from freshwater ecosystems. Specifically, we propose and validate that (I) the generation of a combined species abundance data matrix from multiple <b>taxonomic</b> <b>groups</b> based on different sampling techniques and investigation scales is possible if standardisation/normalisation procedures which account for differences in species numbers and numerical scale are appropriately considered. (II) The integrative consideration of multiple <b>taxonomic</b> <b>groups</b> into multivariate community response analysis does not reduce the capability of detecting environmental gradients and differences between treatments compared to single <b>taxonomic</b> <b>groups.</b> (III) Combining information from multiple <b>taxonomic</b> <b>groups</b> using multivariate analysis is advantageous for the quantification of environmental changes compared to univariate (i.e. Shannon Index) or descriptive (i.e. WFD Ecological Quality Class) analyses of single compound indices. Compared to current methods, the herein proposed standardized procedure for analysing community and ecosystem change considers a combined data matrix based on normalized or averaged abundance data, derived from different sampling strategies, being independent of the scale of investigation and the presence of indicator taxa.|$|R
5|$|The holotype {{worker for}} P. longiceps was {{collected}} by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1868. The fossil, which was preserved in Baltic amber from the Eocene, was formally described in Mayr's journal article Die Ameisen des baltischen Bernsteins, designating {{it as the}} type species by monotypy (the condition of a <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group</b> having only a single taxon described) for the newly established genus Prionomyrmex. Originally, the genus {{was placed in the}} subfamily Ponerinae by Mayr, but in 1877, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery classified the genus into the subfamily Myrmeciidae (now known as Myrmeciinae), the same year Emery established the subfamily. In 1915, the tribe Prionomyrmecini was erected by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler, who had placed Prionomyrmex in it. In that year, Wheeler placed the genus back into Ponerinae without any means of justifying his decision. British myrmecologist Horace Donisthorpe would also retain the genus in Ponerinae without explanation, but William Brown Jr. would return it to Myrmeciinae in 1954.|$|E
5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{is the notion}} that a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct ancestor of one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, it is unlikely that any particular form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group</b> being an ancestor of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where the fossil record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E

25|$|After {{landing on}} a {{suitable}} tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel {{in which it}} releases spores of its fungal symbiont.

The majority of ambrosia beetles colonize xylem (sapwood and/or heartwood) of dying or recently dead trees, but some attack live trees. Species differ in their preference for different parts of trees, different stages of deterioration, and in the shape of their tunnels ("galleries"). However, the majority of ambrosia beetles are not specialized to any <b>taxonomic</b> <b>group</b> of hosts, unlike most phytophagous organisms including the closely related bark beetles.|$|E

500|$|The {{fossil record}} tells a {{different}} story.

[...] Another problem is that some of these molecular dates have overestimated the divergence of other mammalian orders, such as Rodentia, suggesting primate divergence might also be overestimated. [...] One of the oldest known strepsirrhines, Djebelemur, dates from the early Eocene of northern Africa and lacks a fully differentiated toothcomb. [...] Based on fossils and other genetic tests, a more conservative estimate dates the divergence between lemurs and lorises to around 50 to 55mya.|$|E
