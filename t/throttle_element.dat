40|$|Purpose. In {{this paper}} it is {{necessary}} to conduct: 1) research and analyse the influence of <b>throttle</b> <b>element</b> pneumatic resistance on elastic and damping parameters of air spring; 2) to obtain the dependence of air spring parameters on <b>throttle</b> <b>element</b> pneumatic resistance value. Methodology. The work presents the elaborated model of the air spring as a dynamic system with three phase coordinates (cylinder pressure, auxiliary reservoir pressure, cylinder air mass). Stiffness and viscosity coefficients were determined on the basis of system response to harmonic kinematic disturbance. The data for the analysis are obtained by changing the capacity of the connecting element and the law of pressure variation between the reservoir and the cylinder. The viscosity coefficient is regarded as the viscosity ratio of the hydraulic damper, which for one oscillation cycle consumes the same energy as the air spring. The process of air condition change inside the cylinder (reservoir) is considered to be adiabatic; the mass air flow through the connecting element depends on the pressure difference. Findings. We obtained the curves for spring viscosity and stiffness coefficients dependence on the throttle resistance at three different laws, linking airflow through the cylinder with the pressure difference in cylinder and reservoir. At both maximum and minimum limiting resistance values the spring viscosity tends to zero, reaching its peak in the mean resistance values. Stiffness increases monotonically with increasing resistance, tends to the limit corresponding to the absence of an auxiliary reservoir (at high resistance) and the increase in cylinder volume by the reservoir volume (at low resistance). Originality. The designed scheme allows determining the optimal parameters of elastic and damping properties of the pneumatic system as function of the <b>throttle</b> <b>element</b> air resistance. Practical value. The ability to predict the parameters of elastic and damping properties of the pneumatic system as function of the <b>throttle</b> <b>element</b> air resistance will improve the running performance of carriages, the comfort of passenger transportation and reduce the wear of the rolling stock and the track caused by interaction of carriage and rails. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis work {{is devoted}} to {{computer}} simulation of electro-pneumatic drives for vertical motion mobile robots. These robots are equipped with suction pads to move on walls and ceiling. An output highlights a conflict between the main requirements to such robot drives: simultaneous ensuring of high speed and smoothness of movement of robots with a considerable mass of moved objects. The low efficiency of traditional cushion systems of cylinders is shown in development of such kind of robots. New structure of electro-pneumatic drive for applications with considerable inertia load is developed. This structure represents mechatronic system and consists from the set of on-off valves and computer control device that operates the valves and reaches the optimum motion control of the object with required smoothness. This could be achieved due to the multistep braking {{in the end of}} stroke. The paper also represents the mathematical model of developed drive with description of <b>throttle</b> <b>elements,</b> friction forces and details of computer control systems. Mathematical model realized in computer program allows to simulate processes of movement of electro-pneumatic drives. The results of computer modeling show that developed structure and multistep computer control allows to develop effective electro-pneumatic drives for high-quality and high-speed control of massive objects in the part of vertical motion mobile robots.

40|$|High {{pressure}} reducing valve (HPRV) is a key device for the pressure control of high temperature and pressure steam in industrial processes. Perforated plate is used as the <b>throttling</b> <b>element</b> to ensure the suitable pressure of steam and reduce aerodynamic noise inside HPRV and the linked pipelines. Mach number is the parameter to reflect the compressibility of steam flow. Higher Mach number may cause serious aerodynamic noise of steams flow, waste {{large amount of energy}} and do harm to the valves and pipelines. In this paper, Mach number on multi-stage perforated plates inside a novel HPRV and the linked pipelines is investigated. Mach number in reversible isentropic process is analyzed and the design method of multi-stage perforated plates in HPRV is proposed. Then, the RNG k-ϵ model combining with compressible gas is established, and the Mach number simulation of single perforated plate and multi-stage perforated plates is carried out in software Fluent 6. 3. Meanwhile, Mach number inside HPRV is also presented, and the pressure ratio of perforated plate is also investigated. It can be found that under higher pressure ratio, the influence area of the last perforated plate becomes larger, and the energy loss in perforated plate is larger than the valve core. Furthermore, there exists a limited pressure ratio of every stage perforated plate, and it is better to keep the pressure ratio of every stage perforated plate larger than 0. 5. This work presents the function of perforated plates in HPRV for throttling and reducing aerodynamic noises, and it can benefit the researchers who are dealing with multi-stage perforated plates design for valves and pipelines...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{design of}} a rotary {{hydraulic}} flow control valve has been presented for high flow rate fluid power systems. High flow rates in these systems account for substantial flow forces acting on the <b>throttling</b> <b>elements</b> of the valves and cause the application of mechanically sophisticated multi-staged servo valves for flow regulation. The suggested design enables utilisation of single-stage valves in power hydraulics operating at high flow rates regimes. A spool driver and auxiliary mechanisms of the proposed valve design were discussed and selection criteria were suggested. Analytical expressions for metering characteristics as well as steady flow torques have been derived. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of steady state flow regimes was conducted to evaluate the hydraulic behaviour of the proposed valve. This study represents a special case of an independent metering concept applied {{to the design of}} power hydraulic systems with direct proportional valve control operating at flow rates above 150 litres per minute. The result gained using parametric CFD simulations predicted the induced torque and the pressure drops due to a steady flow. Magnitudes of these values prove that by minimising the number of spool’s mobile metering surfaces it is possible to reduce the flow-generated forces in the new generation of hydraulic valves proposed in this study. Calculation of the flow jet angles was analytically verified by measuring the deflection of the velocity vector using flow velocity field distribution, obtained during visualisation of the results of CFD simulations. The derived calculation formulas can predict metering characteristics, values of steady flow torques and jet angles for the specified design and geometry of the suggested valve. The proposed novel structure of the flow control valve promises to attain improved controllability, reliability and efficiency of the hydraulic control units of heavy mobile machinery operating at high flow rates regimes...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{research results}} of the mineral oil flow process with viscosity of 30 cSt through a round orifice with the sharp inlet edge of 0. 9 mm in diameter. Pilot studies were conducted using a module from the transparent plexiglas that allowed to visualize hydrodynamic processes. The intake and off-take channels of the module with their sufficient extension had diameter of 20 mm (24 diameters of an orifice) {{that allows us to}} consider compression of a stream as perfect. Drawing the enameled nichrome wire with a mark as a stripping isolation of 0. 1 mm width enabled sounding of electric processes in the stream sections. Intensive high- frequency electric processes were revealed in cavitation stream. The paper gives experimental values of coefficients of volumetric and mass flow at low (150 <Re < 800) Reynolds numbers in conditions of free jet and submerged orifice. Free jet at a speed exceeding 50 m/s strikes a wall, barrier, installed at a distance of 100 diameters of the orifice: the reflection from walls, barriers shot blast, which caused intense foaming and conversion of oil into the two-phase mixture "fluid- combined air. " We investigate the "life cycle" of a two-phase mixture: flotation bubbles in a viscous medium, and there was no air passes completely evolved in the dissolved state in a time not exceeding 30 minutes. Volumetric analysis of the foam allowed us to estimate the percentage of volumetric gas content of oil, which was 9 % at 240 С and atmospheric pressure of 97. 5 kPa.

40|$|As one of {{the first}} {{technology}} development programs awarded under NASA's Vision for Space Exploration, the Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) Deep Throttling, Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine (CECE) program was selected by NASA in November 2004 to begin technology development and demonstration toward a deep throttling, cryogenic Lunar Lander engine for use across multiple human and robotic lunar exploration mission segments with extensibility to Mars. The CECE program leverages the maturity and previous investment of a flight-proven hydrogen/oxygen expander cycle engine, the RL 10, to develop and demonstrate an unprecedented combination of reliability, safety, durability, throttlability, and restart capabilities in a high-energy, cryogenic engine. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and NASA Glenn Research Center personnel were integral design and analysis team members throughout the requirements assessment, propellant studies and the deep <b>throttling</b> demonstrator <b>elements</b> of the program. The testbed selected for the initial deep throttling demonstration phase of this program was a minimally modified RL 10 engine, allowing for maximum current production engine commonality and extensibility with minimum program cost. In just nine months from technical program start, CECE Demonstrator No. 1 engine testing in April/May 2006 at PWR's E 06 test stand successfully demonstrated in excess of 10 : 1 throttling of the hydrogen/oxygen expander cycle engine. This test provided an early demonstration of a viable, enabling cryogenic propulsion concept with invaluable system-level technology data acquisition toward design and development risk mitigation for both the subsequent CECE Demonstrator No. 2 program and to the future Lunar Lander Design, Development, Test and Evaluation effort...|$|R
40|$|During {{the moving}} of vehicle {{is a change}} in {{temperature}} mode, which arises due to fluid friction in the dissipative <b>element</b> (<b>throttle</b> bores) hydropneumatic spring. In this case, hydropneumatic spring can be warm to significant temperatures. Due to lower viscosity of the fluid below the warning level, the increased heat causes a sharp increase in various types of leakage, increased friction parts, and as a consequence, the intensive wear and seizure of the surfaces. This leads to partial or complete loss of efficiency hydropneumatic springs. To changes in temperature mode in the hydropneumatic spring is influenced not only the external surface of the hydropneumatic spring, temperature and speed of blowing air flow, but also the conditions and the duration of the moving of vehicle. In this paper we investigate the heat intensity of the hydropneumatic springs of vehicle in weight 5. 5 tons during the moving at different speeds for different types of roads. Investigations were carried out on the basis of mathematical models realized in a package of Matlab Simulink. In this case, was fixed the time average power released in the hydropneumatic spring in the form of heat. According to the research conclusions were drawn about the most heavy-duty vehicle and the amount of heat generated by the length of relative motion in this mode. To prevent overheating, an algorithm diagnosis of the condition and management of heat intensity of the hydropneumatic springs Also made recommendations to reduce the heat intensity hydropneumatic springs...|$|R
