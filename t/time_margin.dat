50|$|In {{the second}} round of the Island Challenge, Sting went first. Janardan and Maddy took a risk and held three dice each to take to the other side. The two wobbled a little bit with their {{crossing}} and did not communicate because they knew what to do. Janardan got to the other side of the wire first, shortly followed by Maddy. In Claw's turn, Abbey took three dice across and made his way to the other side quickly, but Shya just stayed on the starting position, because she was slightly scared of heights and not confident. Abbey then went back and took two more dice across, and Shya took the last die, but she was very slow, so halfway across, Abbey offered to take the last die with the other two, and they both got to the other side.

In 1964 the European Championships were the top international orienteering events; from 1966 they were replaced by the World Championships and held every second year over the next decennium. The competition terrain in Le Brassus in 1964 consisted of a mixture of spruce forests and open grazing land at an altitude between 1,300 and 1,700 metres. The maps prepared for the competitions were special editions of Swiss military maps of scale 1:25,000. The women's individual contest was held on Saturday, 26 September. The course had a length of 8.1 kilometers and ten control points. Wallsten finished second in the race, behind Margrit Thommen from Switzerland. In the relay contest the next day, the Swedish team won gold medals, winning with a <b>time</b> <b>margin</b> of forty minutes ahead of the Swiss team.

The bounded linear stability analysis method seeks to represent an adaptive law by a locally bounded linear approximation within a small time window. The <b>time</b> delay <b>margin</b> of this input delay system represents a local stability measure and is computed analytically by three methods: Pade approximation, Lyapunov-Krasovskii method, and the matrix measure method.

The optimal control modification adaptive law overcomes this limitation in that, as the adaptive gain tends to infinity and if the matched uncertainty is linear, then the closed-loop input delay system tends to a LTI system. A lower bound of the <b>time</b> delay <b>margin</b> of this system can then be estimated uniquely without the need for the windowing analysis.
