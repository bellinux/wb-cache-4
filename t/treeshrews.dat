5|$|The sublingua in lemuriform {{primates}} and tarsiers {{may have}} {{evolved from the}} specialized folds of tissue below that tongue, as seen in some marsupials, such as sugar gliders, {{as well as some}} embryonic eutherian mammals, such as whales and dogs. It is also found in some adult eutherian mammals, such as <b>treeshrews,</b> colugos, and rodents. The sublingua of <b>treeshrews,</b> close relatives of primates, is less developed than in lemuriforms and tarsiers, but suggests a phylogenetic relationship.|$|E
5|$|Tupaia miocenica is {{a fossil}} treeshrew from the Miocene of Thailand. Known {{only from a}} single tooth, an upper first or second molar, it is among the few known fossil <b>treeshrews.</b> With a length of 3.57mm, the tooth is large for a treeshrew. At the back lingual corner (the side of the tongue), the tooth shows a small cusp, the hypocone, that is {{separated}} from the protocone {{in front of it}} by a narrow valley. The condition of the hypocone distinguishes this species from various other <b>treeshrews.</b> In addition, the presence of a well-developed but simple mesostyle (a small cuspule) is distinctive.|$|E
50|$|Horsfield's <b>treeshrew</b> (Tupaia javanica), {{also called}} Javan <b>treeshrew,</b> is a <b>treeshrew</b> species within the Tupaiidae. It is endemic to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Bali, Java and Nias where it inhabits {{foremost}} primary forest.|$|R

5|$|Tupaia miocenica was {{described}} in 1997 by French paleontologists Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg in {{a report on the}} fossil mammals of Li Mae Long, a Miocene site in Thailand. The animal is known from a single tooth, which according to Mein and Ginsburg's comparisons most closely resembles the living <b>treeshrews</b> of the genus Tupaia. The specific name, miocenica, refers to the animal's occurrence during the Miocene. Only a few other fossil <b>treeshrews</b> are known, and T.miocenica is the only fossil species from Thailand. When it {{was described}}, it was the only Miocene representative of Tupaia, but a second species, Tupaia storchi, was named from the Late Miocene of Lufeng, China, in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Down {{the middle}} of the sublingua is a thick {{strengthening}} rod called the plica mediana or lytta, which connects the sublingua to the underside of the tongue, and is part of the lingual septum (septum of the tongue). The thickness and size of the plica mediana can vary between species, and except in <b>treeshrews,</b> it is cartilaginous and provides support for the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|Bats are placental mammals. They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the <b>treeshrews</b> (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic evidence places bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, with its sister taxon as Fereuungulata, which includes carnivorans, pangolins, odd-toed ungulates, even-toed ungulates, and cetaceans. One study places Chiroptera as a sister taxon to odd-toed ungulates (Perissodactyla).|$|E
50|$|The pen-tailed <b>treeshrew</b> (Ptilocercus lowii) is a <b>treeshrew</b> {{native to}} {{southern}} Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and some Indonesian islands.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} smooth-tailed <b>treeshrew</b> (Dendrogale murina) is {{a species}} of <b>treeshrew</b> in the family Tupaiidae found in Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|The slender <b>treeshrew</b> (Tupaia gracilis) is a <b>treeshrew</b> species {{within the}} Tupaiidae.It {{is native to}} Borneo and inhabits {{foremost}} lowland old forest.|$|R
5|$|The toothcomb of <b>treeshrews</b> is {{like the}} lemuriform toothcomb in that it uses interdental spaces to form the comb tines, but only two of its three pairs of lower incisors are {{included}} in the toothcomb and the canines are also excluded. The lateral two incisors in the toothcomb are generally larger. In the extinct arctocyonids, all six lower incisors were part of the toothcomb. In African antelopes, the toothcomb is strikingly similar to that of lemuriforms in that it consists of two pairs of incisors and a pair of canines.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the lemuriform toothcomb and the clade it characterizes have been the center of {{considerable}} debate {{for more than a}} century. In 1920, British palaeoanthropologist Wilfrid Le Gros Clark proposed that the toothcomb found in <b>treeshrews</b> (which he believed were primates) was an early version of the dental structure found in lemuriforms. Because he viewed the fossil lorisoids from the Miocene as not having fully developed the modern lemuriform toothcomb, he implied that lemurs and lorisoids had evolved the trait independently. This view was later overturned, and the monophyletic relationship between lemurs and lorisoids is now accepted.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the first}} taxonomic {{classification}} of lemurs, many {{changes have been}} made to lemur taxonomy. [...] Within the primate order, <b>treeshrews</b> (order Scandentia) were considered basal, prosimian primates—close relatives of lemurs—until the 1980s. Colugos, also incorrectly referred to as [...] "flying lemurs", were once considered lemur-like primates, but were reclassified as close relatives of bats, and more recently as close relatives of primates within their own order, Dermoptera. [...] Primates, together with their closest relatives, the <b>treeshrews,</b> colugos, and long-extinct plesiadapiforms, form the taxonomically unranked Euarchonta clade within the Euarchontoglires. Lorisids, some of which were originally placed in the genus Lemur by Carl Linnaeus, have since been moved into either their own infraorder (Lorisiformes) or their own superfamily (Lorisoidea) within Lemuriformes.|$|E
50|$|The golden-bellied <b>treeshrew</b> (Tupaia chrysogaster) is a <b>treeshrew</b> species {{within the}} Tupaiidae.It is also called Mentawai <b>treeshrew</b> {{as it is}} endemic to the Indonesian Mentawai islands of Sipora, North and South Pagai. It lives in forests, and is {{considered}} endangered due to habitat loss since the islands' forests are continuously logged.|$|R
50|$|The {{mountain}} <b>treeshrew</b> (Tupaia montana) is a <b>treeshrew</b> species {{within the}} Tupaiidae.It is endemic to Borneo and inhabits montane forests in Sarawak and Sabah.|$|R
50|$|The long-footed <b>treeshrew</b> (Tupaia longipes) is a <b>treeshrew</b> species {{within the}} Tupaiidae.It is endemic to Borneo and {{threatened}} due to deforestation and degradation of habitat.|$|R
500|$|Toothcombs {{can also}} be found in colugos and <b>treeshrews,</b> both close {{relatives}} of primates; however, the structures are different and these are considered to examples of convergent evolution. [...] Likewise, small- or medium-sized African antelopes, such as the impala (Aepyceros melampus), have a similar structure sometimes referred to as the [...] "lateral dental grooming apparatus". [...] Living and extinct hyraxes (hyracoids) also exhibit a toothcomb, although the number of tines in the comb vary throughout the fossil record.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} forest {{reserves}} {{within the city}} namely the Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve in the city centre, the oldest gazetted forest reserve in the country , Bukit Sungai Putih Forest Reserve (...) and Bukit Sungai Besi Forest Reserve (...) [...] Bukit Nanas, {{in the heart of}} the city centre, is one of the oldest virgin forests in the world within a city. These residual forest areas are home to a number of fauna species particularly monkeys, <b>treeshrews,</b> pygmy goats, budgerigars, squirrels and birds.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{his work}} as a mammalogist, Lyon is {{considered}} the taxonomic authority for the family Ptilocercidae (pen-tailed <b>treeshrews),</b> as well as the genus Anathana (the Madras treeshrew) and two genera of leporids (rabbits and hares), Pentalagus (the Amami rabbit) and Pronolagus (red rock hares). [...] Lyon was the first to describe the Bornean white-bearded gibbon (Hylobates albibarbis), the Gansu pika (Ochotona cansus), the Sumatran porcupine (Hystrix sumatrae), the shadowy broad-nosed bat (Platyrrhinus umbratus), and two species of slow loris from Borneo, Nycticebus bancanus and Nycticebus borneanus.|$|E

500|$|The sublingua ("under-tongue") is {{a muscular}} {{secondary}} tongue found below the primary tongue in tarsiers and living strepsirrhine primates, which includes lemurs and lorisoids (collectively called [...] "lemuriforms"). Although {{it is most}} fully developed in these primates, similar structures {{can be found in}} some other mammals, such as marsupials, <b>treeshrews,</b> and colugos. This [...] "second tongue" [...] lacks taste buds, and in lemuriforms, it is thought to be used to remove hair and other debris from the toothcomb, a specialized dental structure used to comb the fur during oral grooming.|$|E
500|$|Primates first evolved {{sometime}} between the Middle Cretaceous {{and the early}} Paleocene periods on either the supercontinent of Laurasia or in Africa. [...] According to molecular clock studies, the last common ancestor of all primates dates to around 79.6mya, although the earliest known fossil primates are only 54–55million years old. The closest relatives of primates are the extinct plesiadapiforms, the modern colugos (commonly and inaccurately named [...] "flying lemurs"), and <b>treeshrews.</b> [...] Some of the earliest known true primates are represented by the fossil groups Omomyidae, Eosimiidae, and Adapiformes.|$|E
500|$|Although <b>treeshrews,</b> plesiadapids, and {{the like}} are now no longer {{considered}} to be closely related to lemurs, disagreements persist over the classification of lemurs and related groups, resulting in competing arrangements of the infraorders and superfamilies within Strepsirrhini. In one taxonomy, infraorder Lemuriformes contains all living strepsirrhines in two superfamilies, Lemuroidea for all lemurs and Lorisoidea for the lorisoids (lorisids and galagos). Alternatively, the lorisoids are sometimes placed in their own infraorder, Lorisiformes, separate from the lemurs. [...] Yet another classification published by Colin Groves placed the aye-aye in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes, {{while the rest of}} the lemurs were placed in Lemuriformes and the lorisoids in Lorisiformes.|$|E
5000|$|The Madras <b>treeshrew</b> (Anathana ellioti), {{also known}} as the Indian <b>treeshrew,</b> is a species of <b>treeshrew</b> in the {{monotypic}} genus Anathana found in the hill forests of central and southern India. The genus name is derived from the Tamil name of moongil anathaan (literally [...] "bamboo squirrel") and the species name is after Sir Walter Elliot of the Indian Civil Services in Madras.|$|R
50|$|The large <b>treeshrew</b> (Tupaia tana) is a <b>treeshrew</b> species {{within the}} Tupaiidae. It {{is native to}} Sumatra and {{adjacent}} small islands, {{as well as in}} the lowlands and hills of Borneo.|$|R
50|$|The Palawan <b>treeshrew</b> (Tupaia palawanensis) is a <b>treeshrew</b> species {{endemic to}} the Palawan Island, Philippines, where it occurs from sea level to an {{elevation}} of 1400 m. The population is considered steady.|$|R
500|$|Since the 19th century, the {{classification}} of lemurs above the genus level has seen many changes. Early taxonomists proposed a variety of classifications for lemurs, but generally separated indriids from other lemurs and placed the aye-aye in a major group of its own; some classified the {{dwarf and mouse lemurs}} with the galagos. In 1915, William King Gregory published a classification that remained generally accepted over the next decades. He placed all the lemurs together in a [...] "series" [...] Lemuriformes and recognized three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae (including the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae). George Gaylord Simpson's influential 1945 classification of mammals placed the <b>treeshrews</b> and the fossil Anagale (both now classified outside Primates) inside Lemuriformes and classified the fossil families Plesiadapidae and Adapidae in a superfamily Lemuroidea with most of the lemurs.|$|E
500|$|A toothcomb (also tooth comb or dental comb) is {{a dental}} {{structure}} {{found in some}} mammals, comprising a group of front teeth arranged {{in a manner that}} facilitates grooming, similar to a hair comb. [...] The toothcomb occurs in lemuriform primates (which includes lemurs and lorisoids), <b>treeshrews,</b> colugos, hyraxes, and some African antelopes. [...] The structures evolved independently in different types of mammals through convergent evolution and vary both in dental composition and structure. In most mammals the comb is formed by a group of teeth with fine spaces between them. The toothcombs in most mammals include incisors only, while in lemuriform primates they include incisors and canine teeth that tilt forward {{at the front of the}} lower jaw, followed by a canine-shaped first premolar. [...] The toothcombs of colugos and hyraxes take a different form with the individual incisors being serrated, providing multiple [...] per tooth.|$|E
500|$|Nepenthes rajah {{has evolved}} a mutualistic {{relationship}} with mountain <b>treeshrews</b> (Tupaia montana) {{in order to}} collect their droppings. [...] The inside of the reflexed lid exudes a sweet nectar. The distance from the pitcher mouth to the exudate {{is the same as}} the average body length of the mountain treeshrew. [...] These proportions also hold true for N.lowii and N.macrophylla. [...] As it feeds, the treeshrew defecates, apparently as a method of marking its feeding territory. [...] It is thought that in exchange for providing nectar, the faeces provide N.rajah with the majority of the nitrogen it requires. In N.lowii, N.macrophylla and N.rajah, the colour of the lower lid surface corresponds to visual sensitivity maxima of the mountain treeshrew in the green and blue wavebands, making the lid underside stand out against adjacent parts of the pitcher. Of the three species, N.rajah shows the tightest 'fit', particularly in the green waveband.|$|E
