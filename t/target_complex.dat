Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid base sequence to each of a structure's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation. Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy, and is thus the most thermodynamically favorable, while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored. This is done either through simple, faster heuristic methods such as sequence symmetry minimization, or by using a full nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model, which is more accurate but slower and more computationally intensive. Geometric models are used to examine tertiary structure of the nanostructures and to ensure that the complexes are not overly strained.|$|E

Here, we show that the complex members MIP 18 and CIAO 1 associate with the C terminus of MMS 19. By doing so, they form a docking site for Fe-S proteins that is disrupted in the absence of either MMS 19 or MIP 18. The Fe-S helicase XPD seems to be the only exception, since it can interact with MMS 19 independently of MIP 18 and CIAO 1. We further show that the direct interaction between MMS 19 and MIP 18 is required to protect MIP 18 from proteasomal degradation.

Truman Community College - Deborah Perlstein group, Amanda Vo lab mentorIron sulfurs {{play an important}} role in many biological functions such as: DNA replication, and repair, amino acid metabolism, and respiration. In yeast, the 4 Fe- 4 S cluster needed by proteins located in the nucleus and in the cytosol are assembled and inserted by the Cytosolic Iron Sulfur Cluster Assembly (CIA) pathway. These clusters are assembled by the scaffold and sent to inactive Apo proteins (without clusters) by the <b>targeting</b> <b>complex.</b> In the cytosol, there is a three protein complex called the CIA <b>targeting</b> <b>complex</b> that identifies apo-targets in order to assemble them to their cofactor. This <b>targeting</b> <b>complex</b> comprised of the protein Cia 1, Cia 2, and met 18 which are yeast proteins. However, the mechanism by which this occurs has not been established. One thing that has limited our ability to understand apo-enzyme recognitions has been problems that has to do with purification of the individual components of the CIA <b>targeting</b> <b>complex.</b> Previous work has shown that purification of Met 18 is challenging due to purification of many undesired truncated products. To optimize purification of the full length protein, I designed a construct with a C-terminal Strep tag. Another challenge faced is the weak and dynamic interaction that exists between the CIA targeting components and apo-proteins. To stabilize these interactions so they can be characterized, I developed a method to covalently crosslink Cia 1 to Cia 2 The pure full length Met 18 was purified using the new construct that was purified using the new construct, and using a streptavidin affinity resin. Also, the mixture of both Cia 1 and Cia 2 formed what looks like a dimer and a monomer. Cia 2 alone also crosslinked, while Cia 1 alone did not have any crosslinked product which was what we expected because of the prior knowledge we have about how they exist. Now with sufficient amounts of each component of the <b>targeting</b> <b>complex</b> at our disposal, the interactions between these proteins can now be defined, and to help with biochemical characterization, crosslinking Cia 1 and Cia 2 using DSS crosslinker shows that the dynamic interactions that exists between the trafficking complex components can be stabilized using DSS crosslinker.

Using biochemical and biophysical methods, here we show that anionic phospholipids activate the cpSRP receptor cpFtsY to promote rapid and stable cpSRP 54 ·cpFtsY complex assembly. Furthermore, the stromal domain of the Alb 3 translocase binds with high affinity to and regulates GTP hydrolysis in the cpSRP 54 ·cpFtsY complex, suggesting that cpFtsY is primarily responsible for initial recruitment of the <b>targeting</b> <b>complex</b> to Alb 3.

40|$|Signal {{recognition}} particle (SRP) and {{signal recognition}} particle receptor (SR) are evolutionarily conserved GTPases that deliver secretory and membrane proteins to the protein-conducting channel Sec 61 {{complex in the}} lipid bilayer of the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes or the SecYEG complex in the inner membrane of bacteria. Unlike the canonical Ras-type GTPases, SRP and SR are activated via nucleotide-dependent heterodimerization. Upon formation of the SR•SRP <b>targeting</b> <b>complex,</b> SRP and SR undergo a series of discrete conformational changes that culminate in their reciprocal activation and hydrolysis of GTP. How the SR•SRP GTPase cycle is regulated and coupled to the delivery of the cargo protein to the protein-conducting channel at the target membrane is not well-understood. Here we examine {{the role of the}} lipid bilayer and SecYEG in regulation of the SRP-mediated protein targeting pathway and show that they serve as important biological cues that spatially control the targeting reaction. In the first chapter, we show that anionic phospholipids of the inner membrane activate the bacterial SR, FtsY, and favor the late conformational states of the <b>targeting</b> <b>complex</b> conducive to efficient unloading of the cargo. The results of our studies suggest that the lipid bilayer acts as a spatial cue that weakens the interaction of the cargo protein with SRP and primes the complex for unloading its cargo onto SecYEG. In the second chapter, we focus on the effect of SecYEG on the conformational states and activity of the <b>targeting</b> <b>complex.</b> While phospholipids prime the complex for unloading its cargo, they are insufficient to trigger hydrolysis of GTP and the release of the cargo from the complex. SecYEG modulates the conformation of the <b>targeting</b> <b>complex</b> and triggers the GTP hydrolysis from the complex, thus driving the targeting reaction to completion. The {{results of this study suggest}} that SecYEG is not a passive recipient of the cargo protein; rather, it actively releases the cargo from the <b>targeting</b> <b>complex.</b> Together, anionic phospholipids and SecYEG serve distinct yet complementary roles. They spatially control the targeting reaction in a sequential manner, ensuring efficient delivery and unloading of the cargo protein. In the third chapter, we reconstitute the transfer reaction in vitro and visualize it in real time. We show that the ribosome-nascent chain complex is transferred to SecYEG via a stepwise mechanism with gradual dissolution and formation of the contacts with SRP and SecYEG, respectively, explaining how the cargo is kept tethered to the membrane during the transfer and how its loss to the cytosol is avoided. In the fourth chapter, we examine interaction of SecYEG with secretory and membrane proteins and attempt to address the role of a novel insertase YidC in this interaction. We show that detergent-solubilized SecYEG is capable of discriminating between the nascent chains of various lengths and engages a signal sequence in a well-defined conformation in the absence of accessory factors. Further, YidC alters the conformation of the signal peptide bound to SecYEG. The results described in this chapter show that YidC affects the SecYEG-nascent chain interaction at early stages of translocation/insertion and suggest a YidC-facilitated mechanism for lateral exit of transmembrane domains from SecYEG into the lipid bilayer. ...|$|R
