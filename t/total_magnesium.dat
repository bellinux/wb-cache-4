Ionised magnesium was measured by Microlyte 6 (KONE, Espoo, Finland) and <b>total</b> <b>magnesium</b> by atomic absorption spectrometry. In renal insufficiency ionised and <b>total</b> <b>magnesium</b> concentrations were almost equally increased. In proteinuria with a normal glomerular filtration rate, "pseudohypomagnesaemia " was observed, i. e. decreased <b>total</b> <b>magnesium</b> concentration in parallel with a decreased albumin concentration with no significant change in the concentration of ionised magnesium. Hypermagnesaemia occurred in liver diseases combined with renal insufficiency, whereas "pseudohypomagnesae-mia " was most often found in the absence of renal failure. Also treatment with an aldosterone antagonist was associated with a normal ionised magnesium concentration, but the <b>total</b> <b>magnesium</b> concentration was decreased; when additional magnesium was administered, the <b>total</b> <b>magnesium</b> concentration approached a normal value, while ionised magnesium slightly exceeded reference values. Only during cyclosporin treatment did both ionised and <b>total</b> <b>magnesium</b> concentrations become lowered.

Accordingly, we have examined the inter{{relationship between}} <b>total</b> <b>magnesium</b> and ionic magnesium, as well as ionic calcium to ionic magnesium ratio, in 286 patients made up of indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, with or without diabetes. Significant correlations were noted between total and ionic magnesium in all groups (p < 0. 001). Amongst people with diabetes, the correlation coefficient (r) was 0. 81 whereas in non-diabetics, the r was 0. 66. This relationship was independent of whether the sample was from indigenous (r = 0. 71) or non-indigenous (r = 0. 81) participants. Overall the correlation between total and ionic magnesium across all participants was 0. 75. There was no correlation between serum <b>total</b> <b>magnesium</b> and serum ionic calcium (r = 0. 07), and similarly none between serum ionic magnesium and serum ionic calcium (r = 0. 26).
