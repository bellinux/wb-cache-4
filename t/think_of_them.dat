25|$|In addition, {{there are}} a number of earlier towers in Guernsey (the Guernsey {{loophole}} towers), that many people refer to as Martello towers, though they are not Martellos. They were built in the late 18th century, i.e., before the Martellos, and differ from them in a number of ways. One may <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as precursors, like the Genoese towers they resemble.|$|E

In addition, and given their mass, they may be used as a lithic core to obtain flakes that could be used as knives or transformed for specialized uses through retouching.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, Aaron Gillego, a {{columnist}} for The Advocate, criticized the series for having never cast an Asian man in the then-13 years of its existence, opining that Asian women have been cast on the show because heterosexual men have been socialized by the media to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as exotic beauties or sex objects, but that Asian men have been largely invisible in popular media. As of 2017, an Asian man has never been cast in the 25 years of the show's existence.|$|E

25|$|Dewey {{believed}} that a woman’s place in society was determined by her environment and not just her biology. On women he says, “You think too much of women in terms of sex. <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won’t be so sure of some of your generalizations about what they should and shouldn’t do”. John Dewey’s support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams’ Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew {{as well as the}} support for the women’s suffrage movement.|$|E

25|$|Since Charles Darwin, the {{willingness}} of some humans to sacrifice themselves for genetically unrelated {{members of the same}} large, diffuse group (such as a religion or a nation) has raised a theoretical challenge. Social psychological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are motivated by commitment to the larger collective whereas anthropological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are triggered by commitment to other members of the group. The distinction between local and extended fusion provides an explanation for these apparently competing explanations. Local fusion is proposed to occur in relatively small, homogeneous groups whose members attach to each other through direct personal contact (e.g., families or work teams). In contrast, extended fusion occurs in relatively large groups whose members do not all have personal relationships (e.g., political parties or nation states). In extended fusion, even though fused individuals may not actually know all of their fellow group members, they still feel like they know them and even <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as like family.|$|E

Archer then tells Gralik that Degra will use the kemocite to build a weapon, but the Arboreal denies any knowledge of the plan. Back on Enterprise, Commander Tucker also learns that the kemocite {{is the key to}} Reptilian rifle technology. Archer approves his idea to reverse engineer a rifle, but Tucker unknowingly triggers a self-destruct sequence and the weapon is beamed into space. Archer then decides not to destroy the kemocite mining complex as he doesn't want the Xindi to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as aggressors.|$|E

500|$|The {{writers were}} {{selected}} after interviews and script samplings. Among the writers were José Molina, Ben Edlund, Cheryl Cain, Brett Matthews, Drew Z. Greenberg and Jane Espenson. Espenson wrote {{an essay on}} the writing process with Mutant Enemy Productions. [...] A meeting is held and an idea is floated, generally by Whedon, and the writers brainstorm to develop the central theme of the episode and the character development. Next, the writers (except the one working on the previous week's episode) meet in the anteroom to Whedon's office to begin 'breaking' the story into acts and scenes. For the team, {{one of the key}} components to devising acts is deciding where to break for commercial and ensuring the viewer returns. [...] "Finding these moments in the story help give it shape: <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as tentpoles that support the structure". For instance, in [...] "Shindig", the break for commercial occurs when Malcolm Reynolds is gravely injured and losing the duel. [...] "It does not end when Mal turns the fight around, when he stands victorious over his opponent. They're both big moments, but one of them leaves you curious and the other doesn't." ...|$|E

500|$|Elsewhere, barmaid Clara Oswin Oswald investigates a {{disturbance}} outside the tavern she works at and finds the Doctor walking by. He attempts to leave discreetly, but Clara follows {{him to a}} coach. Not wishing {{to become involved in}} matters, the Doctor instructs Strax to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of Clara's memories with just a touch. Before they can do so, they are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group. The Doctor realises that Clara's thoughts are creating the snowmen and ends the threat by instructing her to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> melting. Clara cautions the Doctor that if he wipes her memory, she will forget {{how to deal with the}} snowmen. The Doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to return to the TARDIS. Clara follows him and knocks on the door, but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers. Clara returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain Latimer. She learns that Latimer's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead. Clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess' body is the only thing still frozen around them. She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny, who takes her to see Vastra. Vastra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help. Clara chooses the word [...] "Pond", which shocks the Doctor and arouses his interest.|$|E
500|$|Themes in {{the series}} often revolve around {{forbidden}} love, such as those involving Bluestar and Oakheart, Graystripe and Silverstream, Leafpool and Crowfeather, and Dovewing and Tigerheart. These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats (such as Leafpool), who cannot have mates, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is forbidden by the warrior code. Holmes said that another central theme of the series centres on [...] "faith and spirituality" [...] in StarClan. [...] All books {{in the series}} feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> {{but in terms of}} prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true. [...] Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters. [...] Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in Moonrise. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are [...] "equally valid." [...] This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand. Holmes said that [...] "ignorance is a very scary thing!" [...] Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.|$|E
500|$|Gene Seymour of Newsday {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "And as pop flies go, Cars is pretty to watch, even as it loops, drifts and, at times, looks as if it's just hanging in midair." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "It takes everything that's made Pixar shorthand for animation excellence -- strong characters, tight pacing, spot-on voice casting, a warm sense of humor and visuals that are pure, pixilated bliss -- and carries them to the next stage." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "The truest measure of the movie is that eventually we forget we're watching a bunch of vehicles with faces and start to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as individual characters. It's quite an accomplishment, and perhaps one only possible by Pixar." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "What's surprising about this supremely engaging film is the source of its curb appeal: It has heart." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's the latest concoction from the geniuses at Pixar, probably the most inventive of the Computer Generated Imagery shop -- and the film's great fun, if well under the level of the first Toy Story." [...] Jessica Reaves of the Chicago Tribune gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four, saying [...] "While it's a technically perfect movie, its tone is too manic, its characters too jaded and, in the end, its story too empty to stand up to expectations." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "While Cars may cross the finish line ahead of any of 2006's other animated films, it's several laps behind its Pixar siblings." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing in the {{academic}} journal Rhizomes, scholar Martin Hall, while analyzing the movie, discusses the self-perception an individual develops based on the views of those outside of themselves. The academician notes that when a child first comprehends the function of a mirror, they begin to develop the understanding that their perception of themselves is not self-contained, and learn partly they are what they see in the mirror. He contrasts this to when Anderton discovers the precogs' vision of his future self. At {{the beginning of the}} film, Anderton shows little concern for the precogs; when Witwer feels pity for them, he responds: [...] "It's better if you don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as human." [...] Shortly thereafter, however, Anderton is shown in tears at his home, high on the hard drug neuroin while mourning the loss of his son. Agatha enters a similar period of self-examination when she has visions of her mother's death, and is informed they are merely [...] "echoes" [...] i.e. a faulty image in her memory. Anderton becomes flustered when he begins to interpret the images which show him about to commit murder and begins to frantically sort through, According to Hall he begins [...] "searching for whatever possible versions of this representation are available to him, other than the one that represents him as a murderer." [...] Hall says that he is sorting through the images so feverishly, as he is convinced once they are sorted properly and understood, they will not show him to be the murderer, because he is convinced that he is not a murderer. He literally becomes obsessed with himself, seeking to resolve these images with put him at [...] "discordance with his own reality." [...] Previously, at peace with himself, Hall says Anderton cannot accept the image he sees in the precogs' visions. Unable to reconcile the two, Hall says that he is forced to decide that [...] "it is likely that errors have occurred" [...] in the PreCrime system.|$|E
