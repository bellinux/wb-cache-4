50|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{the risk}} assessment of biocides in EU hinges {{for a large}} part {{by the development of}} specific emission scenario documents (ESDs) for each product type, which is essential for assessing its exposure of man and the environment. Such ESDs provide detailed scenarios to be used for an initial worse case exposure assessment and for subsequent refinements. ESDs are developed in close collaboration with the OECD Task Force on Biocides and the OECD Exposure Assessment Task Force and are publicly available from websites managed by the Joint Research Centre and OECD (see below). Once ESDs become available they are introduced in the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (EUSES), an IT tool supporting the implementation of the risk assessment principles set in the <b>Technical</b> <b>Guidance</b> <b>Document</b> for the Risk Assessment of Biocides (TGD). EUSES enables government authorities, research institutes and chemical companies to carry out rapid and efficient assessments of the general risks posed by substances to man and the environment. Once a biocidal active substance is allowed onto the list of approved active substances, its specifications become a reference source of that active substance (so called 'reference active substance'). Thus, when an alternative source of that active substance appears (e.g. from a company that have not participated in the Review Programme of active substances) or when a change appears in the manufacturing location and/or manufacturing process of a reference active substance, then a technical equivalence between these different sources needs to be established with regard to the chemical composition and hazard profile. This is to check if the level of hazard posed to health and environment by the active substance from the secondary source is comparable to the initial assessed active substance.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to test field {{relevance}} of the prospective methodology for the assessment of environmental risk described in the EU <b>technical</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>document</b> (TGD) [European Commission 2003. <b>Technical</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>document</b> in support of Commission Directive 93 / 67 /EEC on Risk assessment for new notified substances and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488 / 94 on Risk assessment for existing substances and Commission Directive (EC) 98 / 8 on biocides, second ed. European Commission, Luxembourg, Part 1, 2 and 3, 760 pp. ]. To achieve this goal, an environmental risk assessment was performed according to the TGD for two major contaminants, atrazine and diuron, that are present in the Seine River estuary (France) and listed in the EU Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000 / 60 /CE). Results showed that atrazine presented a source of risk in the upper- and mid-estuary throughout the 1993 and 1996 spring seasons. Diuron introduced a risk into the same areas throughout spring periods of 1993 - 2005. Results are discussed and some suggestions for a more realistic in situ risk assessment are given. For the computation of a more relevant PNEC for pesticides, their specific mode of action should be taken into consideration as well as ecotoxicological data on species endemic to the considered area...|$|E
30|$|The <b>Technical</b> <b>Guidance</b> <b>Document</b> (TGD) on Risk Assessment [26] added a {{new chapter}} on marine risk assessment, which also {{contains}} a subchapter on PBT assessment. Consequently, only criteria for water systems (fresh and marine waters and sediments) were defined (Table  1) in 2003, but not for soil. The numerical values for marine water (60  days) and sediment (180  days) {{as well as those}} for vP assessment are identical with those of international agreements, but for those fresh water (40  days) and fresh water sediment (120  days) are smaller. European outdoor temperature was not taken into consideration when defining the criteria.|$|E
30|$|For {{the future}} {{application}} of the ecotoxicological assessment system in water management practice, {{it has to be}} decided how the status classes for water and sediment should be combined so that only one status class results per sampling site. We recommend applying the worst-case principle (“one-out, all-out principle”) according to the EU-WFD [3], i.e., the worst assessed component determines the general status class, which is in line with the precautionary principle and the principles of risk assessment for industrial chemicals according to the European <b>Technical</b> <b>Guidance</b> <b>Document</b> (TGD) [62]. Hence, a single ecotoxicological status class would result, allowing a simplified comparison with the ecological status class under the EU-WFD.|$|E

40|$|This <b>Technical</b> <b>Guidance</b> <b>Document</b> on Biota Monitoring (the Implementation of EQSbiota) aims to {{facilitate}} the implementation of environmental quality standards (EQS) in biota under the Water Framework Directive by addressing in particular the sampling strategies appropriate for monitoring programmes designed to assess compliance with biota EQS. It is Guidance Document No. 32 in the series of guidance documents prepared to support the Common Implementation Strategy (CIS) for the Water Framework Directive. It elaborates extensively {{on the content of}} Guidance Document No. 25 on Chemical Monitoring in Sediment and Biota under the Water Framework Directive, and is complemented by Guidance Document No. 33, the <b>Technical</b> <b>Guidance</b> <b>Document</b> on Analytical Methods for Biota Monitoring. Guidance Documents 32 and 33 together address the requirement for guidance on biota monitoring mentioned in Article 3 (8 a) of Directive 2008 / 105 /EC as amended by Directive 2013 / 39 /EU. The original Directive 2008 / 105 /EC included biota standards for mercury, hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorobutadiene. In Directive 2013 / 39 /EU, biota EQS were introduced for three other existing priority substances (fluoranthene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and brominated diphenylethers), and set for four new priority substances (dicofol, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and its derivatives, hexabromocyclododecane, and heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide). This guidance document takes into account the fact that trend monitoring in sediment and/or biota is required for several other priority substances as specified in Article 3 (6), and indicates how trend monitoring data can be used to check compliance with biota EQS, but does not elaborate on trend monitoring as such. This document constitutes guidance and Member States are therefore not legally required to follow the recommendations contained in it. Member States are, however, required to use methods compliant with the requirements of the Environmental Quality Standards Directive 2008 / 105 /EC and the Quality Assurance/Quality Control Directive 2009 / 90 /EC...|$|E
