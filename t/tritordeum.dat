40|$|Abstract Background The {{wild barley}} Hordeum chilense {{fulfills}} some requirements {{for being a}} useful tool to investigate the endosperm yellow pigment content (YPC) in the Triticeae including its diploid constitution, the availability of genetic resources (addition and deletion stocks and a high density genetic map) and, especially, its high seed YPC not silenced in <b>tritordeums</b> (amphiploids derived from H. chilense and wheat). Thus, {{the aim of this}} work was to test the utility of the H. chilense genome for investigating the YPC in the Triticeae. Results Twelve genes related to endosperm carotenoid content and/or YPC in grasses (Dxr, Hdr [synonym ispH], Ggpps 1, Psy 2, Psy 3, Pds, Zds, e - Lcy, b - Lcy, Hyd 3, Ccd 1 and Ppo 1) were identified, and mapped in H. chilense using rice genes to identify orthologs from barley, wheat, sorghum and maize. Macrocolinearity studies revealed that gene positions were in agreement in H. vulgare and H. chilense. Additionally, three main regions associated with YPC were identified in chromosomes 2 H ch, 3 H ch and 7 H ch in H. chilense, the former being the most significant one. Conclusions The results obtained are consistent with previous findings in wheat and suggest that Ggpps 1, Zds and Hyd 3 on chromosome 2 H ch may be considered candidate genes in wheat for further studies in YPC improvement. Considering the syntenic location of carotenoid genes in H. chilense, we have concluded that the H ch genome may constitute a valuable tool for YPC studies in the Triticeae. </p...|$|R

The agronomic, morphological, chemical, physico-chemical and rheological characteristics of this new crop, similar to bread wheat, indicate that <b>tritordeum</b> is a promising cereal for agriculture and food processing (2). Moreover, {{there is a huge}} genetic variability available for breeding this new crop {{as a consequence of the}} synthesis of hundreds of different amphiploids, becoming <b>tritordeum</b> a potentially donor of useful traits to wheat. Previous studies (3), carried out in our laboratories, have demonstrated that lutein is the major carotenoide present in <b>tritordeum</b> lines, and at much higher concentration (more than 5 times) than in durum wheat, which suggests a high potential of this crop to become a functional food. In addition, it was found that in the case of <b>tritordeum,</b> lutein shows a characteristic esterification with fatty acids, which is absent or at very low levels in durum wheat grains. In the present study, the effect of storage of grains (temperature and time) on the carotenoid content of three advanced <b>tritordeum</b> lines and three commercial durum wheat varieties has been investigated.

40|$|The species × {{location}} {{interaction was}} {{of great importance}} in explaining the behaviour of genetic material. The study presented here shows, for the first time, the performance, under field conditions of the new <b>tritordeum</b> species, compared to wheat and triticale {{in a wide range}} of Mediterranean countries (Spain, Lebanon and Tunisia). The results obtained revealed that despite the diversity of environmental conditions, the main differences in yield were due to genotypes, especially to differences between species. The multi-local study with different growth conditions revealed important information about the water availability effect on yield. In the lowest yielding environments (Tunisia rainfed), <b>Tritordeum</b> and triticale yields were equivalent. However under better growth conditions (Spain), <b>tritordeum</b> yield was shown to be lower than wheat and triticale. Interestingly, when water limitation was extended during the pre-anthesis period, differences in <b>tritordeum</b> versus wheat-triticale yield rate were larger than when water stress occurred during anthesis. These variations were explained by the fact that kernel weight has been found as the limiting factor for yield determination in <b>tritordeum,</b> and a delay in the anthesis date may have been the cause for the low kernel weight and low yield under Mediterranean drought conditions. Such differences in yield between <b>tritordeum</b> and wheat or triticale could be explained by the fact that <b>tritordeum</b> is a relatively new species and far fewer resources have been devoted to its improvement when compared to wheat and triticale. Our results suggest that breeding efforts should be directed to an earlier anthesis date and a longer grain filling period. <b>Tritordeum</b> proved to have possibilities to be grown under drought environments as a new crop, since its performance was quite close to wheat and triticale. Besides, it has qualitative added values that may improve farmers’ income per unit land. This work was funded by CICYT project AGL 2005 - 07257 -C 04.

Among the antioxidant compounds, phenolic acids have great potential to improve human health. In this paper we evaluate the effect of environmental and genetic factors on the phenolic content in the grain of a collection of tritordeums with different cytoplasm and chromosome substitutions. To this purpose, <b>tritordeum</b> flour was used for extraction of the free, conjugates and bound phenolic compounds. These phenolic compounds were identified and quantified by RP-HPLC and the results were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods.

These markers {{have been used for}} evolutionary studies, genetic diversity assessment, DNA fingerprinting, and detection of genetic rearrangements induced by allopolyploidization. The hexaploid <b>tritordeum</b> (HchHchAABB; 2 n = 6 x = 42) is an allopolyploid produced from crosses between wild barley (Hordeum chilense Roem. et Schultz.) (HchHch; 2 n = 2 x = 14) and durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. conv. durum) (AABB; 2 n = 4 x = 28). With this study, we carried out the DNA fingerprinting of two newly formed hexaploid <b>tritordeum</b> lines (HT 22 and HT 27) and their respective parents, line H 1 of H. chilense and line T 81 of durum wheat, based on IRAPs, REMAPs and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs), in order to detect potential rearrangements in <b>tritordeum</b> derived from polyploidization. The amphiploid nature of the HT 22 and HT 27 individuals was successfully confirmed after fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which was performed on their mitotic chromosome spreads with genomic DNA from H. chilense and 45 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), simultaneously, as probes. Six combinations of LTR (long terminal repeat) primers and seven combinations of one LTR and one SSR (simple sequence repeat) primers successfully produced IRAPs and REMAPs, respectively, in both <b>tritordeum</b> lines, and their respective parents. ISSRs were produced with three SSR primers (8081, 8082, and 8564). The analysis of the presence/absence of bands among the <b>tritordeum</b> lines and the respective parents allowed the detection of polymorphic bands: (1) shared by <b>tritordeum</b> and one of the parents; (2) exclusively amplified in tritordeum; and (3) exclusively present in one of the parents. Once no polymorphism was detected among the individuals of each parental species, the polymorphic bands that fit into the second and third cases probably constituted rearrangements in the newly formed tritordeums that arose in response to allopolyploidization, which resulted from the loss of parental bands or, conversely, from the appearance of novel bands not seen in the parental species. Most of the polymorphic IRAPs in <b>tritordeum</b> were shared with the female parent (H. chilense), while most of the polymorphic REMAPs and ISSRs were common to the male parent (durum wheat), but globally, most of the bands inherited by <b>tritordeum</b> had a wheat origin.

In this paper we describe resistance in H. chilense to tan spot disease, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Died.) Drechs. Twenty-two <b>tritordeum</b> lines together with their wheat and H. chilense parents were inoculated with three different races of P. tritici-repentis.

We conducted simultaneous double labelling (12 CO 2 and 15 NH 415 NO 3) in order to characterise C and N partitioning during grain filling. Although triticale plants showed the largest total and ear dry matter values in HN conditions, the large investment in shoot and root biomass negatively affected ear NUE. <b>Tritordeum</b> was the only genotype that increased NUE in both N treatments (NUEtotal), whereas in wheat, no significant effect was detected. N labelling revealed that N fertilisation during post-anthesis was more relevant for wheat and <b>tritordeum</b> grain filling than for triticale. The study also revealed that the investments of C and N in flag leaves and shoots, together with the"waste" of photoassimilates in respiration, conditioned the NUE of plants, and especially under LN. These results suggest that C and N use by these plants needs to be improved in order to increase ear C and N sinks, especially under LN.

Hexaploid <b>tritordeum</b> (×Tritordeum Ascherson et Graebner, 2 n= 6 ×= 42, AABBHchHch) is the fertile amphiploid obtained after chromosome doubling of hybrids between Hordeum chilense and durum wheat. Approaches used in the improvement of this crop have included crosses with hexaploid wheat to promote D/Hch chromosome substitutions. While this approach has been successful as was the case with triticale, it has also complicated the genetic composition of the breeding materials. Until now <b>tritordeum</b> lines were analyzed based on molecular cytogenetic techniques and screening with a small set of DNA markers. However, the recent development of DArT markers in H. chilense offers new possibilities to screen large number of accessions more efficiently. Results Here, we have applied DArT markers to genotype composition in forty-six accessions of hexaploid <b>tritordeum</b> originating from different stages of <b>tritordeum</b> breeding program and to H. chilense-wheat chromosome addition lines to allow their physical mapping. Diversity analyses were conducted including dendrogram construction, principal component analysis and structure inference. Euploid and substituted tritordeums were clearly discriminated independently of the method used. However, dendrogram and Structure analyses allowed the clearest discrimination among substituted tritordeums. The physically mapped markers allowed identifying these groups as substituted tritordeums carrying the following disomic substitutions (DS) : DS 1 D (1 Hch), DS 2 D (2 Hch), DS 5 D (5 Hch), DS 6 D (6 Hch) and the double substitution DS 2 D (2 Hch), DS 5 D (5 Hch). These results were validated using chromosome specific EST and SSR markers and GISH analysis. Conclusion In conclusion, DArT markers have proved to be very useful to detect chromosome substitutions in the <b>tritordeum</b> breeding program and thus they are expected to be equally useful to detect translocations both in the <b>tritordeum</b> breeding program and in the transference of H. chilense genetic material in wheat breeding programs.

Therefore, in this work we characterized and mapped PPO sequences including the orthologous PPO 1 and PPO 2 genes in H. chilense as well as other PPO-like sequences in 3 HchL and 4 HchL. The first evaluation of PPO activity in a collection of <b>tritordeum</b> is also reported.

Microscopic examination of host-cell responses to B. graminis revealed that resistance in H. chilense and amphiploids was attributable to two major factors: (i) a significant reduction in successful fungal penetration by rapid deposition of papillae in the host epidermal cell wall and (ii) a significant increase in frequency of death of penetrated epidermal cells. Papillae formation was associated with localized autofluorescence in host epidermal cells. Cell death prevented further fungal growth and differentiation for the establishment of biotrophy. Tritordeums showed both forms of resistance when tested with Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei and Blumeria graminis f. sp. avenae. The <b>tritordeum</b> and agroticum amphiploids may offer novel sources {{of resistance to}} powdery mildew. They could be used either directly or as a bridge in genetic crosses to introgress resistance to powdery mildew into elite wheat breeding lines. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Toxic Cu 2 + concentrations in the medium resulted in an increase of the variation coefficient for the studied parameters which was more distinctly expressed in the hexaploid tritordeums. The octoploid <b>tritordeum</b> HT 73 demonstrated greater tolerance to the heavy metal based on the changes in the weight and length of the above-ground parts of the plants.

40|$|Hordeum chilense Roem. et Schult. is a South American {{wild barley}} that occurs {{exclusively}} in Chile and Argentina, {{where it is}} a component of natural pastures. This species has been crossed with durum and bread wheats to obtain a new amphiploid, called <b>tritordeum,</b> which presents agronomic traits of a new crop. Two groups represented by H 1 and H 7 lines have shown differences for spike length and density, number of spikelets per spike and various other characters which are interesting for <b>tritordeum</b> improvement. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate inheritance of these three characters in a cross between H 1 and H 7 lines, including parents, F 1 and F 2 generations. The three characters studied fitted the additive model. The dominance effects were less strong than the additive effects, indicating partial dominance of positive sign for number of spikelets per spike; whereas spike length displayed small dominance effects of negative sign and the spike density showed intermediate inheritance, with the inheritance being almost exclusively additive. © 2010 Akadémiai Kiadó.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effects of long-term storage on the carotenoid pigments present in whole-grain flours prepared from durum wheat and <b>tritordeum.</b> As expected, higher storage temperatures showed a catabolic effect, which was very marked for free carotenoid pigments. Surprisingly, for both cereal genotypes, the thermal conditions favoured the synthesis of lutein esters, leading to an enhanced stability, slower degradation, and, subsequently, a greater carotenoid retention. The putative involvement of lipase enzymes in lutein esterification in flours is discussed, particularly regarding the preferential esterification of the hydroxyl group with linoleic acid at the 3 ′ in the ε-ring of the lutein molecule. The negative effects of processing on carotenoid retention were less pronounced in durum wheat flours, which {{could be due to}} an increased esterifying activity (the de novo formation of diesterified xanthophylls was observed). Moreover, clear differences were observed for <b>tritordeum</b> depending on whether the lutein was in a free or esterified state. For instance, lutein- 3 ′- O -monolinoleate showed a three-fold lower degradation rate than free lutein at 37 °C. In view of our results, we advise that the biofortification research aimed at increasing the carotenoid contents in cereals should be based on the selection of varieties with an enhanced content of esterified xanthophylls...|$|E

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al Annual Congress of Biotechnology (BAC), celebrado del 8 al 10 de julio de 2015 en Salamanca (España). Sourdough is {{a mixture}} of flour, water and {{communities}} of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. The flour type, temperature and refreshment timing influence the final microbiota of mature sourdoughs, which provides specific organoleptic and structural properties to artisan baking goods. To satisfy the current demand of increasing the genetic diversity and repertory of baker's yeast available, we isolated and identified 50 autochthonous yeasts from 7 sourdoughs of wheat, rye or <b>Tritordeum</b> flours, 33 of the genus Saccharomyces (S. cerevisiae and S. kunashirensis) and 17 of 8 different genera (Candida, Cryptococcus, Filobasidium, Pichia, Sporobolomyces, Rhodosporidium, Torulaspora and Zygosaccharomyces). We quantified 3 physiological traits: (i) dough leavening capacity on wheat and <b>Tritordeum</b> flours, (ii) CO 2 production and (iii) maltase activity. In general, S. cerevisiae strains produce equal or higher CO 2 levels and display similar maltase activity than commercial baker's yeasts of reference. Conversely, S. kunashirensis strains are particularly efficient in sweet dough fermentation, but their maltase activity is undetectable. Yeasts from the other genera exhibit low values for the traits analysed, but some may provide desirable metabolites or organoleptic properties to sourdoughs. In order to formulate innovative starters for the bakery industry, we carry out collaborative research to test the behavior of a set of yeasts in technologically innovative fermentation processes {{and the quality of the}} corresponding baking goods.

40|$|Hordeum chilense is a South American {{wild barley}} with high {{potential}} for cereal breeding given its high crossability {{with other members}} of the Triticeae. In the present paper we consider the resistance of H. chilense to several fungal diseases and the prospects for its transference to cultivated cereals. All H. chilense accessions studied are resistant to the barley, wheat and rye brown rusts, the powdery mildews of wheat, barley, rye and oat, to Septoria leaf blotch, common bunt and to loose smuts, which suggests that H. chilense is a non-host of these diseases. There are also lines resistant to wheat and barley yellow rust, stem rust and to Agropyron leaf rust, as well as lines giving moderate levels of resistance to Septoria glume blotch, tan spot and Fusarium head blight. Some H. chilense lines display pre-appressorial avoidance to brown rust. Lines differ in the degree of haustorium formation by rust and mildew fungi they permit, and in the degree to which a hypersensitive response occurs after haustoria are formed. Unfortunately, resistance of H. chilense to rust fungi is not expressed in <b>tritordeum</b> hybrids, nor in chromosome addition lines in wheat. In <b>tritordeum,</b> H. chilense contributes quantitative resistance to wheat powdery mildew, tan spot and loose smut. The resistance to mildew, expressed as a reduced disease severity, is not associated with macroscopically visible necrosis. Hexaploid tritordeums are immune to Septoria leaf blotch and to common bunt although resistance to both is slightly diluted in octoploid tritordeums.

40|$|Abstract Background The APETALA 2 -like genes form a large multi-gene {{family of}} {{transcription}} factors which {{play an important}} role during the plant life cycle, being key regulators of many developmental processes. Many studies in Arabidopsis have revealed that the APETALA 2 (AP 2) gene is implicated in the establishment of floral meristem and floral organ identity as well as temporal and spatial regulation of flower homeotic gene expression. Results In this work, we have cloned and characterised the AP 2 -like gene from accessions of Hordeum chilense and Hordeum vulgare, wild and domesticated barley, respectively, and compared with other AP 2 homoeologous genes, including the Q gene in wheat. The Hordeum AP 2 -like genes contain two plant-specific DNA binding motifs called AP 2 domains, as does the Q gene of wheat. We confirm that the H. chilense AP 2 -like gene is located on chromosome 5 H ch. Patterns of expression of the AP 2 -like genes were examined in floral organs and other tissues in barley, wheat and in <b>tritordeum</b> amphiploids (barley × wheat hybrids). In <b>tritordeum</b> amphiploids, the level of transcription of the barley AP 2 -like gene was lower than in its barley parental and the chromosome substitutions 1 D/ 1 H ch and 2 D/ 2 H ch were seen to modify AP 2 gene expression levels. Conclusion The results are of interest {{in order to understand the}} role of the AP 2 -like gene in the spike morphology of barley and wheat, and to understand the regulation of this gene in the amphiploids obtained from barley-wheat crossing. This information may have application in cereal breeding programs to up- or down-regulate the expression of AP 2 -like genes in order to modify spike characteristics and to obtain free-threshing plants. </p...|$|E
40|$|As an {{approach}} to isolate novel cereal promoters, promoterless uidA constructs and particle bombardment were used to transform <b>tritordeum.</b> Five of eight transgenic lines containing uidA sequences showed evidence of promoter tagging. Expression of uidA was detected in four lines as: constitutive expression, expression in short cells of the epidermis of the spikelets, expression in pollen grains and in cells of the epidermis of the spikelet, and expression in anther primordia and pollen grains. In the fifth line, the uidA was shown by RT-PCR to be transcribed, but no GUS activity was detected. The different patterns of uidA expression indicate that different regulatory sequences were tagged {{in each of these}} lines. Analysis of the progeny resulting from self-fertilisation of the primary tagged plants, indicate that the transgenes integrated at one or two loci and the patterns of expression were stably inherited. To our knowledge, this is the first report of promoter tagging in cereals by direct gene transfer. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The high {{carotenoid}} {{content in}} <b>tritordeum</b> (×Tritordeum Ascherson et Graebner) grains {{is derived from}} its wild parent, Hordeum chilense Roem. et Schulz. Phytoene synthase 1 (Psy 1) is located on chromosome 7 HchS and {{plays a major role}} in this trait. This study investigates the impact of the introgression of chromosome 7 Hch into common wheat background on carotenoid composition, including xanthophylls esterified with fatty acids (monoesters and diesters). All of the genetic stocks carrying Psy 1 from H. chilense increased their carotenoid content relative to common wheat. In addition, significant changes in the carotenoid profile were detected in different genetic stocks. The most relevant was the increase in content of lutein diesters when both 7 Hch and 7 D were present, which indicates the existence of genes involved in the esterification of xanthophylls in both chromosomes. Furthermore, our results suggest that 7 Hch genes preferentially esterify lutein with palmitic acid, whereas 7 D is either indifferent to the fatty acid or it prefers linoleic acid for lutein esterification. The involvement and complementarity of 7 Hch and 7 D are highly significant considering the scarcity of previous results on lutein esterification in wheat. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

Knowledge of the genetic structure and the level of H. chilense genetic diversity within its distribution zone may be important to decide on breeding strategies as well as management procedures. The pattern of genetic variation within and among different regions of the distribution area of H. chilense, was analysed by endosperm storage proteins (gliadin and low-molecularweight glutenin subunits). Several analyses were performed including AMOVA, direct correlation between phenotypic and geographic distance matrices and spatial genetics differentiation. Most genetic diversity was caused by differences among individuals within a population, although all the analyses performed suggest the existence of a low degree of differentiation within regions. Correlation values between phenotypic and geographic distances were low but significant. The spatial genetics analysis revealed that the average phenotypic distances of each of the spatial distance class were not lower (or higher) than that expected by chance. These results are explained by their neutral behaviour towards a selection of endosperm storage proteins and could be very useful in optimising future sample collecting strategies.

40|$|In situ {{hybridization}} with cloned, repetitive DNA probes {{and total}} genomic DNA enables the parental origin of all chromosomes {{to be established}} in metaphases of triticale x <b>tritordeum</b> F, hybrids (2 n = 6 x = 42). Nuclei contain seven chromosomes of Hordeum chilense origin, seven from Secale cereale and 28 of wheat origin. When used as a probe, total genomic rye DNA labelled the rye chromosomes strongly and uniformly along their lengths, with brighter regions coincident with the terminal heterochromatin. The probe labelled the wheat-origin chromosomes weakly and was almost undetectable on the H. chilense-orig'm chromosomes. In contrast, under the same conditions, H. chilense DNA hybridized strongly to the H. chilense- and, with intermediate strength, to the S. cerea/e-origin chromo-somes, excluding the subtelomeric heterochromatin: it hybridized only weakly to the wheat chromosomes, in some experiments revealing characteristic bands on wheat chromosomes. Cloned repetitive DNA probes from rye and H. chilense were used as probes to identify the linkage groups of all of their own-species chromosomes. Analysis of hybridization patterns of various probes to prophase and interphase nuclei indi-cated {{that there are many}} non-random features in the localization of both repetitive DNA and whole chromo-somes, although general patterns of nuclear organiza-tion have yet to emerge.

40|$|The morphological, yield, cytological and {{molecular}} characteristics of bread wheat × <b>tritordeum</b> F 1 hybrids (2 n = 6 x = 42; AABBDHch) {{and their parents}} were analysed. Morphologically, these hybrids resembled the wheat parent. They were slightly bigger than both parents, had more spikelets per spike, and tillered more profusely. The hybrids are self-fertile but a reduction of average values of yield parameters was observed. For the cytological approach we used a double-target {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} performed with total genomic DNA from Hordeum chilense L. and the ribosomal sequence pTa 71. This technique allowed us to confirm the hybrid nature and to analyse chromosome pairing in this material. Our results showed that the expected complete homologous pairing (14 bivalents plus 14 univalents) was only observed in 9. 59 % of the pollen mother cells (PMCs) analysed. Some PMCs presented autosyndetic pairing of Hch and A, B or D chromosomes. The average number of univalents was higher in the wheat genome (6. 8) than in the Hch genome (5. 4). The maximum number of univalents per PMC was 20. We only observed wheat multivalents (one per PMC) but the frequency of trivalents (0. 08) was higher than that of quadrivalents (0. 058). We amplified 50 RAPD bands polymorphic between the F 1 hybrid and one of its parents, and 31 ISSR polymorphic bands. Both sets of markers proved to be reliable for DNA fingerprinting.

Over 11, 000 DArT clones were obtained using two complexity reduction methods. A subset of 2, 209 DArT markers was identified on the arrays containing these clones as polymorphic between parents and segregating in a population of 92 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) developed from the cross between H. chilense accessions H 1 and H 7. Using the segregation data a high-density map of 1, 503 cM was constructed with average inter-bin density of 2. 33 cM. A subset of DArT markers was also mapped physically using a set of wheat-H. chilense chromosome addition lines. It allowed the unambiguous assignment of linkage groups to chromosomes. Four segregation distortion regions (SDRs) {{were found on the}} chromosomes 2 H(ch), 3 H(ch) and 5 H(ch) in agreement with previous findings in barley. The new map improves the genome coverage of previous H. chilense maps. H. chilense-derived DArT markers will enable further genetic studies in ongoing projects on hybrid wheat, seed carotenoid content improvement or <b>tritordeum</b> breeding program.
