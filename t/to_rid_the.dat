5|$|Spiders {{have been}} the focus of stories and mythologies of various {{cultures}} for centuries. They have symbolized patience due to their hunting technique of setting webs and waiting for prey, as well as mischief and malice due to their venomous bites. The Italian tarantella is a dance <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> young woman of the lustful effects of a spider bite.|$|E
5|$|The now {{available}} evidence supports {{the conclusion that}} the system of political abuse of psychiatry was carefully designed by the KGB <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> USSR of undesirable elements. According to several available documents and a message by a former general of the Fifth (dissident) Directorate of the Ukrainian KGB to Robert van Voren, political abuse of psychiatry as a systematic method of repression was developed by Yuri Andropov along with a selected group of associates.|$|E

5|$|Two {{months before}} the war's end, on 7 March 1945, when the Allied armies crossed the Rhine and entered German territory, Friedrich Kellner tried {{to explain why the}} German people {{themselves}} had not rebelled against Nazi rule, why it was necessary for outside forces <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> Germans of the tyrannical government they themselves had voted into power.|$|E

Back home in Seattle, Black refuses to sell his own home, telling his wife that they will move back into it together when their problems are resolved.|$|E
5|$|Cather {{discussed}} her authorship {{privately with}} her father and friends, but otherwise said {{she was not the}} author. She was reluctant to discuss most of her work before O Pioneers! (1913). According to L. Brent Bohlke, editor of Willa Cather in Person (1990), Cather regarded the Eddy book as poorly written. While it contains some excellent writing and character analysis, Bohkle wrote, it is not well-structured; the editing had failed <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> book of the serialized nature of the McClure's pieces. Stouck adds that Cather wanted to distance herself from journalism, and sought to minimize her role in the articles because they had angered the Christian Science church.|$|E
5|$|In late April 2004, Fertig {{was called}} up to the SmackDown! brand with vignettes playing on the show announcing his new character, Mordecai, a {{religious}} Zealot-type character, which was partially based on his previous Seven gimmick. During numerous promos, Mordecai claimed {{to be on a}} crusade <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> world of sin. He consistently wore white and had blonde hair and a beard as a sign of his purity. Mordecai debuted in ring for the SmackDown! brand on May 16, 2004 during the Judgment Day pay-per-view, defeating Scotty 2 Hotty. In later appearances, Mordecai condemned the audience for their sins, and led them in prayer. Fertig's Mordecai character was originally created to have a feud with The Undertaker.|$|E

5|$|On 30 March, Nasser proclaimed a {{manifesto}} stipulating {{the restoration of}} civil liberties, greater parliamentary independence from the executive, major structural changes to the ASU, and a campaign <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> government of corrupt elements. A public referendum approved the proposed measures in May, and held subsequent elections for the Supreme Executive Committee, the ASU's highest decision-making body. Observers noted that the declaration signaled an important shift from political repression to liberalization, although its promises would largely go unfulfilled.|$|E

They now begin to manufacture their own army of Sunstreaker bodies. Shockwave and the Dynobots are excavated up by archaeologists in Eureka, Nevada and Skywatch takes over the area. In Oregon, two young humans wonder whether to buy Soundwave, still trapped in cassette player mode. Megatron calls Sixshot to come and speed up Earth's destruction, and the Reapers follow, eager to have Sixshot join their attempt <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> universe of war-like species. Elsewhere on Earth, Ramjet's grandiose plans for a coup against Megatron fail when the Decepticon leader kills him in one-on-one combat.|$|E
5|$|After Amaterasu and Susano defeat Orochi to save Kushi, recreating past events, Orochi's spirit floats northward. Amaterasu and Issun {{embark on}} a journey across Nippon, first {{arriving}} at Ryoshima Coast and Sei-An City, the capital of Nippon. There, they work with the beautiful priestess Rao, the legendary submarine Dragon Kingdom, and the reclusive Queen Himiko <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> coastline and city of Orochi's influence, including destroying a demonic plague and retrieving a mystical weapon from a sunken trading ship. However, it is revealed that the real Rao was killed before Amaterasu arrived, and the Rao they had {{been working with the}} false fox god, Ninetails, who murders Himiko before returning to her fortress on the elusive Oni Island. Amaterasu and Issun eventually find and kill Ninetails, noticing that her spirit, like Orochi's, travels to the icy northern island of Kamui. The two decide to travel northward to find the source of the demons.|$|E

He works as a policeman while Fuk-sang lives with him, attends primary school, and pretends to be his son. Fong meets Ma Siu-ling, the heiress to a clan of ghostbusters who have dedicated themselves <b>to</b> <b>ridding</b> <b>the</b> world of evil supernatural beings. Fong gradually becomes embroiled in a love triangle with Ma and Wong Jan-jan, Ma's close friend and confidante.|$|R
5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was {{to look out for}} the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli became deeply {{involved}} in English church politics. In 1550, he and Martin Bucer provided recommendations to Cranmer for additional changes to the Book of Common Prayer Eucharistic liturgy. Vermigli supported the church's position in the vestarian controversy, over whether bishop John Hooper {{should be forced to}} wear a surplice. Vermigli agreed with Hooper's desire <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> church of elaborate garments, but he did not believe they were strictly prohibited. He advised Hooper to respect the authority of his superiors. Vermigli was probably instrumental in convincing Hooper to drop his opposition in February 1551. In October 1551 he participated in a commission to rewrite the canon law of England. In the Winter he assisted in the writing of a draft set of such laws, which was published by John Foxe as Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum in 1552.|$|E

50|$|Fong Kwok-wah and Fuk-sang survive {{until the}} present-day (1990s) and their {{physical}} appearances {{have not changed}} since 60 years ago. However, before Fong became a vampire, he already had a son with his wife Sau, so he now has a grandson named Fong Tin-yau. Fong Tin-yau is killed in an incident in England so Fong Kwok-wah impersonates his grandson. He meets Ma Siu-ling (a descendant of Ma Dan-na), the heiress to a clan of ghostbusters who have dedicated themselves <b>to</b> <b>ridding</b> <b>the</b> world of evil supernatural beings. Fong starts a romance with Ma.|$|R

5|$|Coon decides <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> town of Mysterion, enlisting {{the help}} of Professor Chaos (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as {{familiar}} to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten {{the destruction of a}} hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of his}} countrymen, Słowacki {{decided to}} stay in France as a {{political}} refugee. In 1832 he published his first collections of poems and his first two dramas (Mindowe and Maria Stuart). He also met Mickiewicz again; reportedly, Mickiewicz approached his younger colleague and shook his hand. However, Słowacki's poems, written in the 1820s, were unpopular among his Polish compatriots, as they failed to capture the sentiment of a people living under foreign occupation. Słowacki was angered by Mickiewicz, who not only stole the limelight with his Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego (Books of the Polish nation and pilgrimage), but his part three of Dziady (1832) cast Słowacki's stepfather, professor Bécu, {{in the role of}} a villain. In a letter to his mother Słowacki wrote that immediately after reading that work he was ready to challenge Mickiewicz for a duel; that did not come to pass but from that moment on, Słowacki would see Mickiewicz as his main rival. Few days later, antagonized by worsening reception of his works among the Polish émigré community in Paris, including sharp criticism from Mickiewicz, Słowacki left on a trip to Geneva, Switzerland. The French authorities denied him the right to return to France {{as part of a larger}} program <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> country of the potentially subversive Polish exiles who had settled there.|$|E
5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating <b>to</b> <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E
