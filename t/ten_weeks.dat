40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to examine the {{influence}} of a high intensity training program on selected cardiovascular exercise responses in a group of prepubescent males. Thirteen healthy boys with a mean age of 10. 0 years were randomly assigned to either control or an exercise group. Children in the exercise group participated in a <b>ten</b> <b>week,</b> three sessions per week, training intervention program. At the completion of the <b>ten</b> <b>week</b> training period the groups were reversed and the control group became the exercise group for the second <b>ten</b> <b>week</b> training program. The initial training group became the control or detraining group. Peak and submaximal cardiovascular exercise responses were measured on four occasions over the two training periods. Polar 'Sports Tester' Heart Rate Monitors were used during all of the training sessions which enabled heart rate data to be collected and stored during the exercise periods. A variety of exercise modes were used, these included, treadmill running, a variety of bicycle ergometers, monitored jogging trails and a modified basketball game. The duration of each training session was between 30 - 40 minutes, with the best 30 minutes of heart rate data used to estimate the work intensity during the study. No statistically significant changes occurred for absolute V 02 l. min- 1 and relative Peak V 02 (ml. kg- 1. min- 1). There were significant changes recorded at the 0. 05 level of significance for the following measures; V 02 at V Slope breakpoint (V 02 vs VC 02), and V 02 at VT as a percentage of peak V 02. The main finding from this study was that, ventilatory threshold may be a more sensitive indicator of change in training responses for children...|$|R
