5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Louvre</b> is {{slightly}} askew of the Historic Axis (Axe historique), a roughly eight-kilometre (five-mile) architectural line bisecting the city. It begins {{on the east}} in <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> courtyard and runs west along the Champs-Élysées. In 1871, the burning of the Tuileries Palace by the Paris Commune revealed that <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> was slightly askew of the Axe despite past appearances to the contrary. <b>The</b> <b>Louvre</b> {{can be reached by}} the Palais Royal– Musée du Louvre Métro or the Louvre-Rivoli stations.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Louvre</b> {{employs a}} staff of 2,000 led by Director Jean-Luc Martinez, who reports to the French Ministry of Culture and Communications. Martinez {{replaced}} Henri Loyrette in April 2013. Under Loyrette, who replaced Pierre Rosenberg in 2001, <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> has undergone policy changes that allow it to lend and borrow more works than before. In 2006, it loaned 1,300works, which enabled it to borrow more foreign works. From 2006 to 2009, <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> lent artwork to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia, and received a $6.9million payment {{to be used for}} renovations.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, the IMA hosted The William S. Paley Collection, a {{traveling}} exhibition {{organized by the}} Museum of Modern Art that included Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and modern pieces collected by the late CBS news chairman William S. Paley. The exhibit helped establish the IMA as a prominent museum venue in the Midwest and brought in a record-setting 60,837 visitors. In 2001, the IMA collaborated with the Armory Museum in Moscow to organize Gifts to the Tsars, 1500–1700: Treasures from the Kremlin. The show helped the IMA form partnerships with local arts organizations, gain international exposure, and attracted a record 70,704 visitors. Another important exhibit {{to travel to the}} IMA was Roman Art from <b>the</b> <b>Louvre,</b> which attracted 106,002 visitors during its 2008 run. The exhibition featured 184 mosaics, frescoes, statues, marble reliefs, and vessels loaned from the permanent collection of <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> in Paris, France. It was the largest collection ever loaned from <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> to date, and only stopped in three U.S. cities before returning to France.|$|E

5|$|Several {{churches and}} palaces, {{including}} Saint Mark's Basilica, were looted by the French, which outraged the Italians and their artistic and cultural sensibilities.

These statues had previously been in the Vatican, and both were housed in <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> until 1815. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Nile was returned to Italy. However, the Tiber remained in <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> Museum and {{can be seen in}} the collections today.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Louvre</b> Palace was altered {{frequently}} {{throughout the}} Middle Ages. In the 14thcentury, CharlesV converted the building into a residence and in 1546, FrancisI renovated {{the site in}} French Renaissance style. Francis acquired {{what would become the}} nucleus of the Louvre's holdings, his acquisitions including Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. After LouisXIV chose Versailles as his residence in 1682, constructions slowed; however, the move permitted <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> {{to be used as a}} residence for artists.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Louvre</b> {{is owned}} by the French government; however, since the 1990s it has become more independent. Since 2003, the museum has been {{required}} to generate funds for projects. By 2006, government funds had dipped from 75percent of the total budget to 62percent. Every year, <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> now raises as much as it gets from the state, about €122 million. The government pays for operating costs (salaries, safety and maintenance), while the rest – new wings, refurbishments, acquisitions – is up to the museum to finance. A further €3 million to €5 million a year is raised by <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> from exhibitions that it curates for other museums, while the host museum keeps the ticket money. As <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> became a point of interest in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book, the museum earned $2.5million by allowing filming in its galleries. In 2008, the French government provided $180million of the Louvre's yearly $350million budget; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales.|$|E

5|$|The {{museum is}} housed in <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> Palace, {{originally}} built as a fortress in the late 12thcentury under PhilipII. Remnants of the fortress are visible {{in the basement of}} the museum. Due to the urban expansion of the city, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function and, in 1546, was converted by Francis I into the main residence of the French Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. In 1692, the building was occupied by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres and the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons. The Académie remained at <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> for 100 years. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly decreed that <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces.|$|E

The Parisian Louvre will also be providing management advice to its Middle Eastern counterpart, at a cost of US$214.5 million. An additional US$253.5 million will be paid for various special exhibitions. A total of four exhibitions will be hosted per year over a period of fifteen years. The city of Abu Dhabi will also make a direct donation of US$32.5 million to <b>the</b> <b>Louvre</b> to refurbish a wing of the Pavillon de Flore for the display of international art.|$|E
