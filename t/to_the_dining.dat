5|$|For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{only the}} {{interior}} {{of one of the}} four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase leading from the first floor to the attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room with large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located {{on the east side of}} the apartment is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part of the apartment contains two bedrooms and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and it is likely that the same would have been done for the first floor unit. The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified because it has been split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests the expanse of the modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance {{is made to}} look like a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room, where they sit at formica countertops in booths {{made to look like}} convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near {{the back of the room}} that are only used when the rest of the restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing to forego the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E
50|$|Burch's {{music is}} the {{contemporary}} expression of traditional Navajo ways and living. Many of her songs are in Navajo language and capture the sacredness of Mother Earth, Father Sun {{and the importance of}} family and place <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Diné.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dining</b> room at <b>the</b> French House {{was opened}} by Fergus and Margot Henderson in 1992. Fergus would later leave in 1994 to {{establish}} his St. John restaurant in Smithfield. Margot continued <b>to</b> run <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room for several years with Melanie Arnold.|$|R

5|$|The Capitol {{has also}} been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a {{journalist}} for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into {{one another in the}} Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room, shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield {{was a member of the}} House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30a.m. as he walked through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress.|$|E

50|$|In January 2009, Speaker Morgan was re-elected speaker, to {{a fourth}} term. The {{election}} made him <b>the</b> first speaker <b>to</b> serve {{eight years in}} that capacity in the council's modern history. President Shirley addressed the council in the annual State of the Navajo Nation address on January 24, 2009. Shirley spoke of his conviction of <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> develop a new governing document for the Navajo Nation. Shirley had campaigned to return government <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> by government reform.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{passengers}} who had been asleep in their cabins found themselves unable <b>to</b> escape <b>the</b> fire. Some passengers were told <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main <b>dining</b> room <b>to</b> await instructions, but most ignored this order, since <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room lay directly {{in the path of}} the fire.|$|R
50|$|Built in the 1920s in the National Romantic style, {{the school}} {{building}} is designated a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark.

25|$|At 6:00am, {{one of the}} assassins, Hamdi Quran, went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room of {{the hotel}} {{to make sure that}} Minister Ze'evi would indeed be there in {{accordance}} with his routine schedule. At 06:20am Ze'evi and his wife Yael went down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room of the hotel. When Quran noticed the minister was in a dining hall, he immediately went back to the room where the assassins were staying and updated his associates. As a result, two assailants headed towards their vehicle, which was parked in the hotel's basement parking lot, to fetch their pistols which were modified with silencers. In order not to raise suspicion, the two assailants returned separately back to their room through the staircase instead of the elevator.|$|E

25|$|The Egyptians {{then started}} {{the second phase}} of their plan—taking over the northwestern {{position}} and the dining hall area. The 4th Company of the 9th Battalion used a tank which broke through the farmstead fence at 12:30 opposite position 8, in the center of Nitzanim's northern fence, after killing six out of the seven Israelis manning the position and blinding the seventh. Schwarzstein, until then posted in the northeastern corner of the smaller orchard, moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall and the nearby residence area, which were surrounded by embankments. He was hoping to form a second line and ordered the men from positions 5, 6, and 7 in the north to move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall area. There, he organized the reserve forces who retreated from the cowshed and the men from the northern positions for defense.|$|E
