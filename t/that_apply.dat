30|$|As Table 8 (Appendix 3) shows out of {{the total}} 111 firms <b>that</b> <b>applied</b> for the loan from formal {{financial}} institutions, {{almost all of them}} got credit. Firms <b>that</b> <b>applied</b> but were rejected are few in number. This implies {{that the majority of the}} firms <b>that</b> <b>applied</b> for the loan from formal financial institutions, either from bank or MFIs got the loan. Having said this, {{out of the}} total 96 firms <b>that</b> <b>applied</b> and received, above average of the firms got in full amount and small number of the firms did not get the full amount. This implies the highest shares of firms were unconstrained borrowers and not restricted by the credit limit.|$|R

5|$|There is no {{consensus}} among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the truth about unobservable things and whether scientific reasoning can be justified at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems <b>that</b> <b>apply</b> to particular sciences (such as biology or physics). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws <b>that</b> <b>apply</b> to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E

5|$|In Aristotle's time, the 4th century BCE, {{porpoises}} {{were regarded}} as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could already see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy. His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his “Natural history”. In the art of this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The harbour porpoise {{was one of the}} most accessible species for early cetologists, because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings <b>that</b> <b>apply</b> to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises. One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules <b>that</b> <b>apply</b> to acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails {{to prevent the}} avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the defendant had the capacity to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant. Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E
