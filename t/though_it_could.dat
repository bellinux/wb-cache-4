Currently, it falls under {{the organization of the}} 1st Armored Division, having relocated as part of the Base Realignment and Closure 2005. This assignment allows the unit maximum flexibility when deployed, as it can provide any support function needed, without being permanently attached to any particular unit or area of operations.|$|E
5|$|British {{palaeontologist}} David Bruce Norman has stressed how remarkable {{it is that}} Owen, {{who previously}} had propounded that dinosaurs were active quadrupedal animals, largely neglected Scelidosaurus <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> serve as {{a prime example of}} this hypothesis and its fossil {{was one of the most}} complete dinosaurs found at that time. Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study of a large number of even more interesting newly discovered extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx. Norman also pointed out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling.|$|E
5|$|While passing to {{the south}} of the island, the tight {{pressure}} gradient between the precursor extratropical storm and high pressures resulted in strong winds on the island, including sustained winds of hurricane status at Fort George. Gusts on the island officially peaked at 100mph (161km/h) at Devonshire. A cruise ship anchored at harbor reported a wind gust of 118mph (190km/h), <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have been caused by a downdraft. The storm also dropped moderate rainfall of just over 3inches (76mm), resulting in minor flooding of streets. Because the storm developed quickly, wave-induced beach erosion was minor.|$|E

5|$|Typewriter in the Sky was {{generally}} well-received, and regular readers of Hubbard's stories {{at the time}} widely appreciated the work. Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas wrote in a 1951 review that the story was amusing <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have used copy editing, and Groff Conklin described its concept as silly. The New York Times review the same year said it had a lively pace. Damon Knight was critical of the depiction of the protagonist's fate, and concluded {{the ending of the}} book made up for this defect. Books including The Classic Era of American Pulp Magazines and Pulp Culture: The Art of Fiction Magazines characterized the work as one of Hubbard's best stories. Adam Roberts pointed out Hubbard likely based the character of pulp fiction writer Horace Hackett on himself.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, science fiction {{began to appear}} on a new medium – television. In 1953 The Quatermass Experiment was shown on British television, the first {{significant}} science fiction show, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> also be described as horror. In the United States, science fiction heroes like Captain Video, Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers were shown, programs that more closely resembled pre-Campbellian science fiction.|$|E
25|$|The Garratt was, obviously, {{not alone}} {{in the field of}} {{articulated}} locomotives. Aside from the well-known Fairlie and Meyer types, the Garratt had contemporary and similarly-designed competition {{in the form of the}} Union-Garratt, Modified Fairlie and Golwé. Of these, the closest was the Union-Garratt, a type originally conceived owing to the perceived necessity for a rigid connection between a bunker or tender and a firebox fed by a mechanical stoker. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be argued that the NZR G class locomotives were Union-Garratts (having their bunkers mounted on the boiler frames, rather than on the hind engine unit), a more concrete example can be seen in the two South African Railways Union Garratts of classes GH and U.|$|E

25|$|Yorkshire by {{contrast}} had a poor season, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> partly be excused {{by the impact}} of Test calls, injuries and Trueman's national service. They dropped to twelfth place in the County Championship, which was then their lowest-ever position. Ray Illingworth, who had made {{only a handful of}} appearances previously, was an ever-present in Yorkshire's championship team in 1953 and other young prospects making progress were Mike Cowan, Doug Padgett, Bryan Stott and Ken Taylor. Otherwise, the mainstays were as before: Yardley, Hutton, Lowson, Lester, Halliday, Watson, Wilson, Sutcliffe, Brennan and Wardle. Close played in only two matches and Trueman in ten. Bill Holdsworth made 14 appearances and Bill Foord, in his last season before finally deciding to be a schoolteacher, made 22.|$|E
25|$|The M1928A1 variant entered mass {{production}} {{before the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, as on-hand stocks ran out. Changes included a horizontal forend, {{in place of the}} distinctive vertical foregrip ("pistol grip"), and a provision for a military sling. Despite new U.S. contracts for Lend-Lease shipments abroad to China, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as the needs of American armed forces, only two factories supplied M1928A1 Thompsons {{during the early years of}} World War II. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> use both the 50-round drum and the 20- or 30-round box magazines, active service showed the drums were more prone to jamming, rattled when moving, and were too heavy and bulky on long patrols. 562,511 were made. Wartime production variants had a fixed rear sight without the triangular sight guard wings and a non-ribbed barrel, both like those found on the M1/M1A1.|$|E
25|$|Following this success, Crowe {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for 1984's The Wild Life, the pseudo-sequel to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Whereas its predecessor followed teenagers' lives in high school, The Wild Life traced {{the lives of}} several teenagers after high school living in an apartment complex. Filmmaker James L. Brooks noticed Crowe's original voice and {{wanted to work with}} him. Brooks executive produced Crowe's first directing effort, 1989's Say Anything..., about a young man pining away for the affections of the seemingly perfect girl. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have easily ended up a formulaic teen love story, Say Anything... got glowing reception from critics. They applauded the way Crowe crafted an intriguing and insightful tale that also involved the girl's relationship with her father and how it is threatened when she discovers he is caught up in a shady business deal.|$|E

25|$|Goya depicts Saturn feasting {{upon one}} of his sons. His child's head {{and part of the}} left arm have already been consumed. The right arm has {{probably}} been eaten too, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be folded in front of the body and held in place by Saturn's thumbs. The titan is on the point of taking another bite from the left arm; as he looms from the darkness, his mouth gapes and his eyes bulge whitely. The only other brightness in the picture comes from the white flesh, the red blood of the corpse, the white knuckles of Saturn as he digs his fingers {{into the back of the}} body. There is evidence that the picture may have originally portrayed the titan with a partially erect penis, but, if ever present, this addition was lost due to the deterioration of the mural over time or during the transfer to canvas; in the picture today the area around his groin is indistinct. It may even have been overpainted deliberately before the picture was put on public display.|$|E

Colonies in places such as Australia, India and Africa were investigated to comprehend the transition of people adapting from the cold climate of Dunwall to areas with a warmer constitution like Karnaca.|$|E
500|$|The {{mounting}} debts of the government, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> [...] "scarcely hope" [...] {{to force}} the HBC company posts to adhere to its authority, made establishing {{an agreement with the}} HBC a priority. An employee of the Company, Francis Ermatinger, was elected to the position of Treasurer in July after carrying the French-Canadian vote. In August Applegate inquired to Chief Factor John McLoughlin if the HBC would pay taxes and join the Provisional Government. At the same time a member of the legislature, David Hill, tabled a bill on 15 August that would deny any HBC employees citizenship or suffrage. The measure failed to pass, but demonstrated the feelings of the [...] "Ultra-Americans" [...] towards the Company.|$|E
500|$|With the {{leadership}} of William Gorham Rice in 1927, a carillon {{was added to the}} tower; it contained sixty bells (<b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> produce only 47 different notes since top notes have double bells) made by John Taylor & Co in England. Financed by public donations (from upwards of 25,000 people), it cost $63,000 ($ in modern dollars) and was the first municipal carillon in the United States. In 1986 Mayor Thomas Whalen had the carillon restored, which included replacing 30 bells and adding two notes to its repertoire.
