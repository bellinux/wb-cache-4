5|$|The Square {{has been}} the home for TKTS (originally known as the Official London Half-Price Theatre Ticket Booth), since 1980. Tickets for theatre {{performances}} taking place around the West End that day and during the week are sold from <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> at a significant discount.

The Official London Theatre Guide recommends avoiding these booths as they are not official and do not contain the Society of Ticket Agents & Retailers (STAR) logo.|$|E

The standalone CD artwork has Hamasaki holding {{the door to}} a red telephone box in Covent Garden, London, with the album title and her name superimposed on <b>the</b> <b>booth.</b> This marks Hamasaki's third album cover to be photographed and directed outside of Japan, after LOVEppears and (Miss)understood. The CD and music video DVD format has a close-up of Hamasaki's face, with parts of the British stripes across her face. The box set is coloured black with the red British cross near the corner; the album version is the CD and DVD format, with the CD and DVD cover imprinted onto the mug, red tea tin, and the bag. The digital release uses the standalone CD format. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Chow, and the design was based on Hamasaki's first visit to the UK and Britannia. First pressing issues for both the standalone CD format, the CD and DVD format, and the box set included a 36–page photo album of Hamasaki roaming the streets and wondering around stores and markets in London.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, using a microsimulation model, queues of Fatih Sultan Mehmet (FSM) Bridge toll booths are analyzed. Generally two queues form in {{the study}} area. First one {{is in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> and <b>the</b> second one is after <b>the</b> <b>booths,</b> due to <b>the</b> {{existing}} bottleneck between <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> and <b>the</b> Bridge. Queue/delay performance of the system is analyzed incorporating the queuing theory. According to demand and service time of each server, queue may occur before <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> and/or before <b>the</b> bottleneck. The propagation of the second queue may overlap the first one because of the bottleneck capacity and for sure the increasing demand. Four different scenarios are simulated in order to evaluate capacity of the toll collectors and the bottleneck section. Some traffic management strategies are applied {{to improve the quality of}} service by decreasing delays and increasing capacities. In each scenario, average delay time per vehicle, average travel time, occupancy and speed data are obtained with microsimulation software, Vissim. Finally, optimum number of toll collectors is determined by seeking to minimize delays and maximize bottleneck capacity...|$|R
5|$|The manor {{remained}} {{in the possession of}} the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through <b>the</b> <b>Booth</b> family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758. The Booth-Greys then held the manor until the 19thcentury, whose patronage, despite being absentee lords, was probably the stimulus for Ashton's growth of a large-scale domestic-based textile industry in the 17thcentury. Pre-industrial Ashton was centred on four roads: Town Street, Crickets Lane, Old Street, and Cowhill Lane. In the late-18th and early-19thcenturies, the town was re-planned, with a grid pattern of roads. As a result, very little remains of the previous town. In 1730 a workhouse was established which consisted of a house and two cottages; it later came {{to be used as a}} hospital. The Ashton Canal was constructed in the 1790s to transport coal from the area to Manchester, with a branch to the coal pits at Fairbottom.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by <b>the</b> <b>booth.</b> As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E
