5|$|After the war <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{supplied}} to many {{countries around the}} globe, including former Warsaw Pact allies, such as Poland. As of the early 2000s it remains in service in Afghanistan, Albania, China, Cuba, Hungary, Iraq, Mozambique, Syria, Vietnam and other countries. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> employed in the Arab-Israeli Conflict and also in some conflicts in former republics of Soviet Union. The long operational history of D-1 howitzers in the national armies of numerous countries is an additional testimony to its qualities.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Possibly {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} firearm in Europe, <b>the</b> Loshult <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> discovered in 1861 by a farmer in a Swedish parish, which <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> named after. <b>The</b> Loshult <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> dated to <b>the</b> mid 14th century, 1330-50.|$|R
5000|$|... 2nd Advance, 1st Action: <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> {{unhooked}} and <b>the</b> limber is {{run to the}} 70-yard line, {{where it}} is turned or spun to face the start; its wheels are removed, and it is dropped to <b>the</b> ground. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> run to <b>the</b> end of the track, turned and stopped. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> fired three times, each shell being run to <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> from <b>the</b> limber by the fastest man in the crew.|$|R
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> Naval Gunfire Support - {{artillery}} bombardment of shore targets. In this role <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> capable of firing {{the equivalent of a}} six-gun shore battery. It can still be used as an anti-ship weapon.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{manufactured}} by Watervliet Arsenal and the carriage by Rock Island Arsenal. The first pieces were delivered early in 1940, the production continued until 1943.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{sometimes}} {{mounted on}} M2 Halftrack, M29 Weasel {{and on the}} 1/4 ton Willys MB / Ford GPW jeep (see photo on the right).|$|E
2500|$|... 57 55 J was {{accepted}} {{for use as}} training weapon in 1950s {{because of a lack}} of suitable training guns and no funds to buy new ones. The old 57mm Nordenfelt and Hotchkiss <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> worn-out, and 76mm <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> kept in reserve, so 57 55 J, among other old <b>guns,</b> <b>was</b> used as training piece. Some of <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> converted for sub-caliber training for the 234/50 Be and 305/52 O <b>guns.</b> <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> refurbished at beginning of the 1960s and sub-caliber <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> converted back to the normal configuration, but <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed from use and placed into storage in 1965–1966.|$|R

5|$|The Ordnance QF 25-pounder Short was an Australian {{variant of}} the British Ordnance QF 25-pounder field gun/howitzer. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} by modifying the 25-pounder's design to improve its mobility during jungle warfare. Development began in 1942, and the weapon first entered service with the Australian Army the next year. It was used by several Royal Australian Artillery regiments during fighting in the South West Pacific Area, before being declared obsolete in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical to the carriage of the M-30. It had suspension and steel wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The trails were initially of riveted construction, but were eventually replaced in production by welded ones. Late production pieces were equipped with caster wheels to ease manhandling. Time to set up for combat was about two minutes. In an emergency {{it was possible to}} fire without splitting trails; however this was at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). Since <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> not equipped with a limber, it could be towed only by vehicle. The maximum towing speed was 40km/h on paved roads, 30km/h on cobbled roads and 10km/h off-road. To give the crew some protection from bullets and shell fragments, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> fitted with a shield.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} lend lease {{recipient}} of the M3 was the Chinese National Revolutionary Army (1,669 pieces). <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> also supplied to Bolivia (4), Canada (3), Chile (198), Colombia (4), Cuba (1), El Salvador (9), France (130), Paraguay (12), United Kingdom (78), USSR (63) and other countries. Some nations still had it in service in the early 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The Barrett M90 is {{not meant}} to be a shoulder-fired weapon. Upon setup when {{preparing}} to fire the M90, it is first set up by folding down the attached bipod on the weapon and set on whatever space is being used to fire <b>the</b> weapon. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> first inspected {{to see if there is}} any debris that might cause the weapon to malfunction. Being a bolt-action rifle, there is typically little cause for error, whereas a semi-automatic rifle could jam or the round might have problems ejecting after firing. After <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> set up in the desired firing space, the five-round magazine <b>is</b> loaded and <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> ready to be fired after proper safety precautions <b>are</b> followed. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> rested on <b>the</b> bipod with the user holding the rifle’s handle firmly to prevent <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> from sliding back. The design that has gone into the M90 allows it to be fired in this manner without being pressed against <b>the</b> shoulder. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> able to reduce recoil through the muzzle brakes, and bipod usage. If the Barrett M90 did not have any muzzle brakes then the recoil of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> would <b>be</b> considerably larger and would need a different design incorporating the shoulder being pressed to <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>guns</b> of Battery French {{were removed}} in 1917 for {{potential}} {{service on the}} Western Front; three of <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> sent to France for use on field carriages, but sources indicate that none of <b>the</b> 6-inch <b>gun</b> regiments completed training before the Armistice and thus they did not see combat. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> not returned to Fort Kearny.|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{the night}} of 18April, Turret Two's crew {{conducted}} a major overhaul of their turret {{in preparation for a}} firing exercise scheduled to take place the next day. The center gun's compressed air system, which cleansed the bore of sparks and debris each time <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> fired, was not operating properly.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1943 Petrov {{notified}} the People's Commissar of Armaments Dmitriy Ustinov {{about the new}} project. On 13 April Ustinov informed Petrov that the State Committee of Defence had requested for five of the new guns {{to be sent to}} the testing grounds on 1 May. On 5 May, two pieces were received for trials; two days later, on 7 May <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> recommended for adoption, and on 8 August 1943 it was officially adopted as the 152mm howitzer M1943. One and a half months later, the first series production D-1 howitzers were delivered to the Red Army representatives.|$|E
5|$|Later in August, Alabama {{departed}} for the Pacific theater; {{the ship was}} assigned to the US Third Fleet during the amphibious operations in the Gilbert islands, particularly Kwajalein in early 1944. During the night of 21 February 1944, Alabamas 5-inch guns were firing upon Japanese aircraft in the area. The ship turned {{in the direction of the}} Japanese aircraft in order to better engage them, but the rearmost turret was masked behind the amidships mount. The gunner in the rearmost turret accidentally overrode the safety mechanism that prevented the gun from firing in that circumstance, and when <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> fired, it hit the 5-inch turret in front of it. Five men were killed and 11 wounded in the incident; an investigation revealed that the override switch was faulty and prone to accidental operation.|$|E

5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators sought {{to make it easier for}} law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
5|$|Southeast Asia abounds {{with tales}} of {{historic}} cannon: many {{are said to be}} imbued with supernatural powers; some are revered for their cultural and spiritual significance; others are notable for having been present at defining moments in the region's history. Burma's Glass Palace Chronicle recounts a story about the Burmese-Siamese war (1765–1767) that illustrates the divine properties ascribed to certain cannon. After attempts to repel Burmese attacks on the Siamese capital had proved unsuccessful, the King of Siam ordered that the city's guardian spirit, a great cannon called Dwarawadi, be used to halt the advance. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> ceremoniously hoisted and aimed at the enemy's camp, but the powder failed to ignite. Fearing the guardian of the city had abandoned them, the king's officials implored their sovereign to surrender.|$|E
5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E

5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> only {{initially}} {{known as}} the 41cm/45 3rd Year Type naval gun before it was redesignated as the 40cm/45 3rd Year Type naval gun on 29 March 1922 {{to comply with the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty which forbade guns larger than 40.6cm (16in). Third year type refers to the Welin breech block on which design began in 1914, the third year of the Taishō period. This breech block design was also used on the 20cm (7.9 inch), 15.5cm (6.1 inch), 14cm (5.5 inch), 12.7cm (5 inch), and 12cm (4.7 inch) naval guns.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} Mark 2 {{was tested}} and proven on 8 April 1918, and <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{scheduled to go}} into naval service in 1923. However, with the cancellation of both the Lexington and the South Dakota classes, no guns were installed on any ships even though 71 had been built and 44 were under construction. In 1922–24, twenty of the guns {{were given to the}} Army for use as coastal defense guns along with the Army's 16"/50 caliber M1919 guns. Later planning called for the use of these guns in the s, but miscommunication between design bureaus led to the 16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun being used instead. As a result, all but three of the Navy's remaining Mark 2 and 3 guns were sent to the Army to also be used as coastal defense guns.|$|E

50|$|In 2000, Australian {{firearms}} manufacturer Metal Storm {{was inspired}} by Judge Dredd's Lawgiver to create the Variable Lethality Law Enforcement electronic pistol. Like <b>the</b> Lawgiver, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> designed to be used only by its designated owner, ensuring that it cannot be fired if lost or stolen. The designated shooter can be identified by palm or fingerprint, numerical code, swipe card or voice recognition. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> capable of firing multiple projectiles which can include traditional bullets as well as pesticides, fertilisers, fireworks, fire-retardants and other rapid-delivery packages. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> also features an electronic voice that tells the shooter which firing mode <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> in.|$|R
