50|$|The {{triangulation}} method (also called phrase table multiplication) calculates {{the probability of}} both translation correspondences and lexical weight in s-p and p-t, to try to induce a new s-t phrase table. The transfer method (also called sentence <b>translation</b> <b>strategy)</b> simply carries a straightforward translation of s into p and then another translation of p into t without using probabilistic tests (as in triangulation).

Then a bilingual s-p corpus is synthesized to enable a p-t translation.|$|E
50|$|How {{suitable}} each {{of these}} solutions is depends on various factors. One {{of them is the}} type of text that is being translated. Adequate translations (in Toury's sense) of realia add some exoticism, a quality that is often desirable in fiction. For non-fiction, nowadays adequacy is usually preferred to acceptability, so as to avoid the ambiguity that can arise from the use of more culturally neutral translations - though the opposite preference has prevailed in the past. One must also consider how the element of realia relates to the source culture in terms of importance and familiarity. If, for instance, it is rather common in the source culture, then providing an adequate translation creates an exotic note that wasn’t {{there in the first place}} (though this can be justified by the fact that, after all, one is not dealing with an original, but a translation). If, on the contrary, the source culture perceives the element of realia as unusual, unless the translator renders such an element more culturally neutral, readers of the translation will most likely also perceive it as unusual. Another thing to keep in mind when establishing a <b>translation</b> <b>strategy</b> is that not all languages are equally open to “foreignisms”, and how familiar speakers of that language may be with the realia one introduces. Some languages, such as Italian, welcome such words and frequently integrate them into their vocabulary. Other languages, on the contrary, have the opposite tendency: they are wary of foreign words and are very impermeable to them. French is a good example of such protectionism. Lastly, the expected readership (which may or may not be similar to that of the original) influences the choice of a suitable <b>translation</b> <b>strategy.</b> For example, the name of a chemical compound will be translated differently depending on whether one expects the text to be read by chemists or schoolchildren.|$|E

50|$|In {{programming}} language theory, the call-by-push-value (CBPV) paradigm, inspired by monads, allows writing semantics for lambda-calculus without writing two variants {{to deal with}} the difference between call-by-name and call-by-value. To do so, CBPV introduces a term language that distinguishes computations and values, according to the slogan a value is, a computation does; this term language has a single evaluation order. However, to evaluate a lambda-calculus term according to either the call-by-name (CBN) or call-by-value (CBV) reduction strategy, one can translate the term to CBPV using a call-by-name or call-by-value <b>translation</b> <b>strategy,</b> which give rise to different terms. Evaluating the result of the call-by-value translation corresponds to evaluating the original term with the call-by-value strategy; evaluating the result of the call-by-name translation corresponds instead to evaluating the original term with the call-by-name strategy.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{all these}} empirically false {{examples}} of explaining geyi, {{there are some}} noteworthy counterexamples. The Dutch sinologist Erik Zürcher (1972:12) defines geyi as [...] "elucidating Buddhist terms, notably numerical categories (shu), {{with the help of}} notions extracted from traditional Chinese philosophy." [...] Robert Sharf, a professor of Buddhist studies, expresses skepticism about whether geyi was a significant phenomenon in Chinese Buddhist history.The shortcomings of these early Chinese Buddhist writings are viewed as the result of ko-i 格義, or 'matching concepts,' a spurious practice that supposedly involved the use of native Chinese terminology, culled primarily from Taoist classics, to express Buddhist concepts. … For the scholar interested in the larger issue of sinification, ko-i is a red herring. The practice of elucidating Indian Buddhist concepts by drawing parallels with native systems of thought was ubiquitous throughout the history of Buddhism in China; indeed, how was Buddhism to be understood without some recourse to the familiar? (2001:97-98) The Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism (2004), which does not include a geyi article, describes it in the [...] "China" [...] article: [...] "A case in point is the putative method of 'matching the meaning' (geyi), which involved pairing key Buddhist terms with Chinese expressions primarily derived from Daoist sources." [...] Charles Muller's Digital Dictionary of Buddhism (2010) entry for geyi cites Mair's [...] "What is Geyi, After All?" [...] article.Modern reference works have commonly defined this term as something like 'matching meanings,' to describe a <b>translation</b> <b>strategy</b> assumed to have been used during the earliest period of the rendering of Indian Buddhist texts into Chinese, where Indian terms such as śūnyatā were rendered into Chinese with comparable concepts such as wu 無, with mixed results in terms of accuracy. Victor Mair, in investigating the grounds of this theory, has found it to be utterly without support, explaining that [...] "we may conclude that geyi...was not a translation technique at all but an exegetical method, and that it was by no means restricted exclusively to drawing upon Daoist texts for its non-Buddhist (i.e., non-Indian, non-Indic) comparanda.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 93 - 95 This {{study examined}} the cognitive processes and <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> of three Turkish students who were good translators using think-aloud protocols. In think-aloud procedure, subjects verbalize their thoughts during the solution of a task. The reason for using think-aloud protocols {{in this study was}} to bring out the unconscious (cognitive) processes of translation, as well as determine the <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> of the subjects. The subjects were chosen from among translation students at the upper-intermediate level of language proficiency who volunteered for the study. Immediately after the protocols the researcher interviewed the subjects. Both the protocols and the interviews were audio-recorded and these recordings were transcribed verbatim and translated into English. In order to analyze the collected data from the think-aloud protocols, the researcher developed a taxonomy based on the <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> of the three subjects. The researcher developed another taxonomy to analyze the interviews based on the research questions and comments made by the subjects during the thinkaloud protocols. The results {{of this study indicate that}} thesethree translators used individual <b>translation</b> <b>strategies,</b> as well as universal cognitive processes. Although the three subjects used the same <b>translation</b> <b>strategies,</b> how these strategies were implemented varied among them. Another finding of this study was that the use and choice of <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> were related to the experience and training of the translator. M, the most experienced translator, used global strategies related to the whole text, whereas FI and F 2, the less experienced translators, used strategies which stayed close to the surface features of the text. M also showed the greatest variety in his choice of <b>translation</b> <b>strategies.</b> Subjects' choice of <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> also effected the quality of the translation.

Many researchers, linguists, and scientists deal with definition, recognition, classification and translation matters of culture-specific items, yet the consensus cannot be reached. Different definitions, interpretations, and even classifications, which strongly rely upon similar criteria, are offered. Therefore, the analysis of <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> used to render culture-specific items in popular science literature are very important and relevant to the overall analysis of cultural realia. Aiming to research <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> of CSI in the genre of popular science, Martin Lindstrom's book Brand Sense: build powerful brands through touch, taste, smell, sight, and sound" (2005) and its Lithuanian translation Prekės ženklo jausmas, accomplished by Lina Krutulytė, was chosen. The analysis presented in this article is restricted to the group of common expressions denoting CSI, as translation of proper nouns follow the recommendations provided by the Lithuanian Language State Commission and were found to be less problematic as compared to the group of common expressions. For the analysis of <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> used to render culture-specific items, categorization of Davies (2003) was followed.

[...] University of Washington, 2014 Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on translating thoughts into different levels of written language [...] the next sentence (Level I) and the evolving text (Level II). In Study 1, a longitudinal study of typically developing writers, <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> were coded at Levels I and II for narrative (cohort one - grades one, three, and five; cohort two - grades three, five, and seven) and expository (cohort one - grades two and four; cohort two - grades four and six) texts for three transcription (spelling) ability groups (poor spellers, average spellers, and superior spellers; 10 girls and 10 boys within each group). The first research hypothesis was confirmed: The coding scheme accounted for all observed <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> and reflected some use of multiple ones at Level I or across Levels I and II, consistent with the generative nature of cognitive to linguistic translation. Consistent with the second hypothesis, main effects or interactions with transcription ability were found, especially in cohort one for grades one to five. Study 2 examined whether teaching <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> for writing the next sentence, just before the culminating composing activity (autobiographical texts in first six lessons or summaries of read and heard source material in last twelve lessons) to students in grades four to nine with specific learning disabilities (SLDs), resulted in students' use of these strategies during composing of autobiographical texts (lessons one to six) or summaries about read source material and heard source material, that is, integrated reading-writing and integrated listening-writing, equated for number of words and comparable content (lessons seven to 18).

In addition, this study also analyzed the degree of meaning equivalence of the culture-specific terms in the novel. This study applied a descriptive qualitative approach since it emphasized in describing the phenomena of domestication and foreignization in the texts. To support the analysis, quantitative data were also used. The data are the English version of CSTs and their Bahasa Indonesia translations found in I’ve Got Your Number novel, both the original and Bahasa Indonesia version, in the form of words and phrases. The main instrument of the study was the researcher herself, since the researcher was the data collector and data analyzer. To ensure the trustworthiness of the study, this research applies credibility and dependability, in which the researcher performed deep and detailed observation of the data. The trustworthiness also gained by applying triangulations. This study reveals three findings. In terms of CSTs, there are four categories. They are geographical, historical, society and cultural categories. Among them, CSTs in terms of society category has the highest number.

40|$|This {{research}} is {{located within the}} framework of descriptive translation studies and corpus-based contrastive discourse analysis. Modern Translation Studies has growingly taken into account the complexities of culture-specific expressions in literary translation. Conference interpreting setting has paradoxically not been touched upon. Through an empirical case study of the interpretation of Chinese culture-specific expressions in ten Chinese Premier’s Press Conferences, this thesis aims to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} interpreting culture-specific expressions in a conference interpreting setting. Methodologically, this thesis integrates the linguistic approach with the culture-oriented approach, empiricism with interpretivism and quantitative with qualitative research. It began with a detailed transcription of ten unrevised press conference video recordings downloaded from Internet. With such transcription, the specialized corpora constituted by the Chinese culture-specific expressions and their interpretations were built and coded innovatively using the four <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> converted from the six kernel theories within the theoretical framework of this thesis. Contrastive discourse analysis of the specialized corpora was carried out against such extra-textual resources as the media coverage of the press conference, the lectures given by the government interpreters and so on. Translation norms that reflect the regularities of how the four <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> are used were derived from such large-scale case studies and tested against more cases before being qualitatively analyzed to explain why they exist and how they were manifested in the selection of <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> in the specialized corpora. This thesis claims contribution to existing literature in terms of theory and methodology. Theoretically, it proposed six translation norms of the use of four <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> for the five categories of the Chinese culture-specific expressions in the Chinese Premier’s Press Conferences with a core argument that the interpreters’ selection of <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> is subject more to contexts than to their subjectivity, which empirically confirms for the first time Eco-translatology Theory’s central claim that an interpreter selects <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> by adapting to contexts. In addition, as a pioneering study on cultural expressions under conference interpreting context, this research increases the explanatory power of relevant translation theories because it spans literary translation and conference interpreting. Methodologically, <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> were converted from relevant translation theories and used as descriptive categories for corpus-based contrastive analysis, which constitutes an originality in contrast to previous research that teem with researcher-named <b>strategies</b> and confuse <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> with <b>translation</b> methods. Furthermore, this research improves transcription coding and corpus building tactics, making data analysis not only more systematic but also more accessible to readers who do not know both languages...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper revisits the {{concepts}} of translation model, translation analysis, and <b>translation</b> <b>strategy</b> from an integrated perspective. Translation modeling is reconsidered {{in terms of a}} paradigm shift and a distinction between a process-oriented (descriptive) model and an action-oriented (prescriptive) model. Following the discourse and communication translation model, we put forward a “model – analysis – strategy” concept and a “features – difficulties – solutions” concept to reformulate a <b>translation</b> <b>strategy</b> as a flexible, variable and, to a certain extent, individual (but not unique) algorithm. We also introduce the notion of a discursive profile framed on existing discourse-related data in translation...|$|E

The research question sought to explore the dominant cultural <b>translation</b> <b>strategy</b> in the dichotomy of domestication and foreignization, which was composed of six of Hemingway’s works, originally written in English with their Persian translations {{over a period of}} six decades. The current product-oriented descriptive translation research was a qualitative attempt to describe and analyze cultural translation strategies in the corpus of the research and did not intend to judge the correctness of translations or appropriateness of the application of translators’ ideological presuppositions. According to the obtained results, although both domesticating and foreignizing strategies have been used over the last six decades, domestication has been the most pervasive cultural <b>translation</b> <b>strategy</b> from the 1950 s up to the 2000 s.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{translation}} of proper names from French to Slovene; more specifically, on the Slovene translations {{of the names of}} French political institutions in journalistic texts. At the beginning, the proper names in Slovene and in French are presented together with the relevant differences between both languages and certain translation strategies. In the analysis, which consists of two parts, we first analyse the journalistic subcorpus of the parallel corpus FraSloK and then also the Slovene corpus Gigafida. The proper names in the two Slovene newspapers are translated differently and {{it is clear that the}} choice of the <b>translation</b> <b>strategy</b> depends on the target reader. In the news articles translated from French to Slovene, the expected <b>translation</b> <b>strategy</b> was transference, but the results show that the names are frequently translated to Slovene or explained to help the reader. The results confirmed that the context and the reader have the most influence on the choice of the <b>translation</b> <b>strategy</b> and they also show the tendency to explain those names that are likely considered to be unknown to the reader...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{determine}} the <b>translation</b> procedures and <b>strategies</b> adopted in the self-translation of Ingrid Winterbach’s Die boek van toeval en toeverlaat (2006) /The Book of Happenstance (2008). These procedures and strategies are compared to the strategies followed by two other South African self-translators, Dalene Matthee and André Brink. Vinay and Darbelnet’s <b>translation</b> procedures and <b>strategies</b> and Venuti’s notion of “invisibility” are used to analyse the author’s translation approach. To facilitate comparison with the <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> of Matthee and Brink, Vinay and Darbelnet are supplemented by a number of other <b>translation</b> <b>strategies,</b> such as rationalisation, explicitation and removal of foreshadowing. This study contributes to the study of literary translation in South Africa, specifically in the area of self-translation by a South African author for a South African audience...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a self-reflexive study into effective <b>translation</b> <b>strategies.</b> The study focuses {{primarily on}} the <b>translation</b> <b>strategies</b> by Vinay and Darbelnet (1995), namely direct and oblique <b>strategies</b> of <b>translation.</b> The <b>strategies</b> {{are used in the}} translation of Jeanne Goosen‘s novel Louoond (1987). The novel was chosen on account of the writer‘s unique writing style and the challenges it poses for the prospective translator. One of the key objectives {{of this study was to}} comprehensively illustrate Vinay and Darbelnet‘s <b>strategies</b> of <b>translation</b> when translating the novel. The theoretical framework of this study is an analysis of Vinay and Darbelnet‘s <b>translation</b> <b>strategies.</b> The study also aims to give insight into what is meant by translation, translation theory, literary theory and literary translation. The translation of the novel is the final product, but in order to illustrate each procedure of Vinay and Darbelnet (1995) examples were taken from this final product. The chapters that follow illustrate the strategies of Vinay and Darbelnet (1995) as used in the translation of an Afrikaans text (SL) into English (TL). Conclusions can then be drawn as to whether full equivalence was obtained and whether the translation is deemed successful...|$|R
