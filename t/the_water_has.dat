5|$|On August 15, 2017, {{water was}} {{restored}} to the fountain as a test run, with the intention that it will stay on until November, when the ice rink reopens. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> been dyed with the 'Blue Lagoon' aquatic dye to control the growth of algae and bacteria. The nontoxic aquatic dye attenuates the penetration of light into the water, and tints the water blue.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
5|$|Hot springs {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter, whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} mineral resources, the Goat Rocks area {{can be divided}} into three segments, each rich with certain minerals. The first two are named Packwood Glacier–McCall Basin and Glacier Basin, and are located near past {{volcanic}} vents. These areas exhibit anomalous levels of cobalt, copper, lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc, well-dispersed levels of pyrite, and sporadic concentrations of silver. Area C corresponds to the Clear Fork of the Cowlitz River and lies along the area of contact between Goat Rocks volcano and older volcanoes to the east. It is distinct from the other two study areas, featuring anomalous amounts of barium, cobalt, copper, and manganese, as well as smaller quantities of lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc. Other minerals found in Area C include barite, boron, cinnabar, mercury, pyrite, and tin in concentrates taken from stream-sediment. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> high concentrations of chlorine, copper, fluorine, and molybdenum, and altered rocks contain arsenic, lead, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc at especially high levels. The Goat Rocks vicinity seems to offer large base metal deposits. Outside the area studied, coal has been identified at the Packwood and Cowlitz fields, and building stones and gravel are being quarried to the north and west of the volcano. The Goat Rocks area's potential resources for oil and gas remain unidentified. Because no volcanic activity has occurred during the Holocene (within the past 11,700 years), Goat Rocks has very little potential for geothermal resources.|$|E
5|$|The new route added several locks to the canal, making {{water supply}} {{problems}} more severe. Because {{of the way}} the system of locks work, water is lost from the upper part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. This is a particular issue for the pound between Bradford Lock at Bradford on Avon and the Bath Locks, where a series of locks need to be opened each time the gates are opened. Most lock gates are not watertight, therefore some water leaks from the higher levels of the canal to those lower down. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> to be replaced, or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold enough water to be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts of the canal, but if no suitable source is available or sufficient, a pumping station, such as the one at Claverton, can be used to maintain the water level. Crofton Pumping Station was built to supply water to the summit pound of the canal, opening in 1810 but, unlike Claverton, was powered by steam.|$|E
25|$|An {{aquarium}} must {{be maintained}} regularly {{to ensure that the}} fish are kept healthy. Daily maintenance consists of checking the fish for signs of stress and disease. Also, aquarists must make sure that <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> a good quality and it is not cloudy or foamy and the temperature of the water is appropriate for the particular species of fish that live in the aquarium.|$|E

25|$|At room {{temperature}} and pressure, the water jar reaches equilibrium {{when the air}} over <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> a humidity of about 3%. This percentage increases as the temperature goes up. At 100°C and atmospheric pressure, equilibrium is not reached until the air is 100% water. If the liquid is heated a little over 100°C, the transition from liquid to gas will occur {{not only at the}} surface, but throughout the liquid volume: the water boils.|$|E
25|$|Parts of {{the parish}} were almost {{completely}} surrounded by water until 1692 when Thomas Fleetwood of Bank Hall cut a channel to drain Martin Mere to the sea. From this point on, attempts at large-scale drainage of Martin Mere and other marshland continued until the 19th century, since when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> been pumped away. This left behind a legacy of fine agricultural soil and created a booming farming industry.|$|E
25|$|Marginalism is {{a theory}} of {{economics}} that attempts to explain the discrepancy {{in the value of}} goods and services by reference to their secondary, or marginal, utility. The reason why the price of diamonds is higher than that of water, for example, owes to the greater additional satisfaction of the diamonds over the water. Thus, while <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> greater total utility, the diamond has greater marginal utility.|$|E

25|$|Chlorine {{can result}} in the {{bleaching}} of the dye {{in the absence of}} thiosulfate to inhibit the oxidizing chlorine. High levels of bromine can convert phenol red to bromophenol red (dibromophenolsulfonephthalein, whose lowered pKa results in an indicator with a range shifted in the acidic direction – water at pH 6.8 will appear to test at 7.5). Even higher levels of bromine (>20 ppm) {{can result in}} the secondary conversion of bromophenol red to bromophenol blue with an even lower pKa, erroneously giving the impression that <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> an extremely high pH despite being dangerously low.|$|E
25|$|In a fireless {{locomotive}} {{the boiler}} {{is replaced by}} a steam accumulator, which is charged with steam (actually water at a temperature well above boiling point, 212°F/100°C) from a stationary boiler. Fireless locomotives were used where there was a high fire risk (e.g. in oil refineries), where cleanliness was important (e.g. in food factories) or where steam is readily available (e.g. in paper mills and power stations where steam is either a by-product or is cheaply available). The water vessel ("boiler") is heavily insulated the same as with a fired locomotive. Until all <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> boiled away, the steam pressure does not drop except as the temperature drops.|$|E
25|$|A {{half mask}} is not {{directly}} connected to the scuba air supply. the only available source of air to displace {{the water in the}} case of a leak or flood is through the diver's nose. The procedure involves exhaling through the nose into the mask until <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> all been displaced by air. During this process, the air must be prevented from escaping at a high point, or the water will not be expelled. If the mask does not fit in such a way that this happens automatically, it must be sealed at the high point by the diver pressing it against the face.|$|E

25|$|The {{sources of}} the {{municipal}} water supply are various spring fed tanks located around the island. The three island communities supply water within a limited but expanding part of their jurisdictions. Homes outside the municipal water system use wells or cisterns to collect rain water. There are plans to construct an artificial lake {{in the area of}} Panormos to supply water to farmers. Private water wells supply some agricultural needs and water from these wells can be transported by lorry to outlying areas to refill cisterns or swimming pools. The municipal water is good quality. As most natural source water in limestone environments, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> a high calcium content.|$|E
25|$|Zucchini has a {{delicate}} flavor and requires {{little more than}} quick cooking with butter or olive oil, with or without fresh herbs. The skin is left in place. Quick cooking of barely wet zucchini in oil or butter allows the fruit to partially boil and steam, with the juices concentrated in the final moments of frying when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> gone, prior to serving. Zucchini can also be eaten raw, sliced or shredded, in a cold salad, as well as lightly cooked in hot salads, as in Thai or Vietnamese recipes. Mature (larger sized) zucchini are well suited for cooking in breads. Zucchinis can be cut with a spiralizer to make zucchini noodles for low-carbohydrate recipes.|$|E
25|$|Characteristic of {{the country}} are the {{enormous}} fissures which divide it, formed over time by the erosive action of water. They are the valleys of the rivers, which rising on the uplands or mountain sides, have cut their way to the surrounding lowlands. Some of the valleys are of considerable width; in other cases the opposite walls of the gorges are but two or three hundred meters apart, and fall almost vertically thousands of meters, representing an erosion of many hundred thousands cubic metres of hard rock. One result of the action of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> been the formation of numerous isolated flat-topped hills or small plateaus, known as ambas, with nearly perpendicular sides.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney have {{published}} {{information on how}} to grow Wollemi Pines from seed which has been harvested from helicopters from the forest trees. The majority of seeds that fall from the cone are not viable so need to be sorted to retain the plump and dark ones. These can then be sown on top of seed raising mix and watered. Once <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> drained through the mix, the pot should be placed in a plastic bag and refrigerated for two weeks. After this, the pot should be removed from the plastic bag and placed somewhere warm but not very sunny until the seed germinates (remembering to keep them moist but not wet). This could take several months.|$|E
25|$|Experimentally, {{the phase}} lines are {{relatively}} easy to map due to the interdependence of temperature and pressure that develops when multiple phases forms. See Gibbs' phase rule. Consider a test apparatus consisting of a closed and well insulated cylinder equipped with a piston. By charging {{the right amount of}} water and applying heat, the system can be brought to any point in the gas region of the phase diagram. If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line until all of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> condensed.|$|E
25|$|Most of the NEWater {{is used by}} {{industries}} for non-potable uses such as wafer fabrication. The rest is {{fed into}} nearby reservoirs. As of 2008, according to PUB NEWater was able to meet 30% of Singapore's water requirements. The high purity of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>has</b> actually allowed industries to reduce their costs. With {{the construction of the}} Deep Tunnel Sewerage System the decentralized water reclamation plants and NEWater factories are expected to be gradually closed and replaced by the single, much larger water reclamation plant and NEWater factory at Changi at the Eastern end of Singapore Island. The Bedok reclamation plant {{was the first one to}} be decommissioned in 2009, followed by the Seletar plant in 2011. The Bedok NEWater plant, however, continued to operate, while the Seletar NEWater plant was decommissioned along with the reclamation plant. The Kranji, Ulu Pandan and Bedok reclamation plants had been upgraded in 1999-2001, making them more compact so that they needed less land and covering them for odor control in order to make nearby land more valuable.|$|E
