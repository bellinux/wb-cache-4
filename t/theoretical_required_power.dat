40|$|Aerodynamic {{knowledge}} for practical flapping-wing {{micro air vehicle}} (MAV) design is obtained by application of the design exploration framework coupled with CFD to a multiobjective aerodynamic design optimization problem of two-dimensional flapping motion of an airfoil. Lift and thrust are maximized while <b>required</b> <b>power</b> is minimized in the design problem. Pareto-optimal solutions are obtained by a multiobjective evolutionary optimization and analyzed with the self-organizing map. Aerodynamic performance of each flapping motion is evaluated by a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver. The result reveals tradeoff information between each objective and effect of each design parameters on them. Analysis of the time histories of lift, thrust, and <b>required</b> <b>power</b> coefficients and corresponding pressure coefficient distribution of the extreme Pareto-optimal solutions leads to useful guidelines for the lift maximization, thrust maximization, and <b>required</b> <b>power</b> minimization.
