5|$|During the American Civil War, White {{served as}} a Sergeant Major and Captain in the Confederate States Army and headed a bureau of the Confederate States Department of the Treasury. White served under <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> of Stonewall Jackson and Jubal Early and was {{responsible}} for the safekeeping of Hampshire County's land registration records from destruction by Union Army forces. From 1864 to 1865, White was in command of Company C of the 23rd Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1864, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry (plus {{additional}} cavalry and infantry regiments) marched from Charleston towards White Sulphur Springs {{in eastern}} West Virginia. The men were poorly equipped, and over {{one third of}} the cavalry did not have horses. Their immediate destination was Stanton, Virginia. On June 7, they met two groups of infantry, and one division of cavalry, under <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> of Generals David Hunter and George Crook. Fresh supplies were issued at that time.|$|E
5|$|Lords of Shadow is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the main character, Gabriel Belmont. The combat involves a retractable chain whip called the Combat Cross. The player can perform up to forty unlockable combos with it. <b>The</b> <b>commands</b> consist of direct attacks for dealing damage to single enemies, and weak area attacks when surrounded by them. It is also capable of interactions with secondary weapons, such as knives, holy water and other items which can be upgraded. In addition, the Combat Cross's melee skills can be combined with the Light and Shadow magic system, which are spells aimed at defense and aggression, respectively. The whip is upgradeable and {{can also be used}} to guard against an opponent's attack.|$|E
50|$|The Supporting Establishment {{includes}} <b>the</b> Combat Development <b>Command,</b> <b>the</b> Logistics <b>Command,</b> <b>the</b> Systems <b>Command,</b> <b>the</b> Recruiting <b>Command,</b> <b>the</b> Installations <b>Command,</b> and <b>the</b> Marine Band.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> FANC is <b>commanded</b> by <b>the</b> <b>Commanding</b> Officer FANC (COMSUP FANC), who {{is under}} <b>the</b> <b>command</b> of <b>the</b> Chief of the Defence Staff. <b>The</b> <b>Commanding</b> officer {{is usually a}} Brigade general.|$|R
5000|$|In 1891, the White Squadron {{commenced}} {{a tour of}} the Great Lakes {{that was}} commemorated in an album by Woolson Spice Co. At that time, the White Squadron consisted of the cruiser [...] under <b>the</b> <b>command</b> of Captain Frederick Rodgers, the [...] under <b>the</b> <b>command</b> of Captain George C. Remey, [...] under <b>the</b> <b>command</b> of Captain Winfield S. Schley, [...] under <b>the</b> <b>command</b> of Captain Gilbert C. Wise, [...] under <b>the</b> <b>command</b> of Lieutenant Seaton Schroeder, the torpedo boat [...] under Lieutenant Cameron McRae Winslow, [...] under <b>the</b> <b>command</b> of Lieutenant-Commander M. R. S. McKenzie, [...] under <b>the</b> <b>command</b> of Captain John W. Philip, and [...] under <b>the</b> <b>command</b> of Captain Joseph N. Miller. Some of the ships had other squadron assignments, prior to the 1891 cruise.|$|R
5|$|On 23 April, Hitler {{appointed}} General of the Artillery Helmuth Weidling, {{commander of}} the LVI Panzer Corps, as the {{commander of the}} Berlin Defense Area, replacing Lieutenant-Colonel (Oberstleutnant) Ernst Kaether. Despite <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> being issued from the Führerbunker, by 25 April the Red Army had consolidated their investment of Berlin, and there was no prospect that the German defence could do anything but delay the city's capture. Hitler summoned Field Marshal Robert Ritter von Greim from Munich to Berlin to take over command of the Luftwaffe from Hermann Göring. Along with his mistress and crack test pilot, Hanna Reitsch, he arrived on 26 April.|$|E
5|$|White and {{his company}} saw combat from early 1864 through the early 1865. During the summer of 1865 alone, White's company participated in 56 battles and skirmishes, {{including}} picket fights, with two men killed, 26 men wounded (four of which later {{died as a result}} of their wounds), and ten men taken prisoner. By October 1, 1864, White's company had 15 serviceable horses and 70 that were not serviceable. Between 1863 and 1865, White received one severe wound (from June 21, 1864) and two minor wounds from various campaigns. White felt the effects of these wounds for the remainder of his life. Throughout his military service during the American Civil War, White served under <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> of Stonewall Jackson and Jubal Early.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{introduced}} in the game is the Dimension Link (D-Link), measured in a blue gauge on the interface. It is used to draw power from certain companions who the player characters meet during the game, such as Experiment 626, temporarily replacing <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> in the player's customized command deck with a pre-determined set of commands that differ with each D-Link. Once the command gauge is filled while performing a D-Link, a powerful finishing move is activated to take out enemies. Each finishing move has two levels which can render a finishing move more powerful than before, {{similar to that of}} the Command System. The D-Link can only be used when its corresponding gauge is filled completely, and can be activated by pressing right on the directional pad to access the D-Link menu, followed by selecting the chosen ally.|$|E
50|$|Reporting {{directly}} to <b>the</b> <b>Commanding</b> General, Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic (CG FMFLANT) are <b>the</b> <b>Commanding</b> General, II Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), <b>the</b> <b>Commanding</b> General, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), and <b>the</b> <b>Commanding</b> Officers of three Marine Expeditionary Units (22d, 24th, 26th MEUs). <b>The</b> <b>Commanding</b> General, II MEF, exercises operational {{control over the}} 2d Marine Division, the 2d Marine Aircraft Wing, and the 2d Marine Logistics Group.|$|R
50|$|The {{radio-frequency}} {{signal that}} {{is transmitted from}} the ground is received by <b>the</b> <b>command</b> receiver and is amplified and demodulated. Amplification is necessary because the signal is very weak after traveling the long distance. Next in <b>the</b> <b>command</b> system is <b>the</b> <b>command</b> decoder. This device examines the subcarrier signal and detects <b>the</b> <b>command</b> message that it is carrying. The output for the decoder is normally non-return-to-zero data. <b>The</b> <b>command</b> decoder also provides clock information to <b>the</b> <b>command</b> logic and this tells <b>the</b> <b>command</b> logic when a bit is valid on the serial data line. <b>The</b> <b>command</b> bit stream that is sent to <b>the</b> <b>command</b> processor has a unique feature for spacecraft. Among {{the different types of}} bits sent, the first are spacecraft address bits. These carry a specific identification code for a particular spacecraft and prevent <b>the</b> intended <b>command</b> from being performed by another spacecraft. This is necessary because there are many satellites using the same frequency and modulation type.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, salutes at a halt {{are given}} on <b>the</b> <b>command</b> [...] "Hand Salute". They are lowered {{in the same}} amount of time elapsed between the two words. <b>The</b> <b>command</b> [...] "present arms" [...] will cause <b>the</b> <b>command</b> to salute if <b>the</b> <b>command</b> is not given rifles for the ceremony, but the salute will be held until they are ordered to lower it with <b>the</b> <b>command</b> [...] "order arms".|$|R
5|$|Lee {{chose the}} {{relatively}} well-rested commands of D. H. Hill, Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder {{to lead the}} Confederate offensive, as they had barely participated in the fighting of the day before. Meanwhile, James Longstreet's First Corps and A. P. Hill's Light Division, who had fought {{the majority of the}} previous day's hostilities, would be held in reserve. According to Lee's plan, the Army of Northern Virginia would form a semi-circle enveloping Malvern Hill. D. H. Hill's five brigades would be placed along the northern face of the hill, forming the center of the Confederate line, and <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> of Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder would take the left and right flanks, respectively. Whiting's forces would position themselves on the Poindexter farm, with the outfits of Brig. Gen. Charles Sidney Winder and Richard Ewell nearby. The infantry of these three detachments would provide reinforcement for the Confederate line if necessary. Maj. Gen. Theophilus Holmes would take up a position on the extreme Confederate right flank.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{well-known}} stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered {{the execution of the}} king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.|$|E
5|$|The only {{significant}} Celestial Master text that survives from the Hanzhong period is the Xiang'er commentary to the Dao De Jing. This text gives {{insight into the}} Celestial Masters’ physiological beliefs, meditation practices and rituals. In addition, the commentary reinterprets the Dao De Jing {{to have all of}} humanity as its intended audience, instead of only a sage. The Taiping Jing, a text attributed to the Yellow Turbans, was not a Celestial Master text, but reflects at least in part some Celestial Master thought and practice. A later text written in 255 CE, known as <b>the</b> <b>Commands</b> and Admonitions for the Families of the Great Dao was composed to a divided Celestial Master community after the dispersal of the Hanzhong population. While written in the persona of Zhang Lu, it is probable that this text was not written by him, as he had probably died by 255 CE.|$|E
50|$|<b>Commanding</b> {{officers}} of <b>the</b> artillery on Gotland from 1860 to 2000. <b>The</b> <b>commanding</b> officer had <b>the</b> title corps commander between 1860 and 1975. <b>The</b> <b>commanding</b> officer had <b>the</b> title regimental commander between 1975 and 1982 and 1994 to 2000. During the years 1982-1994, <b>the</b> <b>commanding</b> officer was subordinate to <b>the</b> <b>commanding</b> officer of <b>the</b> Gotland Military <b>Command</b> (MKG).|$|R
50|$|In {{this case}} before {{executing}} a <b>command</b> <b>the</b> program counter is at some position (state before <b>the</b> <b>command</b> is executed).Executing <b>the</b> <b>command</b> moves <b>the</b> program {{counter to the}} next command.Since the program counter is the whole state, it follows that executing <b>the</b> <b>command</b> changed <b>the</b> state.So <b>the</b> <b>command</b> itself corresponds to a transition between the two states.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>commanding</b> {{officer of}} a company, usually a captain, is {{referred}} to as the company commander (or the battery/troop commander for artillery/cavalry). <b>The</b> <b>commanding</b> officer of a battalion (or squadron of cavalry), is usually a lieutenant colonel. <b>The</b> <b>commanding</b> officer of a brigade, a colonel, is the brigade commander. At the division level and higher, however, <b>the</b> <b>commanding</b> officer {{is referred to}} as <b>the</b> <b>commanding</b> general, as these officers hold general officer rank.|$|R
5|$|While {{the band}} fled west, Commanding General Henry Atkinson trimmed his force {{to a few}} hundred men {{and set out to}} join militia commanders Henry Dodge and James D. Henry to regroup and {{resupply}} at Fort Blue Mounds. Under the command of Atkinson, around 1,300 men from <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> of Henry, Dodge, Alexander Posey and Milton Alexander crossed the Wisconsin River between 27 July and 28 July near present day Helena, Wisconsin. The well-fed and rested militia force picked up Black Hawk's trail again on 28 July near present-day Spring Green, Wisconsin, and relatively quickly closed the gap on the famished and battle-weary band of Native Americans. On 1 August, Black Hawk and about 500 men, women, and children arrived at the eastern bank of the Mississippi, a few miles downstream {{from the mouth of the}} Bad Axe River. On arrival, the leaders of the band, including Black Hawk, called a council meeting to discuss their next move.|$|E
5|$|With no keyboard, the Famicom version {{replaces the}} verb-noun parser with a menu list of {{fourteen}} set commands selectable with the gamepad. This {{is similar to}} the command selection menu system introduced in Yuji Horii's murder mystery adventure game , which was released in 1984, in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia. One of <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> on the menu allowed the player to use a point-and-click interface, using the D-pad to move a cursor on the screen in order to look for clues and hotspots. The Famicom version of Portopia also features branching menu selections, which includes using the pointer as a magnifying glass to investigate objects, which is needed to find hidden clues, and as a fist or hammer to hit anything or anyone, which could be used to carry out beatings during suspect interrogations. Additional sequences were also added, notably an underground dungeon maze, with a style similar to role-playing video games.|$|E
