40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the empirical literature {{on the effects of}} environmental regulation on investment. In particular, we ask whether and how strongly an industry's investment responds to stringency in environmental regulation. Environmental regulation is measured as (i) an industry's <b>total</b> <b>current</b> <b>expenditure</b> on environmental protection, and (ii) a country-industry's revenue from environmental taxes. Focusing on European data of manufacturing industries between 1998 and 2007, we estimate the differential impact of environmental stringency on four types of investment: gross investment in tangible goods, in new buildings, in machinery, and in 'productive' investment (investment in tangible goods minus investment in abatement technologies). Both environmental variables enter positively, and their quadratic terms exhibit significantly negative parameter estimates. This, in turn, indicates a positive but diminishing impact of environmental regulation on investment. Investment Environmental regulation Pollution abatement costs Europe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{explore the}} {{hypothesis}} that long-term commitments affect the dynamics of Government expenditure. This results in a novel view of the fiscal policy variable, which is seen to consist of {{only a part of}} the <b>total</b> <b>current</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the rest being pre-determined by its past level. We confront this hypothesis with OECD post-war data, and find that the long-term trend in the inherited part of public expenditure is to grow {{at the same rate as}} the GDP; this implies that under budget balance the tax rate does not decrease unless Government costly dismisses existing programs. In the light of these findings, with the aid of a simple median-voter model of government size we interpret the pattern of increasing, then constant tax rates observed in OECD countries in the second half of the last century. The fiscal policy variable is found to be anti-cyclical, asymmetric and negatively affected by the joint impact of taxes and debt...|$|R
30|$|The most {{significant}} effect of the cohesion and structural funds in simulation S 1 on public accounts, see Table  4, is the increase in total public investment in almost 15 % due to the raise of “other constructions” in 22.7 %. The increase in final demand of public investment raises construction production and also labor and capital demand, but unemployment benefits only fall in 0.26 %. All other public expenditures remain almost equal to their corresponding values in the benchmark, and the effect on <b>total</b> <b>current</b> <b>expenditures</b> is negligible. However, public revenues increased in 1.25 %, a figure that almost matches the raise of VAT revenues, 1.36 %. In the current model, public investment is subject to VAT and the positive variation of public investment affects tax revenues. The impact of this policy in VAT revenues and also in VAT transfers to the EU is missing in previous studies for Spain, {{and even in the}} studies implemented for other countries. In this case, the increase in public investment funded by the European Union, and co-funded by the national government, leads to a significant raise in VAT revenues, which reduces public deficit in 2.2 %.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{determining}} whether economic, financial and monetary integration {{on the one}} hand, and institutional factors on the other, {{may have led to}} gradual convergence in key fiscal variables across the euro area over the recent period, bringing fiscal positions closer together. The Maastricht convergence criteria have facilitated this process but we investigate here whether the structural factors bringing fiscal positions closer together have been a feature of European integration starting already in the 1970 s. The alternative scenario is that the euro zone is still characterised by largely idiosyncratic national fiscal policies. Over the 1970 - 1998 period we run contemporaneous cross-correlation, dispersion and cointegration tests using annual data for government net lending, and <b>total</b> <b>current</b> revenue and <b>expenditure</b> to uncover common trends, as measures of fiscal convergence. We also investigate whether the short term fiscal position in a given country shares both a common euro area component and national features (i. e., idiosyncratic national cycles) using a dynamic factor analysis on quarterly data for the four largest euro area countries since 1985. We find convincing evidence that for euro area countries cross-correlation has increased steadily over the sample period and that fiscal dispersion has been declining at a sustained pace among all countries in the sample. There is evidence of cointegration across the euro area for several countries on the basis of <b>total</b> <b>current</b> revenue, and also for <b>total</b> <b>current</b> <b>expenditure.</b> However, when the series are corrected for the business cycle, cointegration is only accepted for net lending. There is clearly common fiscal cycles for net lending across the euro area that do not only express common business cycles. However, while countries have followed more similar policies in the 1990 s in particular during the run-up to EMU, the timing of fiscal adjustment differed across countries. In addition, idiosyncratic components still contribute to a significant share of the variability of individual countries. JEL Classification: H 60, E 61, C 22...|$|R

40|$|Background: Australian Aboriginal women attend {{antenatal care}} less {{frequently}} and experience poorer pregnancy outcomes than non-Aboriginal women. Improving access to antenatal care is recognised {{as a means}} to improve pregnancy outcomes for mother and baby. Objective: To estimate the costs of inadequate antenatal care and provide baseline measurements and implications for policy that targets improving access to care in rural and remote Western Australian (WA) Aboriginal communities. Methods: An individual sampling model of pregnancy was developed that simulated hypothetical women with pregnancy events and outcomes observed in the WA Aboriginal population. Weekly pregnancy events were modelled via logistic regression according to maternal characteristics, events during pregnancy and current gestation, with adequate and inadequate care (≥ 4 and 3 ̆c 4 antenatal visits) to reflect differences in outcomes reported in the literature. The pregnancy model simulated clinical management including antenatal visits, hospitalisations, and transfers to tertiary care. Results: The mean cost of pregnancy was AUD 8985, with a large difference depending on access to antenatal care (AUD 7635 and AUD 10, 216 for adequate and inadequate care respectively). The main difference in costs resulted from neonatal care (AUD 1021 vs AUD 3205 for adequate and inadequate care respectively). In a rural community with 150 births per year, up to AUD 123, 082 may be spent to improve access to care at no extra cost to the <b>total</b> <b>current</b> <b>expenditure</b> (AUD 1, 347, 733). Conclusions: The large difference in pregnancy costs between those receiving adequate and inadequate care demonstrates that additional expenditure on improving access to antenatal care may be cost-effective and should be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the latest estimates of Hong Kong domestic health spending between fiscal years 1989 / 90 and 2005 / 06, cross-stratified and categorised by financing source, provider, and function {{on an annual}} basis. In fiscal year 2005 / 06, total health expenditure was HK$ 71 557 million. In real terms, it grew 6. 5 % per annum on average throughout the study period, whereas gross domestic product grew 4. 1 %, indicating a growing percentage of health spending relative to gross domestic product, from 3. 5 % in 1989 / 90 to 5. 1 % in 2005 / 06. This increase was largely funded by public spending, which rose 8. 2 % per annum on average in real terms, compared with 5. 1 % for private spending. This represents a growing share of public spending from 40. 2 % to 51. 6 % of total health expenditure during the period. Public spending was the dominant source of health financing in 2005 / 06, whereas private household out-of-pocket expenditure accounted for the second largest share (34. 5 %), followed by employer-provided group medical benefits (7. 5 %), privately purchased insurance (5. 1 %), and other private sources (1. 3 %). Of the HK$ 71 557 million total health expenditure in 2005 / 06, HK$ 68 810 million (96. 2 %) was on <b>current</b> <b>expenditure</b> and HK$ 2746 million (3. 8 %) on capital expenses (ie investment in medical facilities). Services of curative care accounted for the largest share (67. 3 %) and were made up of ambulatory services (35. 7 %), in-patient services (27. 7 %), day patient hospital services (3. 4 %), and home care (0. 6 %). The second largest share was spending on medical goods outside the patient care setting (10. 8 %). In terms of health care providers, hospitals (44. 0 %) accounted for the largest share of total health expenditure in 2005 / 06, followed by providers of ambulatory health care (31. 4 %). We observed a system-wide trend towards service consolidation at institutions (as opposed to free-standing ambulatory clinics, {{most of which are}} staffed by solo practitioners). Not taking capital expenses (ie investment in medical facilities) into account, public <b>current</b> <b>expenditure</b> on health amounted to HK$ 34 849 million (50. 6 % of <b>total</b> <b>current</b> <b>expenditure)</b> in 2005 / 06, most of which was incurred at hospitals (76. 3 %), whereas private <b>current</b> <b>expenditure</b> (HK$ 33 961 million) was mostly incurred at providers of ambulatory health care (55. 8 %). This reflects the mixed health care economy of Hong Kong, where public hospitals generally account for about 90 % of total bed-days and private doctors (including western and Chinese medicine practitioners) provide about 70 % of out-patient care. Although both public and private spending were mostly expended on personal health care services and goods (93. 0 %), the patterns of distribution among functional categories differed. Public expenditure was targeted at in-patient care (53. 7 %) and substantially less on out-patient care (24. 6 %), especially low-intensity first-contact care. In comparison, private spending was concentrated on out-patient care (49. 9 %), followed by medical goods outside the patient care setting (22. 0 %) and in-patient care (19. 0 %). Compared to countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Hong Kong has devoted a relatively low percentage of gross domestic product on health services in the last decade. As a share of total spending, public funding (either general government revenue or social security funds) was also lower than in most comparably developed economies, although commensurate with its public revenue collection base. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The framework also generates a data-driven reference band for the projections, and is therefore convenient to update. The framework {{is applied to the}} current World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast period and the Great Recession to compare its performance to past projections.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the latest estimates of Hong Kong domestic health spending for fiscal years 1989 / 90 to 2006 / 07, cross-stratified and categorised by financing source, provider, and function. Total expenditure on health (TEH) was HK$ 75 048 million {{in fiscal year}} 2006 / 07, which represents an increase of HK$ 4405 million or 6. 2 % over the preceding year. Represented {{as a percentage of}} gross domestic product (GDP), TEH increased from 3. 6 % in 1989 / 90 to 5. 6 % in 2003 / 04 and then decreased to 5. 0 % by 2006 / 07. Taking population growth into account, total health spending per capita (at constant 2007 prices) grew at an average annual rate of 5. 1 %, which was faster than the average annual growth rate of per capita GDP by 2. 1 percentage points. In 2006 / 07, government financing of health expenditure was HK$ 37 417 million (49. 9 % of TEH), which was the first time it was surpassed by private spending (HK$ 37 631 million) in the last decade {{as a result of the}} continued growth of private spending (averaging 9. 5 % per annum in real terms since 2002 / 03). The second important source of health financing was out-of-pocket payments by households (35. 2 %), followed by employer-provided medical benefits (7. 4 %) and private insurance (5. 6 %). Private insurance has taken on an increasingly important role for financing private spending, whereas household and employer expenditure together has shown a corresponding decrease during the same period. Of the HK$ 75 048 million total health expenditure in 2006 / 07, <b>current</b> <b>expenditure</b> comprised HK$ 71 888 million (95. 8 %), whereas HK$ 3161 million (4. 2 %) was for capital expenses (ie investment in medical facilities). Analysed by health care function, services for curative care accounted for the largest share of total health spending (66. 2 %) which was made up of ambulatory services (35. 2 %), in-patient curative care (27. 1 %), day patient hospital services (3. 4 %), and home care (0. 5 %). In response to the escalating demand for private health care, private hospitals had increased capital expenditure leading to an observed increase in investment in medical facilities from 2. 2 % to 4. 2 % of total spending over the period 2002 / 03 to 2006 / 07. Analysed by health care provider, hospitals accounted for the largest share (42. 7 %) and providers of ambulatory health care the second largest share (30. 9 %) of total health expenditure in 2006 / 07. The downward trend in hospital share after 2002 / 03 was primarily driven by the reduced public spending on hospitals, albeit with continued growth in corresponding private spending since 1997 / 98. Meanwhile, expenditure at providers of ambulatory services accounted for an increasing share of health spending after 2003 / 04, mainly due to increases in the volume and expenditure for private services. Not taking into account capital expenses (ie investment in medical facilities), public <b>current</b> <b>expenditure</b> on health amounted to HK$ 35 437 million (49. 3 % of <b>total</b> <b>current</b> <b>expenditure)</b> in 2006 / 07 with the remaining HK$ 36 451 million made up of private sources of funds. Expenditure on hospital care (HK$ 32 069 million) was predominately funded by general government revenue (83. 8 %), whereas that on providers of ambulatory health care (HK$ 23 201 million) was by private household out-of-pocket payments (67. 3 %). This reflects the mixed health care economy of Hong Kong, where public hospitals generally account for about 90 % of total bed-days and private doctors (including western and Chinese medicine practitioners) provide about 70 % of the out-patient care. Although both public and private spending were mostly expended on personal health care services and goods (92. 2 % of total spending), the distributional patterns among functional categories differed.

Statistical reports from OECD shows that health expenditure and GDP have growing positively in Norway for decades. However, there is gap in empirical researches examining long-run relationship between health care expenditure and income for longer time-series. Objective: To investigate long run relationship between health expenditure per capita and GDP per capita for the period 1970 - 2012 in Norway and estimate and compare income elasticity of health spending among some OECD countries. Method: A quantitative research method is adopted. This study investigates the relationship between per capita health care expenditure and GDP per capita in Norway over the period 1970 - 2012 by employing dynamic version of Engle and Granger error correction mechanism (ECM). It examines unit root properties of the series, by using Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test, and cointegration between health spending and income. Income elasticity of healthcare expenditure for Norway and some other OECD countries is estimated. Both estimations of ECM and elasticity are conducted by OLS regression method. Data for <b>total</b> <b>current</b> health <b>expenditure</b> per capita (HCE) and GDP per capita (PGDP) at 2005 constant price in national currency unit are obtained from OECD online sources. Both HCE and PGDP are natural logarithmic transformed as lnHCE and lnPGDP respectively. Result: A time series unit root test showed that both lnHCE and lnPGDP are integrated of the same order, I(1). Estimation of Error correction model (ECM) confirmed presence of stable long- run equilibrium between health expenditure and income in Norway. Coefficient of error correction (ECT) is negative 0. 75 showing fast adjustment to steady sate equilibrium. Short- run parts of the ECM revealed both current and lagged GDP per capita positively determines health expenditure in short run, though they are not statistically significant. Last year s health expenditure has significant effect on <b>current</b> health <b>expenditure.</b> Income elasticities of health spending are more than unity Norway, US, UK, Australia, Finland, the Netherlands and Canada. It was equal to 1. 2 for Spain. Conclusion: Series of healthcare expenditure and income have unit root in level and are stationary in difference. There exists steady sate long-run equilibrium between health spending and GDP. Health care is necessary good for Norway. Income elasticity of health spending is not stable over time...|$|R
30|$|Fire {{management}} costs are quite variable over time, {{with the average}} percentage expenditure for DOC of fire {{management costs}} (e.g. pre-suppression, suppression) is generally 7  % (of the total natural heritage expenditures of DOC {{for each of the}} previous six financial years). As some costs occurred over different years (e.g. Thermal imaging camera costs, <b>total</b> fire <b>expenditures,</b> <b>current</b> RPA cost, etc.), in order to reduce inflation-based bias, all costs are expressed in 2013 Q 3 figures using the reserve bank inflation calculator ([URL] in order to minimise any inflation ambiguity. A summary of the parameters tested for each scenario is presented in Table 1. As the cost data was not considered to be as detailed as possible (e.g. there could be more appropriate or cheaper RPA-FLIR systems available–such as the recent iphone/FLIR app/add-on ([URL] accessed 20 / 01 / 2014). unknown actual thermal/FLIR returns, unknown actual discount rates), variability was included into each cost benefit analysis, by running the NPV calculations using a Monte Carlo simulation model (a total of 5000 simulations).|$|R
