25|$|Davros, {{which does}} not feature the Daleks, {{apparently}} fills in the gaps between Resurrection of the Daleks and Revelation of the Daleks, and has the scientist trying to manipulate the galaxy's economy into a war footing similar to Skaro's. The Sixth Doctor manages to defeat his plans, and Davros is last heard when his ship explodes, an event obliquely mentioned in Revelation. However the Doctor <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> survived. Davros also mentions he will work {{on a plan to}} combat famine, tying into Revelation of the Daleks.|$|E
25|$|The vagrants Varlaam and Misail, who {{are dressed}} as monks and are begging for alms, and their {{companion}} Grigoriy, {{who is in}} secular garb, arrive and enter. After exchanging greetings, Varlaam requests some wine. When the Hostess returns with a bottle, he drinks and launches into a ferocious song ("So {{it was in the}} city of Kazan") of Ivan the Terrible's siege of Kazan. The two monks quickly become tipsy, and soon begin to doze. Grigoriy quietly asks the Hostess for directions to the Lithuanian border. The Hostess mentions that the police are watching the ordinary roads, but they are wasting their time, because there is an alternative, less well-known way to get to the border. Policemen appear in search of a fugitive heretic monk (Grigoriy) who has run off from the Chudov Monastery declaring that he will become Tsar in Moscow. Noticing Varlaam's suspicious appearance and behavior, the lead policeman <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> found his man. He cannot read the ukaz (edict) he is carrying, however, so Grigoriy volunteers to read it. He does so, but, eyeing Varlaam carefully, he substitutes Varlaam's description for his own. The policemen quickly seize Varlaam, who protests his innocence and asks to read the ukaz. Varlaam is only barely literate, but he manages to haltingly read the description of the suspect, which of course matches Grigoriy. Grigoriy brandishes a dagger, and leaps out of the window. The men set off in pursuit.|$|E
500|$|In certain episodes, Cartman {{is shown}} to {{think of himself as}} a skilled fighter, only to be beat up by Wendy, Token, Stan, and Kyle at {{different}} times. [...] However, when Cartman <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> some sort of authority, such as being the Coon or the hallway monitor, he displays various martial arts knowledge and proves to be able to beat up various other characters such as Clyde and Bradley.|$|E

500|$|The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt {{has argued}} that the method Bates {{described}} would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization. Leavitt asked [...] "How can we tell whether someone has relaxed or imagined something, or just thinks that he or she has imagined it?" [...] In regards to the possibility of a placebo trial, Leavitt commented [...] "I cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> imagined something while we know that he has not." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Norman Osborn {{arrives at}} the {{warehouse}} to supervise an experiment on Marko. Restrained Marko will be given subdermal silicon transplants giving him a hardened untraceable silicon armor. Dr. Octavius says that the experiment has too many flaws but Osborn commands him {{to go with it}} anyway. The experiment malfunctions and the silicon violently mutates him. His body evaporates into sand and Octavius, terrified, <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> just killed him. Suddenly, Marko reshapes himself, still made of sand, and viciously thrashes against the walls for them to let him out. Hammerhead and Osborn take him outside in their limousine, where Marko is able to reform himself in his old appearance. When they tell him he will work for [...] "the Big Man," [...] but he decides to go alone and leaves. Hammerhead is fine with that as it means they will now have a distraction for Spider-Man.|$|E

On February 1, 2004 Little, Brown Young Readers published Suzan Colon's Temptation, where Clark uses red kryptonite {{in an attempt to}} impress Lana and Chloe when they are infatuated with a French exchange student.

500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two teams was in the Premier League on Boxing Day, when Arsenal came from behind to beat Chelsea. Arsenal were unbeaten {{domestically}} since December 2001 and on course to complete their first league and cup double in four years. Arsenal manager Ars√®ne Wenger was buoyant his team would complete the task on hand: [...] "We have been facing cup games in the league every week {{for a long time}} and this is just another. Chelsea will be a difficult team to beat if they are at their best on Saturday, but such is the confidence in this squad, we just feel we can win every game." [...] When asked what he made of Sir Alex Ferguson's comments that Manchester United played the best football in England, Wenger retorted: [...] "What do you want me to say? Everybody <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the prettiest wife." [...] The Arsenal manager was undecided whether to drop Richard Wright who started in every round of the FA Cup for David Seaman and to recall Sol Campbell who recovered from a hamstring injury.|$|E
500|$|He next {{appears in}} the third season episode [...] "The First Time". He has {{transferred}} to another high school from McKinley for his senior year, fearing {{that he might be}} outed if he stayed; he sees Kurt in a gay bar, and tells Kurt he has become a regular there and feels accepted. He is Kurt's secret admirer for Valentine's Day in the episode [...] "Heart", and after Kurt gently turns him down, he is recognized by a classmate, who later spreads the word to others in the school that Karofsky is gay. In [...] "On My Way", he is taunted and bullied by his athletic teammates and by others, at school and using online media, so severely that he attempts to hang himself, but is saved by his father, who finds him in time. Kurt visits Karofsky in the hospital where Karofsky tells Kurt his best friend never wants to see him again and how his mother <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a disease and can be [...] "cured". Karofsky, in tears the whole time, again apologizes to Kurt saying he made Kurt's life hell but he couldn't handle it himself, and the two agree to become friends.|$|E
500|$|Professor Cuthbert Calculus (Professeur Tryphon Tournesol in Herg√©'s {{original}} version; tournesol is the French {{word for}} sunflower) is an absent-minded and partially-deaf physicist {{and a regular}} character alongside Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock. He was introduced in Red Rackham's Treasure, and based partially on , a Swiss physicist. The leading characters do not initially welcome his presence, but through his generous nature and his scientific ability, he develops a lasting bond with them. Eventually, {{by the end of}} Land of Black Gold, he becomes a resident of Marlinspike Hall. Normally mild-mannered and dignified, Calculus occasionally loses his temper and acts in a spectacularly aggressive manner in response to actual or perceived insults, such as when Captain Haddock belittles his work or accuses him of [...] "acting the goat". He is a fervent believer in dowsing, and carries a pendulum for that purpose. Calculus's deafness is a frequent source of humour, as he repeats back what he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. He does not admit to being near-deaf and insists he is only [...] "a little hard of hearing in one ear." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2000 interview, William Asher {{described}} Temperatures Rising {{as being}} about: [...] "a young black surgeon {{who was always}} into mischief and things, {{but he was a}} very competent surgeon. James Whitmore was the head surgeon and he used to drive Whitmore crazy". The pilot episode of Temperatures Rising was written by Sheldon Keller, who turned to his This is a Hospital? script for inspiration. It features Noland broadcasting a bingo game in code over the hospital's public-address system. Jack Albertson guest starred as a United States Senator. Subsequent episodes feature Noland performing a secret operation on a young baseball player while Campanelli deals with a hospital inspector (Ed Platt), and John Astin as a gangster wanting Noland to be his personal physician. In another episode, Noland hypnotizes a patient (Alice Ghostley) and, accidentally, Nurse Turner as well. This nearly costs the hospital a large donation from a potential benefactor (Charles Lane). In later episodes, Campanelli is seen having a brief romance with Nurse Turner's aunt (Beverly Garland), Noland helps out a new intern (Bernie Kopell) who has a reputation for being a jinx, and also performs a witchcraft ritual on a patient (Alan Oppenheimer) who <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been cursed.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} a 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 56 metascore on Metacritic. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby, while quite {{critical}} of the film overall, praised Douglas' work as [...] "the funniest, canniest performance of his career". Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised it for allowing [...] "all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense. The movie can be followed by anybody, because the details of stock manipulation are all filtered through transparent layers of greed. Most {{of the time we}} know what's going on. All of the time, we know why". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "This time he works up a salty sweat to end up nowhere, like a triathlete on a treadmill. But as long as he keeps his players in venal, perpetual motion, it is great scary fun to watch him work out". In his review for the Globe and Mail, Jay Scott praised the performances of the two leads: [...] "But Douglas's portrayal of Gordon Gekko is an oily triumph and as the kid Gekko <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> found in Fox ('Poor, smart and hungry; no feelings'), Charlie Sheen evolves persuasively from gung-ho capitalist child to wily adolescent corporate raider to morally appalled adult". Rita Kempley in the Washington Post wrote that the film [...] "is at its weakest when it preaches visually or verbally. Stone doesn't trust the time-honored story line, supplementing the obvious moral with plenty of soapboxery".|$|E

2500|$|Bad ending: Torque is in a semi-unconscious {{state on}} the shore of Carnate, with Killjoy (John Armstrong) berating him, telling him he thought he was cured, and warning if he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> seen the worst of things, he is mistaken. With that, mercenaries arrive and place Torque on a helicopter, with one of them saying, [...] "we have secured the prime target." ...|$|E

Later, during an outing in the countryside with fellow adventurer and girlfriend Patricia Holm, Templar stumbles upon a secret British government installation where he and Holm witness the testing of a deadly and mysterious weapon‚Äîthe electroncloud machine, which creates a vapour capable of turning anything (and anyone) it touches into ash.|$|E
