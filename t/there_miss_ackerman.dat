6000|$|... "Now you're {{just wrong}} <b>there,</b> <b>Miss</b> Maggie!" [...] said Tom. [...] "You think you're very wise. But bonus means 'good,' as it happens--bonus, bona, bonum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't. It {{was quite}} by {{accident}} that we met <b>there.</b> <b>Miss</b> Shirley {{was anxious to}} keep her presence in the house a secret from everybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} have me <b>there,</b> <b>Miss</b> Von Taer. And what do I know about society? Just nothing at all. It's out of my line entirely." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "To be sure I does--I {{like the}} capt'in--och, he's a jontleman-- and I likes the missus; she's a laddy--and I likes Miss Beuly, who's a swate young woman--and then <b>there's</b> <b>Miss</b> Maud, who's {{the delight of}} my eyes. Fegs, but isn't she a crathure to relish!" ...|$|R

PLEASE, Diana, go and explain." ...|$|R
