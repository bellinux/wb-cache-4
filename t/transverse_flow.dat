In 1973, simple {{harmonic}} (SH) {{stationary waves}} in an artery, observed during a radiologist’s rapid injection of radiopaque x-ray “dye” (arteriographic standing waves), at turbulent arterial flow rates, contradicted chaos, initiated research into transition to turbulence (Hamilton 1980). The SH {{high and low}} pressure bands suggested that SH standing wave sound accompanied the periodic fluid shear waves that develop in compliant-walled arteries (G Hamilton 1980, and 2015).2. In wind and water flow, SH waves arise on flat sand surfaces in transition and grow in amplitude in turbulence; photographs show sand particles ejected vertically from troughs and deposited at shallow angles on the following crests of SH sand waves; “.... instead of finding chaos and disorder, the observer never fails to be amazed at a simplicity of form, an exactitude of repetition and a geometric order...” (Bagnold 1941; G Hamilton 2015). 3. In water flow in glass cylinders, SH waves of tiny glass beads begin accumulating in transition along the tube base, persisting and growing in turbulence; Thomas related the glass bead waves to Bagnold’s SH sand waves (Thomas 1964), believing the underlying physics was the same. The SH glass bead waves slide slowly along the shiny glass cylinder; Bagnold’s stationary sand waves cannot slide on sand (Hamilton 2015). If, as with Bagnold’s sand waves, the glass bead waves were stationary, they would resemble the SH particle waves in a glass tube in the Kundt’s tube standing wave sound experiment.4. SH edge tones (and notes of a flute) appear during transition, persisting and growing in amplitude at turbulent flow rates (Sondhaus 1854; Krüger 1920). 5. As SH sound triggered turbulence in laminar cylinder water flow, the now turbulent efflux jet would split into 2, 3, or more similar jets (Tyndall 1867). In water flow, a cylinder’s turbulent column shows 2. 3, or more similar <b>transverse</b> <b>flow</b> sectors, each sector displaying a centripetal streaming flow from the BL, flanked {{by a pair of}} counter-rotating vortices (Hof 2004; Fitzgerald 2004). Logic suggests Tyndall’s turbulent flow divisions are the Hof cylinder sectors (Hamilton 2015). 6. Turbulence in tubes with triangular or rectangular cross sections also revealed organizes <b>transverse</b> <b>flow</b> divisions - a transverse centripetal streaming flow arising from the BL of each mid-wall, flanked by a pair of counter-rotating vortices (J Nikuradse 1931). 7.

The in-medium nucleon-nucleon (NN) elastic cross sections are evaluated with the scaling approach according to the effective mass and their influence on collective flows in heavy-ion collisions are discussed. The inelastic cross sections, in particular for the process of the channel NΔ→NN, are parameterized in accordance with the available experimental data.

Asymmetry exists downstream of installation effects such as elbows or tees. Usually, the velocity flow profile is described on two planes 90° apart. Using the latest software technology a full pipe cross sectional description of the velocity profile is possible provided sufficient data points are given.|$|E
