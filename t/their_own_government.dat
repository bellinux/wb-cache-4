On 28 August, Thanou-Christophilou's caretaker cabinet was sworn in, with George Chouliarakis being sworn in as the interim Minister of Finance.|$|E
5|$|The American Civil War {{was a major}} {{conflict}} fought {{between the}} federal government of the United States and eleven of its member States which sought to secede and to create <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government,</b> the Confederate States of America. It started on April 12, 1861, shortly after Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United States, and ended four years later on April 9, 1865. During the war over 10,000 military engagements took place and more than 3 million people fought {{on both sides with}} 40% of the battles being fought in the states of Virginia and Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, the Rowlatt Act gave {{extensive}} {{powers to}} the British government and police, and allowed indefinite {{arrest and detention}} of individuals, warrant-less searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship of media and publications. The public opposition to this act eventually led to mass campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power. Indians, who were seeking independence and <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government,</b> were particularly influenced by the independence of Ireland {{and the development of}} the Irish constitution. Also, the directive principles of state policy in Irish constitution were looked upon by the people of India as an inspiration for the independent India's government to comprehensively tackle complex social and economic challenges across a vast, diverse nation and population.|$|E
5|$|Ethiopia is a polyethnic nation {{consisting}} of 80 {{different ethnic groups}} and 84 indigenous languages. Due to the diverse population and rural areas throughout the nation, it was nearly impossible to create a strong centralized state; though it was eventually accomplished through political evolution. Prior to 1974, nationalism was only discussed within radical student groups, but by the late 20th century the issue {{had come to the}} forefront of political debate. Ethiopia was forced to modernize their political system to properly handle the nationalism debates. The Derg military government took control with a Marxist–Leninist ideology, urging self-determination and rejecting compromise over any nationality issues. In the 1980s, Ethiopia suffered a series of famines and after the USSR broke apart, they lost their aid from the Soviet Union and the Derg government collapsed. Eventually Ethiopia restabilized and adopted a modern political system that models a federal parliamentary republic. It was still impossible to create a central government holding all power, so the government was torn. The central federal government now presides over ethnically-based regional states and each ethnic state is granted the right to establish <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government</b> and democracy.|$|E
5|$|The Resale Prices Bill was {{introduced}} to deny manufacturers and suppliers the power to stipulate the prices at which their goods must be sold by the retailer. At the time, up to forty per cent of goods sold in Britain were subject to such price fixing, {{to the detriment of}} competition and to the disadvantage of the consumer. Douglas-Home, less instinctively liberal on economic matters than Heath, would probably not have sponsored such a proposal unprompted. However, he gave Heath his backing, in the face of opposition from some cabinet colleagues, including Butler, Hailsham and Lloyd, and a substantial number of Conservative backbenchers. They believed the change would benefit supermarkets and other large retailers at the expense of proprietors of small shops. The government was forced to make concessions to avoid defeat. Retail price maintenance would continue to be legal for some goods; these included books, on which it remained in force until market forces led to its abandonment in 1995. Manufacturers and suppliers would also be permitted to refuse to supply any retailer who sold their goods at less than cost price, as a loss leader. The bill had a difficult Parliamentary passage during which the Labour party generally abstained, leaving the Conservatives to vote for or against <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government.</b> The bill received the royal assent in July 1964, but did not become operative until 1965, by which time Douglas-Home, Heath and their colleagues were out of office.|$|E

25|$|From 1948 {{until its}} repeal in 2013, Voice of America was {{forbidden}} to broadcast directly to American citizens under § 501 of the Smith–Mundt Act. The act was repealed {{as a result}} of the passing of the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2013. The intent of the legislation in 1948 was to protect the American public from propaganda actions by <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

The Abbasids took this opportunity to set up <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government</b> in Sindh. The Soomra dynasty ruled Sindh as the functionary of the Abbasid Caliphate until the Siege of Baghdad (1258). Mansurah was {{the capital of the}} Soomra Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|The Irish Catholics formed <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government,</b> Confederate Ireland, {{to fight}} the {{subsequent}} wars. They negotiated with Charles I, for, among other things, {{an end to the}} plantations and a partial reversal of the existing ones. During the following ten years, murderous fighting took place between the rival ethnic and religious blocks throughout Ireland until the Irish Catholics were finally crushed and the country occupied by the New Model Army in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649 to 1653.|$|E
25|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Civil War, the Nationalists began to organize <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government</b> machinery, considering those institutions that remained {{under the control of the}} Republican government in Madrid as illegitimate and illegal. As such, a parallel central bank, headquartered in Burgos, was formed. Both Republican and Nationalist banks claimed to be the legitimate Bank of Spain, both domestically and internationally. The central headquarters of the Bank of Spain in Madrid, and thus its gold reserves, as well as its most important provincial delegations, were kept under the control of the Republican government, while the Nationalists gained control of the provincial delegations within their territory, including Burgos.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, Soviet whalers had no {{international}} observers on board, and no {{conservation groups}} following them at sea. By 1962, humpback, blue and fin whales were getting {{harder to find}} in the North Pacific, and the Soviet whalers, under great pressure from <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government</b> to meet production targets, deliberately chose to hunt right whales, apparently killing every right whale they could over the next eight years, in the North Pacific and also the southern oceans. The Soviet government then filed fraudulent reports with the Bureau of International Whaling Statistics and the International Whaling Commission, admitting killing during this period only one right whale, by accident.|$|E
25|$|After declaring their independence, {{the provinces}} of Holland, Zeeland, Groningen, Friesland, Utrecht, Overijssel, and Gelderland formed a confederation. All these duchies, lordships and {{counties}} were autonomous and had <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government,</b> the States-Provincial. The States General, the confederal government, were seated in The Hague and consisted of representatives {{from each of the}} seven provinces. The sparsely populated region of Drenthe was part of the republic too, although it was not considered one of the provinces. Moreover, the Republic had come to occupy during the Eighty Years' War a number of so-called Generality Lands in Flanders, Brabant and Limburg. Their population was mainly Roman Catholic, and these areas did not have a governmental structure of their own, and were used as a buffer zone between the Republic and the Spanish-controlled Southern Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland {{each have}} <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government</b> or {{executive}}, {{led by a}} First Minister (or, {{in the case of}} Northern Ireland, a diarchal First Minister and deputy First Minister), and a devolved unicameral legislature. England, the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK's government and parliament on all issues. This situation has given rise to the so-called West Lothian question which concerns the fact that members of parliament from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can vote, sometimes decisively, on matters that only affect England. The McKay Commission reported on this matter in March 2013 recommending that laws affecting only England should need support from a majority of English members of parliament.|$|E

25|$|Until the Servian reforms, {{the passing}} of laws and {{judgment}} was the prerogative of the comitia curiata (curiate assembly), made up from thirty curiae; Roman sources describe ten curiae for each of three aristocratic tribes or clans, each supposedly based on one of Rome's central hills, and claiming patrician status {{by virtue of their}} descent from Rome's founding families. These tribes comprised approximately 200 gentes (clans), each of which contributed one senator ("elder") to the Senate. The senate advised the king, devised laws in his name, and was held to represent the entire populus Romanus (Roman people); but it could only debate and discuss. Its decisions had no force unless approved by the comitia curiata. By the time of Servius, if not long before, the tribes of the comitia were a minority of the population, ruling a multitude who had no effective voice in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Roman Catholics who {{originate}} {{from the present}} state of Goa, a region on the west coast of India, and their descendants are generally referred to as Goan Catholics. After the Portuguese possession of Goa in 1510, the Portuguese consolidated their power by imposing <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government</b> and cultural traditions some of which are still retained in Goa. Many pre-Portuguese Hindu (and some Islamic) traditions were adapted or retained by the Goan Catholics. This often includes the Hindu caste system although it is not widely practiced. Throughout the Portuguese Empire a large part of civic administration (e.g. registration of birth, marriage and death, schools, hospitals, orphanages, etc.) was initially maintained by the religious orders and it is still possible to find these records with the Catholic church in Goa. All Goans born before 1961 were Portuguese citizens by birth and many present-day Goans and their descendants are reclaiming their ancestral right.|$|E
25|$|The era of European {{colonialism}} {{lasted from}} the 16th to 19th centuries and involved European powers vastly extending their reach {{around the globe}} by establishing colonies in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The dismantling of European empires following World War II saw the process of decolonization begin in earnest. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill jointly released the Atlantic Charter, which broadly outlined {{the goals of the}} U.S. and British governments. One of the main clauses of the charter acknowledged the right of all people to choose <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>government.</b> The document became the foundation for the United Nations and all of its components were integrated into the UN Charter, giving the organization a mandate to pursue global decolonization. Despite a uniform effort by the United Nations, modern postcolonial states vary widely in terms of political and economic stability.|$|E
