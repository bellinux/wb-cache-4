5|$|Although {{he shared}} {{interests}} in both philanthropy and military affairs with his father, they eventually had a falling out while Johnston {{served as a}} State Assemblyman, and was bitterly opposed by his father in {{a vote on the}} 1889 World's Fair Bill. The feud became so heated that while Johnston was Mayor of Tivoli, his father, who owned the building where the town government met, barred his son from entering the building. The village government was forced <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> building and remained there until 1894, when they finally returned to de Peyster's building. Another incident occurred and was reported in the press when Johnston's mother fell ill, and he visited her at the de Peyster family home and was violently assaulted by his father. The father {{went so far as to}} run against his son for Mayor of Tivoli in 1900, but was defeated in the general election.|$|E
5|$|The duo wrote three songs while touring {{in support}} of their debut album Felt Mountain, but decided to take their work in a {{different}} direction with more rhythmic music. Goldfrapp chose to record in a studio in a Bohemian area of Bath, England, because they needed a place to put their equipment and start working. The band began working on the album in January 2002 with a list of songs they wanted to try to record, such as a disco song with only string instruments. The studio's walls were covered in neon lights and Alison Goldfrapp used them to write down her song ideas. They recorded early demos and worked on pre-production using a Yamaha 02R digital mixing console. Goldfrapp held jam sessions with Mark Linkous and Adrian Utley and, after they built momentum writing the album, decided not <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> studio.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm track}} brought Mireille {{west of the}} most {{populated}} island of Honshu, limiting damage there compared to Kyushu. At Misawa Air Base, the strong winds knocked over trees and blew off the roofs of several warehouses, and also knocked off storage sheds off their foundation. Ahead of the storm, advance warning allowed the American military to shelter aircraft and warn the population. Damage was estimated between $500,000$1.5million. Two of Mazda's loading docks in Hiroshima were completely destroyed, affecting American inventories of 1992 Mazda 929's {{until the end of}} November 1991. Also in the city, 1.1million residents, or 80% of households, lost power due to winds and storm surge. In Yamaguchi Prefecture, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company was flooded with 0.6m (2ft) of waters, forcing workers <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> plant in the United States. The strong winds and waves damaged the Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima and Kenroku-en northwest of Tokyo. In Okayama Prefecture, salt spray damaged railways and shut down lines for three days. High winds in Naka-ku collapsed scaffolding from a parking garage, and another damaged scaffolding nearby forced a road to shut down. There were extensive crop losses in northern Honshu. In Toyama Prefecture, the winds destroyed 192greenhouses and exasperated a fire that caused further crop damage.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, {{with the}} {{ascension}} of Nazis {{to power in}} Germany, von Hippel decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> country, mainly because his wife was Jewish, but due also to his political stance against the new regime. In 1934 {{he was able to}} secure a position with the University at Istanbul, Turkey, then spent a year in Denmark, working at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. In 1936, accepting an invitation by Karl Compton, von Hippel moved again, this time to the U.S., and became an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During this time, he studied the properties and behavior of high voltage gas discharges, using positive and negative Lichtenberg figures recorded on photographic film. In 1940 he founded the Laboratory for Insulation Research, which soon {{became one of the most}} important research and education centers in this area in the world.|$|E
25|$|During the 2004–05 season, Charisteas scored five {{goals in}} 11 matches for Werder Bremen, {{before moving to}} the Netherlands to play for Ajax for a {{reported}} fee of €4.5 million. Greece manager Otto Rehhagel had publicly urged Charisteas to try <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> club during the January 2005 transfer window, in order to get more first-team action. Ajax fitted the bill, as they were hoping to find a replacement for Swedish international striker Zlatan Ibrahimović, who had been sold to Juventus. Charisteas made his Ajax debut on 23 January 2005 against FC Utrecht and scored his first goal four days later against SC Heerenveen. However, he only managed three more games all season. Charisteas netted home eight goals in the 2005–06 season, which included a late winner against Vitesse Arnhem. Charisteas missed Greece's crucial match in the World Cup qualifying due to a head injury received after colliding with Arsenal's Kolo Touré in a Champions League match which Ajax lost 2–1.|$|E
25|$|General de Peyster {{was known}} as the largest {{developer}} in the village of Tivoli, New York, where he resided at his family home. In 1892 he replaced a wooden Methodist church with a brick structure that stands today. He also refurbished an old school into an industrial school for girls. An authority on fire fighting, in 1895 de Peyster erected a huge state-of-the-art brick building for the local department. A portrait of him resides there in present day, and it was used as a firehouse until 1986. The high Victorian structure also contained a courtroom, a jail and a large meeting room for the local government. The General eventually had a conflict with the village Mayor (his own son, Johnston de Peyster), and de Peyster barred him from entering the building. The village government was forced <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> building and remained there until the Firehouse was restored in 1994, returning the local government to de Peyster's building.|$|E
50|$|A HAG runs {{multiple}} virtual machines {{or physical}} machines - {{one or more}} subsystems for the lower classification, one (or more) subsystems for the higher classification. The hardware runs a type of Knowledge Management software that examines data {{coming out of the}} higher classification subsystem and rejects any data that is classified higher than the lower classification. In general, a HAG allows lower classified data that resides on a higher classified system <b>to</b> be <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> lower classified system. For example, in the US, it would allow unclassified information residing on a Secret classified system <b>to</b> be <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> Unclassified system. Through various rules and filters, the HAG ensures that data is of the lower classification and then allows the transfer.|$|R

25|$|On 10 November 2014, the Bloomington {{city council}} voted 5-4 to {{purchase}} four {{acres of land}} near McGraw Park in Empire Business park using state funds and to rent the land to CCHS {{for use as a}} football practice field.

In 2009, state senator and CCHS alum Bill Brady had arranged a $750,000 state legislative grant for the purchase as part of a General Assembly capital bill. Alderman Jim Fruin, another CCHS alum, voted in favor. CCHS agreed to spend at least $20,000 to improve the land, pay an annual rent of $1,700, as well as maintain, mow, and clean the field. The annual cost to the city was estimated to be $2,500 and the land was {{to be used as a}} park when not in use by the school.|$|E
25|$|Now {{left with}} only seven of his {{original}} jeeps, Farran pressed on, {{the remainder of the}} troopers strafing a passing goods train, puncturing the boiler on its engine and forcing it to come to a halt. Eventually they linked up with Grant-Hibbert's men after one final encounter during their journey, assaulting a German radar station and causing the German garrison to flee; prisoners informed the SAS troopers that they believed the jeeps to be the advance guard of General George S. Patton's United States Third Army. Farran took command of the combined group, which consisted of a composite squadron of 60 troopers, 10 jeeps and a civilian truck, and ordered it <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> base to avoid further German scrutiny. The squadron roamed around until the end of August, assaulting German troop convoys and facilities, and then split into three groups to maximise the area they could cover and the damage that could be dealt to the German forces. Throughout their entire time behind German lines they were supplied by the Royal Air Force in 36 sorties, which supplied by the SAS with 12 new jeeps and 36 supply panniers. Operation Wallace came to an end on 17 September, when the groups linked up with advance elements of the United States Seventh Army; during the month they had been active, Farran and his men had caused more than 500 German casualties, destroyed some 95 enemy vehicles and more than 100,000 gallons of petrol. 17 SAS troopers had been lost, including one in a parachuting accident, as well as 16 jeeps. After linking up with the American forces, Farran sent the squadron back to Paris and granted it a week's leave in the capital, despite it officially being out of bounds to all British troops. As a result of these actions, Farran was awarded a Distinguished Service Order, which unusually was awarded under the pseudonym of 'Patrick McGinty'; Farran had used the name since his escape from German captivity in 1941, and claimed that the name was a reference to an Irish song.|$|E
