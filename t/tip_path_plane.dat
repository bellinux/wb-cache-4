40|$|An amended six {{degree of}} freedom {{helicopter}} stability and control derivative model was developed in which body acceleration and control rate derivatives {{were included in the}} Taylor series expansion. These additional derivatives were derived from consideration {{of the effects of the}} higher order rotor flapping dynamics, which are known to be inadequately represented in the conventional six {{degree of freedom}}, quasistatic stability derivative model. The amended model was a substantial improvement over the conventional model, effectively doubling the unsable bandwidth and providing a more accurate representation of the short period and cross axis characteristics. Further investigations assessed the applicability of the two stability derivative model structures for flight test parameter identification. Parameters were identified using simulation data generated from a higher order base line model having sixth order rotor <b>tip</b> <b>path</b> <b>plane</b> dynamics.

A 12 -microphone, 500 -ft radius semicircular array combined with two aircraft headings provided acoustic data over the full 360 -deg azimuth about the aircraft with a resolution of 15 deg.

40|$|A {{turbulence}} {{model has}} been developed for blade-element helicopter simulation. This model, called Simulation of Rotor Blade Element Turbulence (SORBET), uses an innovative temporal and geometrical distribution algorithm that preserves the statistical characteristics of the turbulence spectra over the rotor disc, while providing velocity components in real time to each of five blade-element stations along each of four blades. An initial investigation of SORBET has been performed using a piloted, motion-based simulation of the Sikorsky UH 60 A Black Hawk. Although only the vertical component of stochastic turbulence {{was used in this}} investigation, vertical turbulence components induce vehicle responses in all translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the helicopter. The single-degree-of-freedom configuration of SORBET was compared to a conventional full 6 -degrees-of-freedom baseline configuration, where translational velocity inputs are superimposed at the vehicle center of gravity, and rotational velocity inputs are created from filters that approximate the immersion rate into the turbulent field. For high-speed flight the vehicle responses were satisfactory for both models. Test pilots could not distinguish differences between the baseline configuration and SORBET. In low-speed flight the baseline configuration received criticism for its high frequency content, whereas the SORBET model elicited favorable pilot opinion. For this helicopter, which has fully articulated blades, results from SORBET show that vehicle responses to turbulent blade-station disturbances are severely attenuated. This is corroborated by in-flight observation of the rotor <b>tip</b> <b>path</b> <b>plane</b> as compared to vehicle responses...|$|E

The tiltrotor {{is able to}} transport passengers relatively quickly {{from the center of}} a city to destinations within a 300 -mile radius. For such vehicles to be commercially viable, the interior noise and vibration levels must be acceptable to the passengers. A review of the literature revealed very little structural-acoustic data related to the tiltrotor. For this reason, structural-acoustic measurements were taken aboard an XV- 15 tiltrotor. The six flight conditions included five in level flight, nominally 140 - 220 knots, for airplane mode (nacelle at 0 degrees) and one out-of-ground-effect (OGE) hover (nacelle at 90 degrees).

40|$|For many years, {{analysts have}} been {{puzzled by the}} fact that the {{off-axis}} coupling of a helicopter exhibits the opposite sign in flight tests as compared to simulations. Recently, researchers have shown that the effect may be attributable to the bending of the wake during a pitching maneuver, which introduces a fore-to-aft gradient in induced flow that can reverse the predicted sign of the roll coupling. Other research as shown that this result can also be obtained with momentum and vortex theory. There are many issues still under debate regarding the magnitude of wake distortion and its effectiveness in predicting off-axis dynamics. In the present work, a generalized ynamic wake model is augmented to include wake distortions. This model is then coupled with a flap model for simulation in low speed forward flight.

We study a prototypical model for rate-induced tipping, the saddle-node normal form subject to time-varying equilibrium drift and noise. We find that both most commonly used early-warning indicators, increase in variance and increase in autocorrelation, occur not when the equilibrium drift is fastest but with a delay. We explain this delay by demonstrating that the most likely trajectory for tipping also crosses the tipping threshold with a delay and therefore the tipping itself is delayed.
