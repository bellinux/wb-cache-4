5|$|In the {{election}} of 1796, under the Constitution as it stood then, each of the presidential electors had two votes, which they were to cast for different men. The one who received most votes would become President, the second-most, Vice President. This system was not designed with the operation of parties in mind, {{as they had been}} thought disreputable and factious. The Federalists planned <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> by having all their Electors vote for John Adams, the Vice President, and all but a few for Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The single-instruction-single-data (SISD) {{classification}} {{is equivalent}} to an entirely sequential program. The single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) classification is analogous to doing the same operation repeatedly over a large data set. This is commonly done in signal processing applications. Multiple-instruction-single-data (MISD) is a rarely used classification. While computer architectures <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> were devised (such as systolic arrays), few applications that fit this class materialized.

5|$|Another {{international}} {{problem was}} the slave trade, and the African squadron was formed in 1820 <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> threat. Politically, {{the suppression of the}} slave trade was unpopular, and the squadron was withdrawn in 1823 ostensibly to deal with piracy in the Caribbean, and did not return to the African coast until the passage of the Webster–Ashburton treaty with Britain in 1842. After the treaty was passed, the United States used fewer ships than the treaty required, ordered the ships based far from the coast of Africa, and used ships that were too large to operate close to shore. Between 1845 and 1850, the United States Navy captured only 10 slave vessels, while the British captured 423 vessels carrying 27,000 captives.|$|E
5|$|Spurred on by this success, the Red Army {{planned a}} series of {{follow-up}} offensives in January and February 1943 intended to decisively beat the German forces in southern Russia. After {{the destruction of the}} remaining Hungarian and Italian forces during the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive, Operation Star and Operation Gallop were launched to recapture Kharkov and Kursk and to cut off all German forces east of Donetsk. Those operations succeeded in breaking through the German lines and threatened the whole southern part of the German front. <b>To</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> threat, Army Group Don, Army Group B, and parts of Army Group A were united as Army Group South (Heeresgruppe Süd) under Manstein's command in early February.|$|E
5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special water-tight boxes called caissons were invented <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} and use of the term Wicca within contemporary Paganism has been a recurring topic of discussion in the field of Pagan studies. The majority of academics and independent scholars use the first, more inclusive definition. Given its historical status and prevalent usage within Paganism, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White thought it the logical and easier choice for academia, although there is still some disagreement and confusion among researchers as to what defines Wicca. Among those who have used the former definition are American sociologist Margot Adler, literary scholar Chas S. Clifton, and religious studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly, while others such as the Britons Graham Harvey and Ronald Hutton failed to make their usage clear. <b>To</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> problem in future, Doyle White urged scholars to specify which definition they used in their work.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> {{shortage}} of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems {{should focus on}} training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country health care workers to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists.|$|E
5|$|Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did {{not manage}} <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> mounted force {{and use the}} sizable {{advantage}} of their army effectively. Their own Byzantine cavalry never {{played a significant role}} in the battle and were held in static reserve for most of the six days. They never pushed their attacks and even when they obtained what could have been a decisive breakthrough on the fourth day, they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, though this may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict. Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, while the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{from the}} outset, {{overcrowding}} {{has been a}} constant problem, and there have been numerous improvements to the facilities and below-ground arrangements <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this.</b> After much discussion between the then two separate operators, a major reconstruction began in 1912. This entailed a new ticket hall, serving both lines, being built {{in the basement of the}} Bakerloo station, with the Bakerloo lifts removed and new deep-level escalators opened down to the Bakerloo line level. Access to the CLR was by way of existing deep-level subways. The new works came into use on 9 May 1914 with the CLR lifts still available for passengers. By 1923 even this rearrangement was unable to cope, so a second rebuilding began. This involved a second set of escalators being built directly down to the Central line and the CLR station building becoming exit-only. On 2 October 1928, a third escalator leading to the Bakerloo platforms was opened. Unusually, lifts came back into prominence at an Underground station when, in 1942, a set of high-speed lifts came into use, largely used as an exit route from the Central line platforms directly to the Argyll Street exit building.|$|E
5|$|On 21 August, Taskforce Butler {{occupied}} the hills {{north of the}} town of Montélimar, according to revised orders from Truscott, as he considered it too weak to block the entire German force marching north. From this position, Taskforce Butler fired on the evacuating German troops, while waiting for further reinforcements. Troops from the FFI supported the Americans, harassing German troops through the entire battle. The sudden appearance of this new threat shocked Wiese and the German command. As a first countermeasure, Wietersheim's 11thPanzer Division was called in. The first of its units to arrive, together with several ad-hoc Luftwaffe battle groups, were tasked <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> new threat. This hastily assembled force mounted an attack against Puy the same day, and the Germans were able to isolate Taskforce Butler from supplies. This success was, however, short-lived, and the Germans were pushed back soon after.|$|E
5|$|To {{cope with}} the ongoing war situation, Charles had {{introduced}} martial law to large swathes of the country; he extended this during 1626 and 1627, as the financial constraints imposed by Parliament began to cut into pay, leading to soldiers rioting. Under {{the law of the}} time, martial law was declared by the local military commander, at which point a group of Commissioners would be empowered to decide on the facts of offences, before passing the case to the commander, who would pass judgment. In practice, things worked completely differently. In Dover, the forces were commanded by Lord Conway, who declared martial law. Not only were commissioners authorised to decide on the facts, they were also permitted to authorise summary judgments, including the execution of people they deemed to be guilty. In addition, the commissioners were given the power not only to resolve billeting disputes between soldiers and civilians, but to order civilians to provide quarters for the troops. A later declaration of martial law in Portsmouth extended the commission's remit yet again, allowing for civilians to be tried under martial law and, if necessary, sentenced to death. Even this did not solve the problems, as soldiers would often wander outside the jurisdiction of the commissioners; <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> February 1627 saw a Provost Marshal introduced to each county, bringing the entire nation under martial law.|$|E
30|$|There are two {{statistical}} approaches <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> problem: the frequentist and the Bayesian techniques. Reference [25] {{provides an}} introduction to Bayesian statistics. We do not carry out a Bayesian approach, because X_N(t) has a very large expression, which makes the use of Bayesian estimation impracticable in the computer. Thereby, we use {{the ideas of the}} so-called inverse frequentist technique for parameter estimation exhibited in [5] and [35, Chap.  7]. In order not to depart from our reasoning, we will explain our concrete frequentist approach in Remark  4.6 {{at the end of this}} example.|$|R

5|$|While {{the coastal}} {{defenses}} had not turned back the invasion at the beach, they {{had broken up}} and weakened the assault formations struggling through them. The German emphasis on this Main Line of Resistance (MLR) meant that defenses further inland were significantly weaker, and based on small pockets of prepared positions smaller than company sized in strength. This tactic was enough to disrupt American advances inland, making it difficult even to reach the assembly areas, let alone achieve their D-Day objectives. As {{an example of the}} effectiveness of German defenses despite weakness in numbers, the 5th Ranger battalion was halted in its advance inland by a single machine gun position hidden in a hedgerow. One platoon attempted to outflank the position, only to run into another machine gun position {{to the left of the}} first. A second platoon dispatched to take this new position ran into a third, and attempts <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> met with fire from a fourth position. The success of the MLR in blocking the movement of heavy weapons off the beach meant that, after four hours, the Rangers were forced to give up on attempts to move them any further inland.|$|E
5|$|Many royal and baronial castles {{were left}} to decline, {{so that by the}} 15th century only a few were {{maintained}} for defensive purposes. A small number of castles in England and Scotland were developed into Renaissance Era palaces that hosted lavish feasts and celebrations amid their elaborate architecture. Such structures were, however, beyond the means of all but royalty and the richest of the late-medieval barons. Although gunpowder weapons were used to defend castles from the late 14th century onwards it became clear during the 16th century that, provided artillery could be transported and brought to bear on a besieged castle, gunpowder weapons could also play an important attack role. The defences of coastal castles around the British Isles were improved <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> threat, but investment in their upkeep once again declined {{at the end of the}} 16th century. Nevertheless, in the widespread civil and religious conflicts across the British Isles during the 1640s and 1650s, castles played a key role in England. Modern defences were quickly built alongside existing medieval fortifications and, in many cases, castles successfully withstood more than one siege. In Ireland the introduction of heavy siege artillery by Oliver Cromwell in 1649 brought a rapid end to the utility of castles in the war, while in Scotland the popular tower houses proved unsuitable for defending against civil war artillery– although major castles such as Edinburgh put up strong resistance. At the end of the war many castles were slighted to prevent future use.|$|E
