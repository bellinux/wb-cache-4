5000|$|Miethe was the {{designer}} {{of a camera}} for color photography, the first photographic product made by the Berlin cabinetmaker Wilhelm Bermpohl. Introduced {{to the public in}} 1903, it produced sets of three separate black-and-white images on glass plates by making a series of three photographs of the subject through red, green and blue color fliters, a method of color photography first proposed by James Clerk Maxwell. These were used to reconstitute the full original range of color by projecting transparent positives made from them through similar filters and exactly superimposing the images on the projection screen (additive color), or by making three prints consisting of <b>transparent</b> <b>pigment</b> or dye images in the complementary colors and superimposing those to make a single full-color transparency or print on paper (subtractive color). They were also used to prepare printing plates for illustrating books, periodicals and other mechanically printed media, the only form in which early color photographs were likely to be seen by the general public. There were a number of technical issues with the system, including the relatively long time required to make each sequence of three exposures and the difficulty of correctly balancing them to obtain accurate color values under different lighting conditions. In 1901, Miethe had introduced [...] "Ethyl Red", a sensitizing dye that greatly improved the characteristics of panchromatically sensitized photographic emulsions, which in turn obviated the very long exposures previously needed to photograph red-filtered images, simplified color filter design, and generally cleared the path for future progress. Miethe's innovations provided the technological foundation used by such photographic pioneers as the Russian Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky, who studied with Miethe for several weeks in 1902.|$|E
5000|$|Matsuki {{describes}} the purposes and techniques {{involved in the}} painting of Triumphal Return:The painting “Triumphal Return” {{was done in the}} epoch where the Vietnam War was nearing its zenith. The most vocal of all sentiments was that of 'anti-war'. The most immediate experience which inspired my theme was the one where I, by chance, attended the yearly ceremony of the local American Legion, Long Island New York, in which the entire procession was conducted seemingly most diffident and eventlessly hastened up way. The National Anthem was sung in hushed voices in disarray. The white rectangular military caps looked as forlorn as the brown of deserted piers.There was something moved me deep enough to plunge into my first major work, which the production of demanded total concentration for four months working every night (I painted during night.) Except for Saturday. I went to the movies during the day, to the bar at night for distraction.Preparation of painting surface was done by mixture of opaque and transparent regular oil color pigments produced by Windsor and Newton and Grumbacher which eventually took the hue of reddish dark brown. I used a commercially prepared cotton small grain canvas. So far acceptable for my rendition of details. On this prepared surface, of approximately 1~2 mm thickness of the pigment after sufficient dryness was achieved, I first transferred the final sketch of the theme using medium strength charcoal of commercial origin.Approximately 3 or 4 coats of a commercial brand fixative were applied before the execution of final underdrawing (cartoon) by oil colour, mixture of burnt umber and Prussian blue in various composition ratio for the purpose of shortening drying period, with pure turpentine, as medium.When the under-drawing was sufficiently dry, therefore accepting overlapping pigment application without causing surface damage, I began first application of painting, molding. Medium: pure turpentine plus linseed oil. Ratio, approximately 2 turp/1 linseed. Pigments used were burnt umber, optional Prussian blue and yellow ochre (in later paintings I changed this colour to Naples yellow, because of its larger covering strength and fast drying speed.)After adequate surface dryness of the so far monochromatic sketched first coat (at this level the entire pictorial plane was equally developed), the second coat was applied to achieve chromatic “mapping” according to the psychological connotation and aesthetic atmosphere desired by the theme.In this case, I began by using opaque-est possible pigments for the purpose of similar strength such as yellow ochre, cobalt blue, burnt sienna etc, and quick drying properties like umbers, prussian blue, naples yellow mixed by turp and linseed with aforementioned concoction ratio. At this stage the entire effect of the painting still presents monochromatic, relief-like quality, although proper hues were ascribed to the major areas of the composition. I call it “the view at dusk” for its similarity in chromatic effects.At this stage the painting surface began to appear “realistic” Since the canvas dimensions of “Triumphal Return” is rather large, 50" [...] by 60", the earlier applications became dry enough to accept further application by the time this coast was finished.Once this stage is achieved, real part of “painting” begins: rendering of the objects with utmost objective fidelity. The method I used for this purpose was glazing (thin application of <b>transparent</b> <b>pigment)</b> techniques employing pigments of high transparency such as alizarin crimson, ultramarine, prussian blue, verdian green, chrome yellow, aureolin, zinc white, ivory black, etc.I found later on that the family of “Thalo” had good property for glazing. Especially thalo violet was intriguing in its chameleon-like adaptation to the underlying hues. With same pigment, thalo violet, one can develop several nuances upon surfaces depending on the hues of previous application(s). Thalo family was considered by authority such as Ralph Meyer as comparatively safe but not time tested to the perfect desirability, which might take 500 years to complete. If the surface of “Triumphal Return” crumbles, then the Thalo family of pigments should be buried with it.When the entire pictorial surface was covered and safely dried, I used larger brushes such as 1inch or 1 inch flat, sable and fanshaped and or pig hair brushes, employing “wash” technique which is similar to second coating, to go over the entire canvas in order to achieve thematic and pictorial unity*. This is the final stage of the painting. When the surface becomes adequately dry, regular application of 3~4 coat of “retouch” varnish (I use this frequently to bring out sunk-in colors) was given to the entire pictorial surface. The final varnish by finish varnish was applied much later. In fact, after the exhibitory entry to the 1st NY International Art Show had been over. Pictorial unity: In this case the term is used to connote all the executional aspects utilized for the purpose of constructing pictorial surface."End of Matsuki's description of the painting of Triumphal Return.

40|$|The {{idea that}} evolves in my {{photographs}} {{is a personal}} expression of man's constructive and destructive influence on the land. I try to capture the effect of man etching his personality into the land. My show includes aerial photographs, close-ups, and a composition of both. I {{became aware of the}} scope of man's influence on the land from frequent flights as a passenger. I found flying created a type of landscape from a different perspective than the ground. I was fascinated by the picture of the land from the air. The picture lacks the depth created by three dimensions. I took all of the aerial photographs while piloting {{in different parts of the}} world. The country I am in is not important because I do not create a map of the land. I use the aerial view to get photographs but I am not 1 ooking for realism. Instead I derive an image from the landscape. I take the liberty of altering the picture to present my idea about man's effect on the land. I want to demonstrate the impact which man has on the land. In the combined composition of aerial and close-up to the same scale by reducing the close-up and enlarging the aerial. In the interaction between man and the land change occurs continually. In my work I use <b>transparent</b> <b>pigment</b> to create further variation. The colors in the picture are created by putting one <b>transparent</b> <b>pigment</b> on another. I transfer one pigment at a time onto the paper, allowing it to be absorbed by the other pigments to effect this innovation. As an artist I make further alterations as I express my interaction with nature. The art work itself is constantly in change too because of its transparent colors. By looking at it, the viewer can modify foregrounds and backgrounds, not physically but through optical illusion. There is no defined depth or perspective to it because the colors are transparent. By using transparent colors, I change a landscape again and again to express my feelings about; man???s 1 nteraction with nature. I choose not to spell out the meaning of my pictures. I want the pictures to speak for themselves, and I therefore want each viewer to interpret the work for himself. Nonetheless, I hope the viewer will see the human involvement with the land as he looks at my art...|$|E
40|$|These {{paintings}} were done between 1979 and 1982 and used towards my master's degree here at CSUN. The works {{are not meant}} as religious offerings or parables, although I {{would like them to}} be filled with a sense of sacred mystery. In a way; these pictures present themselves to me and I merely record what I see as clearly as I can. They play a part in my life much as dreams do and I can often recognize the subconscious meaning behind the images. The figures in the paintings are people in my life and are attempts at exact likenesses. The landscapes and settings are from around the Los Angeles area but they have been transformed and idealized. In recent works I have arranged small three-dimensional models in box-like sets which enables me to more clearly envision, understand, and explore possibilities. I then take photographs of friends in the poses and use them as a reference while I paint. I work on masonite panel which has been covered with a white base coat of traditional gesso and polished smooth. On this is drawn an exact but sparse drawing. The first layer of oil paint is vague with little modeling or detail. This first coat is kept thin so that the drawing is barely visible beneath.

5000|$|Watercolour paint has {{the virtue}} of being more {{permanent}} than dyes, but is less transparent and so more likely to obscure details. Hand-colouring with watercolours {{requires the use of}} a medium to prevent the colours from drying with a dull and lifeless finish. Before the paint can be applied, the surface of the print must be primed so that the colours are not repelled. This often includes prepping the print with a thin coating of shellac, then adding grit before colouring. Watercolour paint used in photographic hand-colouring consists of four ingredients: pigments (natural or synthetic), a binder (traditionally arabic gum), additives to improve plasticity (such as glycerine), and a solvent to dilute the paint (i.e. water) that evaporates when the paint dries. The paint is typically applied to prints using a soft brush. Watercolours often [...] "leave a darker edge of color at the boundaries of the painted area." [...] Since different pigments have varying degrees of transparency, the choice of colours must be considered carefully. More <b>transparent</b> <b>pigments</b> are preferred, since they ensure greater visibility of the photographic image.|$|R

30|$|This {{study has}} {{demonstrated}} through {{the analysis of}} approximately ten percent of Bauer’s paintings for the Flora Graeca using non-invasive, in situ methods, that Bauer used a fairly simple and traditional palette for the period, and that together with his colour code system, he used {{a relatively small number}} of pigments to achieve almost perfect colour fidelity in his work. It has determined that Bauer largely favoured a pure (copper-based) green adulterated with indigo for his foliage, rather than a mixture of blue and yellow pigments, unusual for the time It has also shown that the Madrid colour chart was created using a very similar palette, and although Bauer cannot be definitively credited as its creator, the pigment data adds to an existing body of historical information that provides convincing evidence that this is likely. From the limited analysis performed on his later paintings, it is clear that Bauer’s pigment use changed as he evolved toward the more time consuming and technically challenging transparent watercolour painting style where he abandoned more opaque pigments such as vermillion, copper blues and greens, red lead and lead white in favour of more <b>transparent</b> <b>pigments.</b>|$|R

Micro-mechanical performance of the coatings was assessed by progressive load scratch tests. 'Hot dipping' fluidized bed is found a fast deposition technique as, after substrate pre-heating, it takes just few seconds to have the part completely powder coated. On the other hand, electrostatic spray deposition is a potentially selective coating technique, but it lasts longer (generally, 6 - 15 s) and, moreover, the coated parts must be post-cured for long time (at least, 15 min) and at high temperature (150 - 200 °C) to give rise to the formation of continuous films. Indeed, whilst 'hot dipping' fluidized bed is found particularly suitable for the deposition of thick and smooth thermoplastic coatings, electrostatic spray deposition is found the most viable technique to deposit thinner and highly scratch and wear resistant thermoset coatings. © 2012 Elsevier B.

5000|$|In 1860 Cros began {{studies in}} medicine, {{but he soon}} {{abandoned}} them {{for a life of}} literary and scientific pursuits. In 1869 he published a theory of color photography in which he proposed that a single scene could be photographed through glass filters colored green, violet, and orange. The three negatives obtained through those filters could be developed to produce positive impressions that contained varying amounts of red, yellow, and blue (the [...] "antichromatic" [...] or complementary colors of the filters). The three positive impressions, when superimposed on one another (for instance, by making three carbon prints using sufficiently <b>transparent</b> <b>pigments,</b> then transferring the pigmented gelatin onto a single support sheet) would recompose the original colors of the photographed scene. Cros's proposals, which anticipated the subtractive method of modern photography, were similar to more influential ideas advanced about the same time by Louis Ducos du Hauron. The same day, May 7, 1869, Charles Cros and Louis Ducos du Hauron presented their method of creating color photographs to the French Society of Photography. They had not been in communication beforehand and each knew nothing about the other's research. Cros ended up conceding the invention to Ducos Du Hauron, despite having deposited a sealed paper at the French Academy of Sciences on December 2, 1867. Ducos du Hauron had patented his ideas on November 28, 1868, almost a full year later, but claimed to have written an unpublished paper on the subject in 1862.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in Chester {{and worked as a}} {{designer}} after leaving school. He studied art in the evenings at the Chester School of Art (now the Department of Art and Design at University of Chester), then at the Royal College of Art. Later in Paris he became influenced by the work of Jules Bastien-Lepage, who also favoured rustic scenes depicted in a realistic but sentimental style. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1896 and was President of the London Sketch Club from 1902 to 1904. He stayed in France in the early 1900s, painting many of his works in Brittany and Normandy, where he depicted a peasant lifestyle which was already disappearing in England. From 1904 until well after World War I he maintained a studio at the Etaples art colony. Writing in The Studio (Vol. XXXVI, No. 154, Jan. 1906) A. L. Baldry commented that [...] "He is in his water-colours an absolute purist; he paints entirely with <b>transparent</b> <b>pigments,</b> and never has recourse to opaque colours; his brushwork is broad and confident - free, on the one hand, from affectation of showy cleverness, and, on the other, from niggling minuteness or over-elaboration; and he does not insist, as is the fashion with many present-day painters, upon lowness of tone." [...] His French paintings include land- and seascapes such as [...] "The Harbour at Étaples" [...] and the distant view of the town in Auckland Art Gallery and figure studies like [...] "Mother and Child" [...] and [...] "The Goose Girl".|$|R
30|$|Although MA-XRF {{scanning}} is not depth-selective, {{it appeared}} to be highly suitable to study the complex layer sequencing that is typical for seventeenth century still life paintings. The ground rule was to start off with an underpainting, blocking out each figure in its own basic color, using pigments with strong hiding power and/or tinting strength and then gradually building up the tonality and form by applying local passages of <b>transparent</b> <b>pigments</b> in the upper paint layers. This particular system, in fact, favored characterizing the build-up of the paint layers with MA-XRF scanning. Pigments with more body, such as vermilion (HgS), lead white (PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2) and umber (Fe 2 O 3 ·(H 2 O) + MnO 2) were often found in the ground, underpainting, or as small highlights in the upper layers. Those pigments are composed of elements with a high atomic number, and are consequently easier to detect with MA-XRF scanning and less influenced by attenuation. In addition, the superimposed layers are projected as a shadow on top of the fluorescence emission from subjacent layers. Therefore, the degree of attenuation and blocked fluorescence emission of the elements gave an insight in the layered sequence. In return, pigments with a smaller body and little hiding power, such as ultramarine and lakes, are composed of elements with a low atomic number and are highly influenced by attenuation and blocking by other elements. Since they are usually found in upper layers of the strata, the fluorescence emission of the elements is either not or to a lesser degree attenuated. Moreover, color information from the paint surface can ameliorate the ability to distinguish pigments with the same element composition.|$|R

40|$|The visual {{pigments}} of most invertebrate photoreceptors {{have two}} thermostable photo-interconvertible states, the ground state rhodopsin and photo-activated metarhodopsin, which triggers the phototransduction cascade until it binds arrestin. The {{ratio of the}} two states in photoequilibrium is determined by their absorbance spectra and the effective spectral distribution of illumination. Calculations indicate that metarhodopsin levels in fly photoreceptors are maintained below ~ 35 % in normal diurnal environments, due to {{the combination of a}} blue-green rhodopsin, an orange-absorbing metarhodopsin and red <b>transparent</b> screening <b>pigments.</b> Slow metarhodopsin degradation and rhodopsin regeneration processes further subserve visual pigment maintenance. In most insect eyes, where the majority of photoreceptors have green-absorbing rhodopsins and blue-absorbing metarhodopsins, natural illuminants are predicted to create metarhodopsin levels greater than 60 % at high intensities. However, fast metarhodopsin decay and rhodopsin regeneration also {{play an important role in}} controlling metarhodopsin in green receptors, resulting in a high rhodopsin content at low light intensities and a reduced overall visual pigment content in bright light. A simple model for the visual pigment–arrestin cycle is used to illustrate the dependence of the visual pigment population states on light intensity, arrestin levels and pigment turnover. ...|$|R

Of a special interest are new applications of cool coatings in automotive industry due to the possibility for saving energy on air conditioning and reduction of emission of C 02. lt is of relevance to apply solar light reflecting coatings for E-mobility cars considering their limited energy resources. Reduction of surface temperature can be achieved by increasing solar reflectance and thermal emission of energy. in order not to restriet the colour range, the solar reflectance in the near infrared (NIR) range is most important, which covers one half {{of the power of the}} total solar irradiation. Special NIR reflective and NIR <b>transparent</b> <b>pigments</b> are emerging into the market that can be incorporated in coating materials. lnvestigation of the heat transport by IR reflective coatings du ring solar irradiation of the surface gives a possibility to simulate heating of a substrate exposed to sun. This can be applied for Simulation of heating of a car body by the solar radiation. Cool paint material compositions were developed and prepared by dispersion of IR reflective pigments in the base coat material applied in automotive industry. A special set-up was developed to analyse the effect of IR reflective coatings on heating of a substrate under solar irradiation. One of the most important tasks in the application of IR reflective coatings is their characterisation and correct selection of pigments. To evaluate cool coatings, usually the value of Total Solar Reflectance (TSR) is used. The TSR value is calculated by integration of the reflectance spectra. Considering that the "cooling" effect of coatings is aimed in decreasing temperature of the substrate, changes in temperature of the substrate during coatings exposure to solar light were analysed. The kinetics was investigated based on the temperature profiles against time. The heat uptake by cool coatings was compared with that by carbon black coatings imitating absolute black body. Cool and carbon black containing coatings with and without a clear coat were evaluated to investigate the effect of clear coats related to conventional coatings in automotive industry on the heat uptake. lt is proposed to evaluate the "cooling" efficiency by the amount of heat taken up by cool coatings compared to coatings filled with carbon black.

40|$|CIC 23, Darmstadt, Germany, October 19 - 23, 2015 In {{an effort}} to create more dynamic looking automobiles, there is an ever {{increasing}} trend among automobile manufacturers towards the use of gonio-apparent coatings in car bodies. These coatings consist of <b>transparent</b> <b>pigments</b> mixed with metallic or interference flakes. The flakes in the coating cause a change in color and brightness of the finish with viewing and illumination direction. This change in appearance accentuates the 3 D shading of a car body, making it visually more attractive. Besides this angular dependence on viewing/illumination direction, the metallic finishes also exhibit a visually complex texture. Depending on {{the properties of the}} finish and the viewing and illumination conditions, the flakes exhibit a sparkle like texture, while the glossy clear coat may show a rough or smooth surface. As a result of these complex visual attributes, capturing the appearance and finding a perfect color match for an automotive coating is a non trivial task. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the relationship between the special-effect pigments size, and the maximum distance which is detectable the sparkle texture effect. For this, two different sets of samples with different structural features were evaluated in a lighting booth specifically designed for the visual experiment. The booth allows to vary the lighting conditions, the viewing geometry and the distance at which the sample is perceived. The visual experiment was applied to evaluate the high correlation between a structural parameter (i. e. pigment size) and the visual appearance attribute related with texture (sparkle detection distance). Under some fixed environmental conditions, as light intensity, color temperature and geometry of the light source, the sparkle detection distance was evaluated by applying the adjustment psychophysical method for two panel sets (metallic grays and blues), with known pigment sizes and colorimetry, with a small set of observers. The visual results show that a greater the pigment size, a greater the sparkle detection, but with some considerations. In future, we will extend this method, even reinforced applying the statistical design of experiments (DOE), for understanding the relevance and interplay of structural (size, shape, concentration, orientation, etc.), environmental (illuminance level, color rendering, geometry, etc.) and colorimetric (dark vs. light background, chroma, etc.) factors on the sparkle detection distance.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{emulsification}} process of lithographic ink and water was conducted to investigate methods for determining the water content of lithographic ink and water emulsions. Experiments using infra-red spectroscopy {{and analysis of the}} hydroxyl and carbonyl absorption bands revealed several variables which must be considered when attempting to use infra-red spectroscopic methods for the determination of the water content of ink emulsions. These factors include the choice of <b>pigment,</b> (either <b>transparent</b> or opaque), the type of cell medium, and methods for dispersing added water into an ink. The initial problem encountered was a lack of reproducibility when attempting to construct a calibration system. The carbonyl absorption band at 1745 cm^- 1 was shown to vary with each sample of emulsion. The intensity of the hydroxyl absorption band at 1645 cm^- 1 was discovered to be erratic between differing samples of ink and water emulsions. This resulted in hydroxyl contents which appeared to be inconsistent with known concentrations of water. The simulation of 2 ̆ 2 on-press 2 ̆ 2 emulsification, as it occurs in the lithographic process on an offset press, is a very important factor. The importance of added water attaining the internal phase of the lithographic emulsion is the prime criterion for valid and reproducible data obtained from infra-red spectroscopic analysis. This is accomplished by applying sufficient forces to generate an adequate rate of shear on the ink as added water is introduced into the emulsification process. The two modes of vibration of a water molecule were studied utilizing data obtained from infra-red spectra. The O-H stretching mode exhibited at 3400 cm^- 1 proved to be more sensitive to changes in water content of an ink than the bending mode exhibited at 1645 cm^- 1. Valid data used to construct a calibration system for water content determination of lithographic emulsions relies on the elimination of any moisture contamination of the cell medium used in the optics system of an infra-red spectrophotometer. Likewise, use of a <b>transparent</b> <b>pigmented</b> ink yields a continuous spectra. An opaque pigmented ink causes excessive light scattering resulting in off-scale deflections of absorption bands. Present methods of laboratory simulation of the emulsification of water into an ink were investigated to determine the optimum system which would yield stable ink and water emulsions in which the added water would assume the internal phase of the lithographic emulsion. Factors such as the rate of shear and time of dispersion were studied and found to significantly influence the formation of stable lithographic emulsions. Finally, the behavior of added water on the tack of an ink was also investigated. The tack values of a 2 ̆ 2 dry 2 ̆ 2 ink were closely monitored for extended periods of time. Immediate changes in tack were noted and recorded upon the addition of water. The addition of water to an ink in which the tack had apparently stabilized, effectively lowered the tack to the point where a homogeneous, stable emulsion was possible...|$|R
30|$|Bauer’s {{painting}} style changed markedly {{during and}} after his expedition to Australia with Matthew Flinders (1801 – 1806), and he favoured a more delicate watercolour style in transparent watercolour [1, 6, 38]. After 1800, Bauer largely abandoned the opaque painting technique he had used for the Flora Graeca paintings. Having more time to paint these at his leisure in Australia and after he returned to England in 1806, {{it is likely that}} he was able to spend more time on the more technically complex transparent watercolour technique. To do so also required a change to his pigment palette. Opaque pigments used in the Flora Graeca paintings such as lead white, red lead and vermillion were perhaps more suited to the bodycolour painting traditionally used in both manuscript illumination and portrait miniature painting [22, 26, 38]. XRF analysis carried out at the Natural History Museum in 2016 revealed that, at least in the small sample of paintings analysed, lead, copper and mercury were absent from Bauer’s palette during these years. Pigments in the later paintings contained iron, aluminium, sulphur, potassium and barium, suggesting that he abandoned the use of the opaque copper greens and blues, vermillion, red lead and lead white used throughout the Flora Graeca in favour of more <b>transparent</b> laked <b>pigments.</b> As noted above, ultramarine, indigo and an unknown, transparent blue were found in several instances, but no red pigment used in these paintings produced a Raman spectrum. Furthermore, levels of iron in these pigments were only slightly higher than the paper background, largely ruling out the iron oxide reds, and suggesting Bauer's preference for organic red lakes at this time.|$|R
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{relationship between}} organic carbon and mineral contents of particles sinking below 1800 m {{in the ocean}} indicates that organisms with mineral shells such as coccolithophores are of special importance for transporting carbon into the deep sea. Several hypotheses about the mechanism behind this relationship between minerals and organic matter have been raised, such as mineral protection of organic matter or enhanced sinking rates through ballast addition. We examined organic matter decomposition of calcifying and non-calcifying Emiliania huxleyi cultures in an experiment that allowed aggregation and settling in rotating tanks. Biogenic components such as particulate carbon, particulate nitrogen, particulate volume, <b>pigments,</b> <b>transparent</b> exopolymer particles (TEP), and particulate amino acids in suspended particles and aggregates were followed {{over a period of}} 30 d. The overall pattern of decrease in organic matter, the amount of recalcitrant organic matter left after 30 d, and the compositional changes within particulate organic matter indicated that cells without a shell are more subject to loss than calcified cells. It is suggested that biogenic calcite helps in the preservation of particulate organic matter (POM) by offering structural support for organic molecules. Over the course of the experiment, half the particulate organic carbon in both calcifying and non-calcifying cultures was partitioned into aggregates and remained so {{until the end of the}} experiment. The partial protection of particulate organic matter from solubilization by biominerals and by aggregation that was observed in our experiment may help explain the robustness of the relationship between organic and mineral matter fluxes in the deep ocean...|$|R
40|$|Painting {{has always}} been {{considered}} a two dimensional art form. Sculpture has obviously been considered three dimensional, yet acceptable in various degrees of relief. To combine, or merge the two art forms {{has always been}} a problematical consideration for me to explore. I found the incorporation of a sculptural technique of draped relief objects and painting techniques combine pleasantly for an unusual series of high relief paintings which are permanent, stable, and posessing a structure with numerous possibilities for compositional explorations. My objectives for this sort of painting were the following: 1) to find a new overall format for shape, instead of rectangular, 2) to find a new surface in which to incorporate the above mentioned media, 3) to find a media capable of long term stability under any atmospheric conditions, 4) to find a pleasing combination of <b>transparent</b> and opaque <b>pigments</b> suitable for these surfaces. In my early paintings, while still on canvas using acryllic and oils, my interest was in line, form, texture and shape. I found my canvases and composition becoming that of flowing oval and freeform shapes, and minimal in color. With the paintings becoming very static and heavy, I searched for a more expressive statement. I found it to be shape, {{and to a lesser extent}} texture. With earlier paintings becoming tactile and expressionistic, I now decided to change surfaces, from canvas to homemade paper fiber. Fig. 1 Early experiments in homemade paper led me to believe that earlier linear considerations would no longer compliment the surface texture, and this led to the ceramic technique of draping the paper over ???found objects". Fig. 2. Draping sheets of paper over objects was successful in that it satisfied my first objective of changing the overall shape and surface of the composition. The new overall shape dealt with the covered oval and semi-circular shapes, and free forms of the draped items. This eliminated the need for working with paints and brushes. However, as these experiments progressed, I felt that the composition became too became too minimal. I reacted by incorporating a brush line surface that resembled marble.

40|$|The {{pigments}} {{investigated in}} this thesis were synthesised and characterised {{in order to find}} promising candidates for near-infrared absorbers. The chemical systems were chosen due to their absorbing properties and also their chemical and thermal stability and non-toxicity as well as for economical reasons. Investigations were undertaken on several phosphates and silicates. Within the group of phosphates, first several known copper compounds, i. e. Cu 2 P 2 O 7, Cu 4 P 2 O 9, Cu 5 P 2 O 10, Cu 3 (PO 4) 2, Cu(PO 3) 2 and Cu 2 P 4 O 12, were tested and the most suitable were chosen for more detailed experiments. The structure types with the general formula M 2 P 2 O 7 were found to be promising and the metals calcium, strontium and copper were investigated as a starting point. It was confirmed that M 2 P 2 O 7 (with M = Ca or Sr) and Cu 2 P 2 O 7 could only form a pigment material for the middle member e. g. MCuP 2 O 7. Better candidates were found in the systems Mg/Cu and Zn/Cu. Here solid solutions occur and the absorption behaviour could be adjusted according to the ratio of the metal cations. A series of different cation ratio compounds were synthesised for both systems. As Zn/Cu shows more favourable absorption properties compared to Mg/Cu, a full investigation of structural parameters including neutron powder diffraction and EXAFS studies was undertaken and the influence of the shape of M–O coordination spheres on the near-infrared absorption properties is discussed in detail. After deriving the successful concept it was investigated in two further chemical systems. First, the cation Fe 2 + was used into the Zn 3 (PO 4) 2 structure to form a solid solution (Zn,Fe) 3 (PO 4) 2 and then Cu 2 + was introduced into the Mg 2 Si 2 O 6 pyroxene structure. Resulting from the studies, three promising systems for <b>transparent</b> near-infrared absorbing <b>pigment</b> applications were isolated: (Zn,Cu) 2 P 2 O 7, (Zn,Fe) 3 (PO 4) 2 and (Mg,Cu) 2 Si 2 O 6 solid solution...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of using new mixed oxides based on perovskite and cerium oxide-based pigments, for high temperature (above 1000 °C) ceramic colouring applications {{is presented in}} this paper. The solid-state synthesis method was used to manufacture the various pigment precursor powders used in this study. In the case of Er 6 MoO 12, orange–yellow colours were observed at calcination temperatures of 1200 °C and 1300 °C with different soaking times. Examination of the X-ray diffraction pattern generated after heat treatment at 1200 °C for 2 h revealed the single-phase nature of the compound. However, when applied to unleaded commercial <b>transparent</b> glaze, the <b>pigment</b> powder changed to a light pink colour indicating instability of the pigment in the glaze. Similarly mixed oxides such as Ba 0. 5 La 0. 5 Na 0. 5 Cu 0. 5 Si 4 O 10 and Ba 0. 5 La 0. 5 Na 0. 5 Cu 0. 5 Si 2 O 6 produced vivid blue and violet–blue colour powders, respectively when calcined between 950 °C and 1050 °C for different soaking times. X-ray diffraction patterns for Ba 0. 5 La 0. 5 Na 0. 5 Cu 0. 5 Si 4 O 10 showed {{the presence of the}} phases which included (a) BaCuSi 4 O 10 (b) La 2 Si 2 O 7 (c) SiO 2 and La 2 O 3 (trace) whereas Ba 0. 5 La 0. 5 Na 0. 5 Cu 0. 5 Si 2 O 6 confirmed the presence of the phases such as (a) BaCuSi 4 O 10 and (b) BaCuSi 2 O 6. These pigment powders were also not stable and light-green colours were observed when they were immersed in the unleaded commercial transparent glaze. Finally, AxB(2 −x−y) CryO 3 (A = rare earth and B = Al) perovskite-type compounds produced a variety of shades of red and yellow colour depending on the rare earth, the value of x and y, and the calcination temperature. An intense brownish-red colour was obtained when the rare earth Erbium was used with x = 1, y = 0. 06. From the X-ray diffraction trace, Er (Al Cr) O 3 was found to be the only phase present. SEM micrographs indicated the presence of agglomerates as well as two different types of crystals in terms of morphology. EDX spectra confirmed that both types of crystals had the same composition. When applied in an unleaded transparent glaze, the brownish-red colour pigment powders turned into very pale yellow in the glaze, again indicating instability of the pigment powder in the commercial transparent glaze...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the isolation and characterization in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. of induced mutants, deficient for gibberellins (GA's), abscisic acid (ABA) and photoreceptors. These compounds {{are known to}} regulate various facets of plant growth and differentiation, so mutants lacking one of these substances {{are expected to be}} affected in several aspects of their physiology. It is shown in this thesis that the earliest expression of these mutants occurs during seed development and seed germination. Therefore these processes form an excellent phase to screen for these mutants. Planthormone and photoreceptor mutants in relation to seed physiology. In general three major periods may be distinguished in the history of a seed: 1) Seed development and maturation, 2) developmental arrest of the mature seed, characterized either by a dormant state in which seeds even do not germinate under favourable environmental conditions, or by a quiescent state in which seeds only require rehydration, and 3) germination, starting with water uptake and often requiring breaking of dormancy, which is triggered by specific environmental factors such as light and temperature. Planthormones may play a regulatory role in all three phases. Non-germinating GA-responsive mutants as described in Chapter 1 have a strongly reduced gibberellin biosynthesis (Barendse, pers. comm.) which may lead to an increased level of dormancy and/or to the inability of the seeds tobreak dormancy after imbibition of mature seeds. Clearly the presence of GA's, either by de novo GA synthesis, or by hydrolysis of bound forms, is not always a prerequisite for seed germination: genotypes that combine GA- and ABA deficiency like the revertants of non-germinating ga- 1 mutants described in Chapter 2 do readily germinate. Apart from the absence of endogenous factors such as gibberellins, also the lack of receptors for environmental factors that normally break dormancy might prevent germination. An example are the hy- 1 and hy- 2 mutants (Chapter 4), which are characterized by an increased hypocotyl length in white light and the absence of detectable phytochrome in dark grown hypocotyls. It was shown by Spruit et al. (1980), that these mutants hardly show any germination and correspondingly, have strongly reduced levels of phytochrome in their seeds. Their reduced germination capacity is restored by (relatively high) concentrations of exogeneously applied GA 4 + 7 (Koornneef et al., 1981). Consequently one might expect such phytochrome deficient mutants to occur among the GA responsive non-germination mutants in Arabidopsis, like van der Veen and Bosma actually found for a tomato mutant (see Koornneef et al., 1981). Remarkably {{this was not the case}} in Arabidopsis. The reason for this seems to be the absence of a light requirement in the hy mutants from the M 2 populations screened for non-germinating mutants of Arabidopsis. It happened that these M 2 seeds in all cases were harvested from M 1 plants grown in winter, in contrast to the seeds studied by Spruit et al. (1980) which were harvested in summer. We have observed during a number of years that seeds (including wild-type seeds), which developed in winter (natural daylight with additional continuous light by Philips TL 57) were less dormant than seeds from summer grown mother plants (long days, high light intensity, no additional light). Relevant environmental factors in this respect may be light intensity, light quality (McCullough and Shropshire, 1970) and daylength (Karssen, 1970; Luiten, 1982). The effect of light quality (McCullough and Shropshire, 1970) indicates that phytochrome may be involved in the determination of the level of dormancy. To select mutants with a reduced or absent seed dormancy, one may choose those conditions, where the wild-type is clearly dormant. However, the high and probably complex environmental variability of this character and the relatively rapid change in the level of dormancy during dry storage of the seeds makes this selection system less attractive. Selection for revertants in the progeny of mutagen treated non-germinating ga- 1 mutants proved to be an effective procedure to isolate mutants with a reduced dormancy (Chapter 2). As the reverting effect (restored germination) was caused by a mutation at a different locus, the ga- 1 allele could be replaced by its wild-type allele by crossing the revertant with the wild-type parent followed by selection in F 2 . These newly selected monogenic recessive mutants had a reduced level of ABA in the leaves and in both the developing and ripe seeds. Correspondingly the mutant allele was called aba (ABA-types are aba/aba plants). The germination of seeds collected at different stages of their development on both ABA- and wild-type plants showed that dormancy developed during the last part of seed maturation in wild-type, but not in the aba -mutant. This shows that the function of ABA is dormancy induction. ABA determinations in unripe siliquae showed a peak level of ABA at about 10 - 12 days after anthesis, followed subsequently by a decrease, a short period at a constant level and a further decrease (Chapter 3). In addition to ABA-type mothers with ABA-type embryo's and wild-type mothers with wild-type embryo's, one can also obtain by means of the appropriate reciprocal crosses ABA-type mothers with wild-type embryo's and wild-type mothers with (50 %) ABA type embryo's. So the effects of maternal and embryonic genotype can be separated. It was found (Chapter 3) that the genotype of the mother plant regulated the sharp rise in ABA content halfway seed development (maternal ABA). The genotype of the embryo and endosperm was responsible for a second ABA fraction (embryonic ABA), which reached lower levels; but persisted for some time after the maximum in maternal ABA. The onset of dormancy showed a good correlation with the presence of the embryonic ABA fraction and not with the maternal ABA. Another category of mutants which also may give some understanding of the role of ABA in seed germination are the ABA tolerant mutants recently isolated by us in Arabidopsis. Compared to wild-type these mutants require an upto 20 fold higher concentration of exogeneously applied ABA to inhibit seed germination. These mutants too are characterized by a reduced seed dormancy. Other genetically determined factors than those mentioned above are certainly also involved in seed development and seed germination. Thus in Arabidopsis mutations leading to the absence of seed coat <b>pigments</b> (<b>transparent</b> testa) and simultaneously to the absence of a mucilage layer around the seed have a reduced dormancy (Koornneef, 1981). The latter seedcoat characters are determined purely by the maternal genotype. Planthormone and photoreceptor mutants in relation to other physiological effects. Non-germinating mutants at the loci ga- 1, ga- 2 and ga- 3, when made to germinate by adding gibberellin, initially develop into normal looking seedlings. Later on they become dark green bushy dwarfs with reduced petals and stamens. Regular GA-spraying from the seedling stage onwards maintains the wild-type phenotype completely or nearly so (Chapter 1). The strong and quick response of the dwarfs to GA sprays (the elongation of the petals of older dwarfs becomes visible within two days) clearly demonstrates the essential role of gibberellin in elongation growth. Recently the non-germinating ga alleles were shown to have a strongly re duced kaurene synthetase activity in young siliquae compared to wild type. These analyses were performed by Dr. G. W. M. Barendse (pers. comm.). This indicates that these genes control some early step(s) in GA biosynthesis. Apart from mutants that do not germinate without GA, also more or less normally germinating GA responsive dwarfs were isolated. Half of these were found to be allelic to the non-germinating ga- 1 , ga- 2 and ga- 3 mutants. These mutant alleles behave like so called "leaky alleles", i. e. the alleles are only partly defective and produce sufficient GA for seed germination, but not enough to give normal elongation growth. GA sensitive dwarfs were also found at two other loci (ga- 4 , ga- 5 ) of which no non-germinating alleles have been isolated so far (Chapter 1). These mutants have normal or slightly reduced kaurene synthetase activity (Barendse, pers. comm.), which indicates that these genes regulate steps beyond kaurene, or affect GA metabolism in another way. It is also possible that in the mutants cell elonga tion factors are blocked for which the relatively high concentration of exogeneously applied GA may substitute. Locus ga- 4 seems to control interconversions between GA's, which is suggested by the insensitivity of ga- 4 dwarfs to GA 9 . which gibberellin is effective with mutants at the other 4 loci. Abscisic acid (ABA) deficient mutants are characterized not only by reduced seed dormancy but also by disturbed water relations (wiltiness, withering), probably as a result of failure to close the stomata upon conditions of water stress (Chapter 2). This is characteristic for ABA deficient mutants in tomato (Tal and Nevo, 1973) and potato (Quarrie, 1982). ABA deficient mutants in maize are in addition to a reduced seed dormancy (viviparous mutants, gene symbol op) characterized by the failure to synthesize carotenoids and they accumulate precursors of these pigments (Robichaud et al., 1980). As ABA deficient mutants in Arabidopsis, tomato and potato have normal pigments, it is suggested that in the latter species the ABA biosynthesis may be blocked in the last part of the pathway, whilst in the maize mutants it is blocked at an earlier stage, i. e. where ABA and carotenoids still have a common pathway. Some of the photoreceptor mutants are affected in their germination behaviour as discussed above. However, the most conspicuous effect observed is the partial lack of light induced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation (Chapter 4). Mutants in Arabidopsis, and also in tomato and cucumber (Koornneef et al., 1981; Koornneef et al., unpublished), that have an elongated hypocotyl when grown in white light, were shown to have locus-specific alterations in the spectra of light inhibition when grown in light of restricted spectra] regions. In these "colour blind" mutants at two loci (hy- 1 and hy- 2) little or no spectrophotometrically detectable phytochrome was present in dark grown hypocotyls, nor was it in the seeds. In these mutants the inhibitory effect of red and farred was almost absent. Mutants of other genes were characterized by the absence only of red inhibition (hy- 3) or by a decreased sensitivity to the shorter wavelengths of the spectrum (hy- 4, hy- 5). Hy- 5 also showed a reduced inhibitory effect of far-red light. The differential sensitivity of the genotypes to specific spectral regions strongly suggests the involvement of more than one pigment in the inhibition by light of hypocotyl elongation and probably also in other photomorphogenetic processes. Some authors ascribed this role solely to phytochrome (Schäfer, 1976). Since under specific conditions phytochrome could nevertheless be detected in so called phytochrome deficient mutants (Koornneef and Spruit, unpublished) the genes hy- 1 and hy- 2 probably do not represent the structural genes of the phytochrome protein or the phytochrome chromophore, but instead may play a role in the regulation of phytochrome metabolism. Further genetic aspects of plant hormone and light receptor mutants. Mutation frequencies for the different groups of loci were estimated for ethylmethanesulphonate (EMS), fast neutrons and X-rays (Chapter 5). Average mutation frequencies calculated per diploid cell, per locus and per MM EMS during 1 hr at 24 °C, were for ga- 1, ga- 2, ga- 3 8. 0 ± 1. 8 x 10 - 6 , for hy- 1, hy- 2, hy- 3 4. 2 ± 1. 4 x 10 - 6 and for the aba locus about 27 x 10 - 6 . These mutation frequencies are relatively high compared to other loci studied by us and others. It is not excluded that in these categories loci escaped detection simply because of a low mutation frequency. It is a good custum to locate newly induced mutations on the organisms gene map, especially when they are the basis of extensive research like our ga, aba and hy mutants. Unfortunately, the gene map of Arabidopsis was rather fragmentary, and contradictory or wrong conclusions about linkage relations could be found in literature. Since we had gradually built up the complete set of 5 primary trisomics supplemented with a number of telotrisomics (one chromosome arm extra) and also made a collection of mutations at many loci, induced in the course of various experiments at our department and supplemented with mutants described in literature, we had a good starting point to construct a more representative gene map for Arabidopsis. The required scale of operations was only feasable thanks to the accurate assistance of many students who performed trisomic analysis and gene mapping as part of their university training program. Important further additional data were obtained from the department of Genetics of Groningen University and from literature. The trisomic analysis aimed at assigning linkage groups (via representative markers) to the different chromosomes is described in Chapter 6. The gene maps in centimorgans for the five Arabidopsis chromosomes is presented in Chapter 7. On the basis of 76 loci mapped the genetic length of the Arabidopsis chromosomes now compares well with that of individual chromosomes in e. g. tomato and maize. This notwithstanding the small size of the Arabidopsis chromosomes. Genes with a similar mutant phenotype (and probably comparable functions) seem to be distributed at random over the Arabidopsis genome. Our set of mutants at the ga- 1 locus of Arabidopsis provides an excellent opportunity for fine structure analysis of the gene. The system has a very high resolving power, for the intragenic recombinants are found as the rare wild-type seedlings among thousands of non-germinating seeds per petri dish. The results show (Chapter 8) that 8 different alleles could be arranged into an internally consistent map on the basis of the frequencies of intragenic recombinants. One fast neutron induced allele behaved as an intragenic deletion. The order of the sites with respect to other genes on chromosome 4 could be established...|$|R
