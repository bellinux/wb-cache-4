5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this honors thesis is to give an {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>system</b> in <b>the</b> United States today. In order to do so {{it is necessary to}} begin with the inception and history of <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>system</b> in England and how it subsequently came about in the United States. Then I will give a timeline of the progression of <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>system</b> in <b>the</b> U. S and any reforms or changes that have been made. After that I will talk about four other countries, England, Canada, Ireland, and France, all of which once had a grand <b>jury</b> <b>system</b> but have since abolished it. I will then lay out the main arguments of both proponents of <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>system</b> in <b>the</b> U. S. and critics of <b>the</b> grand <b>jury</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, I will analyze two recent grand jury proceedings that received national and international attention, the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases...|$|R

25|$|Trial by {{jury was}} {{introduced}} in most German states after the revolutionary events of 1848. However, it remained controversial; and, early in the 20th century, there were moves to abolish it.

25|$|Others {{involved}} the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Strauder v. West Virginia (1880) and Bush v. Kentucky (1883) reversed convictions because of racial exclusion in <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>system.</b> In Pace v. Alabama (1883), the Court upheld an adultery prohibition that punished inter-racial fornication more than same-race fornication. Pace was overruled by McLaughlin v. Florida (1964). Yick Wo v.

Missouri (1887) rejected an equal protection challenge to a statute authorizing the prosecution more peremptory challenges in large cities.|$|E

2500|$|Tocqueville {{believed}} that jury service not only benefited the {{society as a}} whole, but enhanced jurors’ qualities as citizens.

5000|$|Due to the {{criticism}} against <b>the</b> federal grand <b>jury</b> <b>system</b> there are some reform proposals which include the following proposals: ...|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{institution}} of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>system,</b> with its attendant seeking of evidence, based on testimony given by witnesses, the problem of maintenance developed. [...] Maintenance was the practice of witnesses coming forward to provide testimony at trial, without {{being asked to do}} so. [...] These were frequently well-meaning friends or family members who wanted to participate, or help sway the verdict of the trial. [...] The Statute of Westminster I (1275) had fifty-one chapters. [...] One of these dealt with the issue of maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reformer}} {{party in}} the Legislative Assembly desired that <b>the</b> <b>Jury</b> <b>system</b> be reformed, {{to the extent that}} they passed a Jury Law Amendment Bill no less than four times over eight years. [...] This was a contentious issue, and the Legislative Council replied again for the last time in favour of the status quo on February 25, 1836. [...] The defeat of the reformers in June 20, 1836 elections for the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada silenced this legislative outlet of steam, and thus was the stage set for rebellion.|$|E
2500|$|Under these circumstances, {{the jury}} became {{a new form}} of ordeal. [...] The judges, in {{difficult}} cases ceased to be inquisitors, and simply came to accept the verdict of the jury. [...] The accused was pronounced either [...] "guilty" [...] or [...] "not guilty". [...] This result soon came to be accepted with as little doubt, as much {{as the result of the}} hot iron or cold water was accepted a generation earlier. [...] At first, there was no compulsion to deem the actions of a jury with any more rationality than that of the ordeal. [...] The ordeal had shown God's judgment in the matter. [...] The verdict of the jury, while not necessarily congruent with God's will, nonetheless, was inscrutable. [...] Over the course of a generation or so after 1215, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>system</b> began to be rationalized and regarded as a judicial body.|$|E

2500|$|Following the Fourth Lateran Council, {{the civil}} and common law courts quickly moved to ban trial by ordeal and trial by combat. Implementation {{proved to be}} more difficult. [...] What would take their place? [...] The novel choice was trial by jury. [...] In many places this change was seen as radical, and was met with great doubts about its effectiveness. [...] There was {{reluctance}} to accept juries on a large scale by many of the English courts, and the public at large. [...] People were used to a system where decisions were made by the outcome of a duel or an ordeal. [...] <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> <b>system</b> had made a sporadic appearance in England from time to time, including, but not limited to Danelaw and the Saxons. Even so, juries had never been predominant. [...] A jury remained a local and obscure phenomenon. [...] It was generally believed that God's will was revealed in the outcome of the battle or ordeal. [...] The fact that the judge would view the result of the ordeal and declare [...] "God's decision" [...] had little bearing on the validity of the procedure. The jury was something else. It did not represent God and its twelve or more members were likely to fail to deliver God's solution.|$|E

6000|$|I {{had heard}} this before, {{there being a}} very general {{complaint}} throughout the country of the practical abuses connected with <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>system.</b> I have heard intelligent lawyers complain, that whenever a cause of any interest is to be tried, the first question asked is not [...] "what are the merits?" [...] "which has {{the law and the}} facts on his side?" [...] but [...] "who is likely to be on the jury?"--thus obviously placing the composition of the jury before either law or evidence. Systems may have a very fair appearance on paper and as theories, that are execrable in practice. As for juries, I believe the better opinion of the intelligent of all countries is, that while they are a capital contrivance to resist the abuse of power in narrow governments, in governments of a broad constituency they have the effect, which might easily be seen, of placing the control of the law in the hands of those who would be most apt to abuse it; since it is adding to, instead of withstanding and resisting the controlling authority of the State, from which, in a popular government, most of the abuses must unavoidably proceed.|$|E
