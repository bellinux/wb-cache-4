The Supreme Court in Reynolds held that such information should be protected from disclosure when there is a [...] "danger that compulsion of <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged." [...] The Court noted that the privilege was absolute, even if the need in the plaintiff was compelling. The Fifth Circuit has noted, [...] "the greater public good - ultimately the less harsh remedy" [...] is to protect the information from disclosure, even where the result might be dismissal of the lawsuit.|$|E
2500|$|In such cases, {{there are}} strong policy {{considerations}} supporting the principle that a trial procedure can never be considered fair {{if a person is}} kept in ignorance of the case against him or her. First, since the grounds for a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity can span from incontrovertible evidence to an innocent misinterpretation of facts which can be explained away by the person, in many cases it is impossible for courts {{to be sure that the}} disclosure of <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> make no difference to the applicant. Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non-disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself. As Lord Phillips put it, [...] "if the wider public are to have confidence in the justice system, they need to be able to see that justice is done rather than being asked to take it on trust".|$|E

The fact is rather inferred from rites among peoples just emerging from totemism (see the case of the Californian buzzard, in Bancroft) than derived from actual observation.

50|$|In {{order to}} take these {{concerns}} into due consideration the instruments of SA have been extended to provide {{an assessment of the}} entire knowledge and model generating process. This approach has been called 'sensitivity auditing'. It takes inspiration from NUSAP, a method used to qualify the worth of quantitative information with the generation of `Pedigrees' of numbers. Likewise, sensitivity auditing has been developed to provide pedigrees of models and model-based inferences. Sensitivity auditing has been especially designed for an adversarial context, where not only the nature of the evidence, but also the degree of certainty and uncertainty associated to <b>the</b> <b>evidence,</b> <b>will</b> be the subject of partisan interests.|$|E
50|$|Making gene {{functional}} predictions transparent is important, {{but equally}} important is making them {{as accurate as}} possible.

COMBREX is actively working on developing algorithms for functional prediction that can identify genes with novel or interesting functions, and whose results can sit beside the high-quality predictions received from collaborating computational groups. COMBREX's relatively conservative BLAST-based propagation of gene function represents a simple first step towards this goal.|$|E
