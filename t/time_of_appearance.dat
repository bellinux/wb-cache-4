A recent analysis of phenomic characters, however, classified Eomaia as pre-eutherian and reported that {{the earliest}} clearly eutherian specimens came from Maelestes, dated to 91 million years ago. That study also reported that eutherians did not significantly diversify until after the catastrophic extinction at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, about 66 million years ago.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson and Berry (1979) and Ungricht et al. (1998) have {{documented}} the subsequent confusion over {{the number of}} Mediterranean species of Mandragora and their scientific names.

The size and shape of the fruit and the colour and <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> of the flowers have been used to distinguish possible species. In the 1820s, Antonio Bertoloni used flowering time to name two species as Mandragora vernalis, the spring-flowering mandrake, and Mandragora autumnalis, the autumn-flowering mandrake. Identifying the former as Linnaeus's M.officinarum, works such as Flora Europaea listed two Mediterranean species of Mandragora: M.officinarum and M.autumnalis. Using statistical analysis of morphological characters, Ungricht et al. found no distinct clusters among the specimens they examined and concluded that Linnaeus's M.officinarum is a single, variable species. Other sources divide M.officinarum sensu lato differently. Plants from the western Mediterranean, from Turkey westwards to the Iberian peninsula and Morocco, are placed in M.officinarum; plants from the eastern Mediterranean, from Syria to Israel, are placed in M.autumnalis.|$|E

40|$|Coconut lethal {{yellowing}} (LY) {{is caused}} by a phytoplasma and is a major threat for coconut production throughout its growing area. Incidence of LY was monitored visually on every coconut tree in six fields in Mozambique for 34 months. Disease progress curves were plotted and average monthly disease incidence was estimated. Spatial patterns of disease incidence were analyzed at six assessment times. Aggregation was tested by the coefficient of spatial autocorrelation of the ?-binomial distribution of diseased trees in quadrats. The binary power law was used as an assessment of overdispersion across the six fields. Spatial autocorrelation between symptomatic trees was measured by the BB join count statistic {{based on the number of}} pairs of diseased trees separated by a specific distance and orientation, and tested using permutation methods. Aggregation of symptomatic trees was detected in every field in both cumulative and new cases. Spatiotemporal patterns were analyzed with two methods. The proximity of symptomatic trees at two assessment times was investigated using the spatiotemporal BB join count statistic based on the number of pairs of trees separated by a specific distance and orientation and exhibiting the first symptoms of LY at the two <b>times.</b> The semivariogram <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> LY was calculated to characterize how the lag between <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> LY was related to the distance between symptomatic trees. Both statistics were tested using permutation methods. A tendency for new cases to appear in the proximity of previously diseased trees and a spatially structured pattern <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> LY within clusters of diseased trees were detected, suggesting secondary spread of the disease.

50|$|Machairodus {{was similar}} {{in size to}} a modern lion, {{standing}} about 1 meter at the shoulder. The species once referred to Machairodus coloradensis was apparently significantly larger, about 1.2 m at the shoulder, according to skeletal and life reconstructions. If accurate, this would have made M. coloradensis {{one of the largest}} felids. However M. coloradensis, along with M. kurteni and M. giganteus, has been reassigned to the genus Amphimachairodus and by extent, the Homotherini based on both morphology and its <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> in North America. Nimravides catacopsis also has been separated from Machairodus, as the two are too different in regards to autapomorphies to be synonymous. However, the species Machairodus horribilis, which stands as the largest known species of the genus, is comparable in size to the equally large and much later Smilodon, weighing in at around 404.6 kg (892 lb.). Its skull, measuring upwards of 16 inches in length, is the largest known skull for any machairodont.|$|E

5000|$|Much {{research}} in several science disciplines, including economics, political science, geology, paleontology, ecology, meteorology, and astronomy, relies on quasi-experiments. For example, in astronomy {{it is clearly}} impossible, when testing the hypothesis [...] "Stars are collapsed clouds of hydrogen", to {{start out with a}} giant cloud of hydrogen, and then perform the experiment of waiting a few billion years for it to form a star. However, by observing various clouds of hydrogen in various states of collapse, and other implications of the hypothesis (for example, the presence of various spectral emissions from the light of stars), we can collect data we require to support the hypothesis. An early example of this type of experiment was the first verification in the 17th century that light does not travel from place to place instantaneously, but instead has a measurable speed. Observation of the appearance of the moons of Jupiter were slightly delayed when Jupiter was farther from Earth, as opposed to when Jupiter was closer to Earth; and this phenomenon was used to demonstrate that the difference in the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> of the moons was consistent with a measurable speed.|$|E
