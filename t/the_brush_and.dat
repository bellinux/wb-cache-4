5|$|Mark Rathbun {{spent only}} {{four days in}} the Hole in 2004 but says that he left after seeing his old friend Tom De Vocht being {{physically}} beaten by Miscavige. According to Rathbun, one night the incarcerated executives were ordered to jog to a building 400 yards away and back. As they were herded back to their office-prison, he broke away and hid in bushes until the group had disappeared from sight. He retrieved his motorcycle, hid in <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> drove out through the Gold Base gates when they were opened to let a car in. He subsequently rented a car and spent a month touring the South before settling in southern Texas.|$|E
25|$|Professional tools used by blacksmiths, carpenters, {{and farmers}} were carried by nearly all. Axes, crow bars, hammers, hatchets, hoes, mallets, mattocks, picks, planes, saws, scythes, and shovels {{were used to}} clear or make a road through brush or trees, cut down the banks to cross a wash or steep banked stream, build a raft or bridge, or repair the wagon. In general, as little road work as {{possible}} was done. Travel was often {{along the top of}} ridges to avoid <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> washes common in many valleys.|$|E
25|$|The {{engineers}} waited {{the whole}} month of July for Wise to arrive on scene. By 19 July 1861, McDowell started {{calling for a}} balloon {{to be brought to}} the front at First Bull Run (Centreville). As Wise was not to be found, Whipple sent Lowe out to inflate his balloon and prepare to set out for Falls Church. Mary Hoehling tells of the sudden appearance of John Wise who demanded that Lowe stop his inflating of the Enterprise and let him inflate his balloon instead. Wise had legal papers upholding his purported authority. Although Wise's arrival on the scene was tardy, he did inflate his balloon and proceeded toward the battlefield. On the way the balloon became caught in <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> was permanently disabled. This ended Wise's bid for the position, and Lowe was at last unencumbered from taking up the task.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1870s to early 1880s, spread of arc lighting, {{a type of}} {{brilliant}} outdoor street lighting that required high voltages {{in the range of}} 3000-6000 volts, was followed by one story after another in newspapers about how the high voltages used were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead without leaving a mark. One of these accidents, in Buffalo, New York on August 7, 1881, led to the inception of the electric chair. That evening a drunken dock worker, looking for the thrill of a tingling sensation he had noticed before, managed to sneak his way into a Brush Electric Company arc lighting power house and grabbed <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> ground of a large electric dynamo. He died instantly. The coroner who investigated the case brought it up at a local Buffalo scientific society. Another member, Alfred P. Southwick, a dentist who had a technical background, thought some application could be found for the curious phenomenon.|$|E

500|$|On February 17, 2011, the Toronto Star {{revealed}} that Agent Orange {{was employed to}} clear extensive plots of Crown land in Northern Ontario. The Toronto Star reported that, [...] "records from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s show forestry workers, often students and junior rangers, spent {{weeks at a time}} as human markers holding red, helium-filled balloons on fishing lines while low-flying planes sprayed toxic herbicides including an infamous chemical mixture known as Agent Orange on <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> the boys below."

5000|$|Due to friction, <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> <b>and</b> copper {{commutator}} segments wear out. In small {{consumer products}} such as power tools <b>and</b> appliances <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> may {{last as long as}} the product, but larger machines require regular replacement of <b>brushes</b> <b>and</b> occasional resurfacing of the commutator. So commutated machines are not used in equipment at remote locations that must operate for long periods without maintenance.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary fluid {{nitrogen}} flow data are reported for a five-brush, ceramic-coated-rub-runner brush seal system, where <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rub runner were placed {{at each end}} of a centrally pressurized multifunction tester ('back-to-back' set of <b>brushes)</b> <b>and</b> tested at rotor speeds of 0, 10, 18, and 22. 5 krpm. After testing, both <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ceramic-coated rub runner appeared pristine. The coating withstood both the thermomechanical and dynamic loadings with minor wear track scarring. The bristle tips showed some indication of material shearing (smearing) wear. The Ergun (1952) porous flow equation was applied to <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> seal data. <b>The</b> Ergun relation fit the gaseous data but was in poor agreement with the fluid results. <b>The</b> <b>brush</b> seal exit conditions were two phase. Two-phase, choked-flow design charts were applied but required one data point at each rotor speed to define the flow and area coefficients. Reasonable agreement between prediction and data was found, but such methods are not to be construed as two-phase-flow brush seal analyses...|$|R

2500|$|The next day, the Marines were {{reinforced}} by about 60 Cubans under Lieutenant Colonel Enrique Thomas. [...] The Cubans had been equipped with rifles and white duck sailor uniforms by Commander McCalla from the USS Marblehead. [...] Familiar with guerrilla tactics, the Cuban insurgents deployed in pairs {{in front of}} the camp, burning <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> undergrowth as they advanced, thus denying to the enemy of cover. The Marblehead, which had provided shore bombardment on several occasions, steamed down the coast and shelled the well at Cuzco. Nevertheless, the Spanish attack was resumed at dusk, and two more Marines—acting Sergeant Major Henry Good and Private Goode Taurman—were killed.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{a carved}} figure as a finial on the bedpost, {{probably}} of Saint Margaret, {{patron saint of}} pregnancy and childbirth, who was invoked to assist women in labor and to cure infertility, or possibly representing Saint Martha, the patroness of housewives. From the bedpost hangs a brush, symbolic of domestic duties. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> the rock crystal prayer-beads (a popular engagement present from the future bridegroom) appearing together {{on either side of}} the mirror may also allude to the dual Christian injunctions ora et labora (pray and work).

2500|$|The common {{legend of}} Yue {{receiving}} the tattoo {{from his mother}} first appeared in Shuo Yue Quanzhuan. In chapter 21 titled [...] "By a pretext Wang Zuo swore brotherhood, by tattoos Lady Yue instructed her son", Yue denounces the pirate chief Yang Yao (杨幺) and passes on {{a chance to become}} a general in his army. Yue Fei's mother then tells her son, [...] "I, your mother, saw that you did not accept recruitment of the rebellious traitor, and that you willingly endure poverty and are not tempted by wealth and status ... But I fear that after my death, there may be some unworthy creature who will entice you ... For these reason ... I want to tattoo on your back the four characters 'Utmost', 'Loyalty', 'Serve' and 'Nation' ... The Lady picked up <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> wrote out on his spine the four characters for 'serving the nation with the utmost loyalty' ... she bit her teeth, and started pricking.

2500|$|Purported {{findings}} of the team include the alleged 2 August massacre of about 150 civilians attempting to cross back into northwest Rwanda from Zaire by the RPF, as well as systematic arrest and apparent forced disappearance {{of a large number}} of men in Gisenyi. [...] In Butare, part of Kigali, and Kibungo to the south and southeast, the team reported indiscriminate massacres of civilians who had come to meetings convened by local government authorities, house-to-house killing of civilians, organized searches to kill civilians who were hiding in <b>the</b> <b>brush,</b> <b>and</b> ambushes of civilians attempted to flee across the border into Burundi. [...] The report concluded that [...] "the great majority of these killings had apparently not been motivated by any suspicion whatsoever of personal participation by victims in the massacres of Tutsi in April 1994." [...] Gersony's personal conclusion was that between April and August 1994, the RPF had killed [...] "between 25,000 and 45,000 persons, between 5,000 and 10,000 persons each month from April through July and 5,000 for the month of August." ...|$|E
