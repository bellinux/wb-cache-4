40|$|SUMMARY: The sonic {{disruption}} of spores of Bacillus cereus gives multi-hit kinetics. The flrst hit destroys the exosporium, which protects <b>the</b> <b>spore</b> body from destruction; the second hit destroys <b>the</b> <b>spore</b> body. Spores {{which have been}} stripped oftheir exosporia are still viable and heat resistant. From the rate of release during genic tmatment it appears that alanine raceITLsse, adenosine deaminase and hexos-amine {{are located in the}} exosporium while ribosidase is in <b>the</b> <b>spore</b> body. <b>The</b> rate of release of dipicolinic acid does not identify it $ location. Since the discovery of alanine racemase in spores (Stewart & Halvorson, 1953) several other enzymes have been found in preparations of well-cleaned spores (reviewed by Halvorson & Church, 1957).
