As of January 2012, the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards. Since October 2008, the museum's Director General has been Diane Lees.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} checks and {{balances}} built into the state constitution that limit {{the power of the}} General Assembly. Other clauses allow the General Assembly to balance and limit the authority of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>branches</b> of the government. Among these {{checks and balances}} is the governor's authority to veto any bill passed by the General Assembly. The General Assembly may in turn override his veto by simple majority vote in both houses. Bills passed by a super majority automatically become law without requiring the signature of the governor. Once the bill is made law, it can be challenged in the state courts which may rule the law to be unconstitutional, effectively repealing the law. The General Assembly could then override the court's decision by amending the state constitution to include the law. The General Assembly has historically been the most powerful branch of the state government, dominating a weak governor's office. Although the governor has gained more power in the past fifty years, the General Assembly still retains the power to remove much of that authority.|$|E

5|$|Employees {{arrive at}} a Dunder Mifflin company picnic, where Michael (Steve Carell) plans to win back his ex-girlfriend Holly (Amy Ryan), whom he has not seen since she was {{transferred}} to Nashua. Holly arrives with her boyfriend A. J. (Rob Huebel), who tells Michael the couple are designing a house together. CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) allows Michael and Holly to do a presentation {{about the history of}} Dunder Mifflin, and the two spend time in the woods to come up with ideas. Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) run into Charles Miner (Idris Elba) {{for the first time since}} he left Scranton, and Charles is still short with Jim. Dwight (Rainn Wilson) brings his new best friend, Rolf (James Urbaniak), who makes constant insults to Angela (Angela Kinsey) for breaking Dwight's heart; Dwight tells Rolf to stop, much to Angela's surprise. The Scranton branch competes in the picnic's volleyball tournament, facing off <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>branches</b> of Dunder Mifflin. They initially struggle until Pam reveals herself to be a very talented volleyball player. With her help, they reach the final round where they face the corporate head office.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the office}} of Indiana's Governor has been a weaker {{institution}} relative to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>branches</b> of state government and also {{when compared to the}} role of governors of other U.S. states. During Indiana's territorial period, there was a considerable resentment to the power wielded by the territorial governors, and in response the anti-governor faction, which dominated the constitutional convention, created a weak executive position. The governor was not given complete authority over the militia, his term was set at three years, and most of his actions could be overridden by the General Assembly. The position was steadily weakened by the legislature, and his power was limited further by the constitution of 1851. The governor's authority to choose his own appointments for the state courts was removed, and the ability to appoint his own cabinet was ended. The cabinet was effectively made independent by making them elected popularly. The authority to propose budgets was revoked, and serving consecutive terms was banned. By comparison, the Supreme Court was made almost entirely independent, and the General Assembly assumed many of the powers taken from the governor.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of a tunnel under the Narrows to Brooklyn and a connection there with the BMT Fourth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway system, the SIRT electrified its lines using third rail power distribution and cars {{similar to those of}} the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). The first electric train was operated on the South Beach Branch between South Beach and Fort Wadsworth on May 30, 1925, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>branches</b> were electrified by November 1925. The promise of faster and more reliable service with electrification spurred developers and private individuals to purchase land alongside the SIRT lines, with the intention of providing housing for residents that would be attracted to living on Staten Island. The electrification brought no big increase in traffic, and the tunnel was never built. In the 1920s, a branch along the West Shore of Staten Island was built to haul materials to construct the Outerbridge Crossing. The branch was cut back to a point south of the bridge after the bridge was built. The Gulf Oil Corporation opened a dock and tank farm along the Arthur Kill in 1928 and in order to serve it, the Travis Branch was built south from Arlington Yard into the marshes of the island's western shore to Gulfport.|$|E

5|$|On 25 August 1943, Farquharson {{enlisted in}} the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and was {{assigned}} to No.1 Air Command, based in Trenton, Ontario. He was posted to the United Kingdom in 1944 and briefly returned to No.1 Air Command before being released from service on 22 November 1945 with the rank of wing commander. During the war, he chaired the Penicillin Committee of Canada, which regulated the distribution of penicillin (an antibiotic that largely replaced the sulfonamide used earlier in the war) to the armed forces, and was {{a consultant to the}} RCAF's Director of Medical Services. He was also consulted on medical matters by both <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>branches</b> of the Canadian armed forces and by various Allied medical groups. He supervised medical experiments involving penicillin therapy conducted in Ontario hospitals in 194344, and was temporarily appointed Director of Medicine at Christie St. Veteran's Hospital in Toronto. After V-E Day, he travelled to Belgium to supervise the administration of penicillin therapy, and later became involved in the care and treatment of war veterans. For his service in the war, Farquharson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in January 1946. His brother Charles also served in both world wars.|$|E
