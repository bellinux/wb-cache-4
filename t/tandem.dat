5|$|The best-known {{hallmark}} of Vanaja, the full-load lifting <b>tandem</b> axle, {{was introduced in}} January 1957. This invention enabled an additional load of 2.5 tonnes to be carried and the entire load on the <b>tandem</b> could be moved to the fore axle using an electro-hydraulic system. The system improved the traction, offering a significant advantage on slippery surfaces. The innovative lifting <b>tandem</b> was developed under leadership of the company's chief engineer Veikko Muronen. Vanaja became the leader in the Finnish logging vehicle market and maintained this position until production ceased. In forestry work, a layout with a driven front axle and a <b>tandem</b> axle with a driven fore axle, called 4×4+2, became famous in Finland but is seldom seen outside the Nordic countries.|$|E
5|$|A second I-215 {{was built}} to an order from OKB-1 as the I-215D (dooblyor, second prototype), to {{evaluate}} the bicycle or <b>tandem</b> landing gear configuration. It used wider-diameter paired wheels in a <b>tandem</b> arrangement that retracted into the fuselage, along with small outrigger wheels under the engine nacelles which retracted into fairings. The main undercarriage of the I-215D also incorporated a kneeling feature which could increase the incidence of the aircraft by 3° to assist take-off. Trials with this undercarriage arrangement were successful and {{paved the way for}} its use in other Soviet aircraft, including Dr. Brunolf Baade's Aircraft 150, then under development.|$|E
5|$|Banded sugar ants are the {{dominant}} group of nocturnal ants in their range. Workers are mostly encountered at dusk when they are foraging for food on marked trails or on Casuarina and Eucalyptus trees. These ants also forage during the day, but they are more frequently seen at night. They are also more active during the warmer seasons, especially summer. Banded sugar ants use multiple social techniques to make other ants follow them to a food source; this includes a worker carrying another worker, <b>tandem</b> running, or simply leaving a pheromone trail to the source. Around 2–35% of foraging workers engage in <b>tandem</b> running.|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{mechanically}} active proteins {{are organized}} into <b>tandems</b> of identical repeats, (D) N, or heterogeneous <b>tandems,</b> D 1 –D 2 –…–DN. In current {{atomic force microscopy}} experiments, conformational transitions of protein <b>tandems</b> can be accessed by employing constant stretching force f (force-clamp) and by analyzing the recorded unfolding times of individual domains. Analysis of unfolding data for homogeneous <b>tandems</b> relies {{on the assumption that}} unfolding times are independent and identically distributed, and involves inference of the (parent) probability density of unfolding times from the histogram of the combined unfolding times. This procedure cannot be used to describe <b>tandems</b> characterized by interdomain interactions, or heteregoneous <b>tandems.</b> In this article, we introduce an alternative approach that is based on recognizing that the observed data are ordered, i. e., first, second, third, etc., unfolding times. The approach is exemplified through the analysis of unfolding times for a computer model of the homogeneous and heterogeneous <b>tandems,</b> subjected to constant force. We show that, in the experimentally accessible range of stretching forces, the independent and identically distributed assumption may not hold. Specifically, the uncorrelated unfolding transitions of individual domains at lower force may become correlated (dependent) at elevated force levels. The proposed formalism can be used in atomic force microscopy experiments to infer the unfolding time distributions of individual domains from experimental histograms of ordered unfolding times, and it can be extended to analyzing protein <b>tandems</b> that exhibit interdomain interactions...|$|R

5|$|The Cheyenne had a two-seat <b>tandem</b> cockpit {{featuring}} {{an advanced}} navigation and fire control suite. The <b>tandem</b> seating placed the {{pilot in the}} rear seat, and the gunner in the front seat. An unusual feature of the gunner's station was that the entire seat, sighting system, and firing controls rotated to keep the gunner facing {{the same direction as}} the gun turret being controlled. The gun-sight afforded the gunner direct viewing from the turret by way of a periscope sight. The pilot had a helmet mounted sight system for aiming weapons.|$|E
5|$|To {{solve the}} {{remaining}} problems, Viète exploited {{the fact that}} the given circles and the solution circle may be re-sized in <b>tandem</b> while preserving their tangencies (Figure4). If the solution-circle radius is changed by an amount Δr, the radius of its internally tangent given circles must be likewise changed by Δr, whereas the radius of its externally tangent given circles must be changed by −Δr. Thus, as the solution circle swells, the internally tangent given circles must swell in <b>tandem,</b> whereas the externally tangent given circles must shrink, to maintain their tangencies.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{full-size}} mock-up inspection in April 1949 {{was generally}} favorable, range again became a concern since the J40s and early model J57s had excessive fuel consumption. Despite talk of another revision of specifications {{or even a}} full design competition among aircraft manufacturers, General LeMay, {{now in charge of}} Strategic Air Command, insisted that performance should not be compromised due to delays in engine development. In a final attempt to increase range, Boeing created the larger 464-67, stating that once in production, the range could be further increased in subsequent modifications. Following several direct interventions by LeMay, Boeing was awarded a production contract for thirteen B-52As and seventeen detachable reconnaissance pods on 14 February 1951. The last major design change—also at General LeMay's insistence—was a switch from the B-47 style <b>tandem</b> seating to a more conventional side-by-side cockpit, which increased the effectiveness of the copilot and reduced crew fatigue. Both XB-52 prototypes featured the original <b>tandem</b> seating arrangement with a framed bubble-type canopy.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} finding {{end-to-end}} delay bounds for single leaky-bucket shaped flows subject to FIFO multiplexing in <b>tandems</b> of rate-latency nodes. More specifically, we focus on a methodology, called the Least Upper Delay Bound (LUDB) method, which is based on Network Calculus. The latter has already been used for computing delay bounds in <b>tandems</b> in which the paths of the flows are subject to particular restrictions. In this paper we generalize and extend it to <b>tandems</b> traversed by flows following arbitrary paths. We show that such methodology yields better bounds than those obtained through both per-node analysis and comparable methods proposed in the literature...|$|R

5|$|Browne was {{regarded}} as an intelligent and meticulous athlete, who was known for a logical and somewhat introspective style in his approach to the sport. He felt {{that he did not}} have the raw speed to match the likes of Lionel Cox and Dick Ploog in vying for selection in Australia's sprint team, and that he was not suited to long road races, instead focusing on medium length track racing. Browne typically was the front rider in <b>tandem</b> races, liking to be in control. He {{was regarded}} to be a cyclist who behaved in a careful and scholarly manner, and was known for coaxing higher levels of performance out of his younger partners. Browne was respected for his technical knowledge of the <b>tandem</b> and his success was often attributed to his vast experience.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in <b>tandem.</b> The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in <b>tandem</b> has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.|$|E
