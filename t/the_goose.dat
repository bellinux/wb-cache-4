5|$|Between September 2 and September 17, the Breeders {{performed}} in eleven cities, among which were St. Louis, Denver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. Support groups the Funs and the Neptunas opened {{for them at}} five and six of these shows, respectively. The band then played at the Hollywood Bowl concert, and wrapped up the tour on September 20 at <b>the</b> <b>Goose</b> Island 312 Urban Block Dance Party event in Chicago. In addition to their new songs, they performed numerous selections from Last Splash and Pod (1990). The tour received good reviews from critics; appraisal included comments that the performances were rousing, and that the band was as good as—or better than—in its heyday.|$|E

5|$|Exploration of salt domes {{across the}} plains of the Texas Gulf Coast took off with major oil fields opening at Sour Lake in 1902, Batson in 1903, Humble in 1905, and Goose Creek (modern Baytown) in 1908. Pipelines and {{refineries}} were built throughout much of Southeast Texas, leading to substantial industrialization, particularly around Houston and the Galveston Bay. The first offshore oilfield in the state opened in 1917 at Black Duck Bay on <b>the</b> <b>Goose</b> Creek field, although serious offshore exploration did not begin until the 1930s.|$|E

On September 10, the Breeders started a short Pacific Coast stretch, performing in Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco.

50|$|<b>The</b> lesser snow <b>goose</b> {{travels through}} <b>the</b> Central Flyway, across {{some of the}} richest {{farmland}} in America. Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> wintered in coastal marsh areas where they used their short but very strong bills to dig the roots of marsh grasses for dinner. The first transition was to rice fields, where <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> could graze on weeds and eat the grain {{left behind by the}} combine. A decade later <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> had mastered field feeding and had diversified into wheat, corn, sorghum and practically any other field grain they encountered. <b>The</b> <b>geese</b> had also begun to graze in fall-seeded grain fields, especially winter wheat. Snow Geese now feed in grain fields as soon as they reach the prairies in September, and they continue to use agricultural fields until they leave the prairies in April and May on their way to Arctic breeding areas.|$|R
40|$|The habitat {{choice of}} <b>geese</b> depends on <b>the</b> food offer. This offer changes during the year. Brent Geese use only {{one third of}} the {{energetic}} content of their food, so they have to eat large quantities of relatively high-quality food. <b>The</b> <b>geese</b> maximise their net-energy intake by a shift from the improved grassland in early spring to the salt marsh vegetation in late spring. In this period they have to build up body reserves for the flight to their breeding grounds. So <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> need high quality of food. We want to know if geese are selecting for plant quality or biomass (quantity). In the field quality and quantity of food offer are usually associated. In this study we tried to test the effect of plant quality, quantity and salinity on the habitat choice of Brent Geese. The choice of <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> could be measured by observations of Brent Geese in an experimental cage of 4 x 4 m. Two types of experiments were done. The decision experiments with four Brent Geese and salt experiments with four Brent and two Barnacle Geese. During the decision experiments <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> could choose between two halves differing in quality (fertilised, unfertilised) or quantity (high biomass, low biomass). The behaviour and location of <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> were recorded. During the salt experiments <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> could choose between a vegetation sprayed with fresh and a vegetation sprayed with salt water. There is a difference in food choice between <b>the</b> experimental <b>geese</b> and <b>the</b> wild <b>geese.</b> <b>The</b> wild <b>geese</b> have to gain weight in spring so they feed on the vegetation with the highest quality at that moment. Wild geese spent more time in foraging an feed twice intensively. <b>The</b> experimental <b>geese</b> could forage 24 hours and spent more time in sleeping or grooming. <b>The</b> wild <b>geese</b> showed a clear preference for the fertilised vegetation. In most cases the highest biomass was on the fertilised parts of the vegetation. In the first experiment <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> choose for quantity (biomass) and there was no preference for the fertilised vegetation when {{there was no difference in}} biomass. In the second experiment, there was a preference for the fertilised vegetation, when there was no difference in biomass. The quantity of the food seemed to have no effect on the preference. However we showed that <b>the</b> <b>geese</b> can select on quantity and quality, it is not yet clear how the preference for vegetation can be independently explained by quantity or quality of the vegetation. Salt influences the food choice of the Brent Geese and the Barnacle Geese. Brent Geese choose for a vegetation with fresh water. Barnacle Geese also choose for a vegetation with fresh water. During the experiments with two Brent and two Barnacle Geese there was a difference in choice between <b>the</b> <b>geese.</b> <b>The</b> Brent Geese fed on the salt and the Barnacle Geese fed on the fresh vegetation. The food choice of the Brent Geese was influenced by the behaviour of the Barnacle Geese. Inter-specific competition (competition between two species) influences the food choice of <b>the</b> <b>geese.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{research}} on migrating bird species. Two model species for migrating birds are <b>the</b> Barnacle <b>geese</b> (Branta leucopsis) and <b>the</b> Brent <b>geese</b> (Branta bernicla). A lot is known about their foraging, migrating and breeding behavior. Most studies focused only on a specific interaction during a specific time of the year. By putting all this information of different interactions and different areas together it is possible to make an interaction network for the whole flyway route of <b>the</b> <b>geese.</b> Brent geese are declining in numbers, while Barnacle geese numbers are growing. Because habitats are overlapping, it could be that, due to competition, <b>the</b> Barnacle <b>geese</b> have a share in the decline of <b>the</b> Brent <b>geese.</b> By comparing <b>the</b> interaction network of Barnacle and Brent geese it is possible to gain an insight into interactions between the two species. The analysis of the flyway route of <b>the</b> Barnacle <b>geese</b> shows that they only share the Wadden Sea wintering area with <b>the</b> Brent <b>geese.</b> It could be possible that <b>the</b> Barnacle <b>geese,</b> which are bigger and in increasing numbers, are “pushing” <b>the</b> Brent <b>geese</b> from their foraging areas. However, <b>the</b> Brent <b>geese</b> were already declining before the Barnacle arrived in the Wadden Sea area. At the moment it seems that <b>the</b> increasing Barnacle <b>geese</b> numbers do not have a direct effect on the numbers of Brent geese. ...|$|R
