40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} a new decision aid to improve restorative treatment decision making for proximal caries from bitewing radiographs. Methods: Dental teachers involved in patient treatment and clinical caries diagnosis (n = 31) viewed a computerized decision aid. Whilst using <b>the</b> <b>aid,</b> <b>measures</b> of the teachers' diagnostic and treatment accuracy, and also their decision-making knowledge and values were recorded. After completing the aid, they evaluated its performance on ten aspects using visual analogue scales. We carried out two linear regression analyses, using "Overall usefulness" {{of the aid}} as the dependent variable. The independent variables were (1) nine decision-making variables and (2) the nine other aspects of aid performance. Results: The teachers gave the program a mean overall usefulness score of 70 % (median 73 %, standard deviation (SD) 15 %). Information presentation scored lowest (mean 58. 9 %, median 64. 5 %, SD 19 %) and aesthetic appearance of the aid scored highest (mean 77. 4 %, median 80. 5 %, SD 11. 5 %). The teachers' diagnostic and treatment decision-making acumen {{was not related to}} the score for overall usefulness (P > 0. 14). Dentists with a lower subjective estimate of the probability of disease or a higher subjective estimate of 10 -year restoration survival valued the aid more highly (P 0. 001). Conclusions: The basic decision-making variables from which the aid provides individual feedback and advice may need additional improvement in presentation. Despite shortcomings and irrespective of the users' diagnostic ability, the aid was valued as generally useful...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the state aid {{rules of the}} European Union {{and the application of}} these rules on banks. The primary problem that is addressed is what conditions should be fulfilled in order for state aid to banks to be declared compatible with the Common Market according to article 107 3 FEUF. The thesis addresses all kinds of state aid to banks and these have been divided into the following groups; (i) aid to banks (which are not in financial difficulties), (ii) aid to banks in financial difficulties, and (iii) aid to banks during a system crisis. The application of the state aid rules by the Commission has typically been very formal and there has been incufficient analysis of the actual consequences of aid granted to banks. This thesis is intended to contribute to a more systematic application by the Commission of the state aid rules on banks. Certain conditions must be identified and scrutinized in the application of the state aid rules on banks. Aid measures granted must, in order to be approved, be of public and common interest and the positive effects must be balanced against any negative effects. In order to achieve public and common interest in every individual case, <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>measures</b> granted must be well balanced, necessary and have a stimulative effect. This thesis {{examines the}}se conditions within each category of aid to banks. Finally, I identify compensatory measures that may be well suited for banks. My thesis presents a systematic approach for the application of state aid to banks. In order to this this, I have found it important to describe the meaning of different concepts and conditions. The thesis will contribute to the discussion regarding “less and better targeted aid”...|$|E
40|$|Parents, {{children}} and young people have the right as recipients of statutory socio-educational provision for children with problems to participate in all the decisions regarding the helping process. The stronger participation in selection and organisation of aid measures has the objective in a traditional field of practice of intervention of being more democratic and based on the requirements of the addressee orientated structures to create and hence increase the acceptance of such aid. The objective of our work is to establish the perspective of the parents with respect to either their participation in the specific organisation of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>measures</b> or to determine the accompanying offers of the parents in order to reveal the discrepancy between the offers and objectives on the pedagogic side coming from instrumental participation understanding and the often very individual participation strategies {{on the side of the}} parents and to throw light on the background. This quality oriented analysis looks at the question of how parents use the learning and developing process Help for education in the day-group against the background of given structural, professional-conceptual and individual conditions and with what strategies they specifically influence it. In the first section there is a theoretical discussion with participation as structure maxim of environment-orientated youth work. In the second section the structural and professional-conceptual framework for the participation of the parents in the framework of statutory socio-educational provision for children with problems is analysed and put in concrete terms using an example from Berlin day-groups. The third section describes the methodology behind the data collection and analysis. The fourth section of the paper presents, interprets and reflects upon the empirical findings: firstly, we investigate the initial situation, the expectations and requirements of the parents as motivational basis for participatory action. Subsequently we are concerned with the helper-client-relationship, whereby the professional process and the occupational individual concepts of the teachers enjoys a special significance with regard to the actions of the parents. Finally, the open and hidden contradictions and the power and control character of participation are analysed, The fifth section reflects on the findings of the current work. It reveals that parental action to a certain extent unfolds independently from the pedagogic participation offers and thus shows forms of participation that are not parallel to conventional conceptions of participation. These alternative strategies represent the parental attempt at self-determined action within the institution that tends to be susceptible to paternalism and heteronomy with regards to its clients and thus through participation to use the educational help as a personal learning and developing process...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} and analyse institutional practice in need assessment dialogues. The questions were: How are the dialogues structured? How is the professional dialogue content combined with: the institutional, traditional and personal perspectives? How are communicative problems solved? Mapping, assessing and deciding on social welfare or other aid measures for elderly people is one part of the concretisation of the elderly care policy in the encounter with the individual citizen. This concretisation is not just a simple transfer of political goals but, rather, contains implications for elderly care institutions as a whole, for elderly oriented social work and for processing. Examples of such implications are demands on knowledge growth in elderly oriented social work and demands on professional practice. The institutional actors, the case officers, serve an important purpose for the elderly in the encounter with elderly care. The need assessment dialogue between case officers and elderly persons is thus seen as a communicative activity or practice through which they (re) produce elderly care. It is this that the study attempts to give shape to. The project has its theoretical underpinning in social constructionism and in dialogism, which explain people’s everyday actions and interaction and how people make their knowledge and assumptions comprehensible. The social constructionist theory also explains how social institutions are created and maintained in people’s interaction in institutional talk. Data have been collected in the form of video recordings of 16 need assessment meetings and consist of about 12 hours of recorded need assessment dialogues. Content analyses of interactive courses of events in need assessment dialogues have been performed. The results show that phases constitute the structure of the dialogues and make them comprehensible. The phases serve different functions in the need assessment dialogues. The phase structure can be seen as a sub activity, which has specific aims and solves different tasks that are central to the case officer’s work. The phase structure consists of: opening, framing, mapping of needs, information and counselling, the turning-point in the dialogue and conclusion. A prominent feature of the study is the relationship between institutional order and professional practice. This relationship is the basis of different dilemmas in the encounter with the client. The key task facing the case officer is to bridge these dilemmas by means of different strategies. The case officer’s professional task in need assessments is not only to assess care requirements but also to make the institutional prerequisites of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>measures</b> comprehensible to the client and to transform care requirements into institutional abstractions. The knowledge contribution consists of an understanding of the complexity of the dialogue and how meaning and perspectives in the dialogue are produced interactively in different ways. An important knowledge contribution is the importance of communication in elderly oriented social work. This is a key factor in establishing a working relationship between the client and the case officer. It is also a key factor in the case officer’s professional practice.

40|$|In 1995 Finland {{joined to}} the European Union as the northernmost country. The {{membership}} in the EU caused {{significant changes in the}} Finnish agricultural sector. The whole food production chain had to face a new competitive situation. Changes concerning the abolition of border controls and decrease in the producer prices had a great influence on the livelihood of the farming population. The number of farms engaged in agricultural production has fallen rapidly in the last decade, and the average farm size is increasing. Both of these trends are expected to continue. Income development of farmers and profitability of agriculture are most critical issues in the adjustment process of agriculture, and some results of the recent studies on income development and estimates concerning the Agenda regime have been presented in this paper. Discussion on the increased support bound of the agriculture cannot be avoided, because in Finland the farm income would be zero or negative in all production lines without any direct support. According to some recent studies on the impacts of Agenda 2000, the average farm income would slightly increase at the farm level. However, the positive income development depends on the development of input and output prices, of which input prices have mainly raised according to the general inflation. Most of the national aid is longstanding, but for the livestock and horticultural production in the southern parts of the country the agreement has to be renegotiated every few years. Next time <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>measures</b> for South Finland will be reassessed in 2003. MTT Economic Research is responsible for most of the income and profitability calculations needed in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for the negotiations. From time to time income studies have been more in focus in Finnish agricultural policy; in late 80 s and early 90 s comparisons of income development between farmers and other salary earners were mentioned in the agricultural income laws, and for that the MTTL had a longstanding research project in collaboration with the authors of income statistics. In that connection research was mainly directed to income concepts and development of data sources (Puurunen 1990). When Finland joined to the EU effects of the common policy on farmers' income and profitability of agriculture became very important research themes and separate research programmes were based for that in Finland. At that time more effort was put to the prognoses of income and profitability development. The old income study became also topical especially for the total income formation of farm families. Pressures for a strong structural reform were seen in agriculture, which emphasised additional need for part time farming and importance of income sources out side of the farm. In 2000 Minna Vare brought up to date farmers' income study (Vare 2000). In the following we have first briefly described the change in the farm structure and investments during the EU-membership, which is on the background of the income development of farmers in recent years. Some income concepts and structure of the statistics used in the income comparisons of Finnish farmers and other population groups has been examined in chapter 3. Income development of farmers in sector level and in different farm groups are examined in the chapter 4. In the beginning of the chapter 4 some figures of the total calculation of agriculture have been presented, and in addition to the income developments during past few years some references to the ongoing scenario work on the effects of Agenda 2000 at the MTTL have been taken with. On the farm level the income formation of farmers is examined in the different farm size groups, {{in different parts of the}} country, maybe less attention has been paid to the production line, but more to the part time/full time grouping of farms and conclusions from that.

A few of these transactions have been declared by Swedish administrative courts to constitute illegal below market value transfers of public resources. The essay seeks {{to determine whether the}} Swedish national provisions that govern legal claims based on the directly effective Art. 88 (3) of the EC Treaty, are compatible with the principle of effectiveness, i. e. to what extent these provisions (do not) render virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Art. 88 (3) EC.

According to historian Toader Paleologu, Iunian attempted to preserve a middle ground in respect to the two centrifugal tendencies inside the grouping, while opposing the PNŢ tendency for collaboration with the increasingly authoritarian King Carol II:"Grigore Iunian was the consistent partisan of openness in relations with Carol II, of strict legality in respect to the extremist parties and creating a large center-left coalition on the basis of an actual common program. In effect, his principled attitude placed him in a very courageous situation: partisans of the King competed in repressing extreme elements with <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> of <b>measures</b> that were debatable from a legal point of view, and the so-called left came to ally itself with the Iron Guard against the Liberals." ...|$|R

40|$|Eleven {{patients}} who evinced hallucinations {{during the early}} recovery after head injury were studied in detail {{in comparison to the}} head injured controls. All of them had suffered from acceleration injuries. Among the clinical variables, post traumatic amnesia was significantly longer in these patients. Length of FTA was found to be correlated with duration of occurrence of hallucinations. Severity of coma, skull fracture, early seizures and alcohol dependence were not discriminatory between the hallucinated patients and the controls. The disorder tended to be self-limiting and patients recovered without <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> of psychopharmacological <b>measures.</b> Theoretical significance of the findings are discussed in the context of recent literature on head injury...|$|R

In a previous study, we investigated slow cortical potential (SCP) N 1 -P 2 amplitudes and N 1 latencies in aided and unaided conditions, with the finding that despite being set to provide 20 or 40 dB of gain, none of <b>the</b> hearing <b>aids</b> resulted in a reliable increase in SCP response amplitude relative to the unaided (Marynewich et al., in press). The current study investigates the effects of hearing-aid processing on acoustic measures for two 1000 -Hz tonal stimuli: short (60 ms) and long (757 ms), presented at three intensities (30, 50, 70 dB SPL) in aided and unaided conditions using three hearing aids (Analog, DigitalA, DigitalB) with two gain settings (20, 40 dB). Acoustic results indicate that gain achieved by <b>the</b> hearing <b>aids,</b> <b>measured</b> at 30 ms after stimulus onset, for both the short and long stimuli, was less than real-ear insertion gain measured with standard hearing aid test signals. Additionally, <b>the</b> digital hearing <b>aids</b> altered <b>the</b> rise time of the stimuli such that maximum gain was reached well past 30 ms after stimulus onset; rise times differed between <b>the</b> digital <b>aids.</b> These results indicate that aided SCP results must be cautiously interpreted and that further research is required for clinical application. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a framework for}} understanding task and psychological factors affecting reliance on advice from decision <b>aids.</b> <b>The</b> framework describes how informational asymmetries in combination with rational, motivational and heuristic factors explain human reliance behavior. To test hypotheses derived from the framework, 79 participants performed an uncertain pattern learning and prediction task. They received advice from a decision aid either before or after they expressed their own prediction, and received feedback about performance. When their prediction conflicted with that of <b>the</b> decision <b>aid,</b> participants had to choose to rely on their own prediction or on that of <b>the</b> decision <b>aid.</b> We <b>measured</b> reliance behavior, perceived and actual reliability of self and decision aid, responsibility felt for task outcomes, understandability of one’s own reasoning and of <b>the</b> decision <b>aid,</b> and attribution of errors. We found evidence that 1) reliance decisions are based on relative trust, but only when advice is presented after people have formed their own prediction; 2) when people rely as much on themselves as on <b>the</b> decision <b>aid,</b> they still perceive <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> to be mor...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{possible}} {{reasons for the}} 1934 amendment's victory have been advanced: the popularity of George Norris; the Depression-era desire to cut costs; public dissatisfaction with the previous year's legislature; or even the fact that, by chance, {{it was on the}} ballot in the same year as an amendment to legalize parimutuel betting on horse races.
