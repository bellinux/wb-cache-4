5|$|Vivah premiered on 10 November 2006 across India. Like Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!, Rajshri Productions {{released}} {{limited number}} of prints for the film and eventually increased prints with increasing popularity. Early reviewers of Vivah predicted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> huge disappointment. The film opened well {{and went on to}} become a commercially successful venture.|$|E
5|$|Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! premiered at Liberty Cinema in {{southern}} Mumbai on 5 August 1994; it eventually ran there for over 100 weeks. The film initially saw {{a very limited}} release, also showing at the Regal and Eros theatres, with only 26 prints total. Eventually it started to appear in many more theatres. When initial viewers complained about the film's length, 2 of the 14 song sequences were removed. These were later restored when film goers were found to enjoy all of the songs. Early reviewers of Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! predicted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> huge flop; hence the industry was stunned when it {{went on to become}} the most successful film of all time up to that point.|$|E

5|$|In 1825 Hogg {{accompanied}} {{his brother}} John {{on a tour}} of Continental Europe. Jane encouraged him to take the trip, believing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> test of his commitment to her. He returned to England in February 1826. Although Hogg enjoyed the trip, he missed reading Greek literature and English newspapers. Writing the journals that were published in 1827 under the title Two Hundred and Nine Days occupied much of his time during the trip. He frequently attacked the Catholic Church and customs officials in his journals, but he often made positive observations about the lifestyles of many of the ordinary people that he met. Hogg also recounted his visit to the grave of Percy Shelley in Italy.|$|E
5|$|In Boston, after Vivien (Connie Britton) catches Ben (Dylan McDermott) {{cheating}} on her, he begs for her forgiveness, {{and says he}} {{would do anything to}} save their marriage. This includes getting out of Boston and relocating to a different city. He shows her pictures of a great house in an older district of Los Angeles, claiming Vivien loves old houses. He tells her the price of the house is strangely lower than those around it, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great place for the family to start over.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} if {{the film was}} {{initially}} planned {{or if it was}} mere assumption, but it was reported <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> two reel production in September 1913. Newspaper accounts change to reference the film as having three reels by October 3, 1913. As details spread in the newspaper, the film's working title continued to be referenced as A Restless Spirit in various papers. Newspaper references began to reference the final title on October 24, 1913. The film was released on October 27, 1913 by Universal Film Manufacturing Company under the Victor label.|$|E

5|$|The United States' {{declaration}} of independence from Great Britain in 1776 led criollos (Spanish peoples born in the Americas) to believe that revolution and independence from Spain were feasible. Between 1775 and 1783, the American patriots of the Thirteen Colonies waged the American Revolutionary War against both the local loyalists and the Kingdom of Great Britain, eventually establishing a popular government {{in the place of}} the British monarchy. The fact that Spain aided the colonies in their struggle against Britain weakened the idea <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> crime to end one's allegiance to the parent state.|$|E
5|$|The first Kingdom Hearts was {{announced}} at E3 in May 2001. Initial details were <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> collaboration between Square and Disney Interactive, and would feature worlds developed by both companies and Disney characters. New characters {{were designed by}} Nomura and include Sora, Riku, Kairi, and the Heartless. On May 14, 2002, a press release announced {{a list of the}} English voice actors. The list included Haley Joel Osment, David Gallagher, and Hayden Panettiere as the three new characters introduced into the game. It was also announced that many of the Disney characters would be voiced by the official voice actors from their respective Disney films.|$|E
5|$|The first {{operations}} in 1940 concerned Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of Britain by the Wehrmacht. The unit was to receive 30 PR Supermarine Spitfire aircraft, specialised and adapted for reconnaissance use. They would {{be capable of}} 1,750 miles round trips. However, just 13 aircraft were available to the unit, and their range limited to 1,300 miles. Eventually, an assortment of Vickers Wellington and Spitfire flights were established. In August 1940, the first PR Spitfires arrived, but teething problems ensured <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> long time before standardisation was achieved with equipment. In August, Coastal Command flew 193 sorties over the suspected invasion ports in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.|$|E

5|$|Wipeout HD {{was first}} {{announced}} during E3 2007, {{where it was}} revealed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> download-only title which would feature remastered versions of old race tracks.

However, a 2007 release was not forthcoming; development continued through 2008, and a shifting release date was eventually finalised in the middle of September 2008, for release later that month.|$|E
5|$|Demolition and The Hart Foundation {{had faced}} each other two years earlier at SummerSlam 1988, where Demolition had {{successfully}} defended the WWF Tag Team Championship. The Hart Foundation duo of Jim Neidhart and Bret Hart later focused on singles wrestling but soon reunited as a team. They announced on the March 31 episode of WWF Superstars {{that they wanted to}} challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship after the WrestleMania match between The Colossal Connection and Demolition. After Demolition won the match, The Hart Foundation faced The Rockers on the April 28 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event. Demolition interfered, causing a double disqualification. On the July 14 episode of WWF Superstars, Demolition and The Hart Foundation brawled after The Hart Foundation claimed that Demolition having three members was evidence of cowardice. The following week, a match between the teams was announced for SummerSlam. The stipulations stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> two out of three falls match and that only two members of Demolition would be allowed at ringside.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{returned}} to the United States {{at the end of}} his one-year tour of duty in February 1945, and was assigned to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina and then to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. He was promoted to captain in July 1945, shortly before the Pacific War's end, but was uncertain of securing a regular commission in the Marine Corps. He was ordered back to Cherry Point, where he joined VMF-913, another Corsair squadron, and learned that he had qualified for a regular commission. In March 1946, he was assigned to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in southern California. He volunteered for service with the occupation in North China, believing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> short tour. He joined VMF-218 (yet another Corsair squadron), which was based at Nanyuan Field near Beijing, in December 1946, and flew patrol missions until VMF-218 was transferred to Guam in March 1947. He finally returned home in December 1948.|$|E

5|$|Hergé first {{devised the}} idea of sending Tintin {{on a mission to}} the Moon while he was working on Prisoners of the Sun (1949). His {{decision}} to move into the field of science fiction might have been influenced by his friendly rivalry with his colleague Edgar P. Jacobs, who had recently had success with his own science fiction comic, The Secret of the Swordfish (1950–53). He decided <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> two-volume story arc, as had proved successful with his earlier arcs, The Secret of the Unicorn (1943) and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944), and The Seven Crystal Balls (1948) and Prisoners of the Sun. He had initially intended on beginning this story after the culmination of Prisoners of the Sun, but both his wife Germaine Remi and his close friend Marcel Dehaye convinced him to proceed with Land of Black Gold (1950), a story that he had previously left unfinished, instead.|$|E
5|$|I {{started doing}} {{different}} charity events where I did {{a combination of}} 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E
5|$|One {{matter in}} which he {{invested}} much effort was the political situation of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In Peru, power struggles between conquistadors and the viceroy became an open civil war in which the conquistadors led by Gonzalo Pizarro rebelled against the New Laws and defeated and executed the viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela in 1546. The Emperor sent Pedro de la Gasca, a friend of Las Casas, to reinstate the rule of law, and he in turn defeated Pizarro. In order to restabilize the political situation the encomenderos started pushing {{not only for the}} repeal of the New Laws, but for turning the encomiendas into perpetual patrimony of the encomenderos – the worst possible outcome from Las Casas's point of view. The encomenderos offered to buy the rights to the encomiendas from the crown, and Charles V was inclined to accept since his wars had left him in deep economic troubles. Las Casas worked hard to convince the king <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bad economic decision, that it would return the viceroyalty to the brink of open rebellion, and could result in the crown losing the colony entirely. The Emperor, probably because of the doubts caused by Las Casas's arguments, never took a final decision {{on the issue of the}} encomiendas.|$|E

5|$|Periyar {{fought against}} the {{orthodox}} traditions of marriage as suppression of women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian sub-continent. Though arranged marriages were meant to enable a couple to live together throughout life, it was manipulated to enslave women. Much worse was the practice of child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sin to marry after puberty. Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the dowry system where the bride's family is supposed to give the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, and in certain circumstances, lead to dowry deaths. There have been {{hundreds of thousands of}} cases where wives have been murdered, mutilated, and burned alive because the father of the bride was unable to make the dowry payment to the husband. Periyar fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team began {{development}} on Sonic the Hedgehog in 2004, {{after the completion}} of Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003). The team was considering working on an original non-Sonic project, with a realistic look and feel and an advanced physics engine. When they were reassigned to work on the new Sonic game, they decided to retain the realistic approach for the new game. Series co-creator and team lead Yuji Naka envisioned the next-generation Sonic game as a reboot of the franchise, and wanted to mimic the success of superhero films such as Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Batman Begins (2005). It was decided to use the same title as the original 1991 game that had launched the franchise to indicate <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major advance from the previous games. The Havok physics engine, previously used in their PlayStation 2 game Astro Boy (2004), allowed them to create expansive levels previously impossible on earlier sixth generation consoles, and experiment with multiple play-styles. Game director Shun Nakamura demonstrated the engine during their stage shows at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
5|$|The {{first group}} of 35, which {{included}} Shepard, assembled at the Pentagon on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, while the United States Air Force officers were addressed by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance. That evening, Shepard discussed the day's events with fellow naval aviators Jim Lovell, Pete Conrad and Wally Schirra, all of whom would eventually become astronauts.
