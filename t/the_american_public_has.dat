25|$|U.S. Public {{opinion on}} the One-China Policy is much more {{ambiguous}} than {{the opinions of the}} American political elites and policy experts. A Pew Research poll from 2012 found that 84% of policy experts believe it to be very important to for the U.S. to build a strong relationship with China, where as only 55% of the general public agreed with that statement . This vast difference of agreement between policy experts and <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Public</b> <b>has</b> been translated into recent politics; Donald Trumps phone call 25 days after his inauguration to the President of Taiwan, breaking a decades old policy, possibly representing an expression of current polling showing negative attitudes towards The Peoples Republic of China. Furthermore, U.S. populist attitudes towards the Peoples Republic of China are negative, where China is viewed as an economic adversary rather than a friendly rival. A 2015 Pew Research poll found that 60% of Americans view the loss of jobs to China as very serious, compared to only 21% who view the tensions between China and Taiwan as very serious. Historical trends conducted by Gallup demonstrate an increase in perception among Americans that China is the leading economic power in the world today, with polls in 2000 showing only 10% agreeing with that statement and in 2016, 50% concurring with the statement.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2011, the Chinese {{government}} {{launched a}} million dollar advertising campaign, which was aimed {{to improve the}} [...] "incomplete understandings" [...] <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> about China. A 60-second ad was shown at New York's Times Square, which featured Chinese personalities such as scientist Sun Jiadong, singer Liu Huan and news anchor Jing Yidan, ending with the message of [...] "Chinese Friendship". Newsweek noted that the ad's great production values, but criticized it as confusing and explaining little about the featured Chinese identities.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{disclosures}} were published, President Obama asserted that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> {{no cause for}} concern because [...] "nobody is listening to your telephone calls", and [...] "there is no spying on Americans".|$|R
50|$|Belden {{published}} China Shakes the World in 1949, when <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> {{lost interest}} in reports from China. The book’s reputation came only in the 1960s, when the Monthly Review Press reprinted it in paperback with a sympathetic introduction by Owen Lattimore.|$|R
50|$|The film showed Kennedy {{on a tour}} of {{the house}} with the CBS News {{correspondent}} Charles Collingwood. The filmed tour was the first glimpse <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> of <b>the</b> $2 million restoration of the White House that Kennedy had helped direct in the first year of her husband's presidency.|$|R
2500|$|Hasse died on July 28, 1953, with a fifty-four year {{career in}} library and {{information}} science. In those fifty-four years, Hasse {{made a significant}} mark on the field as a library assistant, indexer, cataloguer, classifier, bibliographer, editorial analyst, and author. She was an advocate of [...] "efficient and effective" [...] library service, public access to government materials, and the women's movement. Hasse overcame great obstacles in her quest for providing quick, easy access to materials. American Libraries states that she was best [...] "known for her acerbic personality"; however, Gail K. Nelson and John V. Richardson, Jr., state that, regardless of what one may say of her professional relationships and personal life, {{the basis of the}} Superintendent of Documents Classification system still in use today was [...] "essentially Hasse's."

5000|$|A Gallup poll from May 2005 {{showed that}} <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> more {{confidence}} in the military {{than in any other}} institution. Seventy-four percent of those surveyed said they have [...] "a great deal" [...] or [...] "quite a lot" [...] of confidence in the military.|$|E

50|$|By September 1973, {{there was}} a sense that Nixon had regained some {{political}} strength, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> become burned out by the Watergate hearings, and that Congress was not willing to undertake impeachment absent some major revelation from the Nixon White House tapes or some major new action by the president against the investigation.|$|R
50|$|The US {{attitude}} to guns generally perplexes {{those in other}} developed countries, who cannot understand why <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>have</b> not pushed for harsher gun control measures {{in the face of}} mass shootings. Critics contrast the US reaction to terrorism given how few deaths it causes, with their high death rates from non-terror related gun crime.|$|R
5000|$|Asserting a {{need for}} a more aggressive, activist foreign policy, Reagan also {{suggested}} that Americans could have defeated the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese Army, alleging that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> turned against <b>the</b> war from the influence of North Vietnamese propaganda and implying that the soldiers had been let down by Johnson and Nixon administration officials who had been [...] "afraid to let them win" [...] the war in Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|Federal {{depository}} libraries {{have been}} established by Congress to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> access to its Government's information.

5000|$|Human {{rights groups}} have raised {{questions}} as to why al-Awlaki was killed by the U.S. {{in a country with}} which the United States was not at war. Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, stated [...] "If {{the government is going to}} be firing Predator missiles at American citizens, surely <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> a right to know who’s being targeted, and why." ...|$|E

5000|$|After Parker's death, some martial {{artists have}} begun to {{question}} the authenticity of Parker's training and qualifications. Dan Djurdjevic's article [...] "What did Ed Parker Study?" [...] suggests that Ed Parker was not actually a master-level martial artist by the early 1960s but developed an undeserved reputation as a master {{at a time when}} <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> little knowledge of authentic martial arts and were unable to verify his claims.|$|R
5000|$|Publishers Weekly {{said that}} [...] "The {{crux of the}} book's {{argument}} is that... <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>have</b> grown increasingly hostile to expertise" [...] and described The Death of Expertise as a [...] "highly researched and impassioned book that's well timed", further noting that [...] "Generally, Nichols displays strong reasoning, but at times he goes off the rails. It takes some time some sections {{for him to make}} his point".|$|R
5000|$|With Dante's death, what {{historically}} {{has been known}} as the [...] "Golden Age of Magic" [...] came to an end. Gone were the variety theaters of the world, and with it were the large traveling magic productions that had thrilled and mystified millions for generations. In prior decades, the magical lineage created by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> elevated magicians Alexander Herrmann, Harry Kellar, Thurston and Dante {{to the position of}} the #1 magician in the country.|$|R
5000|$|The American Civil Liberties Union {{issued a}} statement, {{beginning}} [...] "The Wikileaks phenomenon — {{the existence of}} an organization devoted to obtaining and publicly releasing large troves of information the U.S. government would prefer to keep secret — illustrates just how broken our secrecy classification system is. While the Obama administration has made some modest improvements to the rules governing classification of government information, both it and the Bush administration have overclassified and kept secret information that should be subject to public scrutiny and debate. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> had to depend on leaks to the news media and whistleblowers to know what the government is up to".|$|E
50|$|On June 5, 2013, Staples {{addressed}} the 25th {{annual conference of}} the North American Agricultural Biotechnology Council held in College Station. In the keynote address Staples said that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> little understanding of what is physically required to produce the needed food and fiber because shelves in grocery stores are always full. He claimed that many fail to understand the importance of agriculture to Texas, which has the largest population of rural citizens in the nation and leads in the production of both beef and cotton. Such misunderstanding, he added, can during times of drought lead to conflict between municipalities and agricultural producers over the available water resources. While water usage declined by 40 percent between 1974 and 2010, the output of cattle, cotton, and corn has doubled since 1960, he noted.|$|E
50|$|However, he {{also argues}} American jurisdictions have {{traditionally}} resisted fines {{and community service}} as alternatives to imprisonment, notwithstanding strong support for these sanctions among academics and reformers. Why? The answer is that these forms of punishment are expressively inferior to incarceration. The public expects punishment not only to deter crime and to impose deserved suffering, but also to make accurate statements about what the community values. Imprisonment has been {{and continues to be}} Americans' punishment of choice for serious offenses because of the resonance of liberty deprivation as a symbol of condemnation in our culture. Fines and community service either don't express condemnation as unambiguously as imprisonment, or express other valuations that Americans reject as false. He uses expressive theory to explain why <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> consistently rejected proposals to restore corporal punishment, a form of discipline that offends egalitarian moral sensibilities; and why the public is now growing increasingly receptive to shaming punishments, which unlike conventional alternative sanctions signal condemnation unambiguously.|$|E
40|$|The negative, stereotypical {{depictions of}} the Japanese and Japanese Americans in American popular culture {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century were of great {{importance}} in the promulgation of the Asian Exclusion Act of 1924, the internment of Japanese <b>Americans</b> following <b>the</b> bombing of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> been adequately prepared to accept inaccurate representations of Japanese and Japanese Americans; therefore, there was little public outcry against these actions...|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} quantifiably {{surveying}} public opinion {{of science is}} now largely associated with the public understanding of science movement (some would say unfairly). In the US, Jon Miller is the name most associated with such work and well known for differentiating between identifiable ‘attentive’ or ‘interested’ publics (that is to say science fans) {{and those who do}} not care much about science and technology. Miller’s work questioned whether <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> following four attributes of scientific literacy: ...|$|R
50|$|Months {{after the}} battle, the U.S. Navy knew <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> {{to be told}} something. The battle had been too large, {{involved}} too many U.S. military personnel, and had resulted in too much loss of life just to ignore. To this end, the U.S. Navy provided {{most of the information}} to the publication Popular Mechanics to publish an article on the battle showing <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> that <b>the</b> battle <b>had</b> gone exactly as Halsey had planned. It was several years before the true story of Halsey's decision to leave the San Bernardino Strait unguarded became known to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In June 1892, Jones {{became the}} first African-American to sing at the Music Hall in New York (renamed Carnegie Hall the {{following}} year). Among the selections in her program were Charles Gounod's [...] "Ave Maria" [...] and Giuseppe Verdi's [...] "Sempre libera" [...] (from La traviata). The New York Echo wrote of her performance at the Music Hall: [...] "If Mme Jones is not the equal of Adelina Patti, she at least can come nearer it than anything <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> heard. Her notes are as clear as a mockingbird's and her annunciation perfect." [...] On June 8, 1892, her career elevated beyond primary ethnic communities, and was furthered when she received a contract, {{with the possibility of}} a two-year extension, for $150 per week (plus expenses) with Mayor James B. Pond, who had meaningful affiliations to many authors and musicians. The company Troubadours made an important statement about the capabilities of black performers, that besides minstrelsy, there were other areas of genre and style.|$|E
5000|$|On December 1, 2010 Amazon.com cut off WikiLeaks 24 {{hours after}} being {{contacted}} by the staff of Joe Lieberman, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security. In a statement Lieberman said:Amazon's decision to cut off WikiLeaks now is the right decision and should {{set the standard for}} other companies WikiLeaks is using to distribute its illegally seized material. I call on any other company or organization that is hosting WikiLeaks to immediately terminate its relationship with them. Constitutional lawyers say {{that this is not a}} first amendment issue because Amazon, as a private company, is free to make its own decisions. Kevin Bankston, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, agreed that this is not a violation of the first amendment, but said it was nevertheless disappointing. [...] "This certainly implicates first amendment rights to the extent that web hosts may, based on direct or informal pressure, limit the materials <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> a first amendment right to access".|$|E

60|$|Kipling {{had just}} {{returned}} to America, and I went at once to call upon him. I had not seen him since the dinner which he gave to Riley and me in the early Nineties, and I was in doubt as to his attitude toward the States. I found him in a very happy mood, surrounded by callers. In the years of his absence <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> learned to place a very high value on his work and thousands of his readers were eager to do him honor.|$|R
5000|$|The von Trapps {{have left}} Austria {{and are now}} in the United States. But the Land of Unlimited Possibilities turns out to be {{anything}} but for our hapless heroes. Though <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> demonstrated countless times, that they'll pay anything to hear German folk songs and other pop songs, the von Trapps {{on the verge of being}} penniless and suicidal, thanks to Father Wasner, who's determined to teach Americans to appreciate great church music ... no matter how much his [...] "cultural mission" [...] pushes the von Trapps to starvation. Only the insistence of paying patrons that they drop the holy roller music and the guffaws of the audience abandoning their shows finally convinces Maria, that it's time to start entertaining the paying public and give Palestrina a rest. Eventually they receive critical acclaim and a large following for their music. Later, they purchase a farm in Vermont and decide to remain in America.|$|E

[...] He then argued that the Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, and Carnegie Endowment were using funds excessively on projects at Columbia, Harvard, Chicago University and the University of California, in order to enable oligarchical collectivism. He stated, [...] "The purported deterioration in scholarship and in the techniques of teaching which, lately, has attracted the attention of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public,</b> <b>has</b> apparently been caused primarily by a premature effort to reduce our meager knowledge of social phenomena to the level of an applied science." [...] He stated that his research staff had discovered that in [...] "1933-1936, a change took place which was so drastic as to constitute a [...] "revolution". They also indicated conclusively that the responsibility for the economic welfare of the American people had been transferred heavily to the Executive Branch of the Federal Government; that a corresponding change in education had taken place from an impetus outside of the local community, and that this [...] "revolution" [...] had occurred without violence and with the full consent of an overwhelming majority of the electorate."

He continued to have hits in the charts throughout the 1960s, though not at the level that he had enjoyed before. Nor did doors open to him in the US market; he was not considered part of the British Invasion, and despite four Hot 100 hits (including the top 25 [...] "It's All in the Game") between August 1963 and August 1964, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> little awareness of him.|$|R
50|$|While in Russia, Jewell, as a tanner, {{discovered}} that the Russians used birch tar to make the aromatic and hard-wearing Russia leather. Rather than keep this a secret for his own profit, Jewell sent {{a sample of the}} birch tar to the United States and American newspapers published how Russia leather was made. Jewell was recalled from Minister to Russia when President Grant offered Jewell the office U.S. Postmaster General. Jewell had desired to hold a domestic office rather than an international office.
