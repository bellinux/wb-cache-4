40|$|Cryopreservation of avian ova and embryos is {{challenging}} {{because of the}} yolky structure of the egg. As an alternative, {{with the development of}} effective cryopreservation protocols, ovar-ian tissue cryopreservation could be used for cryobanking for birds. Pieces of ovarian tissue of week-old Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were frozen at 0. 58 C/min in a programmable freezer or vitrified by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Straws containing slow-frozen samples were <b>thawed</b> <b>in</b> <b>ice</b> water, and vitrified samples were removed from the vials and transferred into sucrose, with the concentration lowered in sequence at room temperature. Cell viability of tissue was estimated by trypan blue assay, and tissue histology was examined by light microscopy. Frozen-thawed or vitrified-warmed tissue from WB (recessive plumage color) chicks was transplanted into week-old ovariectomized QO (wild-type plumage) chicks, with some chicks receiving fresh tissue as a control group. At sexual maturity, QO recipients were mated to WB males, and the production of WB offspring demonstrated successful cryopres-ervation and transplantation. Donor-derived offspring were obtained from the ovarian tissue that had been cryopreserved by either slow-freezing or vitrification. The vitrification protocol used in this study showed better outcomes at each level of evaluation. This study demonstrated that the function of ovarian tissue in avian species can be successfully preserved at subzero temperatures and recovered by transplantation. The vitrification protocol is recommended because of high efficiency and overall simplicity. cryopreservation, Japanese quail, ovary, transplantation, vitrificatio...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Investigations with ram semen were {{conducted}} to develop procedures of cyrogenic preservation that would provide long-term retention of fertilizing capacity in ram spermatozoa. An isotonic extender consisting of egg yolk, sodium citrate, lactose, glycerol, and a broad spectrum antibiotic was selected from among several extenders tested in pilot studies. Using this extender, ram semen collected by artificial vagina was frozen in glass ampules at controlled rates in a Biological Freezing unit, in glass capillary tubes on dry ice, in plastic straws on dry ice and in pellet form on dry ice. Factorial experiments {{were conducted}} to compare: (1) freezing containers, (2) freezing in ampules in a biological freezing unit at controlled rates with the freezing of pellets on dry ice, (3) the effect of enzymes added to the extender, (4) the effect of holding sperm in seminal plasma prior to extension, (5) the influence of glycerol on acrosomal mophology of frozen semen, and (6) ram effects and interactions. The viability of spermatozoa held in liquid nitrogen storage 18 to 21. 8 months was examined. Fertilizing capacity of frozen semen was tested with ewes in natural estrus and with ewes in estrus induced by hormonal treatment. Freezing in glass ampules at an optimum controlled rate and freezing in plastic straws on dry ice gave significantly higher postfreeze motility and percent survival than other methods used. Semen frozen in ampules at the controlled rate and <b>thawed</b> <b>in</b> <b>ice</b> water showed no apparent loss of viability compared to that thawed at 40 °C. Semen frozen in plastic straws on dry ice and thawed at 75 °C for 12 seconds gave viability equal to that frozen in glass ampules at the optimum controlled rate of freezing. Alpha amylase, beta amylase, and beta glucuronidase had no significant effect upon postfreeze viability when added to the extender {{at the rate of}} 10 microgram per ml. Holding ram spermatozoa in seminal plasma for four hours prior to extension caused no significant change in postfreeze motility or percent survival, The addition of glycerol to the freezing medium caused a significant increase in acrosomal damage. The addition of glycerol was also found necessary to obtain postfreeze motility. The insemination of a limited number of ewes with semen frozen and stored at - 196 °C for 30 days to 120 days failed to produce observed pregnancies. The probable causes of this are discussed. The techniques developed in this study allowed ram spermatozoa to be frozen and to retain motility and percent survival in storage at - 196 °C for periods up to 21. 8 months equal to that observed at one week of frozen storage...|$|E

Enterococci were not identified in domestic samples while they were detected in two industrial and three bar/pub samples. The samples collected from bars and pubs were characterized by the highest levels of enteric bacteria.

5000|$|Dance of the Tiger {{is a short}} novel, {{published}} in English in 1980, by palaeontologist Björn Kurtén that deals with the interaction between Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons. Set 35,000 years ago in Scandinavia, during a <b>thaw</b> <b>in</b> the great <b>Ice</b> Age, the novel follows a Cro-Magnon named Tiger {{as he tries to}} defeat Shelk, a tyrant and a hybrid (Neanderthal/Cro-Magnon), the man who killed his father. With his family and much of his tribe dead, Tiger meets, interacts, and allies himself with groups of Neanderthals. He eventually marries a Neanderthal woman. A sequel, Singletusk, {{published in}} 1982, continues the story of the family. [...] Neanderthals are depicted as white-skinned, while Cro-Magnons are dark. Kurtén's skin color identification for both populations appears to agree with recent DNA studies, including those proposing the African origin of modern humans. His racial presentation of the Cro-Magnon is in contrast to Jean M. Auel's view in her Earth's Children series. Auel's initial book, published a few years later than Dance of the Tiger, portrayed Neanderthals as light-skinned and Cro-Magnons as more racially varied, either light or dark-skinned. The author himself says [...] "The book is not intended to be a 'theory about interaction between Neanderthals and Modern Humans', it is just a fictive description of one possible scenario among several that might have taken place".|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{a survey}} was {{conducted}} to both evaluate the consumers’ general attitudes for purchasing and storing the raw chicken and determine the thawing practices used for defrosting frozen chicken at home. About 75 % of the consumers indicated purchasing chicken meat {{at least once a}} week or more. Furthermore, the majority (82. 16 %) of those who stored at least a portion of the raw chicken stated freezing the raw chicken meat at home. Freezing the chicken meat was considered to have no effect on the quality by 43. 49 % of the consumers while 56. 51 % thought that freezing had either negative or positive effects on the quality. The survey study indicated that top five most commonly used thawing practices included thawing on the kitchen counter, <b>thawing</b> <b>in</b> the refrigerator, <b>thawing</b> <b>in</b> the warm water, <b>thawing</b> <b>in</b> the microwave, and thawing under tap water. In addition, an experimental study was conducted to determine the effects of these most commonly used thawing practices on some quality characteristics of the chicken meat including pH, drip loss, cooking loss, color analysis and textural profile analysis. Although, L* value for thawing on the kitchen counter was the lowest, after cooking, none of the thawing treatments have a significant effect on the color values. <b>Thawing</b> <b>in</b> the microwave produced the highest drip loss of 3. 47 % while the lowest drip loss of 0. 62 % was observed with <b>thawing</b> <b>in</b> the refrigerator.
