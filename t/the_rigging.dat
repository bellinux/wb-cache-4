5|$|A {{significant}} number of broadside ironclads {{was built in the}} 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time, and <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> did not impede the field of fire.|$|E
5|$|Low, {{using his}} newly {{captured}} ship, lay in {{wait on the}} popular shipping route between Boston and New York. Within a few days, he and his crew seized a sloop out of Rhode Island and plundered it. His crew cut <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> away to prevent the sloop returning too quickly to port to raise the alarm. He then captured a number of unarmed merchantmen near Port Rosemary.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{confusion}} allowed Belvidera to fire her stern chasers, killing {{six more}} men aboard President. Rodgers {{kept up the}} pursuit, using his bow chasers to severely damage Belvideras rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of Belvidera quickly made repairs to <b>the</b> <b>rigging.</b> They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water overboard to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. Belvidera soon gained enough speed to distance herself from President, and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. Belvidera sailed to Halifax to deliver the news that war had been declared.|$|E
50|$|The {{floor is}} a {{relatively}} small work area in which <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> crew conducts operations, usually adding or removing drillpipe to or from <b>the</b> drillstring. <b>The</b> <b>rig</b> floor is <b>the</b> most dangerous location on <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> because heavy iron is moved around there. Drill string connections are made or broken on the drillfloor, and the driller's console for controlling the major components of <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> are located there. Attached to <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> floor is a small metal room, the doghouse, where <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> crew can meet, take breaks and take refuge from the elements during idle times.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Bermuda <b>rig</b> can {{be split}} into two groups: <b>the</b> {{masthead}} <b>rig</b> and <b>the</b> fractional <b>rig.</b> <b>The</b> masthead <b>rig</b> has larger and more headsails, and a smaller mainsail, compared to <b>the</b> fractional <b>rig.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 27 December 1965, <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> {{was located}} {{approximately}} 67 km {{off the coast}} of Lincolnshire. The crew {{were in the process of}} moving <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> to another site approximately [...] away. This process involved lowering <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> onto <b>the</b> surface of the water, in order to float it to the new site. When <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> was lowered, two of the legs crumpled and broke, causing <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> to capsize, with equipment and people sliding off and into the freezing cold of the North Sea at 1409 GMT.|$|R
5|$|The next morning, the {{schooner}} Lioness discovered {{one of the}} cutters, {{and after}} saving the occupants of the second boat {{made her way to}} the scene of the disaster. Arriving in the afternoon, she found 40 people still clinging to <b>the</b> <b>rigging.</b> It was reported that of the approximately 643people aboard, only 193 were saved. Captain Edward WC Wright of the 91st Argyllshire Regiment was the most senior army officer to survive; he was awarded a brevet majority for his actions during the ordeal, dated 26 February 1852.|$|E
5|$|Those {{still on}} board Gothenburg tried {{to cling to}} <b>the</b> <b>rigging,</b> but {{throughout}} the early morning of 25 February, several more people were drowned after they were swept overboard by large broadside waves. Many passengers associated with the gold diggings were unwilling {{to let go of}} their gold and money belts, as it was probably their life savings; these individuals insisted on keeping them tied and once overboard reportedly drowned very quickly.|$|E
5|$|After riding {{at anchor}} for two weeks, Endeavour was heaved {{out of the}} water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rig</b> {{had other}} {{advanced}} extreme-condition features as well. For example, <b>the</b> <b>rig's</b> columns were strengthened to withstand some ice impact and the marine riser had a feature {{similar to a}} cow-catcher to keep floating ice off the marine riser that connected <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> to <b>the</b> well on the ocean bottom.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Rig</b> Veda Aryaman is {{described}} as the protector of mares, and the Milky Way (aryamṇáḥ pánthāḥ) {{is said to be}} his path.Aryaman is commonly invoked together with Varuna-Mitra, Bhaga, Bṛhaspati, and other Adityas and Asuras. According to Griffith, <b>the</b> <b>Rig</b> Veda also suggests that Aryaman is a supreme deity alongside Mitra and Varuna. According to <b>the</b> <b>Rig</b> Veda, Indra who is traditionally considered the most important deity in <b>the</b> <b>Rig</b> Veda is asked to obtain boons and gifts from Aryaman.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, while {{contracted}} by the Nigerian {{oil company}} Peak Petroleum, <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> was attacked near Nigeria by Nigerian militants and {{eight of the}} personnel on <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> were kidnapped. They were released unharmed after two days in captivity. In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> was purchased by the Indian drilling company Aban for US$211 million.|$|R
5|$|Before filming, Mendes {{sought to}} produce a period film that would avoid clichés in the gangster genre. He chose to film Road to Perdition on {{location}} in downtown at the University Club of Chicago, the Chicago neighborhood of Pullman {{as well as the}} Chicago suburb of Geneva, Illinois. The Armory, the state's largest location mainstay which houses the Illinois State National Guard, was provided to the studio by the Illinois State Film Commission. Sets were built inside the Armory, including interiors of the Sullivan family's home and the Rooney mansion. The availability of an inside location provided the crew complete control over the lighting environment, which was established with <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> of scaffoldings.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{launched}} on 15 August 1799 {{under the command}} of Captain Sever. After fitting-out in Rhode Island, she set off on her maiden voyage 6 January 1800 sailing in company with Essex to escort merchant ships to the East Indies. Six days later she lost all of her masts during a gale. Because her rigging had been set and tightened in a cold climate, it had slackened once she reached warmer temperatures. Without the full support of <b>the</b> <b>rigging,</b> all the masts fell during a four-hour period, killing one crew member trying to repair the main mast.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their losses}} the French {{survivors}} {{returned to the}} remaining guns, although most of their first broadside scattered into the sea, and {{at least some of}} their shot was misdirected towards the merchant ships. The French gunners aimed too high however, most of their shot tearing through <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> of Sybille while the British broadsides slammed into the hull of Forte. This problem was partly attributed to the French gun quoins which had been replaned three days earlier, exacerbated by the lack of suitable gun crews which meant that many of the upperdeck guns were unmanned. The French gunners were also more used to firing warning shots at distant merchant ships and may not have realised that their guns needed to be depressed for combat at point blank range.|$|E
40|$|There is {{compelling}} evidence that, when continuous spectrum is present, the natural mathematical setting for Quantum Mechanics is <b>the</b> <b>rigged</b> Hilbert space {{rather than just}} the Hilbert space. In particular, Dirac's bra-ket formalism is fully implemented by <b>the</b> <b>rigged</b> Hilbert space rather than just by the Hilbert space. In this paper, we provide a pedestrian introduction to <b>the</b> role <b>the</b> <b>rigged</b> Hilbert space plays in Quantum Mechanics, {{by way of a}} simple, exactly solvable example. The procedure will be constructive and based on a recent publication. We also provide a thorough discussion on the physical significance of <b>the</b> <b>rigged</b> Hilbert space.

50|$|Minutes before 18:30, {{those on}} board felt a 'sharp crack' {{followed}} by 'some kind of trembling'. Suddenly <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> heeled over 30° and then stabilised. Five {{of the six}} anchor cables had broken, the one remaining cable preventing <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> from capsizing. <b>The</b> list continued to increase and at 18:53, the remaining anchor cable snapped and <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> capsized.|$|R
5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} found by the diver's {{preliminary}} examination of the ship, including tearing and inch-sized gaps in Astrids hull, as well as popped rivets and spread plates. The salvage company Blue Ocean, of Castletownbere, were appointed to recover the ship. The plans for the salvage operation consisted of removing around 3.5 tonnes of diesel fuel from the ship's fuel tanks, pumping {{water out of the}} ship and cutting away equipment including <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> and masts, before a floating crane lifted the vessel from the rocks. The ship would then be taken to a nearby port to be handed over to the insurers. As of the end of July 2013 it was thought that the ship will never sail again, and that she would be written off as a total constructive loss. A month after sinking, Astrid was still under water.|$|E
5|$|Lydiard {{remained}} cruising off Havana, and on 15 September sighted the French 84-gun Foudroyant. The Foudroyant, {{carrying the}} flag of Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, had been dismasted in a storm and was carrying a jury-rig. Despite the superiority of his opponent and the nearness of the shore Lydiard attempted to close on the French vessel and opened fire. Anson came under fire from the fortifications at Morro Castle, while several Spanish ships, including the 74-gun San Lorenzo, came out of Havana to assist the French. After being unable to manoeuvre into a favourable position and coming under heavy fire, Lydiard hauled away and made his escape. Anson had two killed and 13 wounded during the engagement, while <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> was badly cut. Foudroyant meanwhile had 27 killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 1669 Morgan and his {{flotilla}} {{attacked the}} Spanish squadron. The fire ship plan worked, and Magdalen was shortly aflame; Espinosa abandoned his flagship {{and made his}} way to the fort, where he continued to direct events. The second-largest Spanish ship, Soledad, tried to move away from the burning vessel, but a problem with <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> meant they drifted aimlessly; privateers boarded the ship, fixed <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> and claimed the craft as plunder. The third Spanish vessel was also sunk by the privateers. Morgan still needed to pass the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, but was still out-gunned by the stronghold, which had the ability to destroy the privateer fleet if it tried to pass. The privateer decided to negotiate, and threatened to sack and burn Maracaibo if he was not allowed to pass. Although Espinosa refused to negotiate, the citizens of Maracaibo entered into talks with Morgan, and agreed to pay him 20,000 pesos and 500 head of cattle if he agreed to leave the city intact. During the course of the negotiations with the Maracaibos, Morgan had undertaken salvage operations on Magdalen, and secured 15,000 pesos from the wreck. Before taking any action, Morgan tallied his takings and divided it equally between his ships, to ensure that it was not all lost if one ship was sunk; it totalled 250,000 pesos, and a huge quantity of merchandise and a number of local slaves.|$|E
5000|$|BP Vice President of drilling, Patrick O'Bryan, {{was on the}} {{platform}} two hours prior to the explosion to celebrate seven years without a [...] "lost-time incident" [...] with <b>the</b> <b>rig's</b> crew. A BP official on board <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> directed <b>the</b> crew to replace the drilling mud with lighter seawater even though <b>the</b> <b>rig's</b> chief driller protested.|$|R
50|$|The steel-sided room {{adjacent}} to <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> floor, usually having an access door {{close to the}} driller's controls. This general-purpose shelter is a combination tool shed, office, communications center, coffee room, lunchroom and general meeting place for the driller and his crew. It {{is at the same}} elevation as <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> floor, usually cantilevered out from the main substructure supporting <b>the</b> <b>rig.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{marine riser}} is {{connected}} to the wellhead on the sea bed and therefore the tensioner must manage the differential movements between the riser and <b>the</b> <b>rig.</b> If there were no tensioner and <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> moves downward, <b>the</b> riser would buckle; if <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> rises then high forces would be transmitted to the riser and it would stretch and be damaged.|$|R
5|$|The Spaniards {{had assumed}} the {{approaching}} vessels {{were part of}} their convoy, but by daybreak they had realised their error and vainly set more sail to escape. Being close enough to hail the Spanish crews, Duckworth ordered that they surrender. When the Spaniards ignored the demand, he ordered Leviathan and Emerald to open fire on <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> of the Spanish vessels in order to disable them. Both Spanish frigates quickly surrendered. Carmen had had 11 men killed and 16 wounded; Florentina 12 killed and 10 wounded, including her first and second captains. The two Spanish frigates were each carrying 1500 quintals of mercury.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E
5|$|As the {{two ships}} closed Truxtun's ship held the weather gauge, the {{position}} upwind from his opponent which {{allowed him to}} close or break off. However the heavy winds caused Constellation to heel so much that her leeward gunports had to remain closed. Truxtun decided to cede the weather gauge to the French by sailing past L'Insurgentes to reach her leeward side. From there Constellation could bring more of her guns to bear. With Constellation approaching his frigate fast, Barreaut tried {{to communicate with the}} Americans. The American frigate ignored the French hail, closing to within fifty yards of L'Insurgente before opening up with a broadside. Loaded with double shot, the opening American salvo struck the French frigate's quarterdeck. Barreaut's vessel replied with her own broadside that damaged Constellation's fore topmast. Midshipman David Porter, stationed in <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> of Constellations damaged mast, managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse. L'Insurgente attempted to close on the American frigate to board her, but Constellation held the weather gage and had less damage to her rigging, enabling her to avoid Barreaut's attempt to draw alongside.|$|E
50|$|Reverse {{circulation}} rig setups usually {{consist of}} a support vehicle, an auxiliary vehicle, as well as <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> itself. <b>The</b> support vehicle, normally a truck, holds diesel and water tanks for resupplying <b>the</b> <b>rig.</b> It also holds other supplies needed for maintenance on <b>the</b> <b>rig.</b> <b>The</b> auxiliary is a vehicle, carrying an auxiliary engine and a booster engine. These engines are connected to <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> by high pressure air hoses. Although RC rigs have their own booster and compressor to generate air pressure, extra power is needed which usually isn't supplied by <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> {{due to lack of}} space for these large engines. Instead, the engines are mounted on the auxiliary vehicle. Compressors on an RC rig have an output of around 1000 cfm at 500 psi (500 L·s−1 at 3.4 MPa). Alternatively, stand-alone air compressors which have an output of 900-1150cfm at 300-350 psi each are used in sets of 2, 3, or 4, which are all routed to <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> through a multi-valve manifold.|$|R
30|$|Participants {{were then}} asked to decide which of <b>the</b> two oil <b>rigs</b> would receive <b>the</b> most damage. Our {{hypothesis}} was that the likelihood of choosing <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> closer to <b>the</b> center of the storm would decrease if <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> farther from <b>the</b> center of the storm fell on a hurricane path, supporting the notion that the individual paths are salient features of the ensemble display that could lead to biased responses. In the rest of the paper we will refer to <b>the</b> close oil <b>rig,</b> meaning <b>the</b> oil <b>rig</b> that is closer {{to the center of the}} hurricane forecast display, and <b>the</b> farther oil <b>rig,</b> which is <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> farther away from the center of the hurricane forecast than <b>the</b> closer oil <b>rig.</b>|$|R
500|$|In 2002, <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> was {{upgraded}} with [...] "e-drill", a drill {{monitoring system}} whereby technical personnel based in Houston, Texas, received real-time drilling data from <b>the</b> <b>rig</b> and transmitted maintenance and troubleshooting information.|$|R
5|$|At {{this point}} the action began, with Pitot's stern chasers opening fire upon Constellation. In an effort to cut the American frigate's {{advantage}} in speed, La Vengeance changed course to the south-east where the wind would give her an advantage. As he maneuvered his vessel, Pitot was able to unleash a broadside aimed at Constellations rigging. The American frigate waited to return fire until she'd gained the weather gage. Now having {{the advantage of the}} wind, Truxton's opening double-shotted broadside slammed into the port side of La Vengeances hull. Sailing side by side, the two frigates continued to engage each other {{for two and a half}} hours while Truxton attempted unsuccessfully to move his ship into a raking fire position. As the French tended to aim for <b>the</b> <b>rigging,</b> at one point Constellations foresails were shot away and the frigate lost her maneuverability until they could be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} damaged in the engagement, {{although}} Saumarez's damage was almost entirely confined to his rigging: very few shots had actually struck his hull during the battle, {{and the only}} one that provoked notice passed across the deck without causing injury and struck a cannon on the opposite site, setting it off {{in the direction of a}} number of small gunboats that were approaching from the shore. Casualties on Crescent were equally light, with just one man injured; he had been standing too close to his own cannon during the opening broadside and had been struck by the recoiling gun, suffering a broken leg. Damage and losses on the French ship were very severe, with <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> in tatters, the hull and lower masts repeatedly struck and casualties that Saumarez initially estimated at more than 120 men killed or wounded, although French accounts give the lower figure of 33 killed and 48 wounded.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} {{hour and a half}} the frigates poured shot into one another at close range, until Cooke was struck by grape shot at 01:30 on 1 March, {{replaced}} by his first lieutenant Lucius Hardyman. For another hour the action continued, French fire gradually slackening until it stopped completely at 02:30, by which time only four French guns remained operational. Hardyman hailed to ask whether Forte had surrendered but the French did not reply and he ordered another broadside. A second hail also brought no response but sailors were seen attempting to repair <b>the</b> <b>rigging</b> on Forte. Concerned that the French were attempting to escape, Hardyman concentrated his fire on the masts of Forte, bringing them crashing down one by one until at 03:00 Forte was completely dismasted. With all resistance ended, British merchant prisoners on board Forte emerged from below decks and hailed Sybille, requesting a boat be sent across so that British Lieutenant Nicholas Manger could formally take the surrender of the French ship.|$|E
