5|$|The {{majority}} of Final Fantasy games, including {{all of the}} main series games, have received a soundtrack album release. Many have also inspired orchestral, vocal, or piano arrangement albums. In addition to the regular albums, a number of compilation albums of tracks from multiple games have been produced both by Square Enix and outside groups. Music from the original soundtracks of the games has been arranged as sheet music for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing, while sheet music from the piano albums have been published by Yamaha Music Media. The franchise's music has been performed numerous times in concert tours and other live performances such as the Orchestral Game Music Concerts, Symphonic Game Music Concerts, and the Play! A Video Game Symphony and Video Games Live concert tours, as well as forming the basis of specific Final Fantasy concerts such as <b>the</b> <b>Dear</b> Friends and Distant Worlds concert tours.|$|E
5|$|Music {{from the}} series {{has also been}} played in {{specific}} Final Fantasy concerts and concert series. After {{the success of the}} 20020220 Music from Final Fantasy concert in 2002, a recording of which was produced as an album, the Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy, was launched in Japan in 2004. It was followed by <b>the</b> <b>Dear</b> Friends -Music from Final Fantasy- tour in the United States that same year, which was originally scheduled to be a single concert but grew into a year-long tour. In 2005, a concert entitled More Friends: Music from Final Fantasy was performed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the first Dear Friends concert and also had an album published of the performance. The latest Final Fantasy tour is the worldwide Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy tour, which began in Sweden in 2007 and still continues to date. A recording of its first performance was released as an album. Nobuo Uematsu additionally plays with The Black Mages, a band which performs Final Fantasy music in a rock music style. They have performed music live in concert, as well as with orchestras as part of various concert tours. They have released three albums to date, as well as DVDs of their live performances.|$|E

25|$|A {{range of}} studies have found no {{evidence}} of <b>the</b> <b>dear</b> enemy effect showing the effect is not universal. Territorial males of the strawberry dart-poison frog (Dendrobates pumilio) and the spotted antbird (Hylophylax naevioides) do not discriminate behaviourally between the calls of neighbours and strangers, and female collared lizards show no difference in their behaviour to neighbouring or unfamiliar females.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} have staged three-way contests between male convict cichlids (Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum) to examine <b>the</b> <b>dear</b> enemy effect. When {{faced with a}} familiar neighbour and an unfamiliar intruder simultaneously, residents preferentially confronted the unfamiliar opponent. That is, the establishment of dear enemy recognition between a resident and a neighbour allowed the resident to direct his aggression to the greater competitive threat, i.e. the intruder.|$|E

25|$|The {{people of}} Dhaka {{witnessed}} thrilling low-level dogfights throughout 4 and 5 December. The IAF concentrated in attacking aircraft on the ground. However, for <b>the</b> <b>dear</b> price paid, {{it failed to}} cause significant damage to the PAF assets in well-dispersed and camouflaged locations. IAF also flew ground support missions, and the lessening pressure meant that the PAF managed to fly some ground support missions over Comilla and other areas. In total 20 operational sorties were flown by the Sabres, and 12,000 rounds of ammunition were used up during 5 December by the PAF. By the evening of 5 December, the IAF realized that a change of tactics was necessary. The ack-ack regiment managed to successfully defend the airbase during 5 December and {{the night of the}} early hours of the 6th against Indian attacks.|$|E
25|$|World War II had {{a greater}} impact on the novel than in poetry. It ended the careers of some novelists and delayed the start of others. Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as Robin Jenkins (1912–2005), Jessie Kesson (1916–94), Muriel Spark (1918–2006), Alexander Trocchi (1925–84) and James Kennaway (1928–68) spent much or most of their lives outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes. Jenkins major novels such as The Cone Gatherers (1955), The Changeling (1958) and Fergus Lamont (1978) focused on working-class {{dilemmas}} in a world without spiritual consolation. Very different in tone, Spark produced novels that explored modern social life as in her only two overtly Scottish novels The Ballad of Peckham Rye (1960) and the Edinburgh-set The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Successful mass-market works included the action novels of Alistair MacLean (1922–87), and the historical fiction of Dorothy Dunnett (b. 1923). A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included Allan Massie (b. 1938), Shena Mackay (b. 1944) and Alan Spence (b. 1947). Massie's work often deals with historical themes while aware of the limitations of historical objectivity, as in his Augustus (1986), Tiberius (1991) and The Ragged Lion (1994). Working class identity continued to be a major theme in the post-war novel and can be seen in Archie Hind's (1928–2008) <b>The</b> <b>Dear</b> Green Place (1966), Alan Sharp's (1934–2013) A Green Tree in Gedde (1965), George Friel's (1910–75) Mr Alfred M.A. (1972) and William McIlvanney's (b. 1936) Docherty (1975).|$|E

[...] The flavor of <b>the</b> <b>Dear</b> Girl Thunder bar was advertised as [...] "The Taste of First Love: Salt and Chocolate" [...] ( [...] ). [...] In Japan, chocolate is associated with Valentine's Day and is considered an appropriate gift between sweethearts; salty foods are considered [...] "adult" [...] and are thus associated with maturity. [...] A person's [...] "first love" [...] is, like in other cultures, something of a rite of passage; an episode in life sweet in sentiment, but with maturing results. [...] In July 2009, a limited edition of 480 units of <b>the</b> <b>Dear</b> Girl Thunder bar went on sale and quickly sold out. [...] In October 2010, <b>the</b> <b>Dear</b> Girl Thunder bar went on sale in FamilyMart convenience stores (with the exception of the stores in one region). [...] During 2010, consumers questioned why Black Thunder bars were not distributed to areas of Hokkaido, Miyazaki, Kagoshima, and Okinawa, and the company responded with research into the feasibility of nationwide distribution. [...] In January 2011, it was decided that a second edition of <b>the</b> <b>Dear</b> Girl Thunder bar would be distributed to Animate stores, a retailer that specializes in anime, manga, and video games. [...] It would also be marketed on the mail order website of Cho!A+, a branch of Nippon Cultural Broadcasting, Inc., that focuses on digital radio broadcasting. [...] Both deals ensure that consumers across the country can purchase <b>the</b> <b>Dear</b> Girl Thunder bars.|$|E
