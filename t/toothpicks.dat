5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the episode were cut prior to broadcast. The opening scene in Jerry's car, in which George {{discusses}} breaking up with Marlene, originally had George proposing that he would stage his own kidnapping while {{walking down the street}} with Marlene, and then hide out until she had given up on him. Although it was cut before the episode's broadcast, this scene was included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. Another scene which was cut featured Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) entering Jerry's apartment carrying a plate with cantaloupe on <b>toothpicks.</b> Originally, the scene in which Jerry tells George that he is dating Marlene took place in a library, with a librarian repeatedly shushing George and Jerry and kicking them out of the library {{at the end of the}} scene. The location was changed to Monk's Cafe because the dialogue had nothing to do with a library.|$|E

A lock of Maria's hair sold for two guineas. Polstead became a tourist venue with visitors travelling from as far afield as Ireland; Curtis estimated that 200,000 people visited Polstead in 1828 alone. The Red Barn and the Martens' cottage excited particular interest. The barn was stripped for souvenirs, down to the planks being removed from the sides, broken up, and sold as <b>toothpicks.</b> It was slated to be demolished after the trial, but it was left standing and eventually burned down in 1842. Even Maria's gravestone in the churchyard of St Mary's, Polstead was eventually chipped away to nothing by souvenir hunters; only {{a sign on the}} shed now marks the approximate place where it stood, although her name is given to Marten's Lane in the village. Pottery models and sketches were sold and songs were composed, including one quoted in the Vaughan Williams opera Hugh the Drover and Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus.|$|E

40|$|Although most {{ingested}} {{foreign bodies}} usually {{pass through the}} gastrointestinal tract asymptomatically, <b>toothpick</b> injury to the gastrointestinal tract {{is often associated with}} significant morbidity and mortality. <b>Toothpick</b> perforation of the gastrointestinal tract is frequently reported but, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, bacteremia caused by an impacted <b>toothpick</b> within the gastric mucosa has not yet been described. Here, we report the case of bacteremia caused by an accidentally swallowed <b>toothpick.</b> The <b>toothpick</b> was impacted deeply in the gastric mucosa and was first seen and localized on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). CT scan is a very useful imaging technique in such situations since we lack typical and relevant physical findings or laboratory studies that go with accidentally swallowed objects, in this case a <b>toothpick.</b> Flexible endoscopy was successful in extracting the whole <b>toothpick.</b> In cases without free perforation, flexible endoscopy is the treatment of choice in <b>toothpick</b> removal from the upper gastrointestinal tract...|$|R

40|$|The {{incidence}} and prevalence of foreign body (FB) ingestion {{are difficult to}} estimate. Unlike other foreign bodies, the ingestion of a <b>toothpick</b> is very uncommon and carries high morbidity and mortality rates. We report {{a case of a}} 73 -year-old female patient presenting mid-term epigastric pain. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a slightly dilated common bile duct (CBD) and magnetic resonance showed an irregular filling failure in distal CBD and gallstones. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography revealed major papilla {{on the edge of a}} diverticulum and confirmed the distal filling failure. After sphincterotomy, a partially intact <b>toothpick</b> was extracted from the CBD. Neither fistulas nor perforation signs were found. Literature related to foreign bodies and <b>toothpick</b> ingestion was reviewed and some hypotheses to explain the reported case were created. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a <b>toothpick</b> lodged inside the biliary tract...|$|R

We describe a young male with chronic postprandial lower abdominal pain {{caused by a}} <b>toothpick</b> impaction at the rectosigmoid junction after inadvertent ingestion. The foreign body was detected and successfully removed during flexible sigmoidoscopy.

25|$|Wood {{is used in}} {{thousands}} of ways, e.g. buildings, furniture, boats, airplanes, wagons, car parts, musical instruments, sports equipment, railroad ties, utility poles, fence posts, pilings, <b>toothpicks,</b> matches, plywood, coffins, shingles, barrel staves, toys, tool handles, picture frames, veneer, charcoal and firewood. Wood pulp is widely used to make paper, paperboard, cellulose sponges, cellophane and some important plastics and textiles, such as cellulose acetate and rayon. Bamboo stems also have hundreds of uses, including paper, buildings, furniture, boats, musical instruments, fishing poles, water pipes, plant stakes, and scaffolding. Trunks of palm trees and tree ferns are often used for building. Stems of Reed are an important building material for use in thatching in some areas.|$|E
25|$|Indoors, an avocado tree {{is usually}} grown from {{the pit of}} an avocado fruit. This is often done by {{removing}} the pit from a ripe, unrefrigerated avocado fruit. The pit is then stabbed {{with three or four}} <b>toothpicks,</b> about one-third of the way up from the flat end. The pit is placed in a jar or vase containing tepid water. It should split in four to six weeks and yield roots and a sprout. If there is no change by this time, the avocado pit is discarded. Once the stem has grown a few inches, it is placed in a pot with soil. It should be watered every few days. Avocados have been known to grow large, so owners must be ready to re-pot the plant several times.|$|E
25|$|The {{predecessor}} of the toothbrush is the chew stick. Chew sticks were twigs with frayed ends used {{to brush}} the teeth {{while the other}} end {{was used as a}} toothpick.

The Greeks and Romans used <b>toothpicks</b> to clean their teeth and toothpick like twigs have been excavated in Qin Dynasty tombs. Chew sticks remain common in Africa the rural Southern United States and in the Islamic world the use of chewing stick Miswak is considered a pious action and has been prescribed to be used before every prayer five times a day. Miswaks have been used by Muslims since 7th century.|$|E

40|$|SummaryWe {{present the}} case of a 42 -year-old female who {{presented}} to our emergency department (ED) complaining of epigastric pain for four days. She had been seen in the outpatient department and ED previously for evaluation, but continued to experience epigastric pain with fever. Emergency panendoscopy was performed and a <b>toothpick</b> was discovered impacted in the duodenal bulb. The gastroenterologist was unable to remove the <b>toothpick</b> endoscopically. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a long and straight hyperdense foreign body, and intra-abdominal abscess formation. An emergency laparotomy was performed. The patient recovered gradually and was discharged 11 days later. She could not remember when she swallowed the wooden <b>toothpick,</b> but guessed that it was while out drinking. There is an old wives’ tale in Taiwan that putting a <b>toothpick</b> in the cup while drinking beer reduces the likelihood of abdominal distention from the carbonation of the beer...|$|R

500|$|Throughout the week, Aboukir Bay was {{surrounded}} by bonfires lit by Bedouin tribesmen in celebration of the British victory. On 5 August, Leander was despatched to Cadiz with messages for Earl St. Vincent carried by Captain Edward Berry. Over {{the next few days}} the British landed all but 200 of the captured prisoners on shore under strict terms of parole, although Bonaparte later ordered them to be formed into an infantry unit and added to his army. [...] The wounded officers taken prisoner were held on board Vanguard, where Nelson regularly entertained them at dinner. Historian Joseph Allen recounts that on one occasion Nelson, whose eyesight was still suffering following his wound, offered <b>toothpicks</b> to an officer who had lost his teeth and then passed a snuff-box to an officer whose nose had been torn off, causing much embarrassment. On 8 August the fleet's boats stormed Aboukir Island, which surrendered without a fight.
