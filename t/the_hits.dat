5|$|Dance Again... <b>the</b> <b>Hits</b> enjoyed {{moderate}} {{commercial success}} in the United States, peaking at number 20 on the Billboard 200 the week of its debut with sales of 14,000 copies. The album performed better on the Billboard R/Hip-Hop Albums component chart, where it managed to reach number six. Dance Again... <b>the</b> <b>Hits</b> performed significantly lower on the Billboard 200 than Lopez's seventh studio album Love?, which peaked at number five, {{as well as her}} previous compilation album J to tha L–O!

5|$|The music video's crew did {{not believe}} that Minogue could work with the python, but she said that it did not bother her at all. The music video was {{released}} commercially on <b>The</b> <b>Hits</b> & Beyond special edition companion DVD, released in June 2006.|$|E
5|$|The natural cycle, {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>hits</b> come in order from least total bases to most (single, double, triple, and home run), has been {{accomplished}} 14 times in MLB history. Bill Collins {{was the first to}} collect <b>the</b> <b>hits</b> in order on October 6, 1910. The natural cycle happened most commonly in the 1960s, occurring three times in a four-year span (Jim Hickman in 1963, Ken Boyer in 1964, and Billy Williams in 1966). It also occurred three times in a seven-season timeframe from 2000 to 2006: José Valentín in 2000; Brad Wilkerson in 2003; and Gary Matthews, Jr. in 2006. The natural cycle has also been accomplished in reverse (home run, triple, double, single) by six players: Bid McPhee (1887);Gee Walker (1937);Jim Fregosi (1968; his second cycle); Luke Scott (2006); Carlos Gómez (2008); and Rajai Davis (2016).|$|E
5|$|Elvis Presley is {{a supreme}} figure in American life, one whose presence, {{no matter how}} banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons.... The {{cultural}} range of his music has expanded {{to the point where}} it includes not only <b>the</b> <b>hits</b> of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues.... Elvis has emerged as a great artist, a great rocker, a great purveyor of schlock, a great heart throb, a great bore, a great symbol of potency, a great ham, a great nice person, and, yes, a great American.|$|E

50|$|For {{the fiscal}} years 2007 to 2009 <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> rate was over 75%. In fiscal year 2010, <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> rate {{came down to}} 28% due {{to the number of}} {{aftershocks}} following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, which occurred near the end of fiscal year 2010. <b>The</b> <b>hit</b> rate for that year had been 72% until the Tohoku earthquake. Measurement techniques have subsequently been refined to ignore small scale earthquakes; <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> rate for fiscal year 2011 increased to 56%. The JMA aimed to increase <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> rate to over 85% in fiscal year 2015.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on <b>the</b> <b>hitting</b> times of a {{stochastic}} epidemic model presented by Gray. Under {{the help of the}} auxiliary stopping times, we investigate the asymptotic limits of <b>the</b> <b>hitting</b> times by <b>the</b> variations of calculus and the large deviation inequalities when the noise is sufficiently small. It can be shown that the relative position between the initial state and <b>the</b> <b>hitting</b> state determines <b>the</b> scope of <b>the</b> <b>hitting</b> times greatly...|$|R
5|$|In 1922, São Paulo and Minas Geraes {{helped to}} put down the first of the Tenente revolts. Soldiers seized Fort Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro on 5 July, but no other men joined them. As a result, some men deserted the rebels, and by the next morning only 200 people {{remained}} in the fort. São Paulo bombarded the fort, firing five salvos and obtaining at least two hits; the fort surrendered half an hour later. The Brazilian Navy's official history reports that one of <b>the</b> <b>hits</b> opened a hole ten meters deep.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the local}} McDonald's was totally rebuilt. The new {{building}} decor features memorabilia of Como {{along with that}} of fellow singer and Canonsburg native, Bobby Vinton. A children's playground in Canonsburg on Giffin Avenue is also named for Como. In downtown Canonsburg, all of the tree grates are marked with information about the records that sold a million copies and the town clock hourly plays one of <b>the</b> <b>hits</b> of Como (141), Vinton (44), or the Four Coins (7), also from Canonsburg.|$|E
5|$|Still on Top – The Greatest Hits, a thirty-seven track double CD {{compilation}} {{album was}} released on 22 October 2007 in the UK on the Polydor label. On 29 October 2007, the album charted at number two on the Official UK Top 75 Albums—his highest UK charting. The November release in the US and Canada contains twenty-one selected tracks. <b>The</b> <b>hits</b> released on albums with the copyrights owned by Morrison as Exile Productions Ltd. — 1971 and later — had been remastered in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Monk {{tells them}} {{all that he}} got <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> man {{to tell him what}} it was he dropped in the cab: on his way to <b>the</b> airport, <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> man dropped his BlackBerry. This was bad for him because his phone had emails between him and Archie, plus photos of Lorber and a diagram of the building. When he {{realized}} that he'd left his cell phone behind in <b>the</b> cab, <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> man panicked and called it from a payphone at the airport, and Conrad Stipe answered, explaining how <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> man knew that Stipe had picked up his PDA. Stipe had to be killed because <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> man couldn't risk that either he or the cabbie would scroll through <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> man's messages, or possibly turn the phone in to the police. After he killed Stipe, <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> man arranged to have the cabbie deliver the phone to him. He shot Bisson after he got his phone back.|$|R
50|$|Physical Attack Rings possess three Hit Areas {{coupled with}} Strike Areas. By <b>hitting</b> all of <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> areas, <b>the</b> {{character}} will perform three attacks. If any of <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> areas are missed, the character’s turn will be skipped or their amount of attacks {{will be reduced}} depending on which hit area is missed. If <b>the</b> first <b>hit</b> area is missed the turn is automatically skipped. If <b>the</b> player <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> first <b>hit</b> area but misses <b>the</b> subsequent <b>hit</b> areas, <b>the</b> amount of attacks will be reduced.|$|R
5000|$|Double Contract: Places two mobsters {{from one}} gang on <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> list. If blocked by Family Influence, the gang {{attacked}} {{only has to}} put one mobster on <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> list. If blocked by Mob Power, the attacker and target both put a mobster on <b>the</b> <b>hit</b> list (in that order).|$|R
5|$|The natural cycle {{has been}} {{accomplished}} five times in NPB history. Fumio Fujimura's second cycle on May 25, 1950, {{was the first time}} a player collected <b>the</b> <b>hits</b> in order. On average, the natural cycle occurs approximately every 13years. Other than Fujimura, the four players to hit for the natural cycle are Kazuhiko Kondo in 1961, Takahiro Tokutsu in 1976, Takanori Okamura in 1985, and Muramatsu in 2003. The natural cycle has only been accomplished in reverse by Ochoa (2004).|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship. Most of <b>the</b> <b>hits</b> scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have negatively affected her seaworthiness in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Admiral Graf Spee had fired much of her ammunition in the engagement with Harwood's cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Dance Again... <b>the</b> <b>Hits</b> is {{the first}} {{greatest}} hits album of American singer Jennifer Lopez. It was released on July 20, 2012, by Epic Records, {{to coincide with the}} launch of her first world tour, the Dance Again World Tour. Lopez previously conceived plans for a greatest hits album in 2009, but instead opted to use the material recorded for her seventh studio album, Love?, which was released by Island Records in May 2011 after her departure from Epic Records in 2010. As Lopez owed the label one last album to fulfill her contract, she began work on a new greatest hits album in November 2011. She later became unsure whether she wanted to go along with plans to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album, eventually deciding on the former.|$|E

5|$|Following the December 1983 {{release of}} the first album in the Now That's What I Call Music series, {{compilation}} albums featuring various artists became very popular in the UK during {{the mid to late}} 1980s; this is reflected in the albums that were Christmas number one during this time. From 1983 to 1987, every album {{at the top of the}} Christmas chart was a various artists compilation album, from either the Now That's What I Call Music or <b>the</b> <b>Hits</b> series. The UK Albums Chart was subsequently altered so that, from 14 January 1989, releases from various artists were no longer eligible for the main album chart.|$|E
5|$|Neither team got {{a hit in}} {{the third}} or fourth innings. The only runners to reach base were Whitey Kurowski and Marion, both on walks. The fifth started that the same way, with Slaughter and Moore flying out. With two outs however, the Cardinals started hitting. Musial doubled, Kurowski walked, Slaughter tripled, and Dusak singled. All but Dusak scored on <b>the</b> <b>hits,</b> {{bringing}} the score to 5–1 and ending Hatten's day. Hank Behrman came on in relief. Behrman kept any more runs from scoring, and after another inning in which the Dodgers did not record a hit, the score was 5–1 {{at the end of the}} fifth.|$|E
5|$|Overseas, Dance Again... <b>the</b> <b>Hits</b> {{performed}} well in most music markets, reaching {{the top ten}} in fourteen national charts, five of which were {{in the first five}} positions. Its highest position came from the Canadian Albums chart, where the album achieved number three. The album reached the same peak on the Italian Albums chart. Other countries where the album managed to score a high peak were Spain (number five), Taiwan (number three), the Czech Republic (number six) and Switzerland (number seven). On the Australian Albums Chart, the album had a moderate commercial performance, reaching number 20; her previous compilation album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes, achieved a higher position of number 11. In Latin America, the album appeared on the Mexican Album chart, reaching a peak of number 10.|$|E

5|$|The Italian fleet was reorganized on 9 December, and Pola {{joined her}} three sister {{ships in the}} 3rd Division of the 1st Squadron, which was now {{commanded}} by Admiral Angelo Iachino. On 14 December, a British air raid on Naples slightly damaged Pola. Two bombs hit the ship, both amidships on the port side. <b>The</b> <b>hits</b> damaged three of the ship's boilers and caused significant flooding and a significant list to port. Pola was drydocked on 16 December for repair work that lasted until 7 February 1941. She returned to Taranto on 13 February, and she joined Zara and Fiume for extensive maneuvers off Taranto on 1117 March. A nighttime training operation followed on 2324 March.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{lists the}} number one best-selling singles in Canada in 2007 published in Billboard magazine under <b>the</b> <b>Hits</b> of the World section. Only songs released as physical singles qualified for this chart during this time. During this period, the singles market in Canada was very limited in both scope and availability, and in many cases, these songs received little or no radio support. For tracks other than those by American Idol or Canadian Idol winners, sales {{were likely to be}} less than 1,000 per week. Nevertheless, this was the only singles chart Canadians had until June 2007, when the Canadian Hot 100 was released to the public.|$|E

She was ordered home and {{assigned}} to the Second Pacific Squadron that was intended to relieve the forces in Port Arthur. The ship served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Baron Dmitry von Fölkersam, second-in-command of the squadron, but he died two days before the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905. Oslyabya led the Second Division of the squadron during the battle and was the target of numerous Japanese ships during {{the early part of the}} battle. Many of <b>the</b> <b>hits</b> on the ship were along the waterline and caused extensive flooding. Efforts to counteract the resulting list destroyed her remaining stability and she sank just over an hour after the Japanese opened fire, the first modern battleship to be sunk solely by gunfire. Sources differ on the exact number of casualties, but the lowest figure given is 471.|$|E
