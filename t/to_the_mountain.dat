5|$|According to Rolf Singer's infrageneric {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Pluteus, the fungus belongs in the section Celluloderma. Species in this section have pleurocystidia that are either absent or non-. Furthermore, the majority have a cap cuticle comprising short club-shaped or spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem) cells, {{that may or may}} not be mixed with elongated cystidia-like cells. Other species in Celluloderma include P.romellii, P.aurantiorugosus, P.pulverulentus, P.thompsonii, and P.horakianus. Molecular analyses of internal transcribed spacer DNA sequences supports the placement of P.nevadensis in Celluloderma, and further suggest that it has a sister relationship with P.horakianas. The specific epithet nevadensis refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> Nevado de Colima, where the type material was collected.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} {{among the}} Christians of Neapolis decreased, {{tensions between the}} Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically. In 484, the city became {{the site of a}} deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of Aaron's sons and grandsons Eleazar, Ithamar and Phinehas. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to Constantinople, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and confiscated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.|$|E

In McAfee, CR 517 intersects with Route 94 and the two routes head east for a short wrong way concurrency, crossing the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway before CR 517 turns to the south. Route 94 continues northeast as McAfee Vernon Road, briefly becoming a divided highway as it passes the entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mountain</b> Creek ski resort. Continuing northeast, the route comes to an intersection with CR 515, which it runs concurrent with on Vernon Warwick Road. The two routes continue north, with CR 515 splitting from Route 94 a short distance after crossing the Appalachian Trail. From here, Route 94 continues through more countryside before reaching the New York state line, where the road continues into that state as NY 94.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí {{is usually}} {{considered}} the great master of Catalan Modernism, but his works go beyond any one style or classification. They are imaginative works that find their main inspiration in nature. Gaudí studied organic and anarchic geometric forms of nature thoroughly, {{searching for a}} way to give expression to these forms in architecture. Some of his greatest inspirations came from visits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> of Montserrat, the caves of Mallorca, the saltpetre caves in Collbató, the crag of Fra Guerau in the Prades Mountains behind Reus, the Pareis mountain in the north of Mallorca and Sant Miquel del Fai in Bigues i Riells.|$|E
5|$|His parents imbue {{him with}} a strong moral compass during his {{formative}} years and warn him never to use his great strength in anger. However, during kindergarten, Danner nearly kills the school's bully in a one-sided fight after being assaulted by the child. This event brands him as an outsider {{in the eyes of}} the other children. Because they treat him with such abhorrence, his only solace comes in the form of unleashing his powers within the Colorado wilderness (uprooting trees, throwing huge boulders, leaping <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> tops, etc.). This stigma eventually wears off, though, and is forgotten by the time Danner enters high school.|$|E
5|$|In 1790, Manuel Quimper of the Spanish Navy {{set sail}} from Nootka, a {{temporary}} settlement on Vancouver Island, with orders {{to explore the}} newly discovered Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Although Quimper's journal of the voyage does not refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> one of Haro's manuscript charts includes a sketch of Mount Baker. The Spanish named the snowy volcano , as it reminded them of the white-clad monks of the Carmelite Monastery.|$|E

40|$|The Hakodate {{magistrate}} (bugyo) vaccinated the Ainu {{people for}} smallpox {{during the period}} from 1857 to 1859. Previous studies state that the Ainu people fled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> for fear of the smallpox vaccination. This paper aims <b>to</b> clarify <b>the</b> actual situation that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ainu people fleeing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> and <b>the</b> factors that caused it. In section I, I studied all resources concerning the above-mentioned situation in previous studies. My research shows that the fleeing of <b>the</b> Ainu people <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> was recorded only in four places (yamukusinai, mororan, yuuhutu, and horobetu in east Ezo). In section II,I examined other resources concerning the smallpox vaccination and verified that the Ainu people reacted differently toward the smallpox vaccinations. In section III, I verified that one of the factors that caused <b>the</b> Ainu people <b>to</b> flee <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> was <b>the</b> attitude of the local administrative officers who forced them for the vaccination. Future research should clarify the reason for the emphasis on the Ainu people fleeing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> in <b>the</b> historical study of the smallpox vaccination for the Ainu people...|$|R
5|$|Mariano {{was told}} that this refined cloth was {{restricted}} for use only by the bishop of the city. Mariano {{went to see the}} prelate, who was surprised by the request. He ordered an inquiry of Manuel, directed by the priest of Oncogate (Quispicanchi), a village close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> On June 12, 1783, the commission ascended Qullqipunku with Mariano; they found Manuel dressed in white and shining with a bright light. Blinded, they retreated, returning with a larger party. On their second try they reached the boy. But when they touched him, he was transformed into a tayanka bush (Baccharis odorata) with the crucified Christ hanging from it. Thinking the party had harmed his friend, Mariano fell dead on the spot. He was buried under the rock where Manuel had last appeared.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, {{a new low}} {{pressure}} area developed while the tropical wave was located over the Gulf of Honduras. However, this area of disturbed weather was unable to develop further, because the storm quickly moved over the Yucatán Peninsula. After its one-day passage through the peninsula, the system entered the Bay of Campeche, but lacked any deep convection. This time, though, the wave quickly developed the deep convection it needed to become a tropical cyclone. In part, {{this was due to}} the Sierra Madre Oriental enhancing large-scale rotation of the disturbance by forcing air to flow parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> range, instead of through it. As a result, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida designated it as Tropical Depression Seven, just 255miles east-southeast of Tuxpan, Mexico. Early on the July 24, the cyclone was upgraded to a tropical storm with winds of 40mph (65km/h) and received the name Gert.|$|E

5|$|The Denver MSA has a gross {{metropolitan}} {{product of}} $157.6 billion in 2010, {{making it the}} 18th largest metro economy in the United States.

Because Denver is the largest city within , it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mountain</b> States, Southwest states, as well as all western states. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the Midwest, such as Chicago and St. Louis and some large cities of the West Coast, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|The Transylvanian peasants {{had already}} been outraged because of the {{increase}} of existing seigneurial duties and taxes {{and the introduction of}} new taxes during {{the first decades of the}} century. The bishop also tried to collect the tithe from the petty noblemen and from Orthodox Vlachs who had settled in parcels abandoned by Catholic peasants. In the spring of 1437, Hungarian and Vlach commoners, poor townspeople from Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) and petty noblemen started to assemble on the flat summit of Mount Bábolna near Alparét (Bobâlna) where they set up a fortified camp. The bishop and his brother, Roland Lépes, the deputy of the voivode (or royal governor) of Transylvania, gathered their troops to fight against the rebels. The voivode, the two counts of the Székelys and many Transylvanian noblemen also hurried <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> to assist them against the rebels.|$|E
