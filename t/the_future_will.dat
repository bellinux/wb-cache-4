25|$|The {{relation}} between philosophy and religion lies in their common recognition of an underlying unity, which transcends all the apparent differences and divisions due to individual phenomena. Many changes must {{take place in}} the existing religions before they will be suited to modern conditions, and the resulting religion of <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be a concrete monism.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{a long-standing}} {{agreement}} among many experts that geological disposal can be safe, technologically feasible and environmentally sound, {{a large part}} of the general public in many countries remains skeptical.

25|$|Many mansions/Wait till {{next year}} reply:Better {{technology}} in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> allow computers to understand.

25|$|He was {{eccentric}} and careless.

25|$|Despite the {{proliferation}} of animal protection legislation, animals still had no legal rights. Debbie Legge writes that existing legislation was very much tied {{to the idea of}} human interests, whether protecting human sensibilities by outlawing cruelty, or protecting property rights by making sure animals were not damaged. The over-exploitation of fishing stocks, for example, is viewed as harming the environment for people; the hunting of animals to extinction means that humans in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> derive no enjoyment from them; poaching results in financial loss to the owner, and so on.|$|E
25|$|God {{declared}} that God {{is the first}} and the last, and beside God there is no God, no One Who can proclaim what <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be, no other Rock. Those who fashion graven images shall not profit; they shall be shamed together. The smith makes an ax, and the carpenter forms the figure of a man. He hews down cedars and oaks, and uses the same wood for fuel to warm himself and to make a god to worship. They do not know nor understand that they strive after ashes.|$|E
25|$|Scientists and historians, for example, {{study the}} {{objective}} world, hoping to elicit {{the truth of}} nature—or perhaps the truth of history.

In terms of history, by studying the past, the individual can perhaps elicit the laws that determine how events will unfold—in this way the individual can predict the future with more exactness and perhaps take control of events {{that in the past}} appeared to fall outside the control of humans.|$|E

Lucinda's teacher calls for the pupils to finish but Lucinda continues until her teacher takes the page off her desk unfinished.

25|$|Immediately after Dušan's death (20 December 1355), {{his wife}} Empress Helena {{was found in}} Serres. She started to exert her {{imperial}} control on the region. This surely was against the goals of Vojihna, which would later on trigger armed conflicts. How the Empress ended up in Serres and started to rule it is unknown, it exists sources saying {{she was in the}} region staying away from the harsh winter in the north, just when her husband died. As she was energetic and smart (although not so talented), she might have foreseen the crumbling of the Empire, and sought to rule this region. If this version is correct, Vojihna and his son-in-law Uglješa Mrnjavčević (the son of Vukašin Mrnjavčević) were obliged to work for her as they had done to Dušan, although as <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> tell; with less enthusiasm and fidelity. It is not known how much power Vojihna had in the Serres province, although he most likely had the ambitions of putting it under his control.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} {{advice from}} Archie, Emma decides to confront Hyde about the vision while she pays him a visit at the psychiatric ward {{at the hospital}} where he being held. Hyde is aware of Emma's life behind bars and tests her {{to see if she}} is in fear even if she is in denial and makes his point when her hand started shaking. Hyde gives Emma the answer and he tells her to follow a red bird. Later that night, Emma takes the advice after she sees one during the search for survivors, and it leads Emma to The Oracle, a young girl who gives Emma a vision of her future as The Savior, which reveals a confrontation with an unknown attacker who plans to kill Emma as she was defending her family; The Oracle also hints of many paths Emma could take but the outcome might or might not change. When Emma returns to confront Hyde about this, he explain that the person she'll face in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be her ending but given his previous encounters with those that came before her, he tells Emma that the enemy is among the residents, so Emma decides for her family's sake to keep this to herself.|$|E

500|$|Following {{this line}} of thought Gibson raises the {{question}} of how <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> view today's society. The novel [...] "adopts a postmodern historicism" [...] perspective, through the arguments presented by Bigend, Cayce, and Parkaboy. Bigend and Cayce's view of history are compared to those of philosopher Benedetto Croce in that they believe history is open for interpretation when re-written from the frame of reference of another society. Parkaboy rejects this view, believing that history can be an exact science.|$|E
