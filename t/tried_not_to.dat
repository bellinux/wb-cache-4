5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in the front row watching his father wrestle from the time he could walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> think about it, but did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E
5|$|The second issue, ironically, {{came about}} due to {{concerns}} about a Soviet ABM system. The US's existing SM-65 Atlas and SM-68 Titan both used re-entry vehicles with blunt noses that greatly slowed the warheads {{as they entered}} the lower atmosphere and made them relatively easy to attack. The new LGM-30 Minuteman missile used sharp-nosed reentry shapes that traveled at much higher terminal speeds, and included a number of decoy systems that were expected to make interception very difficult for the Soviet ABMs. This would guarantee the US's deterrent. If there was a budget choice to be made, McNamara supported Minuteman, although he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say this.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli and Saltzman {{tried to}} {{convince}} Sean Connery to return as James Bond, but he declined. At the same time United Artists approached both Batman actor Adam West and Burt Reynolds. Reynolds told the studios that Bond should be played by an Englishman and turned the offer down. Among the actors to test for the part of Bond were Julian Glover, John Gavin, Jeremy Brett, Simon Oates, John Ronane, and William Gaunt. The main frontrunner for the role was Michael Billington. United Artists was still pushing to cast an American to play Bond but producer Albert R. Broccoli insisted that the part should be played by a British actor and put forward Roger Moore. After Moore was chosen, Billington remained {{on the top of}} the list in the event that Moore would decline to come back for the next film. Billington ultimately played a brief role in the pre-credit sequence of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Moore, who had been considered by the producers before both Dr. No and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was ultimately cast. He <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> imitate either Connery's or his own prior performance as Simon Templar in The Saint, and Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay into Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted approach to Bond.|$|E

25|$|In response, Zemskov {{wrote that}} the charge that Zemskov {{allegedly}} did not compare new data with already known information could not be called fair. In his words, the trouble with most western writers {{is that they do}} not benefit from such comparisons. Zemskov added that when he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> overuse the juxtaposition of new information with “old” one, it was only because of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatize the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD.|$|E
25|$|Genie was the last, {{and second}} surviving, of four {{children}} of parents living in Arcadia, California, and was born in 1957 without any noted complications at a normal, healthy weight and size. Around {{the time of her}} birth, her father began to isolate himself and his family from other people. Her father decided that she was severely mentally retarded because she was late to walk due to treatment for a congenital hip dislocation, a view which intensified as she got older, and consequently disliked her. He <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> talk to or pay attention to her and discouraged his wife and son, who was five years older than Genie, from doing so.|$|E
25|$|Topon {{has stated}} {{numerous}} {{times that the}} name Fuck the Facts was chosen, in part, as a statement about his attitude towards the music he wrote. He <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> feel hampered by genre labels, and that {{is reflected in the}} musical style. The earlier Fuck the Facts recordings up until approximately 2000 featured a combination of grindcore and noise. Though those two genres were prominent during this era of recording, many other styles crept into the music as well including death metal, electronic and even as some as diverse as disco and jazz. When Discoing the Dead was released in early 2001, it retained many of these experimental styles, paving the way for the beginning of the first incarnation of Fuck the Facts as a full band.|$|E

He did this because [...] "the victor's always right", and that things happened at Auschwitz which [...] "did not always comply with human rights".|$|E
500|$|Riklis <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{make the}} film {{explicitly}} feminist, {{with the female}} characters portrayed more sympathetically than the male ones. However, {{he has said that}} it can be interpreted that way by viewers. NPR's Mark Jenkins has stated that the film's bittersweet ending depicted the difficult status of women in Palestine as well as Palestinian-Israeli relations. Chris Cabin of the AMC Network criticized the film as being too [...] "fem-centric" [...] and as having a uniformly negative treatment of its male characters.|$|E
500|$|Hail to the Thiefs lyrics were {{influenced}} by what Yorke called [...] "the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity" [...] following the 2000 election of US President George W.

He denied any intent to make a [...] "political statement" [...] with the songs, and told the Toronto Star: [...] "I desperately <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> write anything political, anything expressing the deep, profound terror I'm living with day to day. But it's just fucking there, and eventually {{you have to give}} it up and let it happen." ...|$|E

This point was echoed by Guto Pryce in an interview with Birmingham's Metro although he conceded that [...] "in Rio music is everywhere.

500|$|Williams did {{not produce}} any ethical theory or system; several {{commentators}} noted, unfairly {{in the view of}} his supporters, that he was largely a critic. Moore writes that Williams was unaffected by this criticism: [...] "He simply refused to allow philosophical system-building to eclipse the subtlety and variety of human ethical experience." [...] He equated ethical theories with [...] "a tidiness, a systematicity, and an economy of ideas," [...] writes Moore, that were not up to describing human lives and motives. Williams <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> lose touch [...] "with the real concerns that animate our ordinary ethical experience," [...] unlike much of the [...] "arid, ahistorical, second-order" [...] debates about ethics in philosophy departments.|$|E
500|$|As {{the number}} of First World War {{veterans}} dwindled, calls grew to give the last remaining veteran a state funeral. The calls resulted in Her Majesty's Government approving on 27 June 2006 a National Memorial Service at Westminster Abbey to take place {{after the death of}} the last known British First World War veteran. Before this announcement Allingham often said that he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> think about the prospect, but has also been quoted as saying [...] "I don't mind— as long as it's not me." [...] Allingham received a letter from Member of Parliament Tom Watson on 14 July 2006 explaining the reasoning for a national memorial service rather than a state funeral, as the intention is to commemorate the entire generation that fought in the war rather than single out an individual.|$|E

[...] "We <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have violence or sexual discrimination or religious scenes in the United States," [...] said Masakazu Kubo, executive producer of Shogakukan. Some graphic sequences involving punching were taken out, including one from [...] "Pokémon, I Choose You!" [...] where Misty slaps Ash on the cheek. The names of the characters and monsters were Westernized: Satoshi became Ash, and Shigeru became Gary, and the Pokémon were given descriptive names. For example, of the three starter Pokémon, Hitokage, a salamander with a ball of fire on its tail, became Charmander; Fushigidane, a dinosaur with a green garlic bulb on its back, became Bulbasaur; and Zenigame, a turtle who squirts water, became Squirtle.|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} {{books in the}} Inheritance Cycle, Eragon and Eldest, sold over 15million copies {{worldwide}} together. Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Random House Children's Books and {{the publisher of the}} books, prepared Brisingrs release by printing 2.5million copies in advance, Random House's biggest initial print run of a children's book. Paolini said he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> let the expectations surrounding Brisingr affect him, stating that [...] "As an author, I found that I can't really allow myself to think about those things. I actually fell into that trap with the first part of Brisingr. I sat there and I started obsessing about every single word." [...] He turned away from his computer and began writing on parchment paper instead. The pages were rewritten on a computer document afterwards by his mother.|$|E
500|$|After Diamonds Are Forever, Broccoli and Saltzman {{tried to}} {{convince}} Sean Connery to return as Bond, but he declined. After considering Jeremy Brett, Michael Billington and Julian Glover, the two producers finally turned to Roger Moore, who they had previously discussed for On Her Majesty's Secret Service, but who had been unavailable, and he was ultimately cast to play Bond in Live and Let Die. At the time Moore was an established television actor, known for his performances as Simon Templar in The Saint and Lord Brett Sinclair in The Persuaders!: in both of which he played a [...] "charming, debonair, international playboy". When playing Bond, Moore <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> imitate either Connery or his previous roles, and screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay around Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted feel to Bond, an approach that led Raymond Benson to describe Moore's Bond as [...] "a rather smarmy, eyebrow-raising international playboy who never seemed to get hurt".|$|E

[...] Rogen also noted that the plot mirrors the situation he was in while working on the film The Green Hornet, when he had to lose weight and do physical training for his role.

500|$|Sam Witwer as Galen Marek/Starkiller— The {{child of}} two Jedi, Starkiller becomes Darth Vader's secret {{apprentice}} and is dispatched by his master {{to kill the}} Jedi who survived Palpatine's Jedi purge. Although acting as a villain, Starkiller is [...] "really just [...] damaged kid." [...] Developers decided not to give Starkiller a name in the game, but the novelization gives his name as Galen Marek. Although Starkiller starts as Vader's apprentice, a focus {{of the game is}} to allow the character to evolve into [...] "something more heroic, something greater." [...] Audio director David Collins saw a resemblance between Starkiller concept art and his friend, Witwer; Collins asked for Witwer's headshot and an audition reel, and a few weeks later Witwer sat for a 45-minute audition. Witwer secured the role by demonstrating to developers his deep understanding of the character; in portraying Starkiller, Witwer brought many new ideas about the character and imbued him with a sense of humanity. Developers <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make Starkiller so evil that players would have difficulty connecting to him. The Force Unleashed’s character's name is an homage to [...] "Annikin Starkiller," [...] the original name of the character that eventually became Luke Skywalker.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{classified}} Fantasy Black Channel {{into the}} British New Rave genre and musical scene. Others {{claimed that they}} could hear impressions of Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry and musician Gary Numan in the recording. Pitchfork Media's Adam Moerder commented that it contains several New Rave compositions which are aesthetically dubious. Chris Baynes of PopMatters claimed that the band members [...] "wear their influences pretty much inked onto their sleeves", but concluded that the album is exciting and excitable in equal measure. According to Late of the Pier, comparisons to Klaxons and New Rave are the results of lazy journalism, especially for a scene the band has never been in. Eastgate has explained that musical influences are often subconscious, even though the band members <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> listen to anything but their own work while recording the album. Nick Mitchell of The Skinny {{pointed out that the}} record is [...] "an unrestrained, unclassifiable, unexpectedly triumphant romp through blaring influences and genres, from the 70s camp rock of Queen and Bowie to the primitive electronics of Gary Numan, with echoes of 90s computer games and snatches of modern house".|$|E
