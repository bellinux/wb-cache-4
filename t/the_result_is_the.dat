5|$|Another {{approach}} {{starts with}} the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, {{turns out to be}} ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the TRIM command resolves this problem for operating systems that support it like Windows 7, Mac OS (latest releases of Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion, patched in some cases), FreeBSD since version 8.1, and Linux since version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline. When a file is permanently deleted or the drive is formatted, the OS sends the TRIM command along with the LBAs that no longer contain valid data. This informs the SSD that the LBAs in use can be erased and reused. This reduces the LBAs needing to be moved during garbage collection. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> SSD will have more free space enabling lower write amplification and higher performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{starts with}} a mission explaining {{the origins of the}} Majapahit Empire, wherein Raden Wijaya leads the Malays to victory against the Mongols, the Singhasari, and the Kediri. Gajah Mada proper then appears on the scene to rescue King Jayanegara from the city of Trowulan, which is surrounded by rebels. However, Jayanegara is dissolute and is soon assassinated. His sister, Tribhuwana, takes power and appoints Gajah Mada as her prime minister. Gajah Mada then swears his famous Sumpah Palapa oath to unify Nusantara, whereupon he will not eat any food containing spices until the whole Indonesian archipelago is unified. The Majapahit empire then proceeds to expand settlements to the islands of Bali, Sulawesi, and Borneo, and has conflicts with the Sunda, Dhamasraya, and Tumasik. The queen regent then abdicates to let her now-matured son, Hayam Wuruk, ascend the throne, and the Majapahit Empire then expands to the east by destroying the Docks of Makassar, Kutai, and Luwu. The sole group which remains are the Sunda, and Gajah Mada manipulates them into a trap by arranging for a marriage between his king and a Sunda princess. Whereas the Sunda believe that the marriage will result in an alliance, Gajah Mada has written into the contract that via the marriage, the Sunda will submit to Majapahit rule, unbeknownst to Hayam Wuruk. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Pasunda Bubat Massacre, wherein all the Sunda princes are killed and Hayam Wuruk's bride commits suicide out of grief. Gajah Mada is then summoned to the king and exiled for his actions.|$|E

25|$|The {{corresponding}} Sanskrit term is buddhadhātu. It has two meanings, {{namely the}} nature of the Buddha, equivalent to the term dharmakāya, and the cause of the Buddha.

25|$|At the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) {{the debate}} on papal primacy and {{authority}} re-emerged, and in the dogmatic constitution Lumen gentium, the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on {{the authority of the}} pope, bishops and councils was further elaborated.

25|$|Aircraft flight instruments, however, don't compute true {{airspeed}} {{as a function}} of groundspeed and windspeed. They use impact and static pressures as well as a temperature input. True airspeed is equivalent airspeed that is corrected for pressure altitude and temperature (which define density). <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> true physical speed of the aircraft relative to the surrounding body of air.

25|$|The next electoral schism of note {{developed}} between Symmachus and Laurentius, who both appealed to Theodoric the Great, the Ostrogoth king of Italy (and an Arian); <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first documented case of papal simony, wherein both candidates attempted to bribe the royal councilors, if not Theodoric himself, to influence his choice; Theodoric sided with Symmachus who proceeded to decree that reigning bishops {{would be able}} to designate their own successors, ending the participation of the laity for at least a half-century.|$|E
25|$|This {{unstable}} operation {{results from}} the development of pressure gradients {{in the opposite direction}} of the flow. Maximum pressure is observed at the discharge of the impeller blade and minimum pressure on the side opposite to the discharge side. When the impeller blades are not rotating these adverse pressure gradients pump the flow in the direction opposite to the direction of the fan. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> oscillation of the fan blades creating vibrations and hence noise.|$|E

25|$|In {{a fourth}} case, the {{consequences}} of incapacity are more drastic. Although the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 {{made it possible for}} the government or emanations of the state to be sued on contracts {{in the same way as}} a normal individual, where statute confers power on a public body to do certain acts, actions by representatives beyond that power will be ultra vires and void. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same as it was for companies before reform in 1989, so that whole chains of agreements could be declared as non-existent.|$|E
25|$|Another {{closely related}} {{manifold}} {{is the real}} projective plane. If a circular disk is {{cut out of the}} real projective plane, what is left is a Möbius strip. Going in the other direction, if one glues a disk to a Möbius strip by identifying their boundaries, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> projective plane. To visualize this, it is helpful to deform the Möbius strip so that its boundary is an ordinary circle (see above). The real projective plane, like the Klein bottle, cannot be embedded in three-dimensions without self-intersections.|$|E
25|$|If the fibrous cap {{separating}} a soft atheroma {{from the}} bloodstream within the artery ruptures, tissue fragments are exposed and released. These tissue fragments are very clot-promoting, containing collagen and tissue factor; they activate platelets and activate {{the system of}} coagulation. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> formation of a thrombus (blood clot) overlying the atheroma, which obstructs blood flow acutely. With the obstruction of blood flow, downstream tissues are starved of oxygen and nutrients. If this is the myocardium (heart muscle) angina (cardiac chest pain) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) develops.|$|E
