5000|$|In {{its most}} uncivic form, {{it can be}} a case of road rage and/or intimidation. An example would be where the {{tailgating}} driver (the driver in the following vehicle) threatens damage to the leading vehicle and its occupants by driving aggressively — perhaps also with use of headlights and horn — to bully the leading vehicle's driver {{to get out of the}} way. The driver being tailgated might not wish to comply, especially if doing so would involve breaking the law, such as by increasing speed beyond the speed limit or changing lanes without due regard for safety. Note, however, that in some jurisdictions (E.g., India) flashing high beams is a normal and polite method used to signal the intention to overtake.http://rmv.hqusareur.army.mil/drivrman/ss190-34.htm#P24 [...] Tailgating can also be dangerous to the <b>tailgater,</b> especially if they are driving closely behind a large vehicle (such as a tractor-trailer, or gas tanker). If the leading vehicle decelerates suddenly (such as when encountering a traffic jam, traffic lights, avoiding pedestrians, etc.), the <b>tailgater</b> has a high risk of causing a rear-end collision.|$|E
40|$|A {{favorite}} {{activity of}} many sports fans involves tailgating at sporting events. <b>Tailgaters</b> have been interacting {{with one another}} in large numbers for over a century and yet academic discourse on this communal activity is nearly nonexistent. The sociological study of the social aspects of tailgating reveals that <b>tailgaters</b> form a cohesive bond with one another and develop and reaffirm a sense of community to the point where a distinctive subculture is formed based on a number of social activities.

50|$|The {{primary reason}} for {{implementing}} game day recycling programs {{is to become a}} more sustainable campus.

50|$|Tailgating is a {{favorite}} pastime for fans attending games at Williams-Brice, and many <b>tailgaters</b> consider pre-games at the stadium {{as one of the}} best atmospheres in the nation. The grounds around the stadium, including the State Fairgrounds, provide plenty of real estate for tailgating. Many clubs have also bought private property in the area and erected tailgating shelters. In 1990, a unique form of tailgating called the Cockaboose Railroad arrived in Columbia. 22 immovable cabooses line an unused railroad track behind the south end of the stadium, and each Cockaboose provides private party space and cable television. Four condominium developments recently built around the stadium also cater primarily to Carolina football fans.|$|R

In fact, a 2007 report by KITV said that Hawaii fans had committed acts of abuse toward Fresno State fans, which UH Athletics has continually denied to this day. Fresno fans also told Boise State fans, Hawaii's next opponent in 2007, to not attend the game. Allegations ended up being false as Honolulu Advertiser photographers caught pictures of Boise State and Hawaii fans mingling and sharing food before the game.|$|R
