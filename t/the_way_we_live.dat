25|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Live,</b> Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now You See It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E

[...] In 2006, in a radio interview, Romm stated, [...] "Global warming is going to transform this country and our transportation and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> our lives.

500|$|Vlastimil Koubek (March 17, 1927 – February 15, 2003) was a Czech American {{architect}} who designed more than 100 buildings, {{most of them}} in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. When he died, he had designed buildings worth more than $2 billion. Most of his work is Modernist in style, although he developed a few structures in other vernaculars. He created the site plan for the redevelopment of Rosslyn, Virginia, and his Ames Center anchored the area's economic recovery. He also designed the World Building in Silver Spring, Maryland, which sparked redevelopment of that town's downtown and the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel in Washington, D.C. amongst many other buildings. In 1985, Washingtonian magazine considered him to be one of 20 people [...] "who in the past 20 years had the greatest impact on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> and who forever altered the look of Washington."

500|$|In 2001, Andrew Billen {{compared}} the contemporary cultural {{relevance of the}} series to <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Live</b> Now, as a follow-up to his comparison of the first series with Vanity Fair: [...] "In previous years {{we have seen the}} anguish caused by infidelity, impotence and infertility. This season the characters face the hazards thrown up by miscarriage, alcoholism and a late-flowering career. Sustaining relationships looks as hard as ever. Yet there is nothing each protagonist wants more than old-fashioned domestic bliss." [...] The review resonated with other critics; in The Scotsman, Linda Watson-Brown wrote an overall positive review of the series in general—dismissing the spate of [...] "anti-Cold Feet" [...] reviews—but criticised [...] "the ease with which problems are resolved and morality used to slap the viewer in the face". The final episode set in Australia polarised critics; in a column focusing on Chewin' the Fat, Scotsman critic Aidan Smith accused the big-budget episode [...] "which somehow managed to squeeze the Harbour Bridge into every shot" [...] of being the point the series jumped the shark, and Times columnist Caitlin Moran complimented it, but was concerned that the series' original main characters—Adam and Rachel—were being sidelined by everyone including Mike Bullen.|$|E

[...] It also has a 73 out of 100 rating based on 31 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews", at Metacritic. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film [...] "outrageously profane" [...] and [...] "wildly funny", writing that [...] "While censorship is the filmmakers' main target [...] favorite monster is the Motion Picture Association of America, self-appointed guardians of the nation's chastity. It's all in good dirty fun and in service of their pro-tolerance theme." [...] Stephen Holden of The New York Times heavily praised the film, regarding the film's [...] "self-justifying moral" [...] as [...] "about mass entertainment, censorship and freedom of speech." [...] He also praised Cartman's subjection to the V-chip, which he called [...] "the movie's sharpest satirical twist, reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange". Entertainment Weekly graded the film an A− and praised the film's message in a post-Columbine society, as well as Parker and Shaiman's musical numbers, which [...] "brilliantly parody / honor the conventions of Broadway show tunes and, especially, the Disney-formula ditties that began with Alan Menken and Howard Ashman." [...] The Washington Post Michael O'Sullivan neutrally regarded the offensive nature of the film, commenting [...] "Yes, the lampooning is more broad than incisive, but under the bludgeoning of this blunt instrument very few sacred cows are left standing." [...] In a review that was later quoted on the film's original home video cover, Richard Corliss from Time warned viewers [...] "You may laugh yourself sick – as sick as this ruthlessly funny movie is." [...] Corliss would later name the film his fifth favorite animated film of all time. The film had {{its fair share of}} critical detractors, without noting the conservative family groups offended by the film's humor. Jack Matthews of the Daily News suggested the film's running time made Parker and Stone [...] "run out of ideas", while Roger Ebert stated that the [...] "vicious social satire" [...] of the film both [...] "offended" [...] and [...] "amazed" [...] him. Ebert called the film [...] "the year's most slashing political commentary", but also said, [...] "It is too long and runs out of steam, but it serves as a signpost for our troubled times.
