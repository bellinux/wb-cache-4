This fee was later doubled. In addition to the membership subscription, the annual dues varied between half a dollar and a dollar.

40|$|The field {{measurements}} {{on the sound}} propagation characteristics above both snowfields with depth of 50 and 100 cm were carried out. For other applications, measurements of basic acous-tical properties of the snowfield as acoustic impedance, sound absorption coefficient and propa-gation constant in the snow were also carried out. From thee measurements, followings could be cleared. Both snowfields had high sound absorptive characteristics. There was strong sound attenuation in the frequency range where contained main spectra of the human voice. On the other hands, High frequency sound component, as including instrument music, easily and nois-ily propagated above the snowfield. The numerical simulation on the sound propagation above snowfield was carried out using measured acoustic impedance of the surface. Another simula-tion basis of scale model experiments was also carried out by using jute and <b>towel</b> <b>cloth</b> as corresponded material to the snowfield. It could be also cleared that both simulation results matched well {{to the results of}} {{field measurements}}. 1...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 71 - 73) A two part study, {{a consumer}} questionnaire and laboratory investigation, {{was conducted on}} the absorbency qualities of velour versus terry <b>cloth</b> <b>towels</b> when laundered with and without fabric softeners. Consumer opinions on preference of type of towels for aesthetic value were obtained. Chi Square statistical test was utilized for comparative analysis based on marital status, age, educational level, and family income. Fifty per cent of the respondents owned velour bath towels: of these 52 per cent rated velour towels as not very absorbent. All of the respondents owned terry <b>cloth</b> <b>towels</b> and 70 per cent of these rated terry cloth as very absorbent. The majority of the respondents who used fabric softeners stated the fabric softener made no difference in the absorbency of the towels. Velour towels were preferred for aesthetic value, but the overall preference was for the terry <b>cloth</b> <b>towels.</b> The laboratory investigation included weight, and wick-up tests. The results revealed that terry cloth was superior to velour in absorbency. The addition of fabric softeners greatly reduced the absorbability of both types of towels. Light weight <b>towels,</b> terry <b>cloth</b> and velour, are more absorbent than are heavy weight towels...|$|R

In olden days Kamarpukur, surrounded by extensive fields, looked like an island floating in a vast sea of green. Apart from agriculture, it was noted for cottage industries also. Sweet-meats like jilapi and nabat, hookah pipes of ebony, yarns, <b>towels,</b> <b>cloth,</b> etc., were prepared here and sent out for sale to Kolkata {{as well as to}} nearby markets. To this day, in the month of Chaitra (March - April), Kamarpukur reverberates with songs during the worship of Goddess Manasa and festival of Shiva, and in the following month, devotional choral songs of Hari are sung for three days at a stretch.

40|$|Le, A J Macnab Objective—To {{investigate}} a local “epi-demic ” of incidents of strangulation by hanging from continuous <b>cloth</b> <b>towels</b> in dispensers. Method—The coroner’s oYce in all prov-inces and territories were contacted. Five cases of hanging from continuous <b>cloth</b> <b>towels</b> in Canadian schools {{were identified and}} reviewed. Results—There were four deaths, and one near-death, all males age 7 to 12. Two cases were attributed to a “choking game” that provides a sensation (impending loss of consciousness) described as “cool”. In three cases, the child was alone at the time. All deaths were due to strangulation from hanging and all occurred in school washrooms. One child (playing with two friends) recovered after admission to an intensive care unit. Towel dispensers {{were removed from the}} two index schools. In one province the Ministry of Education encouraged re-moval of towel dispensers from all schools and education of students of the dangers of “choking games”. Conclusions—Thrill seeking from partial asphyxiation appears to underlie these incidents. Awareness of such cases should prompt appropriate education strategies to highlight the serious consequences of this form of risk taking behavior in young males. In Canada, these incidents have resulted in changes in the design of, and legislation regarding, <b>cloth</b> <b>towel</b> dispens-ers...|$|R

5000|$|Cloth menstrual pads are {{environmentally}} friendly {{and do not}} contribute to landfill as they are reusable and do not come in or contain plastic packaging. When cloth menstrual pads wear out (after years of use), those made from natural materials can be composted whereas disposable sanitary napkins made from synthetic materials cannot be recycled or composted. Fewer chemicals are used by cloth menstrual products than by disposable products. They create less overall waste compared to disposable menstrual products {{as they can be}} made from reused materials, including old pillow-cases and <b>towels.</b> Some <b>cloth</b> pads use hemp as the absorbent core which is more {{environmentally friendly}} to grow when compared with cotton or wood pulp.

2500|$|The word toilet {{comes from}} the French toile meaning cloth, and toilette ("little cloth") first came to mean the morning routine of washing, tidying hair, and shaving and making up as appropriate, from the cloth often spread on the dressing-table where this was done.

[...] The Oxford English Dictionary records [...] "toilet" [...] in English first, from 1540, as a term for a cloth used to wrap clothes in, then from 1662 (by John Evelyn) for a gold toilet service, and before 1700 {{for a range of}} related {{meanings}} (a <b>towel,</b> the <b>cloth</b> on a dressing-table, the act of using a dressing-table, and so on), but not for a lavatory, which did not come into use until the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|A {{paper towel}} (or kitchen paper) is an {{absorbent}} towel made from tissue paper instead of <b>cloth.</b> Unlike <b>cloth</b> <b>towels,</b> paper towels are disposable and {{intended to be}} used only once. Paper towels soak up water because they are loosely woven which enables water to travel between the fibers, even against gravity (capillary effect). Paper towels can be individually packed (as stacks of folded towels or held coiled) or come in rolls. Paper towels have similar purposes to conventional towels, such as drying hands, wiping windows and other surfaces, dusting, and cleaning up spills.|$|R
