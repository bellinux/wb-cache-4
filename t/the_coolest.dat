40|$|In hot stamping, <b>the</b> tool <b>cooling</b> system {{plays an}} {{important}} role in optimizing the process cycle time as well as maintaining the tool temperature distribution.

5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, so we should expect {{that there are more}} cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs. This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, and one of <b>the</b> <b>coolest</b> so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The {{reason for this is that}} the Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, cool and become a non-radiating black dwarf in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{combustion}} {{techniques in}} aero engines require highly effective cooling schemes of combustor liners. One Parameter affecting <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> performance is <b>the</b> geometry of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> holes themselves. So far, the freedom in <b>the</b> design of <b>cooling</b> holes was limited {{due to the}} manufacturing techniques. With emerging additive manufacturing methods, e. g. Direct Metal Laser Sintering, however, the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> holes is virtually unlimited. Especially the entrance and the curvature of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> holes determines <b>the</b> through-flow of the hole and consequently <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> performance of <b>the</b> ejected <b>cooling</b> film. In this study a set of combustor liner tiles with two innovative and four traditional cooling hole geometries will be analyzed and compared {{to each other in}} terms of <b>cooling</b> performance. <b>The</b> innovative geometries have bent cooling holes with a nearly horizontal outlet. All specimens have <b>the</b> same <b>cooling</b> hole pattern. <b>The</b> <b>cooling</b> performance is determined by comparing <b>the</b> total <b>cooling</b> effectiveness for a given pressure difference across the combustor liner tiles. The coolant mass flow rate is gained from experimentally determined discharge coefficients for the respective pressure difference. The first set of measurements is conducted in an atmospheric open-loop test rig at reduced temperatures but realistic density ratios between hot gas and coolant. The specimen with <b>the</b> best <b>cooling</b> performance has been selected for an investigation in a high pressure test rig at realistic combustor conditions (pressure, temperature) including fluctuations of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> air to simulate combustion instabilities. <b>The</b> <b>cooling</b> performance again is determined by <b>the</b> total <b>cooling</b> effectiveness for a given pressure difference across the combustor liner tiles...|$|R
