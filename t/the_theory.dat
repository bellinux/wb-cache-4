40|$|This {{chapter is}} focused on school {{violence}} in adolescence. In the last decades {{there has been a}} steady increase in research analyzing problems of violent behaviour among children and adolescents at school, reflecting the growing seriousness of these problems in some European countries and in the United States. In this chapter we first analyze different definitions of the concepts of “violence ” and “school violence ” in an attempt better understanding the topic {{we are going to talk}} about. Secondly, we introduce <b>the</b> most important <b>theories</b> developed to explain violent behaviour, and analyze each of them in relation to school violence in the adolescent period. These theories are split into two groups, innate drive theories and environmental theories.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of a new form of originalism has sparked an interest in <b>the</b> <b>theory’s</b> past that is particularly welcome as developments on the Supreme Court and in the Republican Party unsettle <b>the</b> <b>theory’s</b> place in American law and politics. Our understanding of <b>the</b> <b>theory’s</b> development, however, has been limited by an unfortunate and unnecessary division between what are now two separate histories of originalism. One history examines <b>the</b> <b>theory’s</b> development in academia and emphasizes the influence of principled argument. A second investigates its role in politics and highlights the role of conservative interests. This review essay identifies this division and offers two ways to create a productive dialogue. It first suggests we consider how political interests have shaped the academic debates over originalism by influencing the institutions that produce those debates. Second, it urges a reconsideration of how and why academic debates have shaped <b>the</b> <b>theory’s</b> political uses. There is good reason to consider whether principled constitutional argument, and thus the debates of academics, have shaped the political uses of originalism even if <b>the</b> <b>theory’s</b> most important advocates were motivated mostly – or even entirely – by the pursuit of political advantage. Using these approaches to identify the reciprocal influence of politics and principle on originalism’s past can help produce the new history of originalism we need to understand, evaluate, and influence <b>the</b> <b>theory’s</b> role in American law and politics...|$|R
