5|$|After JNA {{captured}} Vukovar on 18 November, the JNA 12th (Novi Sad) Corps, {{supported by}} the Serbian Ministry of Interior-trained Serb Volunteer Guard paramilitaries, started to advance west between Vinkovci and Osijek on 20 November.

5|$|FBI agents arrested Kaczynski on April 3, 1996, at his cabin, {{where he}} was found in an unkempt state. A search of his cabin {{revealed}} a cache of bomb components, 40,000 hand-written journal pages that included bomb-making experiments, descriptions of the Unabomber crimes and one live bomb, ready for mailing. They also found {{what appeared to be}} the original typed manuscript of Industrial Society and Its Future. By this point, the Unabomber had been the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most expensive investigation in FBI history.|$|E

5|$|For {{his part}} in the campaign, Kesselring was awarded the Knight's Cross with oak leaves, swords and {{diamonds}} by Hitler at the Wolfsschanze near Rastenburg, East Prussia on 19 July 1944. The next day, Hitler was the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20 July plot. Informed of this event that evening by Göring, Kesselring, like many other senior commanders, sent a telegram to Hitler reaffirming his loyalty.|$|E
5|$|Gabrielle Giffords was {{reported}} to be the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shootings. Some news organizations initially reported that she had been killed, but these statements were quickly revised to reflect that she had survived with a gunshot wound to the head. Daniel Hernandez Jr., one of Giffords's interns, assisted her after she was wounded and is credited with saving her life.|$|E
5|$|Hiroshima was {{the primary}} <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first nuclear bombing mission on August 6, with Kokura and Nagasaki as {{alternative}} targets. Having been fully briefed {{under the terms of}} Operations Order No. 35, the 393d Bombardment Squadron B-29 Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, Tinian, about six hours' flight time from Japan. The Enola Gay (named after Tibbets' mother) was accompanied by two other B-29s. The Great Artiste, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, carried instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, served as the photography aircraft.|$|E

Instead, AVALANCHE intend to use her to learn the whereabouts of the Promised Land for their own purposes, although a member of the Turks tries to protect her.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{a direct}} <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug isoniazid, which {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase. In one experiment, mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication.|$|E
5|$|Neither Shepard nor Lovell {{expected}} {{there would}} be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the moon landing was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.|$|E

5|$|Only {{six minutes}} later, in the 62nd minute, Stoke had their key chance and only shot on <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match with Kenwyne Jones in the 61st minute. A looping ball {{over the top}} of the Manchester City defence by Matthew Etherington allowed Jones a one-on-one, but he failed to convert, firing {{straight}} at goalkeeper Joe Hart with the ball ricocheting off both striker and keeper before bobbling to safety. Doubts over Matthew Etherington's fitness resurfaced when he was taken off in the 63rd minute, with Stoke City still in the game at 0–0 as it stood.|$|E
5|$|Overall the {{operation}} appeared to meet few of its initial aims. The political approach did {{lead to an}} increased discussion amongst {{the lower levels of}} Swedish officialdom as to the possibility of an invasion in Norway. However, it failed to convince the higher levels of government (with the exception of Nordenskiöld, who did not communicate his beliefs to anyone). Even the purchase of Norwegian securities went unnoticed. The overriding belief within the Swedish government was that any invasion of Norway would be diversionary, and that the European mainland would always be the main <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allies.|$|E
5|$|Pegasus Bridge, a <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British 6th Airborne, was {{the site}} of some of the {{earliest}} action of the Normandy landings. The bridge was replaced in 1994 by one similar in appearance, and the original is now housed on the grounds of a nearby museum complex. Sections of Mulberry Harbour B still sit in the sea at Arromanches, and the well-preserved Longues-sur-Mer battery is nearby. The Juno Beach Centre, opened in 2003, was funded by the Canadian federal and provincial governments, France, and Canadian veterans.|$|E

5|$|Strafford {{had become}} the {{principal}} <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Parliamentarians, particularly John Pym, {{and he went on}} trial for high treason on 22 March 1641. However, the key allegation by Sir Henry Vane that Strafford had threatened to use the Irish army to subdue England was not corroborated and on 10 April Pym's case collapsed. Pym and his allies immediately launched a bill of attainder, which simply declared Strafford guilty and pronounced the sentence of death.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Infantry Division's Operation Showdown {{launched}} {{in the early morning}} hours of 14 October 1952, with the 31st Infantry and 32nd Infantry at the head of the attack. The <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assault was the Triangle Hill complex northeast of Kumhwa. The 7th Infantry Division remained in the Triangle Hill area until the end of October, when it was relieved by the 25th Infantry Division. The 7th Infantry Division was highly praised by commanders for its tenacity through the fight.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{portion of}} the {{operation}} was to bear the title Dewey Canyon II, named for Operation Dewey Canyon conducted by U.S. Marines in the northwestern South Vietnam in 1969. It was hoped that the reference to the previous operation would confuse Hanoi as to the actual <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed incursion. The ARVN's portion was given the title Lam Son 719, after the village of Lam Son, birthplace of the legendary Vietnamese patriot Lê Lợi, who had defeated an invading Chinese army in 1427. The numerical designation came from the year, 1971, and the main axis of the attack, Route 9.|$|E

Also in December, the police announced they were investigating a Longhorn player in a separate incident that occurred in September. This incident allegedly involved armed robbery with a handgun.

5|$|To defeat more {{powerful}} monsters and gain experience points efficiently, players can join a party. A regular party {{has room for}} six members. Like in many other games, a well-balanced party will consist of several archetypes- namely a healer, a tank (the party member with high defense {{that will be the}} main <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monster), and the damage dealer. The enmity system comes into play heavily in parties, as players try to keep the monsters attention off fragile jobs and on the tanks. A well-balanced team working together {{is the only way to}} defeat many of the game's enemies.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation {{may cause}} either the gain {{of a new}} feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is {{bacterial}} adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell. Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli evolving {{the ability to use}} citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment, Flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing, and the soil bacterium Sphingobium evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol. An interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms' evolvability).|$|E
