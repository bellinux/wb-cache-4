25|$|Terman's {{goal was}} to {{disprove}} the then-current belief <b>that</b> <b>gifted</b> children were sickly, socially inept, and not well-rounded. Therefore, {{the first volume of}} the study reported data on the children's family, educational progress, special abilities, interests, play, and personality. He also examined the children's racial and ethnic heritage. Terman was a proponent of eugenics, although not as radical as many of his contemporary social Darwinists, and believed that intelligence testing {{could be used as a}} positive tool to shape society.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} <b>that</b> <b>gifted</b> students are universally gifted {{in all areas of}} academics, and these misconceptions can have a variety of negative emotional effects on a gifted child. Unrealistically high expectations of academic success are often placed on gifted students by both parents and teachers. This pressure can cause gifted students to experience high levels of anxiety, to become perfectionists, and to develop a fear of failure. Gifted students come to define themselves and their identity through their giftedness, which can be problematic as their entire self-concept can be shaken when they do not live up to the unrealistically high expectations of others.|$|E

2500|$|This is {{the most}} hotly debated aspect of gifted {{education}}. Some people believe <b>that</b> <b>gifted</b> education resources lack availability and flexibility. They feel that in the alternative methods of gifted education, the gifted students [...] "miss out" [...] on having a [...] "normal" [...] childhood, at least insofar as [...] "normal childhood" [...] is defined as attending school in a mixed-ability classroom. Others believe <b>that</b> <b>gifted</b> education allows gifted students to interact with peers that are on their level, be adequately challenged, and leaves them better equipped {{to take on the}} challenges of life.|$|E

2500|$|Based on data {{collected}} in 1921–22, Terman concluded <b>that</b> <b>gifted</b> children suffered no more health problems than normal for their age, save {{a little more}} myopia than average. [...] He {{also found that the}} children were usually social, were well-adjusted, did better in school, and were even taller than average. A follow-up performed in 1923–1924 found that the children had maintained their high IQs and were still above average overall as a group. Data collected in the 1920s also including a pioneering effort to implement above-level testing on a large scale, a practice that is widespread in gifted education today.|$|E

I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn't <b>that</b> <b>gifted,</b> as far as body and physical presence." [...] Subsequent to a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: [...] "It's like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they're {{going to have to change}} the rules."

2500|$|Alfred Binet {{published}} Mental Fatigue in 1898, {{in which}} he attempted to apply the experimental method to educational psychology. [...] In this experimental method he advocated for two types of experiments, experiments done in the lab and experiments done in the classroom. [...] In 1904 he was appointed the Minister of Public Education. This is {{when he began to}} look for a way to distinguish children with developmental disabilities. Binet strongly supported special education programs because he believed that [...] "abnormality" [...] could be cured. [...] The Binet-Simon test was the first intelligence test and was the first to distinguish between [...] "normal children" [...] and those with developmental disabilities. [...] Binet believed {{that it was important to}} study individual differences between age groups and children of the same age. He also believed that it was important for teachers to take into account individual students strengths and also the needs of the classroom as a whole when teaching and creating a good learning environment. He also believed that it was important to train teachers in observation so that they would be able to see individual differences among children and adjust the curriculum to the students. Binet also emphasized that practice of material was important. [...] In 1916 Lewis Terman revised the Binet-Simon so that the average score was always 100. The test became known as the Stanford-Binet and was one of the most widely used tests of intelligence. [...] Terman, unlike Binet, was interested in using intelligence test to identify gifted children who had high intelligence. In his longitudinal study of gifted children, who became known as the Termites, Terman found <b>that</b> <b>gifted</b> children become gifted adults.|$|E

50|$|These are the {{learning}} environments humans create.

The potential to create gifted environments predates humans and exists in chimpanzees.

40|$|Researchers suggest <b>that</b> while intellectually <b>gifted</b> {{children}} might not always display adequate {{focus on their}} general life, they perform very well on experimental attentional tasks. The current study used inattentional blindness (IB) paradigm to understand better the attentional abilities of intellectually gifted children.

An experiment was carried out that involved 44 intellectually gifted and 45 average children. Results showed <b>that</b> intellectually <b>gifted</b> children, whose IB rate was 18. 6 %, were less susceptible to IB than average children, whose IB rate was 46. 5 %, (2) (1) = 7. 626, p =. 006. Intellectually gifted children performed better on the primary attentional tasks than average children when unexpected stimuli occurred. Findings suggest <b>that</b> intellectually <b>gifted</b> {{children are more likely}} to maintain attention on current task but are more prone to process additional stimuli.
