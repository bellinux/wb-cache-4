5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> due to {{the fact}} that the system is at least {{partially}} enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, mellowing it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, are evident in the Leslie's sound. The thinner ply of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and the motors — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E
5|$|Other poems may be {{organized}} into verse paragraphs, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> instead established by {{a collection of}} rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form. Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.|$|E
5|$|Batman Forevers <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> {{significantly}} different from the previous installments, becoming more family-friendly since Warner Bros. believed that the previous Batman film, Batman Returns (1992), failed to outgross its predecessor due to parent complaints about the film's violence and dark overtones. Schumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton's films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic book of the Dick Sprang era, as well as the 1960s television series. Keaton chose not to reprise the role due to Burton stepping down as director. William Baldwin and Ethan Hawke were initially considered for Keaton's replacement before Kilmer joined the cast.|$|E

5000|$|Before modern {{electronic}} telephone switching systems came into use, dial <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> usually generated by electromechanical means. In the United States, the standard [...] "city" [...] dial <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> a 600 Hz <b>tone</b> that <b>was</b> amplitude-modulated at 120 Hz. Some dial <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> simply adapted from 60 Hz AC line current. In the UK, the standard Post Office dialling <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> 33 Hz; it was {{generated by a}} motor-driven ringing machine in most exchanges, and by a vibrating-reed generator in the smaller ones. Some later ringing machines also generated a 50 Hz dial tone.|$|R
50|$|The rising <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> {{marked with}} a {{trailing}} colon, the departing tone with a trailing hyphen. The level and entering <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> unmarked.|$|R
5|$|It is {{considered}} that overeating {{and lack of}} muscle <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> {{the main cause of}} a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.|$|E
5|$|It was a multi-target success, with an {{audience}} {{not limited to}} viewers in their forties as the focus on 1980s nostalgia might have indicated. This countered a contemporary trend in series television to target a specific audience demographic. The plots include characters and situations for all ages, and the series' general <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> family-friendly. Although it includes a number of flashbacks, the scripts did not limit the actors to a 1980s viewpoint; according to consultant Mariela Mociulsky, the show reflects more modern realities (such as men showing their emotions and women having greater autonomy in their lives) than TV shows of the 1980s did.|$|E
5|$|The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories, {{published}} in October 2006, {{is a collection}} of eight short stories by Susanna Clarke and illustrated by Charles Vess. The stories, which are sophisticated fairy tales, focus on the power of women and are set in the same alternate history as Clarke's debut novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell (2004), in which magic has returned to England. The stories are written in a pastiche of 18th- and 19th-century styles and their <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> macabre as well as satirical. The volume was generally well received, though some critics compared it unfavorably to Jonathan Strange.|$|E
50|$|Vowel {{length is}} {{predictable}} and present in Dâw, yet not distinctive lexically. All vowels with a rising or falling <b>tone</b> <b>are</b> long, while all vowels without a <b>tone</b> <b>are</b> short.|$|R
5000|$|In {{practice}} and analysis, neighboring <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> sometimes differentiated depending upon {{whether or not}} they are lower or higher than the chord tones surrounding them. A neighboring <b>tone</b> that <b>is</b> a step higher than the surrounding chord <b>tones</b> <b>is</b> called an upper neighboring tone or an upper auxiliary note while a neighboring <b>tone</b> that <b>is</b> a step lower than the surrounding chord <b>tones</b> <b>is</b> a lower neighboring tone or lower auxiliary note. However, following Heinrich Schenker's usage in Free Composition, some authors reserve the term [...] "neighbor note" [...] to the lower neighbor a half step below the main note.|$|R
5000|$|Stanislaus Pascal Franchot <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> born in Niagara Falls, New York, the {{youngest}} son of Dr. Frank Jerome Tone, the wealthy {{president of the}} Carborundum Company, and his socially prominent wife, Gertrude Van Vrancken Franchot. His maternal great-grandfather was congressman Richard Franchot. <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> also a distant relative of Wolfe Tone (the [...] "father of Irish Republicanism"); his fourth great-grandfather John <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> a first cousin of Peter Tone, the father of Wolfe <b>Tone.</b> <b>Tone</b> <b>was</b> of French Canadian, Irish, and English ancestry. Through his ancestor, the nobleman Gilbert BasqueHomme (Bascom), he was of French Basque descent.|$|R
5|$|The work's moralising <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> {{apparent}} {{from some of}} its more overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, and how the scales tilt far lower beneath {{the weight of the}} damned than the saved. The damned to Christ's left are more numerous and less detailed than the saved to his right. In these ways it can be compared to Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, which served much the same purpose, having been commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, which cared for the dying.|$|E
5|$|Vargas Llosa's fourth major novel, The War of the End of the World (La guerra del fin del mundo), was {{published}} in 1981 and was his first attempt at a historical novel. This work initiated a radical change in Vargas Llosa's style towards themes such as messianism and irrational human behaviour. It recreates the War of Canudos, an incident in 19th-century Brazil in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by the national army for months. As in Vargas Llosa's earliest work, this novel carries a sober and serious theme, and its <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> dark. Vargas Llosa's bold exploration of humanity's propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.|$|E
5|$|Akodon caenosus is the {{smallest}} of the Argentine members of the A.boliviensis group–indeed, among {{the smallest}} of all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> variable: generally ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. Reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, but there is also conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and clear in color. The underparts are clearly different in color, varying from light gray to yellowish or reddish. There are yellowish rings around the eyes, which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are white to yellowish hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered with hair and is dark brown above and white to buffy below.|$|E
50|$|Out of 57.74 million tones, 42.21 million <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> under proved category, 13.56 million tones under {{probable}} {{category and}} remaining 1.76 million <b>tones</b> under <b>are</b> possible category. About 51 million {{tones of the}} total reserves are of metallurgical grade and the grade particular of 6 million <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> not known.|$|R
5000|$|Phrasal <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> high <b>tones</b> which <b>are</b> {{automatically}} {{added to}} words in certain contexts; {{in other contexts}} the same word may be pronounced without phrasal tones. For example, when a word without lexical <b>tones</b> <b>is</b> {{the subject of a}} sentence, or followed by a number or quantity word, it remains toneless: ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{is also an}} {{interaction}} between tone and vowel length. Vowels with a mid <b>tone</b> <b>are</b> long while with a low <b>tone</b> <b>are</b> [...] "pulsated". Trager mentions further interaction but does not report the details.|$|R
5|$|The narrator's <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern is reinforced by the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E

25|$|The {{representation}} of tone. Most non-linguistic transcriptions of Mixtec {{do not fully}} record the tones. When <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> represented, acute accent over the vowel is typically used to indicate high tone. Mid <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> sometimes indicated with a macron over the vowel, {{but it may be}} left unmarked. Low <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> sometimes indicated with a grave accent overt the vowel, but it might be left unmarked, or it might be indicated with an underscore to the vowel.|$|E
30|$|Following the {{definition}} of [4] for melody, a better representation of individual musical <b>tones</b> <b>is</b> expected to ameliorate melody recognition, or in other words, melody is poorly resolved if individual musical <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> poorly represented. Musical <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> characterized by their harmonic structure. To compare the harmonic structure representation for the three different mappings (Std, Smt-MF, and Smt-LF), a sound sequence consisting of 36 consecutive synthetic musical <b>tones</b> <b>was</b> constructed. Each <b>tone</b> consisted of five partials with successive 20 % decrease in amplitude and lasting for 150 ms. The fundamental frequency of each tone increased from 130 Hz (C 3) to 987 Hz (B 5) with 1 -semitone interval.|$|R
50|$|The default mode sends 32 tones {{within the}} 1000 Hz audio {{bandwidth}} and the <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> spaced by 1000 Hz/32 = 31.25 Hz. The <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> shaped {{to minimize the}} amount of energy sent outside the nominal bandwidth.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tones</b> <b>are</b> high, low, rising, {{falling and}} a downstep; {{rising and falling}} may <b>be</b> <b>tone</b> sequences.|$|R

50|$|In telephony, call {{progress}} <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> audible <b>tones</b> that provide {{an indication of}} the status of a telephone call to the user. The <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> generated by a central office or a private branch exchange (PBX) to the calling party.|$|R
50|$|The {{conditioning}} {{factors which}} led to the yin - yang split still exist in Shanghainese, as they do in other Wu dialects: yang <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> only found with voiced initials , while the yin <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> only found with voiceless initials.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tones</b> <b>are</b> not {{marked in}} the {{standard}} orthography used in Chichewa books and newspapers, but linguists usually indicate a high tone by writing it with an acute accent, as in the first syllable of nsómba. The low <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> generally left unmarked.|$|R

25|$|The {{realization}} of the tones in the various varieties of Chinese is generally predictable; see Four tones for details. In Beijing Mandarin, for example, even <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> split according to voicing, with muddy consonants becoming aspirates: ba, pa, ma, bha → bā, pā, má, pá (and mha → mā). Going <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> not split, and muddy consonants become tenuis: bah, pah, mah, bhah → bà, pà, mà, bà. Rising tone splits, not along voicing, but with muddy-consonant syllables conflating with going tone: baa, paa, maa, bhaa → bǎ, pǎ, mǎ, bà. That is, bhaa and bhah are homonyms in Beijing, as indeed they are in all of Mandarin, in Wu apart from Wenzhounese, in Hakka, and in reading pronunciations of Cantonese. Entering <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> likewise split in Beijing: mat, bhat → mà, bá.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{now believe}} that this <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> the reflex of an Old Chinese *-s suffix, {{with a range of}} {{semantic}} functions.|$|E
50|$|Zaiwa {{has five}} tones. Three {{of these five}} <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> in {{unchecked}} syllables and the remaining two are in checked syllables. The <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> distinguished through a numbering system of one to five; one being the lowest pitch and five the highest pitch.|$|R
50|$|Falling tones tend to fall {{further than}} rising tones rise; high-low <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> common, whereas low-high <b>tones</b> <b>are</b> quite rare. A {{language}} with contour tones will also generally {{have as many}} or more falling tones than rising <b>tones.</b> However, exceptions <b>are</b> not unheard of; Mpi, for example, has three level and three rising tones, but no falling tones.|$|R
