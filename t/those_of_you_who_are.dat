[...] "343's response to that quagmire," [...] Gies wrote, [...] " [...] {{to return to the}} fundamentals of what made the series great in the first place. The studio has brought Halos mechanics kicking and screaming into the modern era, while providing the most bombastic, co-op-driven campaign in Halo history." [...] GameSpots Mike Mahardy agreed that 343 had produced some of the best iterations of the game series' facets with Halo 5. IGN's Brian Albert opined that 343 Industries had created an even bigger game than previous entries, with [...] "the strongest combat Halo has ever seen". Destructoids Chris Carter felt that Halo 5 failed to grab him {{in the same way as}} previous games had, [...] "but <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> still content with Master Chief and his wacky adventures across the galaxy will likely walk away satisfied." [...] More critically, the reviewers of GamesTM felt that Halo 5 was [...] "sheepish and safe" [...] and represented a series low.|$|E
2500|$|He was {{the first}} to tell the {{audience}} that King had died; some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were even worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot. When the audience quieted, Kennedy acknowledged that many would be filled with anger. He said: [...] "For <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man." [...] These remarks surprised his aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of his brother's death. Kennedy said that the country had to make an effort to [...] "go beyond these rather difficult times", and quoted a poem by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, [...] "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God." [...] In conclusion, Kennedy said that the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, quoting the Greeks again.|$|E

Then each took a tin of meat and a couple of pounds of biscuit in his pocket.

6000|$|It would, I regret, {{be quite}} {{impossible}} for me to attempt, {{in the course of the}} time I can presume to hold you here, to unfold the history of more than one of these great investigations of Harvey. I call them [...] "great investigations," [...] as distinguished from [...] "large publications." [...] I have in my hand a little book, which <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> at a great distance may have some difficulty in seeing, and which I value very much. It is, I am afraid, sadly thumbed and scratched with annotations by a very humble successor and follower of Harvey. This little book is the edition of 1651 of the 'Exercitationes de Generatione'; and if you were to add another little book, printed in the same small type, and about one-seventh of the thickness, you would have the sum total of the printed matter which Harvey contributed to our literature. And yet in that sum total was contained, I may say, the materials of two revolutions in as many of the main branches of biological science. If Harvey's published labours can be condensed into so small a compass, you must recollect that it is not because he did not do a great deal more. We know very well that he did accumulate a very considerable number of observations on the most varied topics of medicine, surgery, and natural history. But, as I mentioned to you just now, Harvey, for a time, took the royal side in the domestic quarrel of the Great Rebellion, as it is called; and the Parliament, not unnaturally resenting that action of his, sent soldiers to seize his papers. And while I imagine they found nothing treasonable among those papers, yet, in the process of rummaging through them, they destroyed all the materials which Harvey had spent a laborious life in accumulating; and hence it is that the man's work and labours are represented by so little in apparent bulk.|$|E
60|$|Some of {{you have}} heard already of the old Greeks; and all of you, as you grow up, will hear {{more and more of}} them. <b>Those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> boys will, perhaps, {{spend a great deal of}} time in reading Greek books; and the girls, though they may not learn Greek, will be sure to come across a great many stories taken from Greek history, and to see, I may say every day, things which we should not have had if it had not been for these old Greeks. You can hardly find a well-written book which has not in it Greek names, and words, and proverbs; you cannot walk through a great town without passing Greek buildings; you cannot go into a well-furnished room without seeing Greek statues and ornaments, even Greek {{patterns}} of furniture and paper; so strangely have these old Greeks left their mark behind them upon this modern world in which we now live. And as you grow up, and read more and more, you will find that we owe to these old Greeks the beginners of all our mathematics and geometry—that is, the science and knowledge of numbers, and of the shapes of things, and of the forces which make things move and stand at rest; and the beginnings of our geography and astronomy; and of our laws, and freedom, and politics—that is, the science of how to rule a country, and make it peaceful and strong. And we owe to them, too, the beginning of our logic—that is, the study of words and of reasoning; and of our metaphysics—that is, the study of our own thoughts and souls. And last of all, they made their language so beautiful that foreigners used to take to it instead of their own; and at last Greek became the common language of educated people all over the old world, from Persia and Egypt even to Spain and Britain. And therefore it was that the New Testament was written in Greek, that it might be read and understood by all the nations of the Roman empire; so that, next to the Jews, and the Bible which the Jews handed down to us, we owe more to these old Greeks than to any people upon earth.|$|E
