5|$|A mercury–thallium alloy, {{which forms}} a {{eutectic}} at 8.5% thallium, {{is reported to}} freeze at−60°C, some 20°C below the freezing point of mercury. This alloy is used in thermometers and low-temperature switches. In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones and olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble thallium salts are added to gold plating baths <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer.|$|E
5|$|Defeated enemies {{would drop}} {{two types of}} items: cards, which either {{unlocked}} new characters or allowed the player to boost their characters' stats when increasing their level; and bullets, {{which could be used}} on cards that had been increased to their maximum level, to transform them into higher-ranking cards. The player could also find other power-up items scattered in the arenas, which could be used <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> or strength of their characters, recover health points, or make aiming easier.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s the German {{railways}} wanted <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeds</b> of some {{of their}} railway lines. One issue in doing so is signalling. German signals are placed too close to allow high-speed trains to stop between them, and signals may be difficult for train drivers to see at high speeds.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of <b>the</b> nerve impulse, the {{myelin sheath}} helps in reducing energy expenditure over the axon membrane as a whole, because {{the amount of}} sodium and potassium ions {{that need to be}} pumped to bring the concentrations back to the resting state following each action potential is decreased.|$|R

5|$|Although he {{was being}} {{pressured}} by the divisional commander <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of the advance, Whitehead {{was said to be}} reasonably happy with the progress being made by the 2/48th along the central route, although he had misgivings about the performance of the 2/23rd on the left and the 2/24th on the right. To some extent, the failure of the 2/24th to take the 2,200 feature could be attributed to the importance which the Japanese commander, Katagiri, placed upon its defence, however, Whitehead believed that the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Gillespie, was procrastinating and being overly cautious in his tactics. Nevertheless, it was later realised that the terrain which the 2/24th faced was more formidable than first thought, and that in order for the battalion to make progress, they too, like the 2/48th, would need tanks. Some attempt was made by the Australians to bring these up from the rear areas, but ultimately the fighting around Sattelberg came to an end before this could be effected. On the brigade's left, south of the main route, the pace of the 2/23rd's advance had also caused Whitehead some concern. Indeed, Whitehead went as far to express this to the 2/23rd's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Tucker, who pointed out that his lack of progress had been caused by the large number of tasks that the battalion had been assigned, namely the competing demands to secure the flank while attempting to move quickly through broken country in order to make its scheduled rendezvous with the 2/48th.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} 1959, the city wished to build {{exclusive}} bus lanes on Lafayette and DeKalb Avenues in Brooklyn. The lanes {{would be built}} on streets that were to be converted from two-way to one-way streets. They were intended <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of bus service on these avenues, since without the bus lanes, the routes were projected to lose riders. However, traffic commissioner T. T. Wiley disapproved of the proposal, since the city did not install exclusive bus lanes.|$|E
25|$|Law {{and order}} was another key issue, with Labor {{promising}} extra police. Tough drink and drug driving laws {{had also been}} introduced which included zero tolerance roadside testing for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Methamphetamine, and later MDMA. Labor introduced speed limit reduction legislation which took effect in March 2003 which saw non-arterial non-main roads and most Adelaide CBD roads reduce from 60km/h to 50km/h. The Liberals proposed <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> limit back to 60km/h for several roads, concentrated mainly around the Adelaide Park Lands.|$|E

25|$|The fuse {{elements}} may {{be shaped}} to increase heating effect. In large fuses, current may be divided between multiple strips of metal. A dual-element fuse may contain a metal strip that melts instantly on a short-circuit, and also contain a low-melting solder joint that responds to long-term overload of low values {{compared to a}} short-circuit. Fuse elements may be supported by steel or nichrome wires, so that no strain {{is placed on the}} element, but a spring may be included <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of parting of the element fragments.|$|E
25|$|The two {{remaining}} original {{buildings on the}} Phoenix Block, {{one of which is}} the Kersey H. Fell building, are done in the Greek Revival style of architecture. They share a common wall and use simple stone lentils and sills in the windows. The storefronts are accented by columns. The common wall helped <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> which the Phoenix Block was constructed at. So eager were merchants to occupy the storefronts that several stores opened for business while workers were still constructing the second and third floors of the buildings.|$|E

25|$|In 1932, {{during the}} Great Depression, {{the state of}} Virginia helped the Pamunkey develop their pottery {{as a source of}} income. The state set up a program for a pottery school and {{provided}} a teacher. The state furnished materials for the building, but the tribe built it themselves. Tribal members learned methods <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of manufacture. They incorporated firing pottery in a kiln and using glazes into their techniques. They learned to use squeeze molds to produce copies of pots quickly. Kiln firing produced finished pottery of more uniform brown tones than the shades of gray from traditional pottery techniques.|$|E
25|$|Like other neurons, α-MNs {{transmit}} signals as action potentials, {{rapid changes}} in electrical activity that propagate from the cell {{body to the}} end of the axon. <b>To</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> at which action potentials travel, α-MN axons have large diameters and are heavily myelinated by both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. Oligodendrocytes myelinate the part of the α-MN axon that lies in the central nervous system (CNS), while Schwann cells myelinate the part that lies in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The transition between the CNS and PNS occurs at the level of the pia mater, the innermost and most delicate layer of meningeal tissue surrounding components of the CNS.|$|E
25|$|The Rumford {{fireplace}} {{created a}} sensation in 1796 when Benjamin Thompson Rumford introduced {{the idea of}} restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Benjamin Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. Thomas Jefferson had them built at Monticello, and Henry David Thoreau listed them among the modern conveniences that everyone took for granted. Rumford and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> of air going up the flue. It produced a streamlined air flow, reducing turbulence so the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than choking the residents. Rumford fireplaces are appreciated for their tall classic elegance and heating efficiency. This simple alteration {{in the design of}} fireplaces were copied everywhere in an age when fires were the principal source of heat. The Rumford fireplace is still used in the 21st century.|$|E
