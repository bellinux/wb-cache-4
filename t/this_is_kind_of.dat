That was for me the most ground-breaking thing about Devil Wears Prada—it engaged men on a visceral level," [...] she told Indiewire.|$|E

The website Slipcue.com reviewed the release and commented that Love Never Fails, [...] "is probably too rowdy for most Southern Gospel fans (who really like tinkly pianos and less-twangy vocals), and while it probably won't wow many country listeners, for folks who are fans any of these three singers, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a treat.|$|E
500|$|Show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse wrote [...] "I Do" [...] as a [...] "mini-season finale", {{as it was}} {{the last}} episode before mid-season hiatus, and would end in a cliffhanger. It also served as a climax and {{beginning}} of a closure of Jack, Kate and Sawyer's captivity on Hydra Island, with the writers saying that afterwards there would be a return to the beach and the six-episode block would be [...] "more palatable" [...] and make more sense, comparing them to the first seven episodes of season 2 where the tail section survivors are introduced. Executive producer Bryan Burk also said the pre-hiatus episodes were [...] "our season 2.5. [...] Like, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> like wrapping up a lot of where we were last year", considering season three would really begin in the seventh episode.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} support Cyrus' then newly launched, joint apparel line with Max Azria, sold {{exclusively}} by Walmart stores, an EP was chosen for release. [...] "I feel it goes perfect {{for that kind of}} look", she commented. For Cyrus, The Time of Our Lives was a transitional EP and a method of re-introducing herself to new audiences. Speaking about the EP's sound, she said, [...] "I kind of kept it in the lines of what I usually do, which is kind of a pop rock sound — I don’t even like using the word 'rock,' because I feel like it’s an honor to be put in that title. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> my transition. The next record, I definitely {{want to be able to}} step it up a bit." [...] Cyrus originally planned for her succeeding album to be edgier and more predominant in rock music. She said that, after completing promotion for The Time of Our Lives, she wanted to [...] "step out and maybe take a break" [...] for some time in order to compose music that inspires her. Cyrus' next album, Can't Be Tamed was released approximately ten months later, on June 18, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Al Jean {{noted in}} an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly that it was easy to cast Lynch, since [...] "she can do edge, sweetness, and a mix of both". He further noted that the crew was happy when she agreed to take the role, and that he was [...] "embarrassed [...] didn’t ask her before she was so successful because she’s funny in everything she does." [...] Lynch recorded her scenes together with cast member Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer. In an interview with the website Hollywood Outbreak, she commented that [...] "It was pretty amazing to {{every once in a while}} look up at his face and go 'Oh my God, it's that guy that does that voice.'" [...] Lynch added that she [...] "had the best time. I would do it again and again. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> very much a milestone in my career. I will point to this as a big deal." [...] In an interview with Fox All Access, Lynch revealed that she is a longtime fan: [...] "Indeed I am a fan of The Simpsons. I started watching twenty years ago. I remember the first season. I remember clearly moments from the episodes and I thought it was revolutionary, the comedy of it. I really loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I think a lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E

It was alleged by plainclothes policemen who were in the audience that Chambers allowed audience members to touch her with their hands and mouths during her show called [...] "Feel the Magic". She was released on $2,000 bail and the charges were later dropped.

2500|$|In 2008, Taylor becomes {{involved}} with Brooke's son, the much younger Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder), who was previously {{in a relationship}} with Phoebe. Lowder described playing the storyline as [...] "challenging" [...] and one that [...] "stirs the pot". It began after Tylo and Lowder were tested for chemistry in scenes. When the news of Rick and Taylor becoming closer reaches Brooke and Ridge, they both protest against it; Tylo described this as [...] "two pots calling the kettle black". Brooke accuses Taylor of being with Rick as a form of revenge against her, and enlists Phoebe's help in stopping the relationship. Tylo told Soap Opera Digest that Taylor's revenge is [...] "a subconscious thing", explaining: [...] "Taylor sort of feels like Brooke stole her child, so <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> retribution. Taylor is like, 'Well then I'll take your kid'." [...] Phoebe accepts Rick and Taylor being together, wanting both of them to be happy and giving Taylor the [...] "green light she was looking for". Lowder believed that the tables were turning on Brooke, and said [...] "now Brooke's son is in love with , and she's in love with him – and it's legit (...) Taylor wins, Brooke loses – and Brooke's going crazy". Rick and Taylor get engaged but she ends the relationship due to her feelings for Ridge.|$|E
