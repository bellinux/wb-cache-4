5|$|The {{story begins}} as Mr. and Mrs. Mallard fly over various {{potential}} {{locations around the}} city of Boston, Massachusetts (United States) to start a family. Each time Mr. Mallard selects a location, Mrs. Mallard finds something wrong with it. Tired from <b>their</b> <b>search,</b> the mallards land at the Public Garden Lagoon to spend the night. In the morning, a swan boat passes by the mallards. The mallards mistake the swan boat for a real bird and enjoy peanuts thrown by {{the people on the}} boat. Mrs. Mallard suggests that they build their nest in the Public Garden. However, just as she says this, her husband is nearly run down by a passing bicyclist. The mallards continue <b>their</b> <b>search,</b> flying over Boston landmarks such as Beacon Hill, the Massachusetts State House, and Louisburg Square. The Mallards finally decide on an island in the Charles River. From this island, the Mallards visit a policeman named Michael on the shore, who feeds them peanuts every day.|$|E

5|$|<b>Their</b> <b>search</b> for fossils {{led them}} west to rich bone beds in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming. From 1877 to 1892, both paleontologists used their wealth and {{influence}} {{to finance their}} own expeditions and to procure services and dinosaur bones from fossil hunters. By {{the end of the}} Bone Wars, both men had exhausted their funds in the pursuit of paleontological supremacy.|$|E
5|$|As Yonah's illness, the Black Scrawl, is terminal, Nier {{sets out}} {{to look for a}} cure. As he does, Nier finds a talking book, Grimoire Weiss, which {{suggests}} that the two team up to use Weiss' magic and to find a cure for Yonah's disease. In <b>their</b> <b>search,</b> they encounter Kainé, a hot-tempered and foul-mouthed swordswoman; and Emil, a blindfolded boy whose eyes petrify anyone they see. After journeying for a time, the village is attacked by a giant shade; the battle culminates in Yonah being carried away by a master Shade that suddenly appears—the Shadowlord—who carries his own book, Grimoire Noir.|$|E
5|$|Endecott's warrant was {{followed}} by an order issued by King Charles in March and received by Endecott in May 1661 containing a direct order to apprehend the two fugitives and ship them back to England. Endecott dutifully obeyed, but he appointed two recently arrived Royalists to track them down. Somewhat predictably, <b>their</b> <b>search</b> came up empty, and Whalley and Goffe thus escaped. Biographer Lawrence Mayo suggests Endecott would have appointed different men for the search had he been serious about catching them.|$|E

50|$|In 2014, NeighborhoodScout {{released}} a new search feature that {{allows users to}} filter <b>their</b> neighborhood <b>search</b> by crime activity, school quality, housing values, and demographic characteristics such as languages, ethnicity, race, and income.

5|$|Following the announcement, {{numerous}} {{residents of}} the town began to sign a list volunteering to enter the structure themselves to continue the search; the owners also announced their intention to seek a court injunction ordering the resumption of search and rescue efforts.

5|$|Gliese 3634 b {{was one of}} {{a sample}} of over 300 very-low-mass stars {{targeted}} by astronomers in search of planets that may orbit such stars. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at La Silla Observatory in Chile, six years of radial velocity data led the astronomers in the discovery of eleven other planets. After these discoveries, the astronomers chose to refocus <b>their</b> <b>search</b> on short-period planets, hoping to follow up after discoveries using the radial velocity method with a search for planets that also transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|HD 205739's {{designation}} is {{from the}} Henry Draper catalogue. The star was also observed by Hipparcos, which released its catalogue in 1997. The observations {{that led to the}} discovery of the planet HD 205739 b started when the N2K Consortium started an extended search for planets around 300 stars not usually targeted by Doppler spectroscopy surveys. In the case of HD 205739, the star was observed using the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. HD 205739 was selected primarily because it was a metal-rich star; the N2K collaboration biased <b>their</b> <b>search</b> towards metal-rich stars with closely orbiting Jupiter-size planets, hoping to find a connection between a star's metallicity and its planets' masses.|$|E

5|$|In {{guise of}} {{competing}} with other Internet Companies {{such as the}} search service Google, in 2005 Microsoft announced {{a new version of}} its MSN search service. Later, in 2006, the company launched Microsoft adCenter, a service that offers pay per click advertisements, in an effort to further develop <b>their</b> <b>search</b> marketing revenue. Soon afterward, Microsoft created the CodePlex collaborative development site for hosting open source projects. Activity grew quickly as developers from around the world began to participate, and by early 2007 commercial open source companies, such as Aras Corp,. began to offer enterprise open source software exclusively on the Microsoft platform.|$|E
5|$|Later, Morales and Ramsey {{receive a}} report about a stolen car {{that matches the}} one from the Turner and Cook murders. While {{investigating}} a sand pit, they encounter the Phantom.

While the officers {{are waiting for the}} train to pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue <b>their</b> <b>search,</b> but never find him. Years later during the Christmas season of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.|$|E

5|$|Page and Brin {{used the}} former's basic HTML {{programming}} skills {{to set up}} a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As <b>their</b> <b>search</b> engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.|$|E

Figard's father travelled to the UK to help detectives in <b>their</b> <b>search</b> for her and to appeal to the public for information as to her whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|Sonic and Shadow play fast-paced levels, {{emphasizing}} platforming and gameplay. Their homing attack can lock onto robots {{created by}} Eggman and G.U.N., {{and they can}} grind on rails. Tails' and Eggman's levels are slower and oriented towards multi-directional shooting; they are confined to mechs {{in which they can}} jump short heights, hover and shoot enemies. Knuckles' and Rouge's levels are open and feature action-adventure gameplay with treasure hunting; in each level, they must find three shards of the Master Emerald. <b>Their</b> <b>search</b> is guided by radar and puzzle-based clues from harmless robots. Knuckles and Rouge can glide, defeat enemies with punches and kicks and scale walls, digging into them to find power-ups.|$|E
