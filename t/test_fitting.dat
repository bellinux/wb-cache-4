However, the development of society leads to a change in the approach to {{development and}} to the requirements to put forward to new materials. Modern society needs materials that not only have better characteristics, but are also safe and environmentally friendly. Spider silk satisfies all these requirements. This Master`s thesis is devoted to the study of protein solutions, which can be used to create artificial spider silk fibers, which properties are close to the properties of natural spider silk fibers. The study was carried out by using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. A special measuring cell was developed for the study of protein solutions. The dependencies of impedance on concentration of proteins in the solution, time and temperature were obtained. Several theories about processes of adsorption and aggregation and their impact on the impedance of the system were created on the basis of these dependencies.

40|$|Several {{models have}} been fitted {{in the past to}} smooth time-series {{vegetation}} index data from different satellite sensors to estimate vegetation phenological parameters. However, differences between the models and fine tuning of model parameters lead to potential differences, uncertainty and bias between the results amongst users. The current research assessed four techniques: Fourier analysis, asymmetric Gaussian model, double logistic model and the Whittaker filter for smoothing multi-temporal satellite sensor observations with the ultimate purpose of deriving an appropriate annual vegetation growth cycle and estimating phenological parameters reliably. The research used Level 3 Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS, spatial resolution ~ 4. 6 km) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) data over the years 2004 to 2006 composited at eight day intervals covering the Indian sub-continent. First, the four models were fitted to representative sample time-series of the major vegetation types in India, {{and the quality of the}} fit was analysed. Second, the effect of noise on model fitting was analysed by adding Gaussian noise to a standard profile. Finally, the four models were fitted to the whole study area to characterise variation in the quality of model fitting as a function of single and double vegetation seasons. These smoothed data were used to estimate the onset of greenness (OG), a major phenological parameter. The models were evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). The first <b>test</b> (<b>fitting</b> to representative sample time series) revealed the consistently superior performance of the Whittaker and Fourier approaches in most cases. The second <b>test</b> (<b>fitting</b> after the addition of Gaussian noise) revealed the superior performance of the double logistic and Fourier approaches. Finally, when the approaches were applied to the whole study, thus, including vegetation with different phenological profiles and multiple growing seasons (third test), it was found that it was necessary to tune each of the models according to the number of annual growing seasons to produce reliable fits. The double logistic and asymmetric Gaussian models did not perform well for areas with more than one growing season per year. The mean absolute deviation in OG derived from these models was a maximum (3 to 4 weeks) within the dry deciduous vegetation type and minimum (1 week) in evergreen vegetation. All techniques yielded consistent results over the south-western and north-eastern regions of India characterised by tropical climate...|$|E
40|$|Capacity based {{design of}} pile {{foundations}} limits the soil-structure interaction mechanism to group bearing capacity estimation, neglecting, in most cases, {{the contribution of}} the raft. on the other hand, a straightforward, nonlinear, 3 -D analysis, accounting for soil and structural nonlinearities and the effects arising from pile-soil-pile interaction, would be extremely high CPU-time demanding and will necessitate the use of exceptionally powerful numerical tools. With the aim of investigating the most efficient, precise, and economical design for a bridge foundation, a hybrid method, compatible with the notion of sub-structuring is proposed. It is based on both experimental data and nonlinear 3 -D analysis. The first step to achieve these targets is a back-analysis of a static pile load <b>test,</b> <b>fitting</b> values for soil shear strength, deformation modulus, and shear strength mobilization at the soil-pile interface. Subsequently, the response of 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 pile group configurations is numerically established and the distribution of the applied load to the raft and the characteristic piles is discussed. Finally, a design strategy for an optimized design of pile raft foundations subjected to non-uniform vertical loading is proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

This comparison reveals a systematic error much larger than the few-percent total error sometimes claimed for such extractions in the literature. In particular, we find that errors deduced from fits using a Vector Meson Dominance ansatz are misleading, typically turning out to be much smaller than the actual discrepancy between the fit and exact model results. The use of a sequence of Padé approximants, recently advocated in the literature, appears to provide a safer fitting strategy. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|This study {{incorporated}} specific endpoints for estrogenic {{activity in}} the early life-stage (ELS) test, as described in Guideline 210 of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and traditionally used for toxicity screening of chemicals. A transgenic zebrafish model expressing an estrogen receptor-mediated luciferase reporter gene was exposed to ethinylestradiol (EE 2), and luciferase activity as well as vitellogenin (VTG) was measured. Concentrations of EE 2 were tested at 1, 3, or 10 ng/L for 30 d from fertilization or during only the last 4 d with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as presolvent (0. 01 %). Exposure to EE 2 induced no toxic effects. Mean body weights were significantly higher in groups exposed for 30 d {{in the presence of}} DMSO, but condition factors were not affected. Significant luciferase and VTG induction occurred following 30 -d exposure (3 and 10 ng EE 2 /L), while only VTG levels were affected in the 4 -d exposure (10 ng EE 2 /L). This study demonstrated the usefulness of incorporating estrogenic endpoints in the OECD ELS <b>test,</b> <b>fitting</b> the requirements for screening estrogenic activity of chemicals. Quantitative measurement of both VTG and luciferase activity proved to be rapid and sensitive.

40|$|Prior to this study, Dr. Vardha N. Bennert and {{collaborators}} {{selected a}} sample of 100 local active galaxies to study the relationships between black hole mass and host galaxy properties. The broad Hβ width is necessary to determine black hole mass. This value is determined using a spectral decomposition code was scripted in IDL by Dr. Daeseong Park. The script fit spectral features and collected data for properties such as width of emission lines and continuum contribution percentages. The results were logged for further analysis.

To <b>test</b> <b>fitting</b> accuracy with spectra containing variable host galaxy continuum contributions, the artificial spectra were given such contributions. For this study, the extracted components from the real active galaxy spectra were used to create artificial spectra containing relevant characteristics typically found in the sample objects 2 ̆ 7 spectra. 105 artificial spectra were created with their components cataloged. The pseudo-spectra contained features whose physical quantities spanned ranges typically found within the sample of real, collected spectra, as well as added random noise, in order to appropriately represent the original sample set. The varied components were Hβ width and continuum contributions from a power law continuum, host galaxy starlight, and FeII emissions. The artificial spectra were then ran through the same IDL decomposition code that originally fit the real objects. The quantitative results of the applied fitting process were then compared with the properties of the known components that composed the artificial spectra. The comparison of input versus output through the IDL code produces a fitting percent error that was used for analysis of accuracy of fit features. The Hβ emission line width is the focus feature for contrast between the variable pseudo spectra. The errors were plotted against the variable components in order to determine a correlation between feature properties and fitting error, if any exist.

Due to the width of the clean room access door, the heads will have to be upright to fit through. This head cart will hold the heads upright and wheel them into the clean room on a guided track. Before the wheels are placed on the heat cart, it will be used as a stand to place the heads on for the purpose of <b>test</b> <b>fitting</b> the super insulation. The head cart will not only be structurally sufficient to support the weight of the heads but also stiff enough to allow a maximum deflection of 1 / 2 -inch {{at the end of the}} 48 -inch cylinder. The heaviest head assembly weighs about 9000 pounds. Following A. I. S. C. specifications and using a 9000 pound design load, the head cart was initially designed and built and later modified in order to meet the deflection requirements. Bending and tension stresses were limited to two thirds the yield strength. Weld and shear stresses are limited to 0. 4 *Fy. The C 7 X 12. 25 channels, the L 2. 5 X 2. 5 X 0. 25 angles adn the 1 / 2 -inch plate are all A 36 steel.

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{electron}} microscopy measurement of single particles has {{enabled us to}} reconstruct a low-resolution 3 D density map of large biomolecular complexes. If structures of the complex subunits can be solved by x-ray crystallography at atomic resolution, fitting these models into the 3 D density map can generate an atomic resolution model of the entire large complex. The fitting of multiple subunits, however, generally requires large computational costs; therefore, development of an efficient algorithm is required. We developed a fast fitting program, “gmfit”, which employs a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to represent approximated shapes of the 3 D density map and the atomic models. A GMM is a distribution function composed by adding together several 3 D Gaussian density functions. Because our model analytically provides an integral of a product of two distribution functions, it enables us to quickly calculate the fitness of the density map and the atomic models. Using the integral, two types of potential energy function are introduced: the attraction potential energy between a 3 D density map and each subunit, and the repulsion potential energy between subunits. The restraint energy for symmetry is also employed to build symmetrical origomeric complexes. To find the optimal configuration of subunits, we randomly generated initial configurations of subunit models, and performed a steepest-descent method using forces and torques of the three potential energies. Comparison between an original density map and its GMM showed that the required number of Gaussian distribution functions for a given accuracy depended on both resolution and molecular size. We then performed <b>test</b> <b>fitting</b> calculations for simulated low-resolution density maps of atomic models of homodimer, trimer, and hexamer, using different search parameters. The results indicated that our method was able to rebuild atomic models of a complex even for maps of 30 Å resolution if sufficient numbers (eight or more) of Gaussian distribution functions were employed for each subunit, and the symmetric restraints were assigned for complexes with more than three subunits. As a more realistic test, we tried to build an atomic model of the GroEL/ES complex by fitting 21 -subunit atomic models into the 3 D density map obtained by cryo{{electron microscopy}} using the C 7 symmetric restraints. A model with low root mean-square deviations (14. 7 Å) was obtained as the lowest-energy model, showing that our fitting method was reasonably accurate. Inclusion of other restraints from biological and biochemical experiments could further enhance the accuracy...|$|E
