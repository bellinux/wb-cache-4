However, he was doubtful of its success, since {{his knowledge of the}} Polish language was too limited for an adequate musical expression of <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> <b>He</b> was also concerned with the problem of the change of accents in the sung text, which could become unintelligible if they were muddled.|$|E

25|$|In the {{conclusion}} to the essay, he wrote of the Jews that 'only one thing can redeem you from the burden of your curse: the redemption of Ahasuerus — going under!' Although this has been taken by some commentators to mean actual physical annihilation, {{in the context of}} the essay it seems to refer only to the eradication of Jewish separateness and traditions. Wagner advises Jews to follow the example of Ludwig Börne by abandoning Judaism. In this way Jews will take part in 'this regenerative work of deliverance through self-annulment; then are we one and un-dissevered!' Wagner was therefore calling for the assimilation of Jews into mainstream German culture and society - although there can be little doubt, from <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>he</b> uses in the essay, that this call was prompted at least as much by anti-semitism as by a desire for social amelioration. (In the very first publication, the word here translated as 'self-annulment' was represented by the phrase 'self-annihilating, bloody struggle').|$|E

Shakur used this fury, which Johnny [...] "J" [...] described as [...] "superhuman", to attack Biggie and other East Coast rappers.

The book met with immediate critical acclaim and financial success. Reviewers praised it as an exciting alternative to traditional primers. Three years after its debut, the book had already sold over a million copies, and in 2001 Publishers Weekly listed the book at number nine on its list of best-selling children's books of all time.

In 1983, Geisel said, [...] "It is the book I'm proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the Dick and Jane primers."

500|$|The zduhaći, {{the dragon}} men, {{and the related}} folkloric figures of Europe can be {{compared}} with Eurasian shamans, e.g., the noaidi of the Lapps, {{as well as the}} shamans of the Samoyeds and Tungus in Siberia. They were all able to leave their body in spirit to fight against the enemies of their community. The shamans also fought against each other, usually in animal form, for reasons such as to procure for their side as much reindeer as possible. However, for a shaman's soul to leave his body, he had to work himself into a state of ecstasy through a ceremony consisting of drumming, dancing, chanting, and even taking narcotics. All the zduhaći had to do was to fall asleep, although the unusual depth of their sleep indicates a state of ecstasy. There are detailed and eventful descriptions of the journey of the shaman's soul, but no corresponding accounts exist {{in the case of the}} zduhaći. However, the zduhaći who left their bodies were said to have gone into the winds. This expression may contain an idea of a journey. Pavel Rovinski recorded <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>he</b> heard from his landlady in Montenegro on a windy night in March: [...] "Listen, how they sing—the travellers; they have gone high high!

500|$|Oblivions {{score was}} {{composed}} by series mainstay Jeremy Soule, {{a video game}} composer whose past scores had earned him a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award in the [...] "Game Music Category" [...] and two nominations for an Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS) award for [...] "Original Music Composition". The official soundtrack to Oblivion, featuring 26 tracks spanning 58 minutes; it was released in March 2006, via Soule's digital distributor DirectSong. Soule had worked with Bethesda and Todd Howard during the creation of Morrowind, and, in a press release announcing his return for Oblivion, Soule repeated <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>he</b> had said during Morrowinds press release: [...] "The stunning, epic quality of The Elder Scrolls series is particularly compatible with the grand, orchestral style of music I enjoy composing the most". As in his compositions for Morrowind, Soule chose to create a soft and minimalist score {{so as not to}} wear out users' ears. Soule stated that while composing the music he did not imagine any specific characters or events; rather, he wanted it [...] "to comment on the human condition and the beauty of life". In a 2006 interview, he related that this desire came {{as a result of a}} car accident that occurred during his composition of the score. He said, [...] "I ended up rolling in my car several times on an interstate while flying headlong into oncoming traffic ... I felt no fear ... I simply just acknowledged to myself that I've had a good life and I would soon have to say goodbye to all of it in a matter of seconds". Soule sustained only minor injuries, but commented that his feeling during the crash—"that life is indeed precious"—remained with him throughout the rest of the composition.|$|E
500|$|In {{spin-off}} series Torchwood (2006–2011), {{the audience}} learns that Rose's act of resurrecting Jack cursed him with {{being unable to}} die. Her absence and the Doctor's pained estrangement from her proves a point of contention for the Doctor's series 3 companion Martha (Freema Agyeman); when Martha protects the Doctor, living as a human without his memories, it is still Rose that he dreams of. When the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) in the show's fourth series (2008), Rose mysteriously begins {{to appear in the}} Doctor's life—first seen only by Donna, and later in silent video messages which the Doctor fails to notice. When a [...] "Time Beetle" [...] creates an alternate universe in which Donna never meets the Doctor and the Doctor dies, Rose travels from her parallel world to this world, working alongside the organisation UNIT to send Donna back in time, and make Donna's younger self turn left at a junction and not right. Rose tells Donna to say two words to The Doctor; 'Bad Wolf'. The Doctor concludes this is a sign that the Universe, and reality itself is under threat. Later, in the midst of Davros' (Julian Bleach) plot to obliterate existence, Rose unites with the Doctor and his companions Donna, Martha, Jack and Sarah Jane to make a stand against him and his army of Daleks. In the midst of the battle, a part-human Doctor is created and destroys the Daleks. The Doctor returns Rose to the parallel universe along with Jackie, and his part-human counterpart. Rose challenges the Doctor to say <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>he</b> did not say to her during their previous farewell. The Doctor does not answer, but his part-human counterpart whispers in her ear and Rose kisses him. The Doctor retreats, leaving Rose behind with his part-human counterpart. In the closing scenes of The End of Time (2010), just prior to his regeneration, the Doctor travels to Rose's housing estate in the first minutes of 2005. He speaks to her from the shadows, asking her what year it is. She tells him it is January 1, 2005. The Doctor promises her that she will have a really great year.|$|E
