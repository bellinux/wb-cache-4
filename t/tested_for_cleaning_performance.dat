40|$|Brief {{description}} of the proposed change(s) : The layouts of the LHC cleaning insertions in IR 3 and IR 7 were adapted to an improved solution for the LHC collimation system. The new collimation layout addresses LHC requirements <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance,</b> robustness, impedance, aperture, engineering, and schedule. Initial installation is minimized and space reservations are included for system upgrades. At the same time several optimizations are introduced: placement of dipole correctors and quadrupole connections out of particle showers, space reservations for absorbers and scrapers, increased inter-module distance for quadrupoles, consistent vacuum layout, and placement of BLM’s.

40|$|Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and rubisco protein stain {{were used}} as tools to screen the {{effectiveness}} of detergent formulations in cleaning a protein stain from solid surfaces. Surfactant and biosurfactant-based formulations, with and without added protease, were screened <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance.</b> Enzyme-free detergent formulations at 1500 ppm total surfactant were insufficient to cause complete surface cleaning, despite the high concentration of surfactant. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> of a "home-made" formulation containing 2 ppm subtilisin A (SA) and 2 ppm sodium dodecyl benzyl sulphonate (SDOBS) was as efficient as the best amongst the three enzyme-free 1500 ppm formulations. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> of 2 ppm SA {{in the absence of}} SDOBS was less effective than the combined formulation, even though 2 ppm SDOBS alone did not cause any protein removal. The observed synergistic performance was attributed to the cooperative mechanisms (chemical and physical attack) by which these two agents act on a rubisco stain. Replacing SDOBS in the enzyme-surfactant formulation with the same amount of surfactin biosurfactant (2 ppm) gave the best rubisco removal of all formulations examined in this study, irrespective of the surface chemistry underlying the protein film. It was found that 75 % and 80 % of immobilised rubisco stain could be removed from hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, respectively, by the biosurfactant-SA formulation (compared with 60 % and 65 %, respectively, using the SDOBS-SA formulation). Our results suggest that {{it may be possible to}} generate fully renewable biochemical-based cleaning formulations that have superior <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> to existing technologies.

40|$|The present work aims {{to develop}} and {{establish}} conservation processes <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> marine archaeological silver coins - the Shoiba Hoard Coins in Red Sea, Shoiba Port, near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. To help the archaeologists study and date these coins, {{it was necessary to}} reveal the impeded decorations and the inscriptions on these coins. Before establishing the experimental work to evaluate the selected conservation processes, various tests were performed on different types of the selected coins to assess their statement and condition. XRD analysis was used to characterize the coins. Also scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) attached with energy- dispersive x-ray analyzer (EDX) was used to identify and analyze the corrosion products {{on the surface of the}} coins. In this study 5 cleaning methods within various conditions were <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> the current coins. The efficacy of the combined use of alkaline Rochelle salt and reduction cleaning techniques were evaluated. To evaluate the usefulness of the suggested conservation processes used in this study <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> the hoard coins, the coins before, during and after the cleaning processes were investigated by various techniques. SEM with EDAX and XRD techniques were used to characterize the coins after the final conservation. The results showed that the best method that can be used safely and successfully <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> of the studied coins is as the following a) initially the corroded coins have to be treated with alkaline Rochelle salt, b) then treated with alkaline dithionite reduction technique or electrolytic reduction technique, finally c) the coins should be rinsed, dried and followed by isolation.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of drive-through systems {{is that the}} vehicle {{does not have to}} stop <b>for</b> <b>cleaning.</b> As the vehicle passes the magnetic-sensor or photo-sensor at the entrance, the washing process is triggered.

The nozzles are mounted angle-iron grids which open the tire treads and flushing the mud <b>for</b> a high <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance.</b> The washing platform is usually of galvanized steel. The first modern systems were introduced as the MobyDick “Quick” series at a German construction industry trade exhibition.

Today all modern drive through systems are based on the engineering and design development of the Quick series.|$|R
40|$|Future {{upgrades}} of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) demand improved <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> of its collimation system. Very efficient collimation {{is required}} during regular operations at high intensities, because {{even a small}} amount of energy deposited on superconducting magnets can cause an abrupt loss of superconducting conditions (quench). The possibility to use a crystal-based collimation system represents an option <b>for</b> improving both <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> and impedance compared to the present system. Before relying on crystal collimation for the LHC, a demonstration under LHC conditions (energy, beam parameters, etc.) and a comparison against the present system is considered mandatory. Thus, a prototype crystal collimation system has been designed and installed in the LHC during the Long Shutdown 1 (LS 1), to perform feasibility tests during the Run  2 at energies up to 6. 5  TeV.

40|$|The complex {{conservation}} work {{regarding the}} pronaos {{surfaces of the}} Basilica of Sant'Andrea in Mantua has recently been completed. The coffered vaults exhibit stucco decorations composed of a white plaster body or of a pinkish one and coated with either a white (on the relief) or a greyish finish (in the backgrounds). This finish is mainly composed by a gypsum layer with an extensive presence of calcium oxalates, even if in some samples a lime ground has been detected. Restoration works executed in the 1830 s by Paolo Pianzola, radically modified the 15 th century facade and pronaos, reconstructing the painted decorations with new materials, as they were deemed too deteriorated to be preserved. Then the painted decorations and the rosettes, made of gilt wood, were replaced with relief made of a material called by Pianzola stucco-forte; hence the current result, is a neoclassical reading of the Alberti facade.

40|$|Future {{upgrades}} of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may demand improved <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> of its collimation system. Very efficient collimation {{is required}} during regular operations at high intensities, because {{even a small}} amount of energy deposited on superconducting magnets can cause an abrupt loss of superconducting conditions (quench). The present collimation system has accomplished its tasks during the LHC Run I very well, where no quench with circulating beam took place with up to 150 MJ of stored energy at 4 TeV. On the other hand, uncertainty remains on the performance at the design energy of 7 TeV and with 360 MJ of stored energy. In particular, a further increase up to about 700 MJ is expected for the high luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC), where improved <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> may be needed together with a reduction of collimator impedance. The possibility to use a crystal-based collimation system represents an option <b>for</b> improving both <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> and impedance compared to the present system. A bent crystal can in theory replace primary collimators and steer all halo particles onto one single absorber, providing better cleaning with reduced impedance than the present multi-stage collimation system, which is based on massive amorphous blocks of material that surround the beam. Although promising results on the principle of crystal collimation were obtained during experimental tests at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), feasibility studies at the LHC are mandatory before relying on this approach for future upgrades. The main goal of this Ph. D. thesis is the design of an optimised prototype crystal collimation system <b>for</b> these <b>tests</b> in the LHC, which has been installed during April 2014.

Using an interval chemical supply suggests a saving of chemical consumption which is environmentally friendly, and has a high throughput process. When wafers were placed with a wide spacing and a narrow spacing {{at the same time}} in the same wet clean bath, the particle removal efficiency was decreased noticeably at the narrow spacing compared to a wafer arrangement with equal spacing. In order to prevent the wet clean process from decreasing the <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance,</b> there must be a careful consideration of the wafer placement in the wet clean bath. Interestingly, a simulation of the supply flow velocity in a wet clean bath was correlated to experimental data of actual particle removability with various wafer spacing.

Materials and methods: 140 acrylic resin specimens (Orthocryl) were produced according to manufacturer’s instructions: 20 for the pre-tests, 10 stained and 10 unstained for each dishwashing detergent (K Classic Geschirr-Reiniger-Pulver and Sodasan Maschinenspülmittel with corresponding rinse agent and dishwasher salt, Somat 10 Spülmaschinentabs) and each cleaning programme (short programme, 40 °C; intensive programme, 75 °C). Subsequent to sanding and polishing the specimens to a thickness of 1 ± 0. 1 mm, they were stained {{in accordance to}} the method of Jagger et al. (2002) {{with a combination of}} black-tea solution, 0. 2 % chlorhexidine and saliva as a plaque-substitute. The optical density of each specimen was determined before and after staining and after cleaning in the dishwasher. All measurements were done, using a spectrophotometer at 380 nm, the absorption maximum of the stains. In addition, in each series 10 unstained specimens were used {{in order to determine the}} average opacity caused by the cleaning as such, which was subtracted from the values measured for the stained specimens. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> was expressed as a percentage of removed tea-chlorhexidine-salvia-stains (absorption) in relation to the total stain (absorption). The results were analysed for significant differences, using the Kruskal-Wallis- and Mann-Whitney-test. Results: All specimens showed less tea-chlorhexidine-saliva-stains after the <b>cleaning.</b> The <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> was always significantly higher using the intensive programme. Only the short programme yielded significant differences <b>for</b> the <b>tested</b> detergents with K Classic Geschirr-Reiniger-Pulver being the most effective (median: 97. 65 %).

Approach: The {{aim of this}} research was to develop and test an innovative cavitometer for quantitative and automatic performance assessments of Ultrasonic Dental Scalers (UDS) through the acoustic emission produced by cavitation induced by the tip of the UDS ultrasonic transducer when immersed in aqueous solution. Firstly, an optimized acoustic emission sensor specifically for UDS ultrasonic transducers, software to process the acoustic emission sensor signal and to calculate a Figure of Merit (FM) and a hydraulic-pneumatic circuit were developed; these parts together constituted the cavitometer. To validate the developed cavitometer, two groups of UDS transducers were tested with the cavitometer and with one cleaning test; 48 units of the Jet 1 UDS model and 12 units of the Jet 2 model (Gnatus, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil) were tested. Sixteen assessments were carried out with each transducer, for a total of 768 measurements with Jet 1 and 192 with Jet 2. Spearman test was employed to observe correlations between the measurements from the different methods. Jet 1 transducers were compared with Jet 2 employing Student t <b>test</b> <b>for</b> cavitometer assessments and Mann Whitney U <b>test</b> <b>for</b> the <b>cleaning</b> <b>test</b> assessments.

40|$|The {{removal of}} layers {{of a model}} food soil (dried Xanthan gum {{containing}} fluorescent ZnS particles) by a vertical water jet impinging normally on to the plate, generated by a solid stream nozzle which moves across the plate was reported by Kohler et al. (2014). Their experiments investigated nozzle pressures from 0. 5 to 2. 0 barg; nozzle diameters from 0. 84 - 2. 66 mm, nozzle layer separation of 20 mm, and nozzle traverse speeds of 2. 1 - 126 mm s(- 1). The flow parameters and separation are smaller than those typical of industrial jet cleaning operations. The model developed by Wilson it al. (2014) [Chem. Eng. Sci, 109, 183 - 196] <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> of similar layers by a stationary impinging jet was modified to describe the case of moving nozzle. This new model predicted the trends observed in the experiments, {{and analysis of the}} data yielded a similar cleaning rate constant to that obtained previously <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> of similar layers by stationary jets. The model predicted a non circular cleaning front which matched that extracted from new experiments in which the flow was interrupted in order to capture this feature. The model allowed the <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> indicators suggested by Kohler et al. (2014) to be expressed quantitatively: these indicated that higher nozzle traverse speeds give increased cleaning Lime, energy and liquid consumption performance...|$|R
40|$|Concerns over {{possible}} {{waterborne disease}} forced drinking water supply companies in England and Wales to adopt microfiltration and ultrafiltration technologies rapidly. MF and UF membrane plants {{are designed to}} produce water of a consistent quality regardless of throughput and fluctuations in the feedwater quality. To operate well they need to maintain flux and balance the rate of fouling, and chemical <b>cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> is critical to this. Giant steps have been taken into characterizing the foulants scientifically {{in the last few}} years while cleaning is reactive and ad hoc. This thesis explores the basis <b>for</b> a corresponding <b>cleaning</b> science <b>for</b> the technology to develop quantitively. <b>Cleaning</b> <b>performance</b> was defined in terms of a response to combinations of explanatory variables in a materials limited cleaning envelope. The study focused on applying variations of cleanant concentration, applied temperature and soak times to a variety of membranes fouled with different waters and regimes. An experimental design was developed and applied consistently to a number of different sampled sites; allowing an optimised recovery from the polynomial expressions for each treatment, through factorial analysis of the data. The size and variety of the data set analysed allowed comparison and quantification of the different deviations from optimal cleaning response. This effect was seen to vary temporally and with operating regime and the methods usefulness as a practical tool in the membrane plant lifecycle was considered. Cost evaluation of the variation in cleaning response showed that sub-optimal cleaning costs and energy use may be significant and the thesis also illustrated how module geometry affects initial cake deposition and thus cleanability. By demonstrating the potential <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> factor analysis, the potential for a combined heuristic and predictive cleaning control science is possible, but will need new strategies to manage technology change.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to analyse {{clinically}} failed and retrieved implants prior to and after cleaning by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray induced photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as compared to unused controls. Six different chemical and physical techniques <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> of contaminated titanium implants were evaluated: 1) rinsing in absolute ethanol for 10 min, 2) cleaning in ultrasonic baths containing trichloroethylene (TRI) and absolute ethanol, 10 min in each solution, 3) abrasive <b>cleaning</b> <b>for</b> 30 s, 4) cleaning in supersaturated citric acid for 30 s, 5) cleaning with continuous CO 2 -laser in dry conditions at 5 W for 10 s, 6) cleaning with continuous CO 2 -laser in wet conditions (saline) at 5 W for 10 s. SEM of failed implants showed the presence of contaminants of varying sizes and XPS showed almost no titanium but high carbon signals. XPS of unused titanium implants showed lower levels of titanium as previously reported, probably due to contamination of carbon which increased with time in room air. Cleaning of used implants in citric acid followed by rinsing with deionized water for 5 min followed by cleaning in ultrasonic baths with TRI and absolute ethanol gave the best results with regard to macroscopical appearance and surface composition. However, as compared to the unused implants the results from an element composition point of view were still unsatisfactory. It is concluded that further development and <b>testing</b> of techniques <b>for</b> <b>cleaning</b> of organically contaminated titanium is needed. © Munksgaard 1998.
