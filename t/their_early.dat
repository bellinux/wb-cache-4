5|$|Bands {{to emerge}} from other major British cities {{included}} The Animals from Newcastle, Them from Belfast and the Spencer Davis Group and The Moody Blues from Birmingham.

He shot both attackers with his legally owned pistol, killing one of them. The police closed the case as legitimate self-defense six months later and brought charges against the surviving attacker.|$|E
5|$|Pavitra (1894–1969) {{was one of}} <b>their</b> <b>early</b> disciples. Born as Philippe Barbier Saint-Hilaire in Paris. Pavitra {{left some}} very {{interesting}} memoirs of his conversations with them in 1925 and 1926, which were published as Conversations avec Pavitra.|$|E

5|$|There were 10 gunmen, nine of {{whom were}} {{subsequently}} shot dead and one captured by security forces. Witnesses reported that {{they seemed to be}} in <b>their</b> <b>early</b> twenties, wore black T-shirts and jeans, and that they smiled and looked happy as they shot their victims.|$|E
5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to <b>their</b> <b>early</b> appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E

5|$|A {{theory that}} they were {{descendants}} of a 2nd-century chieftain called Kandachaliki Remmanaka, a feudatory of the Andhra Ikshvaku (from an Ikshvaku inscription of the 2nd century) was put forward. This according to Kamath has failed to explain the difference in lineage. The Kandachaliki feudatory call themselves Vashisthiputras of the Hiranyakagotra. The Chalukyas, however, address themselves as Harithiputras of Manavyasagotra in their inscriptions, {{which is the same}} lineage as <b>their</b> <b>early</b> overlords, the Kadambas of Banavasi. This makes them descendants of the Kadambas. The Chalukyas took control of the territory formerly ruled by the Kadambas.|$|E
5|$|After {{releasing}} The Sting (1986) and Electro Reggae (1987) {{as members}} of their Taxi Gang band, Sly and Robbie enlisted Laswell again to work on Rhythm Killers. They recorded the album {{over a period of}} three months at Quad Recording in New York City. Before entering the studio, Sly and Robbie originally had planned music and demos to work with, but scrapped them after Chris Blackwell of Island discouraged the idea. Blackwell wanted the duo to come up with original material at the studio, as they had been known to do since <b>their</b> <b>early</b> years in Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Albert and Victoria {{were shot}} at again on both 29 and 30 May 1842, but were unhurt. The culprit, John Francis, was {{detained}} and condemned to death, {{although he was}} later reprieved. Some of <b>their</b> <b>early</b> unpopularity came about because of their stiffness and adherence to protocol in public, though in private the couple were more easy-going. In early 1844, Victoria and Albert were apart {{for the first time}} since their marriage when he returned to Coburg on the death of his father.|$|E

50|$|The {{discovery}} of Acleistorhinus was far reaching because until the present only Synapida and Diapsida could trace <b>their</b> <b>earliest</b> known members to North America. Now parareptiles can also trace <b>their</b> <b>earliest</b> record {{from the same}} continent. It is very likely that all three major amniote clades Diapsida, Synapsida, and Parareptilia all diverged early during the evolutionary radiation that characterizes much of the Early Permian.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure <b>their</b> <b>early</b> release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 All-Star Game, Paul led the West {{to victory}} with a 20-point and 15 assist performance, earning his first NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award. He {{finished}} the season averaging 16.9 points, 9.7 assists, and 2.4 steals per game, helping the Clippers to a franchise-record 56 wins. Seeded {{fourth in the}} West entering the playoffs, Los Angeles were defeated {{in the first round}} by the Memphis Grizzlies. Shortly after <b>their</b> <b>early</b> postseason exit, the Clippers announced they would not renew coach Vinny Del Negro's contract and rumors arose of Paul forcing Del Negro out. Los Angeles later denied any player involvement in the coaching decision.|$|E
5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced <b>their</b> <b>early</b> caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E
