There has been some reassessment of this view in light of archaeological discoveries of Western Han dynasty tombs at Dingzhou (55 BC) and Shuanggudui (165 BC), but most scholars still believe the work to be a forgery.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} the seminar with an excellent grade, Bruckner was sent as a teacher's assistant {{to a school}} in Windhaag. The living standards and pay were horrible, and Bruckner was constantly humiliated by his superior, teacher Franz Fuchs. Despite the difficult situation, Bruckner never complained or rebelled; a belief of inferiority was to remain one of Bruckner's main personal characteristics during his whole life. He would stay at Windhaag from age 17–19, teaching subjects <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with music.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Girls {{was shot}} on {{videotape}} {{in front of}} a live studio audience. Many episodes of the series followed a similar format or theme. For example, {{one or more of the}} women would become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma. At some point, they would gather around the kitchen table and discuss the problem, sometimes late at night and often while eating cheesecake or some other dessert. One of the other girls then told a story from her own life, which somehow related to the problem (though Rose occasionally regaled a nonsense story <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the situation, and Sophia told outrageous made-up stories). Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous episodes, flashbacks to events not shown in previous episodes, or to events that occurred before the series began. Though the writing was mostly comical, dramatic moments and sentimental endings were included in several episodes. One of the actresses on the show, Bea Arthur, actually hated cheesecake.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Sorge's {{reputation}} in West Germany in the 1950s {{was a highly}} negative one, with Sorge depicted as a traitor working for the Soviet Union {{who was responsible for}} the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Wehrmacht soldiers in the winter of 1941-42. The 1950s were a transition moment in the German memory of Nazi Germany as those Germans who had supported the Third Reich sought a version of history that presented them as victims rather than as followers of Hitler, portrayed Nazism as an aberration in German history that had no connections to traditional Prussian values, portrayed the Wehrmacht as an honorable fighting force <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the Holocaust, and presented the Soviets as guilty of crimes that even more horrific than those committed by the Nazis. Given this way of remembering the Nazi past in the 1950s, Operation Barbarossa and Germany's war in the East were seen as a heroic and legitimate war against the Soviet Union that Germans should not be ashamed of.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the return}} of Black Hawk's band worried U.S. officials, {{they were at the}} time more {{concerned}} {{about the possibility of a}} war among the Native American tribes in the region. Most accounts of the Black Hawk War focus on the conflict between Black Hawk and the United States, but historian John Hall argues that this overlooks the perspective of many Native American participants. According to Hall, [...] "the Black Hawk War also involved an intertribal conflict that had smoldered for decades". Tribes along the Upper Mississippi had long fought for control of diminishing hunting grounds, and the Black Hawk War provided an opportunity for some Natives to resume a war <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Black Hawk.|$|E
500|$|The Giants allowed six {{sacks in}} their week seven 17–12 {{loss to the}} Seattle Seahawks.

Phil Simms threw four interceptions but coach Bill Parcells denied he was struggling, [...] "ou'd like not to take a sack in the scoring zone, but sometimes it's hard {{to know when to}} throw it away. Two of Phil's interceptions were rebounds <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the quarterback.

500|$|The lack {{of record}} sales was {{largely due to}} the fellow punk band Sex Pistols turning people off the genre [...] "with their antisocial behavior," [...] as put by author Brian J. Bowe.

[...] Joey also insisted that the Sex Pistols were partially responsible for the low sale numbers, concluding that before 60 Minutess focused on the Sex Pistols, Rocket to Russia had decent airplay. After this, Joey asserted that [...] "everyone flipped out and then things changed radically. It really kind of screwed things up for ourselves." ...|$|E

500|$|Captain Future was {{a science}} fiction pulp {{magazine}} launched in 1940 by Better Publications, and edited initially by Mort Weisinger. [...] It featured the adventures of Captain Future, a super-scientist whose real name was Curt Newton, in every issue. [...] All {{but two of the}} novels in the magazine were written by Edmond Hamilton; the other two were by Joseph Samachson. [...] The magazine also published other stories <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the title character, including Fredric Brown's first science fiction sale, [...] "Not Yet the End". [...] Captain Future published unabashed space opera, and was, in the words of science fiction historian Mike Ashley, [...] "perhaps the most juvenile" [...] of the science fiction pulps to appear {{in the early years of}} World War II. [...] Wartime paper shortages eventually led to the magazine's cancellation: the last issue was dated Spring 1944.|$|E
500|$|In Taw Cheng Kong, the High Court was of {{the view}} that section 37(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act was both under- and over-inclusive. It {{did not apply to}} non-Singapore {{citizens}} such as permanent residents and foreigners working for the Government who received bribes for acts which would be done in Singapore. On the other hand, it would catch a Singapore citizen now a foreign permanent resident employed in a foreign country by a foreign government who received a bribe in relation to a transaction <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Singapore. For this reason, Karthigesu J. found section 37(1) to be unconstitutional since the nexus between the classification and section 37(1)'s objective was not reasonable enough to justify derogating from Article 12(1). The High Court's decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal, which held that the under-inclusiveness was not fatal because of the [...] "overriding need to observe international ...|$|E
500|$|Shearer was {{unveiled}} {{at a press}} conference the following day by club managing director Derek Llambias. In explaining his acceptance of a managerial role at Newcastle at this time, Shearer stated that he would not have done this for any other club in this position, including his two other previous Premier League clubs. Amid persistent questioning regarding the permanency of the appointment, Llambias announced that Shearer was to be manager for the remaining eight games, and after his recovery, Joe Kinnear would return as manager {{after the end of the}} season. Shearer confirmed that the BBC had agreed to giving him an 8-week sabbatical from his Match of the Day role. Llambias also confirmed Dennis Wise had left his executive role at the club and the club had no plans to appoint a replacement, with Shearer stating that [...] "the people that have moved, were moving on anyways, <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with me". Wise's presence had previously been speculated as being a blockage to any possible appointment of a manager. Shearer accepted the surprise offer on the Monday on the condition that he could bring in Iain Dowie as his assistant. Shearer also brought in Paul Ferris to oversee club medical, physio and dietary matters. Ferris had previously worked with Shearer in his playing days, and had been at the club for 13 years prior to an earlier departure under then manager Glenn Roeder.|$|E
