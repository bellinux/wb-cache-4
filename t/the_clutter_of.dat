40|$|The {{problem of}} {{optimising}} the target detection performance of MIMO radar in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>clutter</b> is considered. <b>The</b> increased false alarm rate {{which is a}} consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>clutter</b> returns is known to seriously degrade the target detection performance of the radar target detector, especially under low SNR conditions.

[...] Mark Holborn, in his introduction to Ancient and Modern writes about the dark undercurrent of these mundane scenes as viewed through Eggleston's lens: [...] " [...] subjects are, on the surface, the ordinary inhabitants and environs of suburban Memphis and Mississippi—friends, family, barbecues, back yards, a tricycle and <b>the</b> <b>clutter</b> <b>of</b> the mundane.

2500|$|The Typhoon {{was first}} {{produced}} with forward-opening [...] "car door" [...] style cockpit doors (complete with wind-down windows), with a transparent [...] "roof" [...] hinged to {{open to the}} left. The first 162 Typhoons featured a built-up metal-skinned dorsal fairing behind the pilot's armoured headrest; the mast for the radio aerial protruded through the fairing. From mid- to late 1941 the solid metal aft dorsal fairing was replaced with a transparent structure (later nicknamed [...] "The Coffin Hood"), the pilot's head armour plate was modified to a triangular shape and the side cut-outs were fitted with armoured glass; the first production Typhoon to be fitted with this new structure was R7803. All earlier aircraft were quickly withdrawn and modified. From early 1942 a rear-view mirror was mounted in a perspex blister moulded into the later [...] "car-door" [...] canopy roofs. This modification was not very successful, because the mirror was subject to vibration. Despite the new canopy structure, the pilot's visibility was still restricted by the heavy frames and <b>the</b> <b>clutter</b> <b>of</b> equipment under the rear canopy; from August 1943, as an interim measure, pending {{the introduction of the}} new [...] "bubble" [...] canopy and cut-down dorsal fairing, the aerial mast and its associated bracing was removed and replaced with a whip aerial further back on the rear fuselage.|$|E

She would have yet time to reach the stockade and secure what was left of her treasures before they came up and drove her away. Yet she had to make a long circuit to avoid the blacksmith's shop and cabin, before she saw the stockade, lifting its four-foot walls around an inclosure a dozen feet square, in the midst of a manzanita thicket. But she could see also broken coops, pens, cages, and boxes lying before it, and stopped once, even in her grief and indignation, to pick up a ruby-throated lizard, one of its late inmates that had stopped in the trail, stiffened to stone at her approach. The next moment she was before the roofless walls, and then stopped, stiffened like the lizard. For out of that peaceful ruin which had once held the wild and untamed vagabonds of earth and sky, arose a type of savagery and barbarism the child had never before looked upon,--the head and shoulders of a hunted, desperate man! ...|$|E

Your hand like Dingley's, you scambling,(17) {{scattering}} sluttikin! YES, MIGHTY LIKE INDEED, IS NOT IT?(18) Pisshh, do not talk of writing or reading till your eyes are well, and long well; only I would have Dingley read sometimes to you, that you may not lose the desire of it. God be thanked, that the ugly numbing is gone! Pray use exercise when you go to town. What game is that ombra which Dr. Elwood(19) and you play at? is it the Spanish game ombre? Your card-purse? you a card-purse! you a fiddlestick. You have luck indeed; and luck in a bag. What a devil! is that eight-shilling tea-kettle copper, or tin japanned? It is like your Irish politeness, raffling for tea-kettles. What a splutter you keep, to convince me that Walls has no taste! My head continues pretty well. Why do you write, dear sirrah Stella, when you find your eyes so weak that you cannot see? what comfort is there in reading what you write, when one knows that? So Dingley cannot write, because of <b>the</b> <b>clutter</b> <b>of</b> new company come to Wexford! I suppose the noise of their hundred horses disturbs you; or do you lie in one gallery, as in an hospital? What! you are afraid of losing in Dublin the acquaintance you have got in Wexford, and chiefly the Bishop of Raphoe,(20) an old, doting, perverse coxcomb? Twenty at a time at breakfast. That is like five pounds at a time, when it was never but once. I doubt, Madam Dingley, you are apt to lie in your travels, though not so bad as Stella; she tells thumpers, as I shall prove in my next, if I find this receives encouragement.--So Dr. Elwood says there are a world of pretty things in my works. A pox on his praises! an enemy here would say more.

Spatio- temporal adaptive processing (STAP) helps to remove <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>clutter</b> by exploiting Doppler spread. <b>The</b> modeling requirements <b>of</b> <b>clutter</b> for spatio-temporal adaptive processing are considered in this study.

Letting A(P) be the Ehrhart ring of P = conv(A), we {{are able}} to show that if A is <b>the</b> <b>clutter</b> matrix <b>of</b> a uniform, unmixed MFMC clutter C, then C is an Ehrhart clutter and in this case we provide sharp bounds on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of A(P). Motivated by the Conforti-Cornuéjols conjecture on packing problems, we conjecture that if C is both ideal and <b>the</b> clique <b>clutter</b> <b>of</b> a perfect graph, then C has the MFMC property. We prove this conjecture for Meyniel graphs, by showing that <b>the</b> clique <b>clutters</b> <b>of</b> Meyniel graphs are Ehrhart <b>clutters.</b> In much <b>the</b> same spirit, we provide a simple proof of our conjecture when C is a uniform clique <b>clutter</b> <b>of</b> a perfect graph.

60|$|My {{visit to}} the Roman Forum when the Genius Loci {{verified}} to my ignorance and the intelligence of my companions the well-conjectured site of the Temple of Jupiter Stator {{was not the first}} nor yet the second visit I had paid the place. There had been intermediate mornings when I met two friends there, indefinitely more instructed, with whom I sauntered from point to point, preying upon their knowledge for my emotion concerning each. Information is an excellent thing--in others; and but for these friends I should not now {{be able to say that}} this mouldering heap of brickwork, rather than that, was Julius Caesar's house; or just where it was that Antony made his oration over the waxen effigy which served him for Caesar's body. They helped me realize how the business life and largely the social life of Rome centred in the Forum, but spared me so much detail that my fancy could play about among its vanished edifices without inconvenience from <b>the</b> <b>clutter</b> <b>of</b> shops and courts and monuments which were ultimately to hem it in and finally to stifle it. They knew their Forum so well that they could not only gratify any curiosity I had, but could supply me with curiosity when I had none. For the moment I was aware that this spot or that, though it looked so improbable, was the scene of deeds which will reverberate forever; they taught me to be tolerant of what I had too lightly supposed fables as serious traditions closely verging on facts. I learned to believe again that the wolf suckled Romulus and Remus, because she had her den no great way off on the Palatine, and that Romulus himself had really lived, since he had died and was buried in the Forum, where they showed me his tomb, or as much of it as I could imagine in the sullen little cellar so called. They also showed me the rostrum where the Roman orators addressed the mass-meetings of the republican times, and they showed me the lake, or the puddle left of it, into which Curtius (or one of three heroes of the name) leaped at an earlier day as a specific for the pestilence which the medical science of the period had failed to control. In our stroll about the place we were joined by one of the several cats living in the Forum, which offered us collectively its acquaintance, as if wishing to make us feel at home. It joined us and it quitted us from time to time, as the whim took it, but it did not abandon us wholly till we showed a disposition to believe in that lake of Curtius, so called after those three public-spirited heroes, the first being a foreigner. Then the cat, which had more than once stretched itself as if bored, turned from us in contempt and went and lay down in a sunny corner near the tomb of Romulus, and fell asleep.|$|E
