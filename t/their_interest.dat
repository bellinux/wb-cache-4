5|$|Campbell {{was sent}} out on loan {{again in the}} 2007–08 season, this time at Hull City in the Championship. He {{initially}} joined Hull in October 2007 on loan until January 2008, and scored twice on his home debut in a 3–0 victory over Barnsley. Following his match-winning display against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Boxing Day 2007, in which he scored one goal and assisted another, Hull expressed <b>their</b> <b>interest</b> in extending Campbell's loan {{until the end of}} the season. The loan extension was completed on 28 December 2007.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis {{ended the}} season having been {{named in the}} PFA's League One Team of the Year, and with Charlton Athletic expressing <b>their</b> <b>interest</b> in him.

5|$|Meanwhile, other European powers {{had decided}} that it was not in <b>their</b> <b>interest</b> that any one power should {{dominate}} the Baltic Sea. After long negotiations, known as the first Concert of the Hague, England sent a large fleet of 43 ships with more than 2,000 cannons. The force did not directly participate in fighting but nevertheless sent a clear message to the Dutch fleet patrolling the Danish waters. England worked hard to broker a peace, aided by France which also declared its willingness to help the Swedes if the Danes refused to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|Not long thereafter, the film-directing team of Dan Pița and Mircea Veroiu {{found that}} Agârbiceanu's short stories {{supplied}} ideal material for <b>their</b> <b>interest</b> in formal experimentation, leading to two films, each {{based on a}} pair of his stories: Nunta de piatră (1972) and Duhul aurului (1974). In 1988, Nicolae Mărgineanu and Ion Brad also filmed their version of Arhanghelii, as Flames over Treasures.|$|E
5|$|Others who {{expressed}} <b>their</b> <b>interest</b> in running included Texas representatives Bill Flores and Michael McCaul, Georgia representative Lynn Westmoreland, Montana representative Ryan Zinke, and California representative and former Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa. However, several candidates {{made clear that}} they would only run if Ryan chose not to, including Issa, McCaul, and Minnesota representative John Kline. On October 12, Flores confirmed that he would run for Speaker, but stated that he would run only if Ryan {{stayed out of the}} contest.|$|E

5|$|Switzerland did {{not possess}} {{biological}} weapons nor chemical weapons, {{nor did they}} see it as in <b>their</b> <b>interest</b> to acquire them. Thus the banning of such weapons was in the country's interest. Switzerland signed the Biological Weapons Convention in April 1972 and ratified the treaty in 1976 with three reservations. The country also signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in January 1993 and ratified it in March 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Fragrant Hill Hotel {{opened on}} 17 October 1982 but quickly fell into disrepair. A member of Pei's staff {{returned}} for a visit several years later and confirmed the dilapidated condition of the hotel. He and Pei attributed this to the country's general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings. The Chinese architectural community at the time gave the structure little attention, as <b>their</b> <b>interest</b> at the time centered {{on the work of}} American postmodernists such as Michael Graves.|$|E

During World War II, services were continued, but in the spring of 1944 hooligans broke into the church and destroyed the altar with the altarpiece, the organ, the chairs and the windows. In 1946, the congregation asked the Soviet government to list the Cathedral as a protected historical monument, but it failed to raise <b>their</b> <b>interest.</b> The church was empty for years; for some time it was used for storing grain, even plans for turning it into a swimming-pool were made.|$|E

5|$|The patrons {{ensured that}} cricket was financed in the 18th century but <b>their</b> <b>interest,</b> equally {{applicable}} to horse racing and prizefighting, {{was based on}} the opportunities that cricket provided for gambling. Every important match in the 18th century, whether eleven-a-side or single wicket, was played for stakes. The early newspapers recognised this and were more interested in publishing the odds than the match scores. Reports would say who won the wager rather than who won the match.|$|E

5|$|The spell in Turkey, however, {{proved to}} be an unhappy time for Babangida and the Ankara side chose no to pursue <b>their</b> <b>interest</b> in the player once the loan deal expired. Looking for a move away from Netherlands, Babangida came close to signing with AJ Auxerre, but {{received}} a last-minute call from Ronald Koeman and agreed to join him at Vitesse instead. Another loan move followed. First team player under Koeman, Babangida subsequently lost his place in the starting line-up, when Ronald Koeman left for Ajax and was replaced by Edward Sturing.|$|E
5|$|Tourism has {{now become}} the town's main industry. Initially {{attracted}} by its associations with the Skagen Painters, well-to-do visitors sought to benefit from its special light, colour and its fishermen. <b>Their</b> <b>interest</b> led to new hotels, summer houses and expensive villas. The old fishing village {{was transformed into a}} miniature city with fine streets lined with boutiques. From the 1960s, it became increasingly fashionable for the upper-classes to spend their summers in Skagen.|$|E

5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in <b>their</b> <b>interest</b> to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|According to Pyun, {{the idea}} of Max Havoc has existed since at least 2001. At the time, {{he was asked to}} direct the film in Hawaii. After the September 11 attacks, it was decided that filming in Miami was more {{economically}} viable. Pyun said that Hawaiian film star Mark Dacascos was interested in playing the character of Max Havoc, but that he backed out after anthrax appeared in Florida. Bali was considered next for filming but the idea was abandoned after the terrorist bombing there in 2002. The director and producer settled on filming on Guam, voicing <b>their</b> <b>interest</b> to Guam officials in late 2003. Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon {{was supposed to be the}} first of two films to act as a backdoor pilot into a Max Havoc television series.|$|E

In 1957, the year before her death, Ninah announced that her gifts would “make only a small beginning toward a large vision” and hoped “that others will share this vision and by <b>their</b> <b>interest</b> and contributions will help establish here a center of beauty and culture worthy of the community.” She created the DeEtte Holden Cummer Museum Foundation, named for the deceased infant daughter of the Cummers, to manage her vision after her death.|$|E
