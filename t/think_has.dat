5|$|While {{previous}} {{games in}} the series focus on defense attorneys, Ace Attorney Investigations has the player control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, who investigates five cases that tie together to form an overarching story about a smuggling ring. The game consists of investigation phases, in which the player investigates crime scenes in search for evidence, and rebuttal phases, in which they confront other characters, to hear what they <b>think</b> <b>has</b> happened; the player is able to use evidence to find contradictions in the characters' statements, {{to get closer to}} the truth.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, ABC—which {{had become}} the top-rated {{television}} network in the United States—began looking for stronger affiliates across the country. KMSP-TV (channel 9), the Twin Cities' ABC affiliate since 1961, had long struggled in the ratings. ABC had approached independent station WTCN-TV (channel 11, now KARE), CBS affiliate WCCO-TV (channel 4), and KSTP-TV to affiliate with the network. Channel 5 surprised the industry in August 1978 by announcing its intention to sever ties with third-place NBC after 30 years to join ABC. The affiliation switch occurred on March 5, 1979 and was ABC's biggest coup at the time. “We {{want to go into}} the 1980s in a leadership position with a network which we <b>think</b> <b>has</b> the management, team and depth to be the best. That's ABC. We're just absolutely thrilled,” said KSTP's Stanley S. Hubbard, son of station founder Stanley E. Hubbard. In 2000, Hubbard Broadcasting purchased independent station KVBM-TV (channel 45; now KSTC), creating Minnesota's first commercial television station duopoly (though there is a longstanding public television duopoly: KTCA/KTCI).|$|E

We will, in our own way, try to continue the Bond series for the audience because it's too important".|$|E

Here [...] response is a human one. We can stop a genocide. I think that that's something that Bill Clinton apologized for not doing with Rwanda and we centered a show around that." ...|$|E

Alphonse Salamone similarly remarked that [...] "Claude Philippe brought an ingredient to this industry that I don't <b>think</b> <b>has</b> been surpassed".

500|$|In 2006, The A.V. Club {{included}} Planescape: Torment {{in their}} list of [...] "11 of Video Gaming's Strangest Moments", due to the game's use of death {{as a means to}} advance the plot. In 2006, Gamasutra polled video game industry professionals with the question: [...] "Which role playing game over the entire history of the genre do you <b>think</b> <b>has</b> made the biggest 'quantum leap', and why?". Planescape: Torment was ranked second overall after Fallout, earning it a [...] "Quantum Leap Award". The game also received an honorable mention for the same awards in the [...] "Storytelling" [...] category. In December 2008, IGN listed it as 8th out of 10 in a list of [...] "Franchises We Want Resurrected" [...] and praised the game as having [...] "some of the best writing and characterization seen in gaming".|$|E
500|$|NBC {{ordered a}} four-episode second season, {{which would be}} {{broadcast}} in January 1994 as a mid-year replacement. A decision about whether to renew the show for a [...] would then be made based on how those four episodes performed in the ratings. David P. Kalat, author of Homicide: Life on the Street [...] The Unofficial Companion, credited NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield with that move, although Levinson claimed NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer was behind the decision. Ohlmeyer said he believed a better timeslot, less dense stories and less hand-held photography would attract more viewers and help the show succeed better: [...] "For it to succeed long-term, there's a humanity {{that needs to be}} brought to the characters. There's more here than there was last year." [...] Littlefield said of Homicide, [...] "It's a show we <b>think</b> <b>has</b> tremendous potential that was not fully realized in the first nine episodes.

500|$|On Slant Magazines [...] "Best of the Aughts" [...] list, {{the album}} was placed at numbersix out of one-hundred. Reflecting on the album's reception, Chater felt it was well {{received}} because [...] "It's light-hearted and fun to listen to and there is depth there as well. There are some sadder moments that I <b>think</b> <b>has</b> made it resonate and made it last. It does sound like a 23 year old kid in his bedroom making a record to me, but you can hear that innocence and joy in the discovery of finding all those sounds. So {{that was kind of}} infectious for people." [...] In October 2010, it was listed at No.10 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. Philip Sherburne, writing for Rhapsody, said that [...] "along with DJ Shadow's Endtroducing, this is one of plunderphonic music's greatest LPs." [...] The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|The third pod of {{the season}} [...] "ties {{together}} [...] thematically", taking the characters into the virtual world of the Framework, where their lives {{are different from the}} real world. This explores [...] "what if" [...] scenarios for many of the characters by showing who they may have been if a major regret of their life was changed, hence the pod's title, Agents of Hydra. This continues the season's focus on the nature of identity and reality, having [...] "payoff to all the reflection on the past" [...] such as Mack's tragic loss of his daughter and Fitz's troubled relationship with his father. Bennet called the pod [...] "very relevant. It's definitely a theme that I <b>think</b> <b>has</b> been kind of hopping around in pop culture at the moment. But it's kind of like a fun Marvel take on that. For all those people who wished to see these characters in a different light, {{this is going to be}} the time for that to happen."

2500|$|Aristotle {{says that}} the intellect (nous), the ability to <b>think,</b> <b>has</b> no bodily organ (in {{contrast}} with other psychological abilities, such as sense-perception and imagination). In fact, he {{says that it is}} not mixed with the body and suggests that it can exist apart from the body. This seems to contradict Aristotle's claim that the soul is a form or property of the body. To complicate matters further, Aristotle distinguishes between two kinds of intellect or two parts of the intellect. These two intellectual powers are traditionally called the [...] "passive intellect" [...] and the [...] "active intellect" [...] or [...] "agent intellect". Thus, interpreters of Aristotle have faced the problem of explaining how the intellect fits into Aristotle's hylomorphic theory of the soul.|$|E
