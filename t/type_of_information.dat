5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E

An experimental {{study was conducted to}} examine three different variables: perceived wait duration, acceptability of the wait and affective response to the wait, as mediators between the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and service evaluation. Results of the study show that the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> do not only reduce the uncertainty of the wait, but also facilitate the reappraisal of the wait as more acceptable to consumers. The latter effect also resulted in a cross-over effect <b>of</b> the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on service evaluation with different lengths of wait...|$|R

This study uses a mixed method with sequential exploratory design and data collection research procedures using surveys, depth interviews, and documents. The validation data use source of triangulation techniques. The subjects of this study was divided into 2 (two) information assembling that is government bureaucracy and public Kupang determined by purposive. The results of this research showed that Kupang Goverment bureaucracy has 22 <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> perception (33, 85 %) in category information which is open and 42 <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> (64, 62 %) in category information that are closed while the public perceives 29 <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> (44, 62 %) in category information which is open and 26 <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> (40 %) in the category <b>of</b> <b>information</b> that are closed.

25|$|Semantic {{memory is}} also {{discussed}} {{in reference to}} modality. Different components represent information from different sensorimotor channels.

25|$|Another {{important}} {{example of}} emergence in web-based systems is social bookmarking (also called collaborative tagging). In social bookmarking systems, users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which {{gives rise to}} a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process. Recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge, {{even in the absence of}} a central controlled vocabulary. Some believe that this could be because users who contribute tags all use the same language, and they share similar semantic structures underlying the choice of words. The convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures as people who have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information, a process called semantic imitation.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War on December 7, 1941, Allied Forces had little or no concrete knowledge about Japanese aircraft and their performance capabilities. The air war over China had been in full swing for over four years, little attempt had been made by Allied Intelligence agencies to learn very much about the Japanese equipment, tactics and potential. Due to severe cuts in military funding following WWI, intelligence units had not been developed for gathering and disseminating this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> and the bulk of concern was placed on Hitler's growing airpower and conquests in Europe. Once the US was involved in the War with Japan, there was a frantic effort to fill this information void. There was no meaningful list of Japanese aircraft types, and no way to identify these aircraft when encountered in combat. During this period, every single-engine Japanese fighter was identified as a Zero, and anything else was called a Mitsubishi or a Nakajima.|$|E
25|$|Spanish wine laws {{created the}} Denominación de Origen (DO) system in 1932 and were later revised in 1970. The system shares many {{similarities}} with the hierarchical Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) system of France, Portugal's Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) and Italy's Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) system. As of 2009, there were 79 Quality Wine areas across Spain. In addition there is Denominación de Origen Calificada (DOCa or DOQ in Catalan) status for DOs {{that have a}} consistent track record for quality. There are currently two DOCa/DOQ regions: Rioja and Priorat. Each DO has a Consejo Regulador, which acts as a governing control body that enforces the DO regulations and standards involving viticultural and winemaking practices. These regulations govern everything from the types of grapes that are permitted to be planted, the maximum yields that can be harvested, the minimum length of time that the wine must be aged and what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is required {{to appear on the}} wine label. Wineries that are seeking to have their wine sold under DO or DOC status must submit their wines to the Consejo Regulador laboratory and tasting panel for testing and evaluation. Wines that have been granted DO/DOC status will feature the regional stamp of the Consejo Regulador on the label.|$|E

500|$|... 2. The {{married life}} of Pinchwife and Margery {{is based on}} Molière's School For Husbands (1661) and School For Wives (1662). Pinchwife is a middle-aged man who has married a naive country girl {{in the hope that}} she will not know to cuckold him. However, Horner teaches her, and Margery cuts a swath through the {{complexities}} of London upper-class marriage and seduction without even noticing them. Restoration comedies often contrast town and country for humorous effect, and this is one example of it. Both Molière in the School For Wives and Wycherley in The Country Wife get much comic business out of the meeting between, on the one hand, innocent but inquisitive young girls and, on the other hand, the sophisticated 17th-century culture of sexual relations which they encounter. The difference, which would later make Molière acceptable and Wycherley atrocious to 19th-century critics and theatre producers, is that Molière's Agnes is naturally pure and virtuous, while Margery is just the opposite: enthusiastic about the virile handsomeness of town gallants, rakes, and especially theatre actors, she keeps Pinchwife in a state of continual horror with her plain-spokenness and her interest in sex. A running joke is the way Pinchwife's pathological jealousy always leads him into supplying Margery with the very <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> he wishes her not to have.|$|E
