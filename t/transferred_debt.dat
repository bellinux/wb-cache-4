Theory predicts that this transfer can create empty creditors {{that do not}} fully internalize liquidation costs and liquidate borrowers excessively often. This empty creditor problem is concentrated in firms whose creditors would face powerful shareholders in distressed debt renegotiations. Consistent with this prediction, we show that (1) creditors buy more CDS protection when facing strong shareholders, and that (2) CDS trading reduces the distance-to-default, investment, and value of firms with powerful shareholders.

However, many Southerners proved unwilling to <b>transfer</b> their <b>debt</b> obligations. Furthermore, what exactly constituted [...] "Northern property" [...] proved hard to define in practice. As a result, the share of this source of revenue in government funding never exceeded 0.34% and ultimately contributed only 0.25% to the overall financial war effort.|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} an OLG model with network effects to examine skill obsolescence when individuals can choose technological vintages. In {{the absence of}} transfer payments, some regions of the parameter space have unique stationary equilibria, others have unique cyclical equilibria, and others have multiple stationary equilibria. All equilibria are Pareto efficient. However, “rat race” equilibria can exist in which all agents currently alive prefer a slower rate of progress than occurs in equilibrium. When contemporaneous transfers are allowed, equilibria are unique everywhere, but a cycle still exists, and a rat race can still arise in equilibrium. Allowing intertemporal <b>transfers</b> (<b>debt)</b> ensures that all equilibria are stationary. In the relevant parameter range, the introduction of debt can eliminate cycles and increase the long-run growth rate. No rat race equilibria exist when debt is allowed.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern that governments lose {{substantial}} corporate tax revenue because of profit shifting through transfer-pricing and thin-capitalization strategies. Existing literature studies profit shifting and transfer pricing separately. In practice, the choice of debt-to-asset ratios in affiliates and the <b>transfer</b> price of <b>debt</b> are interrelated management decisions that are also mutually affected by government regulation. This paper models these strategies as intertwined. We find that the tax sensitivity of the corporate tax base depends on whether the <b>debt</b> shifting and <b>transfer</b> pricing are cost complements or substitutes. A second result is that stricter regulation of <b>debt</b> shifting (<b>transfer</b> pricing) can potentially increase the use of <b>transfer</b> pricing (<b>debt</b> shifting) and thus the amount of profits shifted...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} developments in international credit markets {{in recent years has been}} the trade in Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO), which has enabled financial institu-tions to repackage the credit risk of an asset portfolio into tranches to be transferred to inves-tors. The present paper evaluates the credit risk of such a portfolio and the related tranches by applying two prominent prototypes for credit ratings namely the point-in-time and through-the-cycle approach. The central parameters default probability and correlation are forecast for multiple years and related forecasting errors included. The article’s main findings are that banks which <b>transfer</b> <b>debt</b> tranches but retain an equity part and apply a through-the-cycle rating approach may be exposed to higher insolvency risk. Firstly, the credit risk retained may be underestimated resulting in an inadequate capital allocation. Secondly, the credit risk trans-ferred may be overestimated resulting in additional risk-based transfer costs...|$|R

The objectives of this study were to investigate North Dakota farmers' plans regarding business expansion, timing of expansion, and expected financing of that business expansion and to analyze their risk management strategies.

40|$|This paper studies {{financial}} contracting in a two-period financing {{model with}} double moral hazard, as entrepreneurial effort choices and profits are unobservable and non-verifiable. The optimal financial contract must induce both the high effort level and truthful revelation of profits. The paper further analyses {{the structure of}} the optimal contract where the entrepreneur's payoff takes a general functional form that allows for endogenously determined costs of effort. The entrepreneur's performance is influenced by not only extrinsic work motivation factors but also intrinsic factors so that the degree of control imposed by the investor, in the form of end-of-period transfers, affects the entrepreneur's costs of effort. The finding shows that under well-defined conditions, the optimal contract that solves a model with non-verifiable profits also elicits effort, and generally resembles a simple debt contract. The structure of the optimal contract is robust in the general case where the entrepreneur's payoff function is non-linear in <b>transfers.</b> <b>Debt</b> contracts Moral hazard Unobservable profits Hidden effort Endogenous costs of effort...|$|R
5000|$|Hayes' {{analysis}} {{also noted}} {{issues with the}} way that bankruptcy and debt-shifting are addressed. DA's pamphlet, Debt Payment, explains that bankruptcy is an [...] "outside issue," [...] an issue on which DA has no opinion. The pamphlet elaborates, however, that some DA members found bankruptcy only provided a [...] "quick fix" [...] and did not correct the underlying issues causing them to incur unsecured debt. The pamphlet also notes other DA members believe bankruptcy is a proper course of action in some situations. Debt-shifting is the practice of <b>transferring</b> <b>debt</b> from one creditor to another {{in order to get}} a lower interest rate or otherwise make it easier to repay the debt. Debt-shifting is not discussed in official DA literature, although it is discussed in an unofficial auxiliary book based on DA principles. Because DA does not take an official position on bankruptcy and debt-shifting, some groups take stronger positions on these topics than others which can alienate potential members.|$|R

25|$|Though {{nothing new}} to the {{economic}} history of Argentina, he is often accused of implementing financial policies that may have allowed Argentina's main private enterprises to <b>transfer</b> their <b>debts</b> to the state, transforming their private debt into public obligations. During 1982 and 1983, more than 200 firms (30 economic groups and 106 transnational enterprises) transferred {{a great part of}} their 17 billion dollar debt to the federal government, thanks to secured exchange rates on loan installments. This fraud took place both before and after his very brief turn at the Central Bank, but not while he was in charge. In a speech in September 1982 he was forced renounce and express his opposition to the <b>transfer</b> of <b>debt</b> to the state. He inherited this practice from Martínez de Hoz himself (whose chief interest, steelmaker Acindar, had unloaded US$700 million of its debts in this way). Moreover, Cavallo subjected payments covered by these exchange rate guarantees to indexation; this latter stipulation was dropped by his successor, Julio González del Solar. In either case, the mechanism turning private debt into liabilities of the state continued even after the advent of democracy under Raúl Alfonsín (1983–89) and into the economic crisis that surrounded the peso's last sharp devaluation in early 2002.|$|R
