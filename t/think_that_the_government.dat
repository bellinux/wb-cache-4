Only about 5% of respondents said that water supply was among the ten most important issues that the government should address, even though 60% <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> is handling the issue badly. The survey also monitored instances of corruption in the sub-sector: 15% of urban and 11% of rural respondents reported that they had to pay a bribe, give a gift or do a favour to government officials to get water or sanitation services in the past year.|$|E

60|$|Be {{that as it}} may, I do {{not think}} that any {{unbiased}} traveler will doubt that the best possible selection has been made, presuming always, as we may presume in the discussion, that Montreal could not be selected. I take for granted that the rejection of Montreal was regarded as a sine qua non in the decision. To me it appears grievous that this should have been so. It is a great thing for any country to have a large, leading, world-known city, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> should combine with the commerce of the country in carrying out this object. But commerce can do a great deal more for government than government can do for commerce. Government has selected Ottawa as the capital of Canada; but commerce has already made Montreal the capital, and Montreal will be the chief city of Canada, let government do what it may to foster the other town. The idea of spiting a town because there has been a row in it {{seems to me to be}} preposterous. The row was not the work of those who have made Montreal rich and respectable. Montreal is more centrical than Ottawa--nay, it is as nearly centrical as any town can be. It is easier to get to Montreal from Toronto than to Ottawa; and if from Toronto, then from all that distant portion of Upper Canada back of Toronto. To all Lower Canada Montreal is, as a matter of course, much easier of access than Ottawa. But having said so much in favor of Montreal, I will again admit that, putting aside Montreal, the best possible selection has been made.|$|E

40|$|Modern American {{society is}} pervasively regulated. It is also religiously diverse {{to a degree}} that is {{probably}} unprecedented {{in the history of the}} world. It is inevitable that some of these diverse religious practices will violate some of these pervasive regulations, and equally inevitable that if we ask whether all these regulations are really necessary, sometimes the answer will be no. If we take free exercise of religion seriously, sometimes it will make sense to exempt sincere religious practices from generally applicable laws - but only some laws, and only some applications. Hardly anyone <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> human sacrifice should be exempted from the murder laws. And hardly anyone <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> should compel Catholics to ordain female priests, or forbid children to take a sip of communion wine. Other cases provoke more disagreement. Who should decide, and on what criteria? The legal claim in God vs. <b>the</b> Gavel is <b>that</b> only legislatures may decide, and that judges may not. The legislature must enact specific rules for religious exemptions; it may not enact religious exemptions under a generally applicable standard to be interpreted by judges. Professor Marci Hamilton briefly argues for this claim in Chapter Ten...|$|R

30|$|Looking at {{the other}} effects in Table 2, {{we can see that}} natives’ {{attitude}} has a positive effect on <b>the</b> attitude towards <b>government</b> responsibility for <b>the</b> old, the unemployed, and redistribution. This shows that natives’ attitudes affect the attitudes of the Russian diaspora and migrants, except towards responsibility for the sick. Regarding age, it appears <b>that</b> <b>the</b> youngest are in favour of less <b>government</b> responsibility for <b>the</b> old, the unemployed, and redistribution, similar to what was reported in Fig. 2 above. The pattern is, however, not as clear-cut as above, possibly because including other composition effects captures some {{of the differences between the}} age groups. Religiosity only has a significant effect on attitudes towards redistribution. The effect here is positive, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> more religious someone is, the more he or she <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> is responsible for income redistribution (Kahl, 2005). Income does not affect opinion about role of <b>the</b> <b>government</b> in providing for the old, but affects the other three attitudes. Here the pattern is, not surprisingly, that those who belong to the higher income quantiles see a smaller role for <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> This is in line with classic class-based arguments regarding the role of the welfare state in society (Svallfors, Kulin, & Schnabel, 2012).

5000|$|The {{question}} of whether the government should intervene or not in the regulation of the cyberspace is a very polemical one. Indeed, {{for as long as it}} has existed and by definition, the cyberspace is a virtual space free of any government intervention.

R. Clarke said during a panel discussion at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco, he believes that the [...] "industry only responds when you threaten regulation.
