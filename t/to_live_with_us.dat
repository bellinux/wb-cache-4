2500|$|Tan Kim Ching {{introduced}} Abdullah to William Henry Macleod Read (W. H. M. Read) and Read in turn introduced Abdullah to Sir Henry Ord {{on the eve}} of Ord's retirement as Governor of the Straits Settlements. A {{letter was}} drafted by Tan and Read on Abdullah's behalf to new incoming Governor Sir Andrew Clarke seeking British recognition of Abdullah as ruler of Perak, British protection and the provision of [...] "a man of sufficient abilities <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> in Perak[...]. and show us a good system of government for our dominions[...]." ...|$|E

6000|$|And, {{had it been}} thy lot <b>to</b> <b>live</b> [...] <b>With</b> <b>us</b> who now {{behold the}} light, [...] Thou would'st have nobly stirr'd thyself, [...] And battled for the Right.|$|R

6000|$|... 'He's not a nasty brute, mother. He's my dog, and his name's Fido. John {{ran over}} {{him in the}} car, and I brought him home <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> I love him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Albe't," [...] she concluded; [...] "I {{wish we had}} her <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> Yes, I do! I {{wonder if}} we could get her to. You know I always did want to adopt a baby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What, the mater's {{offering}} for you <b>to</b> {{come and}} <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> darling? Oh no; and I's afraid {{it is of}} no use to ask her, for she said of herself, that she knew Mr. Mohun had sisters, and--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You artful scheming creature! We {{have some}} spare rooms. Suppose we ask Mrs. Mackenzie <b>to</b> come and <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> my dear? {{and we could}} then {{have the benefit of}} the {{garrison}} anecdotes, and mess jocularities of your favourite, Captain Goby." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, dearest. What my aunt {{offers to}} you is a very great step in life. If you can accept this gentleman I think you would be happy;--and I think, also, which should be of more {{importance}} for your consideration, that you would make him happy. It is a brighter prospect, dear Dolly, than <b>to</b> <b>live</b> either <b>with</b> <b>us</b> at Nuncombe, or even with Aunt Stanbury as her niece." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I rather liked that. At {{least she}} isn't a rattle-pate. And we shall get acquainted; we shall like each other. She will {{understand}} {{me when you}} bring her home here <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{have such}} {{good news to}} tell you! Grandpapa is so good and kind, and grampa is going <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> and you are to come up, too, and James {{is to go to}} school. Isn't it all splendid?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's middling," [...] said Barker, [...] "but my married {{sister that}} came <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> since you was there {{has had a}} good deal of {{sickness}} in her family. Her husband's laid up with the rheumatism most of the time." ...|$|E
60|$|We had {{no trouble}} in getting a boarder, for we had a friend, {{a young man who}} was engaged in the flour business, who was very anxious <b>to</b> come and <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> He had been to see us two or three times, and had {{expressed}} himself charmed with our household arrangements.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] said he, [...] "that this is {{a strange}} girl of mine?" [...] She {{positively}} refuses <b>to</b> come and <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> We had counted upon having her, and had made all our arrangements for it. She is as good and nice as she can be, {{but we can not}} move her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Isabel, though, as I said to thee before, my cousin, Miss Tartan, that strange, and willful, nun-like girl, {{is at all}} hazards, mystically {{resolved}} <b>to</b> {{come and}} <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> yet it must be quite impossible that her friends can approve in her such a singular step; a step even more singular, Isabel, than thou, in thy unsophisticatedness, can'st at all imagine. I shall be immensely deceived if they do not, to their very utmost, strive against it. Now what I am going to add may be quite unnecessary, but I can not avoid speaking it, for all that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How is this?" [...] cried Middleton; [...] "did you not say, Inez, {{that this}} {{excellent}} {{young woman was}} to accompany us, and <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> {{for the remainder of}} her life; or, at least, until she found some more agreeable residence for herself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No need {{to trouble}} him, Margaret. He has given it already. His great desire {{is that we}} should marry, for he seeks to leave this trade and <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> in the Vale of Dedham, in Essex, where he has bought back my father's land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no explanation, Delly; {{and from}} you, I must have no amazement. My cousin,--mind, my cousin, Miss Tartan, is coming <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> The next room to this, {{on the other}} side there, is unoccupied. That room shall be hers. You must wait upon her, too, Delly." ...|$|E
5|$|Ruby Laffoon (January 15, 1869March 1, 1941) was an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} the 43rd Governor of Kentucky from 1931 to 1935. A Kentucky native, at age 17 Laffoon moved to Washington, D.C., <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> his uncle, <b>U.S.</b> Representative Polk Laffoon. He developed an interest in politics and returned to Kentucky, where he compiled a mixed record of victories and defeats in elections at the county and state levels. In 1931, he was chosen as the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by a nominating convention, not a primary, making him the only Kentucky gubernatorial candidate to be chosen by a convention after 1903. In the general election, he defeated Republican William B. Harrison by what was then the largest margin of victory in Kentucky gubernatorial history.|$|R
5|$|In 1886, Laffoon {{moved to}} Washington, D.C. <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> his uncle, <b>U.S.</b> Representative Polk Laffoon. There {{he served as}} a {{messenger}} in the office of Judge C. R. Faulkner, director of the pension office. In September 1887, he enrolled at Columbia Law School (asserted by Vernon Gipson to have been a prior designation for George Washington University Law School). On October 17, 1888, he matriculated to Washington and Lee University, where he earned a law degree in 1890. He returned to Madisonville, was admitted to the bar, and began practicing in the office of Judge William H. Yost. He became active in the Democratic Party and served as a county election officer. In 1892, he was elected city attorney of Madisonville over Ward Headley. In 1894, he ran for the office of county attorney for Hopkins County, but lost to Roy Salmon by seventeen votes.|$|R

I have therefore {{ordered a}} coach--a sort of Noah's Ark--the biggest thing I could hire at the Cove--to take {{you and all}} your belongings to the railway tomorrow evening. We'll travel all night, and so get to London on Thursday. May expects you. May and I have settled it all, so you needn't look thunderstruck. If I hadn't known for certain that you'd be glad <b>to</b> come and <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> I would not have arranged it at all. If I had not known equally well that your fluttering bird of a heart would have been totally upset at the prospect, I would have consulted you beforehand. As it is, the die is cast. Your fate is fixed. Nothing can reverse the decrees that have gone forth, so it's as well to make your mind easy and go to work." ...|$|R
6000|$|Paula {{had first}} read this through silently, {{and now in}} reading it a second time aloud to Somerset her voice faltered, and she wept outright.

40|$|ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The {{research}} team {{would like to}} acknowledge the support and cooperation provided by both school systems and the local communities involved. This effort required the willing participation of many individuals who took time from their work and home <b>lives</b> <b>to</b> speak <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> We were consistently treated with great hospitality and respect. We appreciate all the effort that was put into making this opportunity a success. We {{would like to acknowledge}} the contributions of one of the initial team members, Dr. Barbara Sparks. CONTEXT The Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) has been working with school districts on the issue of overrepresentation of students of color in special education through annual summits on this issue since 2003. Overrepresentation has been a key performance indicator in Connecticut’s focused monitoring since 2004. Data maps by state and school districts have been used at state meetings to develop deeper understanding and support strategic initiatives based on those data. Connecticut’...|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} noon {{of a very}} fair July day, in the next summer, when Euphemia and myself arrived at the little town where we were to take the stage up into the mountains. We were off for a two weeks' {{vacation}} and our minds were a good deal easier than when we went away before, and left Pomona at the helm. We had enlarged the boundaries of Rudder Grange, having purchased the house, with enough adjoining land to make quite a respectable farm. Of course I could not attend to the manifold duties on such a place, and my wife seldom had a happier thought than when she proposed that we should invite Pomona and her husband <b>to</b> come and <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> Pomona was delighted, and Jonas was quite willing to run our farm. So arrangements were made, and the young couple were established in apartments in our back building, {{and went to work}} as if taking care of us and our possessions was the ultimate object of their lives. Jonas was such a steady fellow that we feared no trouble from tree-man or lightning rodder during this absence.|$|R

You say that you are going to have one room, and that I'm to have another, and that we'll go into the old house to feel at home {{whenever}} we want to; but I believe we'll be like a couple of flies in a barrel! You're going to furnish your new house with everything but people! You ought to have more people! You ought to have a family! That house will look funny without people! You can't ask Mr. Burke, because it would be too queer to have him come and <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> and besides, he'll want a house of his own. Why don't you ask the Thorpedykes <b>to</b> come and <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us?</b> Their roof is dreadfully out of repairs. I know to my certain knowledge that they have to put tin wash-basins on every bed in the second story when it rains, on account of the holes in the shingles! If they had money to mend those holes, they'd mend them, but as they don't mend them, of course they haven't the money. And it strikes me that they aren't as well off as they used to be, and they'll have a hard time gettin' through this winter. Now, there isn't any piece of furniture that you can put in your house that will give it 'such an air of distinction,' as Miss Eleanor calls it, as she herself will give it if you put her there! If you could persuade Miss Eleanor to come and sit in your parlor when you are having company to see you, it would set you up in Plainton a good deal higher than any money can set you up." ...|$|R
60|$|When Jone {{came home}} and I told him a gentleman was coming <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> he thought at first I was joking; and {{when he found out}} that I meant what I said he looked very blue, and stood with {{his hands in his pockets}} and his eyes on the ground, considering.|$|E

'Just round the corner here is Mrs. Webb's, who used <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> before she married, Kunz will be happy with her.

30|$|Shihfu {{was among}} the first of her {{generation}} of Chinese scholars {{to draw attention to the}} Indian roots of Buddhism and to the importance of gaining a solid grounding in the foundations of Indian Buddhist thought. Her steadfast commitment to this holistic Buddhist approach is evident in her naming of the Institute of Sino-Indian Buddhism, acknowledging that Chinese Buddhist thought is, in fact, a blend of Indian and Chinese elements, not simply an import. She was a pioneer in promoting the study of foreign languages, instituting a full slate of classes in Sanskrit, Pali, Japanese, and English at the Institute. She {{was among the}} first Buddhist teachers in Taiwan to understand the importance of imparting Buddhist education to overseas Chinese. She invited applications from girls and young women born and raised in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Canada, and so forth, and sponsored their education and training at the Lotus Ashram. Because of differences in culture, upbringing, and language, educating these students required great wisdom and patience. Often the young women who came <b>to</b> <b>live</b> and study <b>with</b> <b>us</b> were the privileged daughters of well-to-do overseas Chinese families. They were accustomed to having servants to cook, clean, and take care of them, whereas at the Lotus Ashram everyone was expected to work on an equal footing with others. Even training the younger generation of Taiwanese nuns required great wisdom and patience.|$|R
6000|$|He {{then sent}} to {{all the women in}} Rome who had {{formerly}} belonged to these cities, summoning them to appear before him at his public place of audience in the city, and {{in the presence of the}} Roman Senate. The women were exceedingly terrified at receiving this summons. They supposed that death or some other terrible punishment, was to be inflicted upon them in retribution for the offenses committed by their countrymen, and they came into the senate-house, hiding their faces in their robes, and crying out with grief and terror. Romulus bid them calm their fears, assuring them that he intended them no injury. [...] "Your countrymen," [...] said he, [...] "preferred war to the peaceful alternative of friendship and alliance which we offered them; and the fortune of war to which they thus chose to appeal, has decided against them. They have now fallen into our hands, and are wholly at our mercy. We do not, however, mean to do them any harm. We spare and forgive them for your sakes. We intend to invite them <b>to</b> come and <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> and <b>with</b> you at Rome, so that you can once more experience the happiness of being joined to your fathers and brothers as well as your husbands. We shall not destroy or even injure their cities; but shall send some of our own citizens to people them, so that they may become fully incorporated into the Roman commonwealth. Thus, your fathers and brothers, and all your countrymen, receive the boon of life, liberty, and happiness through you; and all that we ask of you in return, is that you will continue your conjugal affection and fidelity to your Roman husbands, and seek to promote the harmony and happiness of the city by every means in your power." ...|$|R
