5|$|Although the Eskaya {{had been}} known to {{people living in the}} {{vicinity}} of Bohol’s southeast highlands prior to World War II, {{it was only in the}} early 1980s <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to wider public attention when government agricultural advisers toured the province to introduce Green Revolution policies. Local journalists and researchers have since suggested various theories on the origins of the Eskaya but there is still no broad consensus on the subject.|$|E
5|$|By {{studying}} {{the relationship between}} Calabi–Yau manifolds and certain conformal field theories called Gepner models, Brian Greene and Ronen Plesser found nontrivial examples of the mirror relationship. Further evidence for this relationship came {{from the work of}} Philip Candelas, Monika Lynker, and Rolf Schimmrigk, who surveyed a large number of Calabi–Yau manifolds by computer and found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> in mirror pairs.|$|E
5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa {{had heard}} of an animal <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to call the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi {{was some sort of}} rainforest zebra.|$|E
50|$|Chocos is {{a breakfast}} cereal {{manufactured}} by Kellogg's {{and sold in}} certain European and Middle-Eastern countries as well as India. They are usually shaped in 'scoops'.

5|$|Originally it was {{believed}} that Lake Cahuilla formed around 900 AD and existed until 1500 but with fluctuations as the Colorado River changed its course. In 1978, Philip J. Wilke proposed that two highstands occurred, one between 900 and 1250 and another between 1300-1500. Another proposal by Waters in 1983 suggested highstands 700-900, 940-1210 and after 1250, the latter with some brief recessions to lower lake levels. Both proposals were criticized on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to definite conclusions with insufficient information.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– explained <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> from {{a land where}} the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided {{by the sound of}} bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E
5|$|As colonies {{closer to}} each other are more genetically similar, {{independent}} colony foundation is most likely associated with nuptial flight if they disperse far from genetically similar colonies they originate from. Inseminated queens could even seek adoption into alien colonies if a suitable nest site area for independent colony foundation is restricted or cannot be carried out, known as the nest-site limitation hypothesis. Some queens could even try {{to return to their}} nests <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> from after nuptial flight, but end in another nest, in association that nests nearby will be similar to the queens birth nest.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} with ABC News, Esch and Lefkow stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> up with the original idea for bacon products and their first invention, Bacon Salt, while making a joke about the subject over a meal at a diner. The money for their startup came from the $5000 that Lefkow had obtained while on America's Funniest Home Videos. The idea to make bacon spreadable came from a customer's request. Together, they created interest in their products by going to numerous sporting events dressed in bacon costumes and used social networking sites {{to raise awareness of}} their company.|$|E
5|$|To {{write his}} own batch of songs, Farrar looked through {{several of the}} over 3,000 {{handwritten}} lyrics that Guthrie's estate has preserved before incidentally focusing on his California period. The connection to Guthrie's Los Angeles years was accidental—Farrar simply chose lyrics that he found compelling and Nora pointed out <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> from a relatively brief period of her father's life when he lived in Los Angeles. He also {{made a conscious decision}} to write instrumentation in a style more similar to Guthrie's than other tribute projects, such as The Klezmatics' klezmer-based Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah and Wonder Wheel. Farrar had never listened to the Bragg and Wilco material to ensure that his songwriting would not be influenced by it.|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day, Liz {{goes to her}} dentist {{appointment}} and tells the receptionist {{that she did not}} sign the waiver. After her surgery, Liz reassures the dental staff that the anesthesia is having no effect on her and can take herself home. In the lobby, Liz sees her former boyfriends Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), and Floyd DeBarber (Jason Sudeikis), and is moved <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> back so that she not be alone on Valentine's Day. Liz is hallucinating, however, and the people she sees as Drew, Dennis, and Floyd are actually the three Jamaican women who are dental assistants at the oral surgeon's office. One of them calls Jack, Liz's boss, asking if he could come pick up Liz and take her home. Jack had just spent the night with Avery, who thinks that the phone call was made up by Jack as an excuse to end the date, but when he invites her to come along, she is impressed by his kindness to Liz.|$|E

5|$|The homeless, {{who were}} by {{majority}} South and Central American males, said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> {{into the area}} from their respective countries in promise of work. A particular individual who was interviewed said that the work he was told about had only been short term and, along {{with many of the}} others, had nowhere else to go. Most who had been approached about relocation into nearby homeless shelters express their hesitation to leave the Grove Church Cemetery grounds, fearful that they would lose the freedom they had on the public property. Measures were taken to remove and clean up the cemetery, and it is believed that while some may have entered into shelters, others likely still reside in the general area, while some had moved into the wooded eastern side of the Palisades hills in Union City, where many shacks can be seen supporting the homeless.|$|E
25|$|If women {{work outside}} the home {{independent}} of their husbands, acquire personal assets, and can prove <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> by these assets through their independent work, then these working women can accumulate these assets as their own, unable to be touched by husbands.|$|E
25|$|Many locals {{say it is}} {{the home}} turf of Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, {{due to the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> from Freehold, New Jersey. Several songs on his 1986 live album Live/1975-85 were {{recorded}} at shows at the stadium in August 1985.|$|E

25|$|Also, Jacques Cartier {{wrote in}} his journal that {{when he made his}} first {{contacts}} with the Amerindians (St. Lawrence Iroquoians), <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to him in their boats to offer him furs. All these facts and several other details encourage us to believe that {{this was not the first}} meeting of Amerindians and Europeans.|$|E
25|$|The {{commanders of}} the troops told Moses that they had checked the warriors, and not one was missing, so they brought as an {{offering}} to God the gold <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> upon — armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and pendants — to make expiation for their persons before God. Moses and Eleazar accepted from them 16,750 shekels of gold, but the warriors in the ranks kept their booty for themselves.|$|E

25|$|In 1876, Eugen Goldstein proved <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> {{from the}} cathode, and named them cathode rays (Kathodenstrahlen). Both William Crookes (in the 1880s) and German {{physicist}} Johann Hittorf, a co-inventor and early researcher of the Crookes tube, found that paper wrapped photographic plates placed near the tube became unaccountably fogged or flawed by shadows, {{although they had}} not been exposed to light. Neither found the cause nor investigated this effect.|$|E
25|$|When the British {{then went}} to Governor of East Java Soeryo seeking a more {{positive}} response, Moestopo reportedly wanted the envoys, Macdonald and a naval officer, shot upon arrival. Soeryo, however, proved amenable to the British declaration <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> in peace; he only refused to meet Mallaby on HMS Waveney after Moestopo refused to concede accept the British. The British landed in Surabaya that afternoon, after which Moestopo met with Colonel Pugh; Pugh emphasized that the British were not intending to reinstate Dutch rule, and Moestopo agreed to meet with Mallaby the following morning.|$|E
25|$|In Anthony Horowitz's detective series, The Diamond Brothers, {{the case}} I Know What You Did Last Wednesday {{pays homage to}} And Then There Were None; protagonist Nick Diamond accompanies his brother Tim to a school reunion on a lonely island where the various guests start dying {{in a manner that}} {{reflects}} back to a subject <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> first in at school (the person who came first in chemistry is poisoned, the one who came first in geography is crushed by a globe, etc.), with the killer revealed at the conclusion to be a former schoolfriend who came second in everything.|$|E
