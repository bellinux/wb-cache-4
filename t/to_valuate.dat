You see my deductions are quite obvious; you see how open and frank I deal with you, as I should wish to do with any gentleman with whom I was conjoined in business. You see how much I know; and it can scarcely escape your strong common-sense how much better it would be if I knew all. You cannot hope to get rid of me at this time of day; I have my place in the affair, I cannot be shaken off; I am, if you will excuse a rather technical pleasantry, an encumbrance on the estate.

50|$|Szombatfalvy’s {{philosophy}} in trading stock {{is to be}} a long-term investor, buying companies that are undervalued with low risk. The qualitative model he used <b>to</b> <b>valuate</b> shares in a company didn’t have a formula, but built instead partly on a comprehensive analysis of the company itself, and partly on studying the stock market and interviewing people in the market. His analysis of companies also included an in-depth study of the company, its branches and its management, which resulted in both an optimistic and pessimistic long-term prognosis of the company’s projected dividend growth. The focus of Szombatfalvy’s study was on the dividend growth and the most important key was the company’s profits in its own capital, as this shows the company’s theoretical dividend and growth capacity.|$|E

The association between nonintersecting paths and ▵-matroids {{is derived from}} Pfaffians. On the one hand, certain numbers ofk-tuples of nonintersecting paths may (often) be expressed as a Pfaffian, while, on the other hand, representability problems for ▵-matroids may be studied in terms of Pfaffians. It is shown that ▵-matroids induced by nonintersecting paths are representable over fields of any characteristic and that weightings defined on the edge set and with values in some linearly ordered abelian group give rise <b>to</b> <b>valuated</b> ▵-matroids...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} new {{analytical}} and numerical approaches <b>to</b> <b>valuating</b> path-dependent options of European type have been developed. The model of stochastic volatility {{as a basic}} model has been chosen. For European options we could improve the path integral method, proposed B. Baaquie, and generalized it {{to the case of}} path-dependent options, where the payoff function depends on the history of changes in the underlying asset. The dependence of the implied volatility on the parameters of the stochastic volatility model has been studied. It is shown that with proper choice of model parameters one can accurately reproduce the actual behavior of implied volatility. As a consequence, it can assess more accurately the value of options. It {{should be noted that the}} methods developed here allow evaluating options with any payoff function. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a general {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>valuating</b> investments in end-of-pipe-technologies (EOP-technologies) with special regard to an emissions trading scheme. Since investments {{of this kind}} affect production, {{it is necessary to}} derive the required payments for a financial valuation and the constraints from production theory and production planning. On this basis, it is possible to develop a valuation model. This model considers joint production, activity-level-dependent and -independent payments and specifically includes the indivisibility of the investment. Applying duality theory enables us to examine the determinants of the price ceiling for such an investment. Sensitivity analysis shows that tradable permits have several effects on an investment and do not always encourage environmentally beneficial investments - in particular cases they may even be counterproductive.

40|$|Mixed {{polynomial}} matrices are polynomial matrices {{with two}} kinds of nonzero coefficients: fixed constants that account for conservation laws and independent parameters that represent physical characteristics. The computation of their maximum degrees of minors {{is known to be}} reducible <b>to</b> <b>valuated</b> independent assignment problems, which can be solved by polynomial numbers of additions, subtractions, and multiplications of rational functions. However, these arithmetic operations on rational functions are much more expensive than those on constants. In this paper, we present a new algorithm of combinatorial relaxation type. The algorithm finds a combinatorial estimate of the maximum degree by solving a weighted bipartite matching problem, and checks if the estimate is equal to the true value by solving independent matching problems. The algorithm mainly relies on fast combinatorial algorithms and performs numerical computation only when necessary. In addition, it requires no arithmetic operations on rational functions. As a byproduct, this method yields a new algorithm for solving a linear valuated independent assignment problem...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} generational {{accounting}} approach <b>to</b> <b>valuating</b> research. Based on {{the flow of}} scientific results, a value-added (VA) index is developed that can, in principle, be used to assign a monetary value to any research result and, by aggregation, on entire academic disciplines or sub-disciplines. The VA-index distributes the value of all applications that embody research to the works of research which the applications directly rely on, and further to the works of research of previous generations which {{the authors of the}} immediate reference sources have directly or indirectly made use of. The major contribution of the VA index is to provide a measure of the value of research that is comparable across academic disciplines. To illustrate how the generational accounting approach works, I present a VAbased journal rating and a rating of the most influential recent journal articles in the field of economics.

40|$|Part 2 : Trust and PrivacyInternational audienceMany Internet {{services}} rely on consumers disclosing {{their personal}} data. Despite heavy usage and wide acceptance of services like Online Social Networks, doubts about sustainability of trusted relationships remain. Surveying consumers about their preferences reveals severe {{concerns about the}} fate of their personal data. In stark contrast to privacy concerns (stated preferences), however, consumers generously disclose personal data in exchange for free Internet services (revealed preferences). It has been argued that individuals experience dissonant states in privacy decision making. The tension between stated and revealed preferences is eliminated with the decision made in order to reduce discomfort. This paper proposes a survey design to determine 1) order effects as indicators for dissonant states in privacy decision making, and 2) the degree of experienced tension between stated and revealed preferences. Observations of data valuation and disclosure behavior are dissonant if they do not commute, i. e. disclosing data prior <b>to</b> <b>valuating</b> privacy does not equal privacy valuation before data disclosure. Determining the degree of dissonance in privacy decision making is expected to inform the design of transparency mechanisms to influence experienced dissonance between stated and revealed privacy preferences...|$|R
