5|$|Attached to the 5th Light Infantry at Alexandra Barracks were a {{detachment}} of 97 Indian officers and {{men of the}} Malay States Guides Mule Battery. Raised in 1896 for the internal garrisoning of the Federated Malay States, the regiment was recruited from Sikhs, Pathans and Punjabis in both India and Malaya. The British officer commanding the battery was shot dead by an unknown sniper as he hastened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> park. The MSG gunners then dispersed when {{a large body of}} 5th LI mutineers approached their lines. The MSG artillery pieces were abandoned but not brought into action by the mutineers.|$|E
5|$|Cho {{was able}} to pass both {{background}} checks and successfully complete both handgun purchases after he presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> dealers his U.S. permanent residency card, his Virginia driver's permit to prove legal age and length of Virginia residence and a checkbook showing his Virginia address, in addition to waiting the required 30-day period between each gun purchase. He was successful at completing both handgun purchases {{because he did not}} disclose on the background questionnaire that a Virginia court had ordered him to undergo outpatient treatment at a mental health facility.|$|E
5|$|The M249 LMG entered {{service in}} 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial {{reactions}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> were mixed: it fulfilled the {{light machine gun}} role well when fired from the ground, but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though {{a number of areas}} for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was very weak and broke easily, the sling attachment was awkward, and there were many slots and gaps that accumulated dirt. Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle was a more effective light machine gun.|$|E

5|$|The fort was {{positioned}} {{at one end}} of a new quay built along the harbour, near the entrance to the estuary, and was intended to engage any hostile ships that evaded the guns of Dartmouth and Kingswear castles. It probably originally took the form of a circular tower, similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> tower at Dartmouth Castle. In 1575, the fort was leased by the town to Thomas Carne, a shipwright, subject to it being returned to the town authorities if necessary for the defence of the town. During the 1598 Spanish invasion scare, the town authorities took over control of the fort in accordance with the agreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{guns were}} {{controlled}} from a Battery Commander's Post on the roof, from where commands <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> detachments could be relayed via voice pipes. Three depression range finders were {{installed on the}} roof by the late 1890s to aid the guns' targeting. A well-trained crew could fire each gun once every two minutes. Rather than firing all the guns at once, the guns were positioned {{so that they could}} be fired in sequence as an enemy ship passed by. When combined with the fire from Shornemead and Cliffe Forts on the Kent shore, this would ensure that constant fire could be maintained from three different sides.|$|E

Jo later puts Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton), who has the most seniority in the office, in charge until a committee composed of Jim, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), and Gabe find a replacement. While Jim tells Dwight that Jo did the right thing, he also compliments Dwight, noting that the office got every single company order out on time.|$|E

5|$|One of the cruiser's early {{commanding}} officers, Royal Navy Captain J.W.A. Waller, {{believed that}} the ship's single director control tower was a weak point in the design. The director control tower was the highest compartment on the ship, from where personnel would determine the range and optimum firing angle for a gun salvo, then transmit this information <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> turrets: the actual firing could be controlled from the tower or the turret. Waller {{believed that the}} centralised system could be destroyed with a single hit, or the wiring linking the compartment to the turrets could be severed, forcing the four turrets to rely on independent control. Although Waller suggested that a second tower be installed aft to provide redundancy, it was deferred indefinitely as subsequent commanding officers did not share his concerns, and combat experiences of other Leander-class cruisers showed that the system was more robust than expected.|$|E
5|$|The {{silencer}} {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to {{have been on the}} rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the silencer was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could not shoot herself with the silencer attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E
5|$|The two vessels were {{pounding}} {{each other}} at such close range, they also managed to collide with one another at five different times. By 11:00am Monitors supply of shot in the turret had been used up. With one of the hatches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> ports damaged and jammed shut she hauled off to shallow waters to resupply the turret and effect repairs to the damaged hatch, {{which could not be}} repaired. During the lull in the battle Worden climbed through the gun port out onto the deck {{to get a better view}} of the overall situation. Virginia, seeing Monitor turn away turned her attention to the Minnesota and fired shots that set the wooden vessel ablaze, also destroying the nearby tugboat Dragon. When the turret was resupplied with ammunition Worden returned to battle with only one gun in operation.|$|E

5|$|They {{argued that}} Bamber had then set about {{arranging}} {{the scene to}} make it appear that Sheila was the killer. He discovered that she could not have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. He removed the kitchen phone from its hook, left the house via a kitchen window, perhaps after showering, and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26am to say he had just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter.|$|E
5|$|Wichita {{continued}} to provide gunfire support {{throughout the rest}} of the month. On 27 April, a small caliber shell penetrated a fuel oil tank five feet below the waterline. After temporary repairs while still off Okinawa proved unsuccessful, Wichita returned to Kerama Retto where the damage was repaired on 29–30 April. Wichita then returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> line. On 12 May, the ship was damaged by friendly fire. A 5inch round struck the port aircraft catapult; shell fragments hit the shield of an antiaircraft director, killing one man and injuring eleven others. She departed the area to rest and refit at Leyte, returning to Okinawa on 18 June. Wichita {{continued to}} provide gunfire support to the troops on Okinawa through July, as part of Task Unit 2. On 15 August, the ship's crew received word that the war with Japan was over. Wichita was awarded 13 battle stars for her service during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{destructive}} effects of gunpowder were {{described in the}} earlier Tang dynasty by a Daoist alchemist, the earliest-known existent written formulas for gunpowder come from the Wujing Zongyao text of 1044, which described explosive bombs hurled from catapults. The earliest developments of the gun barrel and the projectile-fire cannon were found in late Song China. The first art depiction of the Chinese 'fire lance' (a combination of a temporary-fire flamethrower and gun) was from a Buddhist mural painting of Dunhuang, dated circa 950. These 'fire-lances' were widespread in use by the early 12th century, featuring hollowed bamboo poles as tubes to fire sand particles (to blind and choke), lead pellets, bits of sharp metal and pottery shards, and finally large gunpowder-propelled arrows and rocket weaponry. Eventually, perishable bamboo was replaced with hollow tubes of cast iron, and so too did the terminology of this new weapon change, from 'fire-spear' ('huo qiang') to 'fire-tube' ('huo tong'). This ancestor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> was complemented by the ancestor to the cannon, what the Chinese referred to since the 13th century as the 'multiple bullets magazine erupter' ('bai zu lian zhu pao'), a tube of bronze or cast iron that was filled with about 100 lead balls. In 1132, at the Siege of De'an, Song Chinese forces used fire lances against the rival Jurchen-led Jin dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{landing on}} the Island, she decides to join Sayid on a hike to {{transmit}} a distress signal, after she and Boone have an argument about her selfishness. When they discover a French looped signal already being transmitted, Shannon's knowledge of the language is used to translate it. Later, Shannon has an asthma attack, but her inhalers are nowhere to be found. Sun (Yunjin Kim) cures her, by using eucalyptus plants to help her breathing. Because of her selfish and manipulative behavior, Boone brands Shannon useless. Sayid enlists her to help translate the maps belonging to the French woman who made the radio transmission, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan). Shannon and Sayid soon form a romantic relationship. After returning from a romantic night along the beach with Sayid, she learns Boone has died after falling from a great height. At his funeral, Shannon does not speak, but allows Sayid to talk instead. Shannon holds Locke (Terry O'Quinn) responsible for Boone's death, and asks Sayid to take action. When he refuses, she steals the key <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> case from Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and holds Locke at gunpoint in the jungle. When Rousseau arrives on the beach one morning to warn the camp of the Others' imminent arrival, Shannon prepares to migrate to the caves {{with the rest of}} the group. Before leaving on the raft the survivors have built, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley) gives Shannon guardianship of his dog, Vincent, as a means to help her recover from her loss.|$|E
25|$|In any case, Warrant Officer F. W. Scarff {{worked with}} Dibovski {{to develop and}} realize the gear, which worked on the {{familiar}} cam and rider principle, the connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> being by the usual push rod and a rather complicated series of levers. It was geared in order to slow the rate that firing impulses were delivered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> (and hence improve reliability, although not the rate of fire).|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, {{when the}} gear was fitted to types {{such as the}} Bristol Scout and the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, which had rotary engines and their forward-firing machine gun {{in front of the}} cockpit, the long push rod linking the gear <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> had to be mounted at an awkward angle, in which it was liable to {{twisting}} and deformation (not to mention expansion and contraction due to temperature changes). For this reason the B.E.12 and the R.E.8, not to mention Vickers' own FB 19, mounted their forward-firing machine guns on the port side of the fuselage so that a relatively short version of the push rod could be linked directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{casualties}} {{continued to}} mount for the ambushed column.
