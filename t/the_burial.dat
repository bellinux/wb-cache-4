5|$|Burial 265 {{was found}} {{at the base of}} the {{stairway}} of Terrace 1 Structure 2 in the acropolis. Ceramics associated with <b>the</b> <b>burial</b> have been dated to the Middle Preclassic Period. This burial is the only evidence yet found of such early activity at the site. It consists of <b>the</b> <b>burial</b> of a seated infant together with a newborn. <b>The</b> <b>burial</b> was laid out upon a layer of large stones and was accompanied by a plate and other ceramics as a funerary offering. The child's skull was found underneath the plate itself. Burnt stones and earth were found next to <b>the</b> <b>burial.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Burial</b> Council's core {{contention}} is the city's decision {{to conduct an}} archaeological survey of the rail line's route in phases, meaning construction on {{a majority of the}} line will be complete by the time the survey in the Kakaako area is performed, which in turn increases the likelihood that any remains discovered will be moved instead of being allowed to remain in situ. In response to <b>the</b> <b>Burial</b> Council's concerns, the city agreed to begin conducting an archaeological survey of the area in 2010, two years earlier than originally planned. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources later signed the city's programmatic agreement on January 15, 2011, over the continuing concerns of <b>the</b> <b>Burial</b> Council.|$|E

50|$|During {{investigations}} {{carried out}} between 1984 and 1987, 26 burials were excavated, of which 23 were found under domestic structures. 24 of <b>the</b> <b>burials</b> were oriented east-west with the skull towards the west; <b>the</b> remaining 2 <b>burials</b> were oriented north-south with the skull to the north. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>burials</b> {{were covered with}} red pigment.|$|R
5|$|Burial 23 was a royal tomb {{inserted}} {{by destroying}} the second {{version of the}} access stairway of Temple 33. The individual interred within the tomb has not been identified but the tomb {{is one of two}} proposed locations for <b>the</b> <b>burial</b> of the late 7th-century king Nuun Ujol Chaak. The tomb was cut into the bedrock under the temple, to the south of <b>the</b> <b>burial</b> of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II. The king appears to have been hastily interred in a tomb that was still being prepared while <b>the</b> <b>burial</b> took place, since plaster from the walls was splashed on some of the grave goods and a flint pick was accidentally left behind by a workman. The body of the king was laid upon a litter painted with cinnabar and overlain with jaguar-pelts; the corpse was laid out on the pelts and covered in layers of marine shells.|$|E
5|$|Burials are {{oriented}} east-west. <b>The</b> <b>burial</b> ground covers {{most of the}} site's {{land and}} is planted with grass and trees. The surrounding land is predominantly of agricultural use {{but there are some}} nearby residences. To the east a wind farm is under construction.|$|E

5000|$|Within the Phum Snay site, {{two types}} of burials were found. These include bodies that were {{stretched}} out lying flat and pits where remains were simply in piles. [...] <b>The</b> <b>burials</b> contained a variety of grave goods, including ceramic vessels, bronze ornaments (bangles, rings, and bells), and a large quantity of animal bones. [...] The proportion of left forelimbs of hooved animals suggest a very particular sacrificial practice of animals within <b>the</b> <b>burials.</b> Researchers found that the manner of <b>the</b> <b>burials</b> and <b>the</b> goods contained within were closest {{in relation to the}} Óc Eo culture of the Mekong Delta.|$|R
5|$|For William Huskisson's funeral on Friday 24September, {{almost every}} {{business}} in Liverpool was closed. Huskisson {{had been a}} popular figure in Liverpool, and the authorities expected {{large numbers of people}} wishing to attend. In an effort to control numbers it was announced that anyone wishing to join the cortège submit a written request in writing to the Town Hall. This proved impractical, and the authorities put up posters around the town advising that anyone in mourning dress would be allowed to join the procession. Colour coded tickets were issued to those wishing to attend <b>the</b> <b>burial,</b> with each colour representing a different section of the cemetery, in an effort to control crowd numbers at <b>the</b> <b>burial</b> service; a total of 3,000 tickets were issued.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49 a cholera {{epidemic}} killed 14,601 {{people in}} London and overwhelmed <b>the</b> <b>burial</b> system completely. Bodies were left stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves were exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interior}} of the pyramid a descending passage led, behind three granite portcullises, to an antechamber, three magazine rooms and <b>the</b> <b>burial</b> chamber. In it, pieces of alabaster and a faience bead on a gold thread were discovered as well as many fragments of what was originally a large sarcophagus of dark grey basalt. The sarcophagus was sunk into the floor of <b>the</b> <b>burial</b> chamber together with a niche for the canopic chest of the king to its north-east. An almost complete mummy was discovered in the remnants of the sarcophagus. An examination by Ahmed Batrawi of these skeletal remains, excavated in the mid-1940s under the direction of Abdel Salam Hussein, suggests that Djedkare {{died at the age of}} 50 to 60 years old.|$|E

50|$|There were one-hundred {{and three}} {{individuals}} {{recovered from the}} site of K’axob and seventy-two <b>burials.</b> <b>The</b> individuals recovered are male and female, of all ages, infant to adult. Excavations yielded beads, pendants, including zoomorphic pendants as well as ceramics and unworked shells interned with the individuals. Some of <b>the</b> <b>burials</b> held multiple individuals, while others were only single-person <b>burials.</b> <b>The</b> individuals are also interned in different positions, ‘sitting’ or ‘flexed’. Many of <b>the</b> <b>burials</b> are beneath household structures. <b>The</b> <b>burials</b> at K’axob date from the Middle Preclassic Period through to the Terminal Classic Period. The amount of beads, pendants or ceramics as well as the number of individuals and the position of an individual in a burial could suggest ritual practices as well as possible social stratification at K’axob.|$|R

50|$|The Cemetery Building {{covers the}} area used as <b>the</b> community's <b>burial</b> ground. Native American {{practices}} prohibit {{the display of}} the dead. The original remains were reinterred and artificial skeletons were placed to show <b>the</b> original <b>burials.</b> <b>The</b> exterior of the excavation has curtains with traditional designs to cover those remains {{that could not be}} removed. <b>The</b> <b>burials</b> are from <b>the</b> 13th century. They included many infants, as well as people with identifiable medical problems, including arthritis, tuberculosis (TB) and various injuries.|$|R
50|$|The objects found are chiefly of Nubian origin, {{but there}} were also many objects {{imported}} from Byzantine Egypt and the Mediterranean in general. Most remarkable is a set of crowns from different tombs showing that <b>the</b> richest <b>burials</b> belong to local ruling kings and queens. There were horses and servants buried with their masters. There are few written objects in <b>the</b> <b>burials.</b> <b>The</b> identification of the tomb owners is, therefore, impossible. It has been assumed that these are <b>the</b> <b>burials</b> of <b>the</b> kings and the court of Nobatia.|$|R
5|$|Only about 1300 {{cartridges}} of {{the estimated}} 700,000 were removed from <b>the</b> <b>burial,</b> as the remaining materials were deeper than expected, and made them more difficult to access, according to Alamogordo mayor Susie Galea. <b>The</b> <b>burial</b> was refilled following this event. Joseph Lewandowski, who had worked to arrange the unearthing with the city, {{said that this was}} a one-time shot to recover materials from the site, as they do not expect the city to agree to a similar event again.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>burial</b> ground {{preceded the}} meeting house, {{as the site}} was home to another meeting house that was {{constructed}} in 1859. The Benjaminville Meeting House represents a well-constructed example of Quaker meeting house architecture and contains within its design many of the major elements associated with the style. It is unique in that it allowed {{both male and female}} friends to worship together in the same room. <b>The</b> <b>burial</b> ground, however, maintains a strict separation, not by gender but by religious affiliation; there are three sections, one for Quakers, one for non-Quakers, and one for distant relatives of both.|$|E
5|$|The graves {{made by the}} Iazyges {{were often}} {{rectangular}} or circular in shape. They were flat, and were grouped like a modern cemetery. During the time after the Iazyges migrated to the Tisza plain, and were in serious poverty. This {{is reflected in the}} poor furnishings of <b>the</b> <b>burial</b> sites, often filled with clay vessels, beads, and sometimes brooches. Very rarely would there be iron daggers in <b>the</b> <b>burial</b> site, and even more rarely would there be iron swords. Their brooches and arm-rings were of the La Tène type, showing a distinct influence on the Iazyges by the Dacians.|$|E
40|$|Three human burials {{were found}} at Çatalhöyük that {{contained}} large microfaunal assemblages. Taphonomic analysis demonstrated {{that many of these}} elements had passed through the digestive tract of a small carnivore, indicating that the microfauna entered <b>the</b> <b>burials</b> in carnivore scats rather than as carcasses. One of <b>the</b> <b>burials</b> in particular (F. 513) contained an enormous quantity of microfauna which was concentrated over the torso of the body. It is concluded that the scats were deliberately placed in <b>the</b> <b>burials</b> by <b>the</b> human inhabitants of the site as part of ritualistic practice. Furthermore, it is suggested that small carnivores were encouraged to enter Çatalhöyük in order to control house mice, and other small mammal, numbers...|$|R
