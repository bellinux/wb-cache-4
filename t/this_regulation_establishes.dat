40|$|According to the EPA, Oklahoma’s leading {{pollutants}} and {{stresses of}} surface waters are from sediment pollution. During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing {{water quality and}} causing the siltation of aquatic habitat. Soil erosion can cause damage to property and necessitate repair of sewers, ditches, streams, ponds, and lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during construction causes loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat. This Regulation was developed to safeguard persons, protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in Oklahoma County. The Regulation also seeks to control the creation of sediment and {{to prevent the occurrence}} of erosion at the source during construction and development. This Regulation promotes the public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in Oklahoma County. <b>This</b> <b>Regulation</b> <b>establishes</b> methods to regulate the introduction of pollutants into the MS 4 and enables the County to comply with all applicable State and Federal laws including, but not limited to, the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251, et seq.), the Oklahoma Environmental Quality Act (Title 27 A OS § 1 - 1 - 101, et seq.), and Federal stormwater regulations (40 CFR Part 122).

This research is conducted to know: 1) whether the obligation of registering fiducia of finance institution in Regulation of the Minister of Finance Number 130 /PMK. 010 / 2012 is already in accordance with Act Number 42 of 1999. 2) whether the obligation of registering fiducia of finance institution in Regulation of the Minister of Finance Number 130 /PMK. 010 / 2012 has already reinforced the legal certainty and justice.

The results of this research are: 1) Regulation of the Minister of Finance Number 130 /PMK. 010 / 2012 is {{in conflict with the}} Act Number 42 of 1999 because of two aspects. Firstly, Regulation of the Minister of Finance Number 130 /PMK. 010 / 2012 does not have any legal basis because Act Number 42 of 1999 does not delegate any authority to the minister {{to regulate}} the duration of fiducia registration. Secondly, the content of Regulation of the Minister of Finance Number 130 /PMK. 010 / 2012 article 2 which regulates the duration of fiducia registration is in conflict with Act Number 42 of 1999 article 11 (1). The content of Regulation of the Minister of Finance Number 130 /PMK. 010 / 2012 article 4 which adds new condition for execution is in conflict with the general rule of execution in Act Number 42 of 1999. 2) Regulation of the Minister of Finance Number 130 /PMK. 010 / 2012 does not reinforce justice because it prompt inequal treatment between finance institution and banking institution which also provides similar motor vehicle financing.

40|$|Summary A human tamoxifen-resistant mammary carcinoma, MaCa 3366 /TAM, {{originating}} from a sensitive parental xenograft 3366 was successfully established by treatment of tumour-bearing nude mice with 1 – 50 mg kg – 1 tamoxifen for 3 years during routine passaging. Both tumours {{did not differ}} significantly in OR- and PR-positivity, however, when compared with the sensitive tumour line, the mean OR content of the TAM-resistant subline is slightly lower. An OR-upregulation following withdrawal of oestradiol treatment was observed in the parental tumours but not in the resistant xenografts. Following long-term treatment with tamoxifen, the histological pattern of the breast carcinoma changed. The more differentiated structures being apparent after treatment with 17 β-oestradiol in the original 3366 tumour were not induced in the resistant line. Tamoxifen failed to induce a tumour growth inhibition in comparison to the tamoxifen-sensitive line. The pure antioestrogen, ICI 182 780, revealed cross-resistance. Sequence analysis of the hormone-binding domain of the OR of both lines showed no differences, suggesting that either mutations in other regions of the OR are involved in the TAM-resistance phenotype or that mechanisms outside of this protein induced this phenotype. Oestrogen and anti-oestrogen regulate pS 2 and cathepsin D expression in 3366 tumours as in the human breast cancer cell line MCF- 7.
