This study hypothesizes that since dividends represent a tax disadvantaged form of income relative to capital gains, then in response to an increase in incremental <b>tax</b> <b>costs,</b> corporations would decrease their dividend payout ratios. The response is expected to be stronger for corporations owned by shareholders with long investment horizons because the <b>tax</b> <b>cost</b> saved from decreasing dividend payout ratios is an increasing function of shareholders’ investment horizon.

This paper reexamines the tax mo-tivation for discounts via a nontraditional interpretation of the <b>tax</b> <b>costs.</b> In particular, this study estimates the cost to investors of lost tax options when fund management realizes and distributes gains that accumulate after the investor enters the fund. The study also compliments the earlier study by Malkiel (1977) who estimated the <b>tax</b> <b>cost</b> of unrealized appre-ciation that exists at the time of the investment in a closed-end fund.

40|$|This {{research}} {{considers the}} net {{effects of the}} tax system complexity in Australia, at the federal government level. The net effects of tax system complexity have been defined as both the short- and long-term effects of <b>tax</b> operating <b>costs</b> on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Since annual estimates of <b>tax</b> compliance <b>costs</b> from empirical studies are not available, an alternative method to estimate <b>tax</b> compliance <b>costs</b> must first be provided. A state space and Kalman filter model was employed to estimate a series of annual percentage changes in tax system complexity. A series of annual <b>tax</b> compliance <b>costs</b> can then be generated based on tax compliance survey results for 1995 (Evans et al. 1997) and the assumption that tax system complexity fundamentally explains why <b>tax</b> compliance <b>costs</b> change over time. A vector error-correction model (VECM) was constructed to analyse the net effects of tax system complexity given that VECM can estimate short- and long-term relationships simultaneously. A series of <b>tax</b> compliance <b>costs</b> for the period between financial years 1965  66 and 2011  12, was generated. The simulated data show that tax system complexity is highly persistent. <b>Tax</b> operating <b>costs</b> {{were found to have}} a negative effect on the gross domestic product (GDP) in the long run. It was estimated that a 1 % increase in real <b>tax</b> operating <b>costs</b> can lead to a 0. 122 % decrease in real GDP in the long run. The short-term relationships <b>tax</b> operating <b>costs</b> and the GDP were simulated based on the VECM. An initial decline in the GDP in response to an increased <b>tax</b> operating <b>costs</b> was evident and was followed by a steady recovery. Approximately seven years after the initial shock, the increase in <b>tax</b> operating <b>costs</b> can contribute to the GDP growth, but this positive relationship slowly dissolved over time. Finally, it was found that tax revenue had a slow diminishing tendency, which suggests that existing tax laws eventually become ineffective in raising revenue...|$|R
