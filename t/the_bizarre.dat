5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, Zappa {{continued}} {{to develop the}} business sides of his career. He and Herb Cohen formed <b>the</b> <b>Bizarre</b> Records and Straight Records labels, distributed by Warner Bros.

5|$|A {{number of}} factors, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>bizarre</b> facts and Cardozo's outstanding reputation, {{made the case}} prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to {{most if not all}} American law students in torts class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars in recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Another Green Wing {{series of}} running jokes is about hair. One {{of the more}} notable was various cracks about Mac's untidy hair, with Sue lending him a hair tie and hair clips before he goes in for an interview. Another was the {{character}} Karen getting her hair trapped in a printer in the first episode. Mac was {{often referred to as}} a Ginger by the other characters. Guy's hair becomes gradually curlier as the series goes on and Rachel dyes her hair from blonde to brunette after the first series. Other recurring jokes include Boyce's practical jokes, <b>the</b> <b>bizarre</b> games played by the human resources staff and surgery scenes where Caroline, Guy and Mac mess around while performing operations.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Holman Hardt {{is actually the}} one controlling the weather. All of <b>the</b> <b>bizarre</b> weather was the side-effect of his long-silent love for Sheila. He felt guilty that his weather-related problem caused Mootz to crash his car, so he would cause it to rain for Mootz. Once he realized Mootz had been drunk {{the night of the}} accident, however, he stopped. Unfortunately, Mulder begins to unintentionally attract Sheila, resulting in a massive thunderstorm that materializes due to the meteorologist's emotions. At the town's high school reunion, however, Hardt admits his love for Sheila, who accepts him. The storm stops, and Hardt and Sheila live happily ever after.|$|E

They later find where Carys lives and arrives there before she could harm a postman. When she tries to escape, Owen traps her using a portable prison cell, much to Jack's chagrin, as he forbids the removal of alien technology from Torchwood's base without his permission.|$|E

5|$|Anning's discoveries became key {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} for extinction. Georges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of mammals such as mammoths. Nevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct—in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. Of <b>the</b> <b>bizarre</b> nature of the fossils found by Anning, some, such as the plesiosaur, so unlike any known living creature, struck a major blow against this idea.|$|E
5|$|Cranial display features, {{such as the}} one {{possessed by}} Cryolophosaurus, make sense in social, gregarious animals, where other members of the species are {{available}} to observe and interpret messages of sexual status. Kevin Padian et al. (2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of bizarre cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian et al. noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures {{can be explained by the}} phenomenon of intra-species recognition, which is supported by the fossil evidence. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. (2010) found that <b>the</b> <b>bizarre</b> crest of Cryolophosaurus was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture. According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating.|$|E

5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is coincidentally in the area, {{taking a}} {{vacation}} in Maine. After stumbling upon the carnage in the grocery store, Scully telephones Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and describes <b>the</b> <b>bizarre</b> situation. Mulder tells Scully that the incident might {{be the result of}} witchcraft or sorcery. Scully, however, can find no physical evidence that might support his theory. Assisted by the local police, Scully reviews the store's surveillance footage and notices Melissa Turner leaving the scene, the only customer unaffected. Jack Bonsaint, the police chief, tells Scully that some townspeople believe Melissa to be a witch. Deputy Buddy Riggs informs Melissa that Bonsaint will be questioning her. Riggs promises to help Melissa, but she warns him to stay away.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{during three}} flybys by Cassini on February 17, March 9, and July 14, 2005, {{revealed}} Enceladus' surface features in much greater detail than the Voyager 2 observations. The smooth plains, which Voyager 2 had observed, resolved into relatively crater-free regions filled with numerous small ridges and scarps. Numerous fractures were {{found within the}} older, cratered terrain, suggesting that the surface {{has been subjected to}} extensive deformation since the craters were formed. Some areas contain no craters, indicating major resurfacing events in the geologically recent past. There are fissures, plains, corrugated terrain and other crustal deformations. Several additional regions of young terrain were discovered in areas not well-imaged by either Voyager spacecraft, such as <b>the</b> <b>bizarre</b> terrain near the south pole. All of this indicates that Enceladus's interior may be liquid today, even though it should have been frozen long ago.|$|E
5|$|The mid-to-late 1970s saw {{a decline}} in Celtic's European achievements, with first-round exits in the European Cup against Olympiacos in 1974 and in the UEFA Cup against Wisła Kraków in 1976. In between these very brief campaigns, Celtic reached the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup in season 1975–76, but disappointingly were knocked out by East German side Sachsenring Zwickau, whose play was unimpressive despite winning the tie. The tie is best remembered for <b>the</b> <b>bizarre</b> {{situation}} where young Roy Aitken had to be 'adopted' by Celtic {{to be allowed to}} enter East Germany to play the away leg. At only 17 years old, the authorities there did not consider him to be an adult.

25|$|These {{developments}} {{coincided with}} the outbreak of World War I. Between 1914 and summer 1916, when Romania was still neutral territory, Ciprian's efforts of circulating <b>the</b> <b>Bizarre</b> Pages may have reached a peak. Urmuz's texts were probably spread around in handwritten copies, becoming somewhat familiar to Bucharest's bohemian society, but Urmuz himself was still an anonymous figure. Both Ciprian and fellow actor Grigore Mărculescu {{are said to have}} given public readings from <b>the</b> <b>Bizarre</b> Pages at Casa Capșa restaurant. According to literary historian Paul Cernat, if rumors about Ciprian's early performances of Urmuz's texts are true, it would constitute one of the first samples of avant-garde shows in Romanian theatrical tradition.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, a {{literary}} underground, reacting against the communist worldview, {{began to emerge}} at various locations in Romania. It tried to reconnect with modernism, {{and in the process}} rediscovered Urmuz. Inside the meta- and autofictional group known as the Târgoviște School, Urmuz's style was mainly perpetuated by Mircea Horia Simionescu. <b>The</b> <b>Bizarre</b> Pages also inspired some other writers in the same group: Radu Petrescu, Costache Olăreanu and the Bessarabian-born Tudor Țopa. Elsewhere, Urmuz's work rekindled Romania's new poetry and prose, influencing some of the Onirist and post-Surrealist writers—from Leonid Dimov, Vintilă Ivănceanu and Dumitru Țepeneag to Iordan Chimet and Emil Brumaru. An icon of neo-modernist poetry was Nichita Stănescu, whose contributions include tributes to Urmuz and pastiches of his writings, hosted by Manuscriptum in 1983. Between 1960 and 1980, <b>the</b> <b>Bizarre</b> Pages also stimulated the work of isolated modernist authors, such as Marin Sorescu, Marius Tupan, Mihai Ursachi and, especially, Șerban Foarță.|$|E
