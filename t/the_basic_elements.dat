5|$|Modern {{research}} on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, {{partly because of the}} variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.|$|E
5|$|All spoken {{languages}} have phonemes of {{at least}} two different categories, vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables. As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called suprasegmental. Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes. In sign languages, the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.|$|E
5|$|Spacetimes are the arenas {{in which}} all {{physical}} events take place—an event is a point in spacetime specified by its time and place. <b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of spacetime are events. In any given spacetime, an event is a unique position at a unique time. Because events are spacetime points, in classical relativistic physics, the location of an elementary (point-like) particle {{at a particular time}} can be written as (x, y, z, t). A spacetime is the union of all events {{in the same way that}} a line is the union of all of its points, formally organized into a manifold.|$|E

40|$|A micromechanical {{acceleration}} sensor comprises a <b>basic</b> <b>element</b> and a seismic mass element suspended in a spring, the relative position between the said sensor and <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>element</b> being detected by a capacitive detector. To prevent the movable structural {{parts of the}} {{acceleration sensor}} from adhering to <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>element</b> without having to accept any impairment in measuring sensitivity, the capacitive detector is designed {{in the form of}} an interdigital capacitor whose capacitor elements are arranged in a single plane alternately and adjacently, perpendicular in the direction of the acceleration to be measured...|$|R
25|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> {{required}} for the modern analog subtractive synthesizers— audio oscillators, audio filters, envelope controllers, and various effects units — had already appeared and were utilized in several electronic instruments.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, {{physicists}} Jim Peebles in the US and Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and collaborators in the USSR independently computed the non-equilibrium recombination {{history of}} hydrogen. <b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> {{of the model}} are the following.|$|E
25|$|Stanley Porter {{argues that}} Mithraism took hold within the Roman Empire after its {{expansion}} and only reached Asia Minor via Roman {{soldiers in the}} latter part of the first century, after <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of the gospels were in place, and hence could not have influenced their essential elements.|$|E
2500|$|As aural/oral {{learning}} is <b>the</b> most <b>basic</b> <b>element</b> of discrimination learning, generalization is <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>element</b> of inference learning. Generalization consists aural/oral learning, verbal learning, symbolic reading, and writing. At the generalization level of learning, students may listen to sets of familiar and unfamiliar tonal or rhythmic patterns and {{determine whether the}} patterns are the same or different, ultimately reading familiar and unfamiliar patterns, as well.|$|R

50|$|A fireteam is <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>element</b> of <b>the</b> Marine Special Operations Regiment. Like fireteams in the infantry, MSOR fireteams {{consist of}} four Marines; a team leader/grenadier, an {{automatic}} rifleman, an assistant automatic rifleman and a rifleman.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo. The {{tones of}} a melody are usually drawn from pitch {{systems such as}} scales or modes. Melody may consist, to {{increasing}} degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.|$|E
25|$|The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Clarify Some Issues About the So-Called Psychopathic Personality is a {{book written}} by American {{psychiatrist}} Hervey M. Cleckley, first published in 1941, describing Cleckley's clinical interviews with patients in a locked institution. The text {{is considered to be}} a seminal work and the most influential clinical description of psychopathy in the twentieth century. <b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of psychopathy outlined by Cleckley are still relevant today.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} difficult for any scholar {{to construct a}} portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of his life. On the other hand, scholars such as N. T. Wright and Luke Timothy Johnson argue {{that the image of}} Jesus presented in the gospels is largely accurate, and that dissenting scholars are simply too cautious about what we can claim to know about the ancient era.|$|E
50|$|Abrams {{promoted}} an {{idea that}} electrons were <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>element</b> of all life. He called this ERA, for Electronic Reactions of Abrams, and introduced {{a number of different}} machines which he claimed were based on these principles.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of art—the line, {{particle}} of color—like {{words could}} be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. The line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an calculable abstract value, {{in addition to}} the particles of color and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim, something Divisionists like the Metzinger would push to the extreme, would have a lasting affect on the works produced in the coming years by Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and Gino Severini.|$|E
25|$|Monodisperse powders of {{colloidal}} silica, for example, {{may therefore}} be stabilized sufficiently {{to ensure a}} high degree of order in the colloidal crystal or polycrystalline colloidal solid which results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established. Such defective polycrystalline structures would appear to be <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of nanoscale materials science, and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in inorganic systems such as sintered ceramic nanomaterials.|$|E
25|$|Base score: The base {{score was}} the default Start Value of the routine, {{provided}} the gymnast fulfilled all required elements. This {{changed over the}} years and tended to lower as the codes went on. For instance, for the 1992-1996 code, a base score of 9.4 was awarded if all of <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> were fulfilled. For the 1996-2000 code, the base score was a 9.0. Finally, a base score of 8.8 was awarded for the 2000-2004 Olympic years. Before the new code, the base score again dropped to an 8.6 but this was not adopted {{for a very long time}} (only 2005-2006).|$|E

25|$|Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC in 1979. He {{was excited}} by the revolutionary mouse-driven GUI of the Xerox Alto and was keen to use these ideas back at Apple. By late 1979, Jobs {{successfully}} negotiated with Xerox for his Lisa team to receive two demonstrations of ongoing research projects at Xerox PARC; when the Apple team saw the demonstration of the Alto computer {{they were able to}} see in action <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of what constituted a workable GUI. A great deal of work was put into making the graphical interface into a mainstream commercial product by the Lisa team.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of hip-hop—boasting raps, rival posses, uptown throwdowns, and {{political}} commentary—were all present in Trinidadian music {{as long ago}} as the 1800s, though they did not reach the form of commercial recordings until the 1920s and 30s. Calypso like other forms of music continued to evolve through the 50s and 60s. When rocksteady and reggae bands looked to make their music a form of national and even international black resistance, they took calypso's example. Calypso itself, like Jamaican music, moved {{back and forth between the}} predominance of boasting and toasting songs packed with 'slackness' and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, 'conscious' style.|$|E
25|$|The khachkars {{created by}} the carver Pavgos in Goshavank stand out among the rest. The best {{of them is a}} 1291 khachkar with the maker’s name carved in the bottom left star, {{which is one of the}} most {{intricate}} examples in existence. The finely carved lacy ornaments are arranged in layers in which <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of the composition — a cross on a shield-shaped rosette and eight-pointed Starr filling the corners of the middle-cross section—show clearly. The intricate openwork ornaments vary — a clear-cut geometrical pattern constitutes the background, and the accentuating elements form a complicated combination of a floral and geometrical ornament which never repeats itself.|$|E

50|$|The rule {{in cases}} {{involving}} such offenses is that <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>element</b> can be proved in the usual way, but the element of specific intent must be shown using a more subjective than objective test so that the legislature's express requirement {{can be seen to}} be satisfied.|$|R
25|$|After Mort Weisinger {{took over}} {{as editor of the}} Superboy comics in 1953, the mythology of Superman began growing, {{starting}} with the introduction of Superboy's pet Krypto the Superdog, the first survivor of Krypton in comics other than Kal-El himself. When Weisinger became editor of the entire Superman line in 1958, the Superman mythology began expanding even more rapidly. Producing over a hundred Superman stories a year, Weisinger aimed to introduce a new element to the character's mythology every six months. By this time, <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of Superman's origin were in place, and Weisinger capitalized on it. Weisinger and his writers gave Superman history and family and constructed a world for readers to explore.|$|E
25|$|Held {{that the}} Constitution of India which is {{essentially}} a social rather than a political document, is founded on a social philosophy and as such has two main features basic and circumstantial. The basic constituent remained constant, the circumstantial was subject to change. According to the learned Judges, the broad contours of <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> and the fundamental features of the Constitution are delineated in the preamble and the Parliament has no power to abolish or emasculate those basic elements of fundamental features. The building of a welfare State is {{the ultimate goal of}} every Government {{but that does not mean}} that in order to build a welfare State, human freedoms have to suffer a total destruction. Applying these tests, the learned Judges invalidated Article 31C even in its un-amended form.|$|E
25|$|Anxious to {{pay homage}} to Stalin, Albania's rulers {{implemented}} elements of the Stalinist economic system. In 1949 Albania adopted <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>elements</b> of the Soviet fiscal system, under which state enterprises paid direct contributions to the treasury from their profits and kept only a share authorized for self-financed investments and other purposes. In 1951 the Albanian government launched its first five-year plan, which emphasized exploiting the country's oil, chromite, copper, nickel, asphalt, and coal resources; expanding electricity production and the power grid; increasing agricultural output; and improving transportation. The government began a program of rapid industrialization after the APL's Second Party Congress and a campaign of forced collectivization of farmland in 1955. At the time, private farms still produced about 87% of Albania's agricultural output, but by 1960 the same percentage came from collective or state farms.|$|E
