5|$|After {{retirement}} as a player, Wormull joined <b>the</b> <b>coaching</b> {{staff of}} Isthmian League club Lewes, {{where he was}} first-team manager from January 2012 {{to the end of}} the 2012–13 season.

5|$|After the hot start, a {{prolonged}} slump through January and February occurred {{during which the}} Senators won only seven of 21 games, and Murray fired Head Coach Paddock and Assistant Coach Ron Low on February 27, 2008, taking over <b>the</b> <b>coaching</b> duties himself. After <b>the</b> <b>coaching</b> switch, team performance improved but did not match {{the performance of the}} beginning of the season. A playoff spot was in doubt until the Senators' last game of the season, a loss to Boston, but the team qualified due to the Carolina Hurricanes losing. After all other games were played, the team ended up as the seventh seed and faced the Pittsburgh Penguins in the opening round, a repeat of the 2007 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. The Senators lost the series four games to none, the third time they were swept in a first-round series. The result, after going to the Finals the previous season, led to speculation by the media that the team would make a large change in personnel before next season, including the buy-out of Ray Emery and the Senators not re-signing their free agents.|$|E

30|$|In {{line with}} the extant {{commitment}} literature, we conceptualize commitment to <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> as a strong belief in the goals and values (normative); a willingness to exert considerable effort on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> (affective); and {{a strong desire to}} continue working (continuance) with <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> (Mowday et al. 1979; Sturges et al. 2005). In this manner, commitment refers to a sense of duty that a student-athlete feels to achieve <b>the</b> <b>coach’s</b> goals and to the willingness to do what is needed to perform well (Kline and Peters 1991). Such cohesion and identification with <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> emerges, for instance, when <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> properly demonstrates leadership in leading the team to success (Carron et al. 2002).|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms that one can do to practice co-coaching. One form involves each individual taking turns to be coach in half hour sessions. [...] With this example, <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> <b>coaches</b> <b>the</b> coachee for a half hour, while the coachee is being coached. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> practices their <b>coaching</b> techniques, while <b>the</b> coachee ultimately gives feedback to <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> on how they are doing (both good and bad). After <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> finishes, <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> becomes <b>the</b> coachee and the previous coachee becomes <b>the</b> <b>coach.</b> This process of half hour sessions utilizes a quick feedback tool for self development in coaching. Even though this is one form, other forms with the basic technique of a coach and coachee are applicable so long as each person gets their turn and receives feedback from their own performance from the other individual.|$|R
