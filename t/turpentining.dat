60|$|And now, {{working in}} my rooms, white-leading and <b>turpentining,</b> {{is another one}} of them. I have learned his name. It is Arthur Deacon. He is the pallid, furtive-eyed man whom I {{observed}} the first day when the men were routed out of the forecastle to man the windlass--the man I so instantly adjudged a drug-fiend. He certainly looks it.|$|E
60|$|Of {{the men who}} did the <b>turpentining</b> and white-leading {{there have}} been four. Two of them were quickly {{rejected}} by Miss West as not being up to the work. The first one, Steve Roberts, which he told me was his name, is an interesting fellow. I talked with him quite a bit ere Miss West sent him packing and told Mr. Pike that she wanted a real sailor.|$|E
60|$|It was {{in truth}} a shabby house outside, with very dim parlour windows and very small show of blinds, and very dirty muslin {{curtains}} dangling across the lower panes on very loose and limp strings. Neither, {{when the door}} was opened, did the inside appear to belie the outward promise, as there was faded carpeting on the stairs and faded oil-cloth in the passage; in addition to which discomforts a gentleman Ruler was smoking hard in the front parlour (though {{it was not yet}} noon), while the lady of the house was busily engaged in <b>turpentining</b> the disjointed fragments of a tent-bedstead {{at the door of the}} back parlour, as if in preparation for the reception of some new lodger who had been fortunate enough to engage it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Turpentine</b> (also called {{spirit of}} <b>turpentine,</b> oil of <b>turpentine,</b> wood <b>turpentine</b> and colloquially turps) is a fluid {{obtained}} by the distillation of resin obtained from live trees, mainly pines. It is mainly used as a solvent and {{as a source of}} materials for organic synthesis.|$|R

50|$|Native Americans {{used this}} site as {{evidenced}} by the fairly widespread shell mounds. During the 1920s, a steamboat stop provided wood and water to citrus loaded ships. The area was also used as a post office for the towns of Pomona and Cisco. The 6,000-acre property was the site of <b>turpentining,</b> logging, cattle ranching and farming operations within the last century. Located south of a sharp bend in the St. Johns River, the park was added to the state park system in October 2001.|$|E
5000|$|Gerry's {{research}} in the area of southern pines and <b>turpentining</b> proved to be her most influential efforts. Working in Mississippi, Gerry performed pioneering work in microscopical studies of the anatomy of resin-yielding pines, and successfully developed methods to increase yield as well as prolong the working life of trees. She worked toward developing best methods stating, [...] "The microscope reveals many secrets concerning the activities of the tree in producing turpentine and gives these results more quickly than experimental methods alone." [...] Based on her field-based research, Gerry was able to develop a program of [...] "More turpentine, less scar, better pine" [...] that many later attributed as a savior for the struggling industry.|$|E
50|$|The torches run on <b>turpentine.</b> <b>Turpentine</b> {{is used in}} the torches {{because it}} burns {{brighter}} than kerosene. People don't use <b>turpentine</b> in lamps because it is far too volatile to be used in that manner.|$|R

50|$|The word <b>turpentine</b> derives (via French and Latin) {{from the}} Greek word τερεβινθίνη terebinthine, {{the name of}} a species of tree, the terebinth tree. Mineral <b>turpentine</b> or other {{petroleum}} distillates are used to replace <b>turpentine,</b> but they are very different chemically.|$|R
5000|$|Colt Creek State Park is a State Park in Central Florida, 16 mi {{north of}} Lakeland off of State Road 471. It became {{open to the}} public in January 2007. Colt Creek was {{purchased}} from the Overstreet family in May 2006. This 5,067 acre park nestled within the Green Swamp Wilderness Area and named after one of the tributaries that flows through the property was opened to the public on January 20, 2007. For over 60 years this property was managed as a cattle ranch by the Overstreet family. Past activities on the land included lime rock mining, timber harvesting, citrus production and <b>turpentining.</b> Composed mainly of pine flatwoods, cypress domes and open pasture land, this piece of pristine wilderness is home to many animal species including the American bald eagle, Sherman's fox squirrel, gopher tortoise, white-tailed deer, wild turkey and bobcat.|$|E

40|$|The "warts" which tar elicits on rabbit skin (papillomas, carcinomatoids, frill horns) {{are true}} tumors, benign growths {{expressive}} of slight yet irreversible deviations of epidermal {{cells from the}} normal. The neoplastic condition gives the cells a superiority over their neighbors when both are submitted to the same encouraging influences, and then they proliferate into tumors. Their state entails such disabilities, though, that {{they are unable to}} maintain themselves under ordinary circumstances, and consequently growths composed of them disappear when no longer aided. Often the neoplastic cells resume the normal aspect and habit of life long before the tumor mass is gone; and they may persist as part of an apparently normal epidermis, retaining their neoplastic potentialities for months after all signs of the growth have disappeared. In these instances it can be made to appear again, sometimes repeatedly, by non-carcinogenic stimulation of the skin (wound healing, <b>turpentining).</b> There is reason however to suppose that in the end the tumor cells, unless helped, die or are cast off. It is plain that the neoplastic state does not necessarily connote independence of behavior or success in tumor formation. On the contrary it may render cells unable to survive or endow them with powers which they can exert only under favoring conditions. This is the case with the cells composing the tar warts of rabbits. In the lack of such conditions the cells of these growths do not manifest themselves but remain in a subthreshold neoplastic state, whereas if aided they form neoplasms. The deviations from the normal represented by the benign tar tumors of rabbits are slight and limited in character, but further deviations in larger variety may be superimposed upon them, with result in malignant tumors, growths possessed of a greater, though not always absolute, independence. Tar cancers usually come about in this way, by successive, step-like deviations from the normal, and so also do the cancers which derive from virus-induced papillomas as well as many human carcinomas. After cells have become cancerous they frequently undergo further changes, some apparently step-like in character, and all taking the direction of greater malignancy. The hypotheses that tumors are due to somatic mutations and to viruses respectively are discussed in the light of these phenomena...|$|E

50|$|The {{plate is}} removed from the acid and washed over with water to remove the acid. The ground is removed with a solvent such as <b>turpentine.</b> <b>Turpentine</b> is often removed from the plate using {{methylated}} spirits since <b>turpentine</b> is greasy and can affect the application of ink and the printing of the plate.|$|R
50|$|Existing records {{indicate}} that the production of naval supplies including <b>turpentine</b> and tar were very important in the local economy during the 19th century. With {{the invention of the}} steam engine, the demand for tar and <b>turpentine</b> slowly evaporated as fewer wooden ships were constructed. Many distillers of <b>turpentine</b> turned to the production of moonshine to make ends meet.|$|R
50|$|<b>Turpentine</b> Creek has {{an on-site}} Veterinary Hospital {{for the animals}} who reside at <b>Turpentine</b> Creek. The vet {{hospital}} is on <b>Turpentine</b> Creek's property and makes giving the animals medical attention easier.

5000|$|Pine {{trees on}} Cape St. George Island were [...] "catfaced" [...] {{used to make}} <b>turpentine</b> from 1910 through 1916. During World War II the island served as a {{practice}} gunnery range for B-24 bombers stationed in nearby Apalachicola. From 1950 through 1956 the pine trees were again harvested for <b>turpentine.</b> The old buildings of the <b>turpentine</b> camp are still in existence at the Government Dock.|$|R
50|$|Mineral {{spirits are}} an {{inexpensive}} petroleum-based {{replacement for the}} vegetable-based <b>turpentine.</b> It is commonly used as a paint thinner for oil-based paint and cleaning brushes, and as an organic solvent in other applications. Mineral <b>turpentine</b> is chemically very different from <b>turpentine,</b> which mainly consists of pinene, and it has inferior solvent properties. Artists use mineral spirits {{as an alternative to}} <b>turpentine</b> since it is less flammable and less toxic. Because of interactions with pigments in oil paints, artists require a higher grade of mineral spirits than many industrial users, including the complete absence of residual sulfur.|$|R
50|$|The {{two primary}} uses of <b>turpentine</b> in {{industry}} {{are as a}} solvent and {{as a source of}} materials for organic synthesis. As a solvent, <b>turpentine</b> is used for thinning oil-based paints, for producing varnishes, and as a raw material for the chemical industry. Its industrial use as a solvent in industrialized nations has largely been replaced by the much cheaper <b>turpentine</b> substitutes distilled from crude oil. <b>Turpentine</b> has long been used as a solvent, mixed with beeswax or with carnauba wax, to make fine furniture wax for use as a protective coating over oiled wood finishes (e.g., tung oil).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Turpentine</b> is {{also added}} to many {{cleaning}} and sanitary products {{due to its}} antiseptic properties and its [...] "clean scent." [...] In early 19th-century America, <b>turpentine</b> was sometimes burned in lamps as a cheap alternative to whale oil. It was most commonly used for outdoor lighting, due to its strong odour. A blend of ethanol and <b>turpentine</b> added as an illuminant called burning fluid was also important for several decades. In 1946, Soichiro Honda used <b>turpentine</b> as a fuel for the first Honda motorcycles as gasoline was almost totally unavailable in Japan following World War II.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, natural (organic) <b>turpentine</b> {{was used}} as the thinner or solvent, but has been {{replaced}} by several mineral-based <b>turpentine</b> substitutes such as white spirit or [...] "paint thinner", also known as [...] "mineral spirit".|$|R
60|$|<b>Turpentine</b> and Resin.--Turpentine is {{the juice}} {{secreted}} by the pine, fir, or larch tree, in blisters under the bark; {{the trees are}} tapped {{for the purpose of}} obtaining it. Resin is <b>turpentine</b> boiled down.|$|R
50|$|<b>Turpentine</b> is {{also used}} {{as a source of}} raw {{materials}} in the synthesis of fragrant chemical compounds. Commercially used camphor, linalool, alpha-terpineol, and geraniol are all usually produced from alpha-pinene and beta-pinene, which are two of the chief chemical components of <b>turpentine.</b> These pinenes are separated and purified by distillation. The mixture of diterpenes and triterpenes that is left as residue after <b>turpentine</b> distillation is sold as rosin.|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{production}} of oil and <b>turpentine</b> in the effluent from the plug screw feeder {{at the exit from}} the presteamer of a fibreboard pilot plant was determined after a steady state of operation had been reached. From these data, the recovery of <b>turpentine</b> from the plug screw feeder effluent, as a proportion of that available in the wood chips, was shown to be 27 %. <b>Turpentine</b> levels in wood of Pinus radiata D.
