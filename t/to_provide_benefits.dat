5|$|As a {{registered}} charity, Stonyhurst is obliged <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>benefits</b> {{to the wider}} community {{under the terms of}} the Charities Act 2006. As such, the College is home to the local Catholic parish church, which receives worshippers from Hurst Green every day. Its sports facilities, including the swimming pool and all-weather pitch are available for public use; the latter was used for competitors training for the London 2012 Olympic Games. Much of the estate has public access; in particular the gardens and tea house are visited during the summer months, whilst the college plays host to tours, antiques fairs, food festivals, music concerts, conferences and weddings. The school has relationships with several state schools, arranging shared activities with their pupils, in particular those serving special needs children. In addition, the school makes available some places to pupils offered on scholarship, bursaries or free of charge; almost a third of current pupils receive financial support for their places.|$|E

25|$|American Motors {{was forced}} to {{constantly}} innovate for 33 years until Chrysler absorbed it in 1987. The lessons learned from this experience were integrated into the company that bought AMC. The organization, strategies, {{as well as several}} key executives allowed Chrysler to gain an edge on the competition. Even today, the lessons gained from the AMC experience continue <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>benefits</b> to other firms in the industry. There are a number of legacies from AMC's business strategies.|$|E

25|$|Some scholars, such as Haveman and Beresford, {{therefore}} {{argue that}} any policies {{aimed at reducing}} occupational inequality must focus on culture changes. According to Haveman and Beresford, people in the United States have historically tended to reject policies that only support one group (unless that group is them). Therefore, effective policies for limiting occupational segregation must aim <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>benefits</b> across groups. Therefore, policies that aim at capping work hours for salaried workers or mandate on-site employer sponsored childcare might be most effective.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} {{circular}} migration {{and its relation}} to development is especially relevant today. First, understanding the importance of transnationalism and the temporary and repetitive movement of migrants between countries has facilitated new thinking, specifically with regards to remittances and organized labor schemes. Second, the “win-win-win” discourse is being considered seriously as a potential option for development <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>benefits</b> for all parties involved. Third, in the current political climate many parts of the developed world are against migration, so circular migration is an option that policy makers believe is more in touch with public opinion. Lastly, advances in technology have enabled government officials to monitor migrants as they move between their home and host countries.|$|E
500|$|Congress had {{expressed}} concern about possible misuse of the blue discharge when it began work on the G.I. Bill in 1944. In discussions about the legislation's details, the American Legion insisted on a specific provision <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>benefits</b> to veterans discharged under any circumstance other than dishonorable. The Legion believed {{a large number of}} veterans had been given blue and other less-than-honorable discharges for reasons that it considered unreasonable or trivial. In testimony before the United States Senate, Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs strongly opposed this provision {{on the grounds that it}} would undermine morale and remove any incentive to maintain a good service record. Senator Bennett Champ Clark, a sponsor of the bill, dismissed his concerns, calling them [...] "some of the most stupid, short-sighted objections which could be raised". Clark went on to say: ...|$|E

2500|$|UK {{occupational}} {{pension schemes}} are typically jointly {{funded by the}} employer and the employees.

Contributions are typically put into a separate trust, whose assets will be used <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>benefits</b> in due course.|$|E

2500|$|In {{determining}} a bid, Medicare Advantage {{plans are}} required to offer a benefit “package” that is at least equal to Original Medicare’s and cover everything Medicare covers, {{but they do not}} have to cover every benefit in the same way. For example, plans that require higher out-of-pocket costs than Original Medicare for some benefits, such as skilled nursing facility care, can balance their benefits package by offering lower copayments for doctor visits [...] but CMS limits the extent to which Medicare Advantage plans’ cost-sharing can vary from the cost-sharing under Original Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans that receive “rebates” or quality-based bonus payments {{are required to}} use the money <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>benefits</b> not covered by Original Medicare.|$|E

NLP is [...] an open field of training with no [...] "official" [...] best practice. With different authors, individual trainers and practitioners having developed their own methods, concepts and labels, often branding them as NLP, the training standards and quality differ greatly.

2500|$|Title I {{requires}} {{the coverage of}} and also limits restrictions that a group health plan can place on benefits for preexisting conditions. Group health plans may refuse <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>benefits</b> relating to preexisting conditions {{for a period of}} 12 months after enrollment in the plan or 18 months in the case of late enrollment. [...] Title I allows individuals to reduce the exclusion period by {{the amount of time that}} they had [...] "creditable coverage" [...] prior to enrolling in the plan and after any [...] "significant breaks" [...] in coverage. [...] "Creditable coverage" [...] is defined quite broadly and includes nearly all group and individual health plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. A [...] "significant break" [...] in coverage is defined as any 63-day period without any creditable coverage. Along with an exception, allowing employers to tie premiums or co-payments to tobacco use, or body mass index.|$|E

2500|$|A {{collaborative}} management {{process has}} had some success in the Bwindi National Park. The forest was gazetted to National Park in 1991; this occurred with little community consultation and the new status prohibited local people from accessing resources within the park as well as reduced economic opportunities. Subsequently, a number of forest fires were deliberately lit and threats {{were made to the}} gorillas. [...] To counteract this, three schemes <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>benefits</b> from existence of the forest communities and involve the local community in park management were developed. They included agreements allowing the controlled harvesting of resources in the park, receipt of some revenue from tourism and establishment of a trust fund partly for community development. Tension between people and park have been reduced and now there is more willingness to take part in gorilla protection. Surveys of community attitudes conducted by CARE show a steadily increasing proportion of the people in favour of the park. More than that there have been no cases of deliberate burning and the problem of snares in these areas has been reduced.|$|E
