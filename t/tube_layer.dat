The stipe is placed centrally to laterally, dimidiate with fan- to kidney-shaped caps or almost effused-reflexed, 1-4 cm wide, 1-5 mm thick, soft when fresh, brittle when dry. The upper surface of the cap is white in young specimens, but becomes yellowish with age, at first finely tomentose, with age more adpressed and semi-glabrous, often somewhat wrinkled, usually azonate. When the stipe is present it is white to yellowish, measuring up to 4 cm long, and it is cylindric to flattened and expanded towards the cap. The colour of the pore surface is white to cream, and consists of tiny, angular pores numbering 4-5 per millimetre. The context in cap and stipe are white and comprise two layers: a hard inner or lower layer that {{is covered with a}} much looser layer, which may be agglutinated on the surface with age. The <b>tube</b> <b>layer</b> is the same colour as the pore surface, and up to 3 mm thick.The hyphal system is monomitic, containing only generative hyphae. These hyphae have clamp connections, which in the subhymenium and trama are thin-walled and 3-5 µm in diameter. In the context and especially the stipe, the hyphae are much more thick-walled and reminiscent of skeletal hyphae, but with scattered clamps. These hyphae are interpreted by Ryvarden as sclerified generative hyphae. Cystidia are variably present in the hymenium. They are often difficult to observe during microscopy. Their shape is ventricose to cylindrical, and they are thin-walled, measuring 15-25 by 5-6.5 µm. The basidia are broadly club-shaped, and have four sterigmata. They have a basal clamp, and measure 15-20 by 6-9 µm. The shape of the spores ranges from broadly ellipsoid to egg-shaped to more or less spherical, and measure 4.5-6 by 4-5 µm.
