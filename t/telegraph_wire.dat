5|$|Until 1864, {{communications}} between Fort Greble {{and its neighbors}} had to be routed through departmental headquarters in Washington. After {{a test of the}} system completely failed, efforts were made to establish signaling points between the forts, and the forts themselves were connected to Washington via <b>telegraph</b> <b>wire.</b> Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton, near Uniontown, and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} that {{followed}} the completion of the fort, numerous telegraph lines were laid between Fort Corcoran, War Department offices in Washington, and other forts in Northern Virginia. According to a July 1863 report on the operations of the military telegraphs in the Army of the Potomac, six telegraph lines ran between Fort Corcoran and Washington, five between Corcoran and Fort Ethan Allen, two between Corcoran and Alexandria, and one each to two observation points southwest of the fort. Throughout the remainder of the war, Fort Corcoran remained an important communications center for the entire Arlington Line system of defenses, eventually connecting to over 30miles of <b>telegraph</b> <b>wire</b> at the time of Robert E. Lee's surrender.|$|E

25|$|The Signal Corps' {{role in the}} Spanish–American War of 1898 and the {{subsequent}} Philippine Insurrection was on a grander scale {{than it had been}} in the Civil War. In addition to visual signaling, including heliograph, the corps supplied telephone and <b>telegraph</b> <b>wire</b> lines and cable communications, fostered the use of telephones in combat, employed combat photography, and renewed the use of balloons. Shortly after the war, the Signal Corps constructed the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS) also known as the Alaska Communications System (ACS), introducing the first wireless telegraph in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|A {{fire alarm}} box is an outdoor device used for notifying a fire {{department}} of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system and were the main method of calling the fire department to a neighborhood {{in the days before}} people had telephones. When the box is triggered, a spring-loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal onto the fire alarm <b>telegraph</b> <b>wire,</b> indicating the box number. The receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the neighborhood. The municipal fire alarm system got its start in Massachusetts. It was invented by Moses G. Farmer, an engineer, and Dr. William Channing, a Harvard-educated Bostonian. Their revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40 miles of wire and 45 boxes in Boston.|$|E
25|$|Brown's men {{needed to}} capture the weapons and escape before word could be sent to Washington. The raid was going well for Brown's men. They cut the <b>telegraph</b> <b>wire</b> and seized a Baltimore & Ohio train passing through. A free black man was the first {{casualty}} of the raid. Hayward Shepherd, an African-American baggage handler on the train, confronted the raiders; they shot and killed him. For some reason, Brown let the train continue, and the conductor alerted the authorities down the line. Brown had been sure that he would win the support of local slaves in joining the rebellion, but a massive uprising did not occur, because word had not been spread about the uprising, so the slaves nearby {{did not know about}} it. Although the white townspeople soon began to fight back against the raiders, Brown's men succeeded in capturing the armory that evening.|$|E

500|$|For {{several years}} the arsenal, which {{was owned by}} the federal government, served as a simple arms depot and was staffed with {{only a handful of}} soldiers. But in November 1860, with the American Civil War on the horizon, a company of the Second United States Artillery, {{consisting}} of sixty-five men, was transferred to Little Rock under the command of Captain James Totten. On January 15, 1861, the state legislature decided to hold a referendum to determine if a state convention should be held to consider the issue of secession and to elect delegates to such a convention. It was planned for February 18; however, events at the arsenal, would not wait. On January 28, then Governor Henry Massey Rector informed Captain Totten that he and his soldiers would be [...] "permitted to remain in the possession of the Federal officers until the State, by authority of the people, shall have determined to sever their connection with the General Government," [...] Totten responded to this by telling the Governor that his orders came from the United States Government and began a desperate but ultimately futile dispatch of letters and telegrams asking for reinforcements, although rumors were widely spread that they were already coming. The first <b>telegraph</b> <b>wire</b> to span between Little Rock and Memphis had recently been completed. Local attorney John M Harrel was asked to compose the first telegraph dispatched from Arkansas's capital. In his message, Harrel reported unconfirmed rumors that more federal troops had been sent to reinforce the Little Rock Arsenal.|$|E
