He added, [...] "People like the [...] media always try <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> we're mainstream. [...] Did you see that Simpsons episode? Chuck Liddell signs an autograph for somebody, and he says, 'That will be $45, please'. The sport isn't like that at all. Then the promoter of the show fights Marge Simpson in the octagon, sucker-punches her in the face, and then says, 'You're the only woman I've ever hit that I didn't love'. That's the way mainstream looks at us and thinks of us, and I know that." ...|$|E
500|$|Much {{time and}} focus {{were given to}} animals, {{especially}} the Siamese cats of which Manning was especially fond. She was {{very concerned about the}} health and comfort of her pets, taking them on visits to friends, along with hot water bottles for them in case the temperature dropped. She frequently sacked vets – telling one [...] "I do not pay you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{there is nothing wrong with}} my animal" [...] – and trying animal faith healers at times. [...] Additionally, she was a committed supporter of organisations combating animal cruelty. Her love and interest in cats was illustrated in her book Extraordinary Cats, published in 1967.|$|E

It remanded our whole association, which I had got to thinking so romantic, to the relation of teacher and pupil. It was a snub--a heartless, killing snub; and I couldn't see it in any other light." [...] Ransom walks away to the window, and looks out.|$|R

The captain of the troop <b>that</b> you belong <b>to,</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you and twenty other young fellows, all from Johannesburg, formed yourselves into a party of scouts, and are making war at your own expense, and that {{although}} {{in a certain way}} you joined his troop you really act independently when it so pleases you." ...|$|R
500|$|Murray {{was elected}} {{chief justice of}} the Howard Court of Peers, the highest student {{position}} at Howard, and in 1944 she was graduated first in her class. Traditionally, men who were graduated first in the class were awarded Julius Rosenwald Fellowships for graduate work at Harvard University, but that university did not accept women. Murray was rejected despite a letter of support from President Roosevelt. She wrote in response, [...] "I would gladly change my sex to meet your requirements, but since the way to such change has not been revealed to me, I have no recourse but to appeal to you to change your minds.

500|$|In December, {{the couple}} held an {{elaborate}} Christmas party at Brede, attended by Conrad, Henry James, H. G. Wells and other friends; it lasted several days. On December 29 Crane suffered a severe pulmonary hemorrhage. In January 1900 he'd recovered sufficiently {{to work on}} a new novel, The O'Ruddy, completing 25 of the 33chapters. Plans were made for him to travel as a correspondent to Gibraltar to write sketches from Saint Helena, the site of a Boer prison, {{but at the end of}} March and in early April he suffered two more hemorrhages. Taylor took over most of Crane's correspondence while he was ill, writing to friends for monetary aid. The couple planned to travel on the continent, but Conrad, upon visiting Crane for the last time, remarked that his friend's [...] "wasted face was enough <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it was the most forlorn of all hopes." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Homeless" [...] {{was written}} by Swedish {{songwriter}} Jörgen Elofsson, and produced by Steve Mac. It is an R power ballad, which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 50 seconds. The song was composed on common time in the key of B minor at 68beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by a piano and a guitar. Lewis's vocal range spans nearly two octaves from low note of A3 to the high note of B5. The song's lyrics revolve around Lewis singing about waiting for her boyfriend {{to come home to}} where she is waiting for him, but feels homeless without his presence. The opening lyrics are [...] "Wait here for you to call me/ For you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> ev'rything's a big mistake." [...] Nick Levine for Digital Spy described Lewis's vocals in the lyric [...] "In this cold I'm walking aimless, feeling helpless" [...] as [...] "a tour de force of despair and misery".|$|E

500|$|The nostalgic [...] "Memory Lane (Sittin' in da Park)" [...] {{contains}} a Reuben Wilson sample, which comprises {{the sound of}} a Hammond organ, guitar, vocals and percussion, and adds to the track's ghostly harmonies. Spence D. of IGN wrote that the lyrics evoke [...] "the crossroads of Old School and New School." [...] "One Love" [...] is composed of a series of letters to incarcerated friends, recounting mutual acquaintances and events that have occurred since the receiver's imprisonment, and address unfaithful girlfriends, emotionally tortured mothers, and underdog loyalty. The phrase [...] "one love" [...] signifies street loyalty in the song. After delivering [...] "shout-outs to locked down comrades", Nas chastises a youth who seems destined for prison in the final verse, [...] "Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul/Only twelve tryin <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he liked my style [...] Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above/Keep a eye out for Jake, shorty-wop, one love". Produced by Q-Tip, [...] "One Love" [...] samples the double bass and piano from the Heath Brothers' [...] "Smilin' Billy Suite Part II" [...] (1975) and the drum break from Parliament's [...] "Come In Out the Rain" [...] (1970), complementing the track's mystical and hypnotic soundscape.|$|E
500|$|By July, it was {{becoming}} obvious that the ice was likely to crush the Endurance, which creaked and trembled under the pressure, and Shackleton instructed Worsley {{to be prepared to}} quickly abandon ship if the need arose. Worsley was initially incredulous, asking Shackleton: [...] "You seriously mean <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the ship is doomed?" [...] Shackleton responded [...] "The ship can't live in this, Skipper." [...] Finally, on 24 October, the pressure of the ice caused the stern post of the Endurance to twist and the ship began to quickly let in water. After desperate attempts to fix the leak and pump the ship dry, Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship three days later. [...] Salvaging what essential supplies they could, the expedition set out on 30 October for Robertson Island, [...] to the northeast. After just three days, {{it was clear that the}} condition of the ice was too rough for sledging. Having travelled only a mile and a half (2.4km) from where the Endurance was sinking, they set up camp to wait for the ice to break up. Lumber and tents were salvaged from the crushed ship, which was still not fully submerged, and a reasonable camp, known as Ocean Camp, was established. [...] The expedition stayed here for two months until 23 December, when they struck camp.|$|E

But that blessing is being {{destroyed}} by your immigrants that are going over there. Especially the Jews, they said. The Second World War was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well.

2500|$|In response, 60 Minutes Wednesday {{released}} a statement suggesting that Will and James had [...] "misrepresented" [...] {{their role in the}} authentication of the documents and had played only a small part in the process. CBS News concurrently amended its previous claim that Matley had authenticated the documents, saying instead that he had only authenticated the signatures. On CNN, Matley stated he had only verified that the signatures were [...] "from the same source," [...] not that they were authentically Killian's: [...] "When I saw the documents, I could not verify the documents were authentic or inauthentic. I could only verify that the signatures came from the same source," [...] Matley said. [...] "I could not authenticate the documents themselves.

2500|$|Among those {{referenced}} in {{the song}} was fellow Queensbridge-based rapper Cormega ("And night time is more trife than ever/What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?"). Cormega's rapping career had been put on hold due to his incarceration during the early 1990s, before his release in 1995.

Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above/Keep a eye out for Jake, shorty-wop, one love". Music writer Susan Weinstein wrote that [...] "the literary technique Nas most strongly excels in {{is the one that}} would seem to be most pedestrian: rhyme", and cited [...] "One Love" [...] as the first display of Nas's [...] "formal inventiveness".|$|E

You want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a force that can impel us to got [...] to war in Iraq can’t find a way to censor two academics? Not much of a lobby, now is it?" [...] Writing for the Columbia Journalism Review, Beckerman cites examples of op-eds critical of Israel from several major U.S. newspapers and concludes that an equally compelling argument could be made that the Israel lobby doesn't control the media. [...] Itamar Rabinovich, writing for the Brookings Institution, wrote, [...] "The {{truth of the matter is}} that, insofar as the lobby ever tries to intimidate and silence, the effort usually causes more damage than it redresses.

2500|$|In the United States, Showgirls {{is shown}} at midnight movies {{alongside}} {{such films as}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. It is heralded {{as one of the}} best [...] "bad movies", a camp classic in the vein of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. Although the film was not successful when first released theatrically, it generated more than $100 million from video rentals and became one of MGM's top 20 all-time bestsellers. Verhoeven accepted the film's unexpected cult status, saying [...] "Maybe this kind of ritualistic cult popularity isn't what I intended, but it's like a resurrection after the crucifixion." [...] Eszterhas, however, maintains that the humor was intentional: [...] "What Paul [...] and I had in mind was something darkly funny. We went through the script line by line, and we were really laughing at some of it. I defy people <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a line like, 'How does it feel not to have anybody coming on you anymore' isn't meant to be funny." ...|$|E
2500|$|I think Walter is {{a writer}} at heart. Writers aren't always that good at {{communicating}} in person. He's also a tough son-of-a-bitch. He's like a cowboy. His director's chair was made out of leather and {{on the back of}} it read [...] "Lone Wolf". [...] He used to frequent gun clubs and he wasn't a very delicate guy.... We were doing a love scene. When they said, [...] "We need to ADR the love scene." [...] I really freaked out. I had never done a love scene before... I really needed help to get through it. I panicked, and the Producer... Joel Silver, called Walter and somehow persuaded him to come over and direct me through the ADR. Streets of Fire was a big picture for me, and I was overwhelmed. I think that bothered Walter. I think he thought that I was a needy guy. He was used to working with actors who had experience like Nick Nolte or David Carradine. I've always wondered why Walter has never wanted to work with me again. I think he was too much of gentlemen <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I was too needy at the time.|$|E
2500|$|DeVille {{recorded}} Miracle in London with Mark Knopfler {{serving as}} his sideman and producer. He said, [...] "It was Mark (Knopfler’s) wife Lourdes {{who came up}} with the idea (to record Miracle). She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie he was doing. It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was half asleep when the phone rang. It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone. She came in <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I was nominated for [...] "Storybook Love." [...] It's pretty wild.

2500|$|Papen {{also contributed}} to {{achieving}} Hitler's goal of undermining Austrian sovereignty and bringing about the Nazis' long-dreamed-of Anschluss (annexation by Germany). Winston Churchill reported in his book The Gathering Storm (1948) that Hitler appointed Papen for [...] "the undermining or winning over of leading personalities in Austrian politics". Churchill also quoted the United States ambassador in Vienna as saying of Papen that [...] "in the boldest and most cynical manner... Papen proceeded <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>that...</b> he intended to use {{his reputation as a}} good Catholic to gain influence with Austrians like Cardinal Innitzer." [...] In 1935, Papen's major fear was with international attention focused on the impeding Italian invasion of Ethiopia and Czechoslovakia in crisis after the Nazi front organization the Sudeten Home Front won the majority of the volksdeutsch vote in the elections, that Schuschnigg might attempt a Habsburg restoration. On 11 July 1935, Papen handed a note to the Austrians offering a normalization of Austro-German relations where Berlin would order the Austrian Nazis to cease engaging in terrorism in return for Austrian support for German foreign policy. On 28 August 1935, Papen negotiated a deal under which the German press would cease its attacks on the Austrian fascist regime, in return for which the Austrian press would cease its attacks on the German fascist regime. On 1 October 1935, the Austrians indicated their interest in taking up Papen's note from July, but Papen pursued the subsequent talks in a [...] "dilatory" [...] manner as Hitler wanted to see what changes in the international order the Italo-Ethiopian war might cause before signing anything. In the same time, Papen was also offered advice to Hitler on other matters. On 12 March 1936, Papen told Sir Walford Selby, the British ambassador to Austria that Hitler's offer to return to the League of Nations in exchange for Anglo-French acceptance of the remilitarization of the Rhineland was his idea. In March 1936, the Austro-German talks gathered speed as the German support for Italy's aggression against Ethiopia improved Italo-German relations {{to such an extent that}} Schuschnigg became desperate for any sort of deal that might save his country's existence. At this point, Papen informed Schuschnigg that he wanted to see members of the [...] "national opposition" [...] included in the Austrian cabinet as the price for a deal ensuring Austria's existence. To provide further pressure on Schuschnigg, Papen had the German embassy start subsidizing the right wing of the Austrian trade union movement, the Freiheitsbund, which staged anti-Semitic and pro-German demonstrations in Vienna and other Austrian cities.|$|E
