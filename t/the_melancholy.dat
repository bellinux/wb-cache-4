5|$|Although Scotland {{increasingly}} {{adopted the}} English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct {{national identity and}} began to enjoy an international reputation. Allan Ramsay (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the Habbie stanza as a poetic form. James Macpherson was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation, claiming to have found poetry written by Ossian, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal written in 1762 was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and <b>the</b> <b>melancholy</b> tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work {{to bring about the}} Romantic movement in European, and especially in German, literature, influencing Herder and Goethe. Eventually {{it became clear that the}} poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between <b>the</b> <b>melancholy</b> beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to the painting to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{artists in}} the later eighteenth century were {{strongly}} influenced by the Enlightenment, which stressed rationalism and human inquiry, of which Scotland was a major centre of influence. Artists like Alan Ramsey formed The Select Society, with philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith and produced his Dialogue on Taste, which made a major contribution {{to the study of}} aesthetics. Scotland also played a major part in the origins of the Romantic movement through the publication of James Macpherson's Ossian cycle, which was proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal, written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and <b>the</b> <b>melancholy</b> tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, influencing Herder and Goethe.|$|E

25|$|Poventud {{wrote his}} first {{composition}} at age 14 titled Ya No Soy Un Niño. (I'm Not a Child Anymore).

25|$|In 13th century medieval Europe, {{psychiatric}} hospitals were built {{to house the}} mentally ill, but there were not any nurses {{to care for them}} and treatment was rarely provided. These facilities functioned more as a housing unit for the insane. Throughout the high point of Christianity in Europe, hospitals for the mentally ill believed in using religious intervention. The insane were partnered with “soul friends” to help them reconnect with society. Their primary concern was befriending <b>the</b> <b>melancholy</b> and disturbed, forming intimate spiritual relationships.

25|$|Traditionally, {{there are}} three types of Kurdish {{classical}} performers - storytellers (çîrokbêj), minstrels (stranbêj) and bards (dengbêj). There was no specific music related to the Kurdish princely courts, and instead, music performed in night gatherings (şevbihêrk) is considered classical. Several musical forms are found in this genre. Many songs are epic in nature, such as the popular lawiks which are heroic ballads recounting the tales of Kurdish heroes of the past like Saladin. Heyrans are love ballads usually expressing <b>the</b> <b>melancholy</b> of separation and unfulfilled love. Lawje {{is a form of}} religious music and Payizoks are songs performed specifically in autumn. Love songs, dance music, wedding and other celebratory songs (dîlok/narînk), erotic poetry and work songs are also popular.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Grecian works, donkeys were portrayed in Biblical works {{as symbols of}} service, suffering, peace and humility, most notably in their inclusion in the New Testament Nativity narrative. Donkeys are also associated with the theme of wisdom in the Old Testament story of Balaam's ass, and are seen {{in a positive light}} through the story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a donkey. By the 19th century, the donkey was portrayed with more positive attributes by popular authors. William Wordsworth portrayed the donkey as loyal and patient in his 1819 poem , using the donkey as a Christian symbol. Robert Louis Stevenson in Travels with a Donkey (1879), portrays the animal as a stubborn beast of burden. Sympathetic portrayals return in Juan Ramon Jimenez's Platero and I. <b>The</b> <b>melancholy</b> Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh (first published in 1926) is arguably the most famous donkey in Western literature.|$|E
