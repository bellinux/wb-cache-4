5|$|A {{separate}} 2008 {{study from}} Western Michigan University found that hybrids and conventional vehicles are equally safe when travelling {{more than about}} , because tire and wind noise generate most of the audible cues at those speeds.

5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because of rules <b>that</b> <b>under</b> normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating.

The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{endorsement}} of Admiral Sims, the Navy Department initially rejected the British request. Like other navies of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the U.S. Navy rigidly adhered to the doctrine of Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose first tenet was <b>that</b> <b>under</b> no circumstances should a battle fleet be divided. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William S. Benson and Admiral Henry T. Mayo—Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet—were particularly worried that if Britain fell, as developments at sea suggested it might, the U.S. Navy would be left to face the German High Seas Fleet completely on its own.|$|E

5|$|Holland {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>under</b> {{the reign}} of Arab Emperor Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, even though {{only a small percentage}} of the inhabitants of the Empire was Muslim, Mecca was intentionally yet erroneously portrayed as Muhammad's home and the birthplace of Islam in order to provide the religion with Arabian origins. Holland argues that in doing so, the faith was dissociated from the Jewish or Christian heritage that would have been self evident at a location in the Negev.|$|E
5|$|In Christian theology, {{the work}} of the Holy Spirit under the Old Covenant is viewed as less {{extensive}} than <b>that</b> <b>under</b> the New Covenant inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. The Spirit was restricted to certain chosen individuals, such as high priests and prophets. Often termed the “spirit of prophecy” in rabbinic writings, the Holy Spirit was closely associated with prophecy and divine inspiration. It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would pour out his spirit upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} the view <b>that</b> <b>under</b> regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, {{the fact that}} goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta was an African nationalist, and was {{committed}} {{to the belief that}} European colonial rule in Africa must end.

5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes <b>that,</b> <b>under</b> George III (reigned 1760–1820), new {{legislation}} prevented debts of under 40shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E

5|$|Most historians {{agree that}} Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, {{but what exactly}} he {{achieved}} {{is a matter of}} some confusion. As has been discussed, some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC. Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him to the status of subject ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it seems likely <b>that,</b> <b>under</b> either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC.|$|E
5|$|O'Neal {{played in}} two more games before the NBA's case was {{brought before the}} U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York on December 30. The NBA argued <b>that</b> <b>under</b> {{the terms of the}} Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Stern had {{absolute}} authority to hand out suspensions and hear appeals for all on-court incidents. But the judge ruled that because O'Neal's behavior was an off-court incident, arbitration was allowed under the CBA, and thus the arbitrator was within his rights to reduce the suspension. Despite O'Neal's successful appeal, no further appeals were made to reduce Artest's and Jackson's suspensions.|$|E
5|$|Returning to {{differential}} equations, Hamming studied {{means of}} numerically integrating them. A popular approach {{at the time}} was Milne's Method, attributed to Arthur Milne. This had the drawback of being unstable, so <b>that</b> <b>under</b> certain conditions the result could be swamped by roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the Adams method. He did extensive research into digital filters, devising a new filter, the Hamming window, and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, Digital Filters (1977).|$|E
