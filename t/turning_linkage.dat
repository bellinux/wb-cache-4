At present the main methods on design computing and verifying <b>turning</b> <b>linkage</b> have still been the planar graphing and analysis method, therefore {{it is very important to}} adopt optimization methods to design the steering linkage. Being satisfied with the Ackerman theory steering characteristics and boundary constraints, considering the ideal relationship of steering angles between external and internal wheels in steering linkage to ensure motion accuracy of automobile, optimization model of <b>turning</b> <b>linkage</b> is established. Then the objective function with penalty terms is built by penalty strategy with addition type, so the constrained optimization is transformed into the unconstrained optimization. The simulated annealing algorithm is adopted to optimize <b>turning</b> <b>linkage</b> of automobile, so that optimization process was simplified and the global optimal solution is ensured reliably...|$|E

40|$|Science Program (CCSP) is {{to enhance}} the {{understanding}} and ability to predict and forecast {{effects of climate change}} on ecosystems. Over the past several decades, numerous scientific publications and reports have described and discussed historical and potential effects of climate change and variability on ecosystems and their constituent biota and processes. Because temperature, precipitation, and related climate variables are fundamental regulators of biological processes, it is reasonable to expect that significant human-induced changes in the climate system, both its mean state and its variance structure in space and time (including occurrence of extreme weather events), will have measurable effects on the distribution, condition, composition, structure, and functioning of ecosystems. Such changes in ecosystems may, in <b>turn,</b> alter <b>linkages</b> and feedbacks between ecosystems and regional climate systems (e. g., altered albedo, changes in rates of energy and gas exchange).

How this occurs is a critical question and must certainly involve signal transduction pathways. The paper by Suter and Forscher (2001) (this issue) begins to address how one such pathway, an Src family tyrosine kinase, enhances cytoskeletal linkage to apCAM, a permissive extracellular cue for Aplysia growth cones. Interestingly, they show that applied tension increases this kinase's localized phosphorylation that in <b>turn</b> further strengthens <b>linkage.</b> This suggests a potential positive feedback mechanism for amplifying and discriminating guidance information to guide growth cone motility...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to review the transmission mechanisms uniting equity market development and economic growth in developing countries. We find that the theoretical impact of equity markets is ambiguous. At the domestic level, the allocation function of equity markets appears conditioned by the extent of informational efficiency. <b>Turning</b> to international <b>linkages,</b> theoretical models suggest that equity market integration lowers the cost of capital, increases financial vulnerability and has a mixed impact on capital flows. Taking this into account, two conclusions arise. First, equity market development policies should focus on reaching and maintaining adequate levels of institutional transparency. Second, the optimal degree of international integration depends on the society’s preference between international accessibility and domestic stability. Equity Markets, Economic Development. ...|$|R

This paper investigates whether returns of forty-one closed-end country funds share a common volatility process with three comparable return series: the underlying net asset value (NAV), U.

S. market, whereas their underlying assets are traded in foreign stock markets. Our results indicate that only a few emerging markets' country funds share common volatility processes with their comparable asset returns. This, in <b>turn,</b> suggests weak <b>linkages</b> through the second moment of related assets. asset pricing, common volatility, country fund, market integration,...|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic {{roughness}} length z(om) {{is an important}} parameter for reliably simulating surface fluxes. It varies with wind speed, atmospheric stratification, terrain, and other factors. However, it is usually considered a constant. It is known that uncertainties in z(om) result in latent heat flux (LE) simulation errors, since z(om) links LE with aerodynamic resistance. The effects of z(om) on sensible heat flux (SH) simulation are usually neglected {{because there is no}} direct link between the two. By comparing SH simulations with three types of z(om) inputs, it is found that allowing z(om) temporal variation in an SH simulation model significantly improves agreement between simulated and measured SH and also decreases the sensitivity of the SH model to the heat transfer coefficient C-t which in <b>turn</b> determines the <b>linkage</b> between Z(om) and thermal {{roughness length}} z(om) ...|$|R
40|$|We reconstructed {{subsurface}} (~ 45 - 200 m water depth) temperature {{variability in}} the eastern Antarctic continental margin during the late Holocene, using an archaeal lipid-based temperature proxy (TEX 86 L). Our results reveal that subsurface temperature changes were probably positively coupled to the variability of warmer, nutrient-rich Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW, deep water of the Antarctic circumpolar current) intrusion onto the continental shelf. The TEX 86 L record, in combination with previously published climatic records, indicates that this coupling was probably related to the thermohaline circulation, seasonal variability in sea ice extent, sea temperature, and wind associated with high frequency climate dynamics at low-latitudes such as internal El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

Through such a local-level investigation utilising multiple qualitative methods, I examine the intra-neighbourhood economic and social roles of small trade-stores in an urban neighbourhood in Cochabamba, Bolivia.

40|$|Extensive {{literature}} exists {{regarding the}} externalities of industrial meat {{production in the}} United States.

This in <b>turn</b> suggests a <b>linkage</b> between feed crop subsidies and the externalities from meat production. Regardless of any impact these subsidies may have had on development of industrial meat production the only subsidies currently of relevance for corn and soybean are for insurance rate premiums. This paper proposes to examine the impact of these subsidies on the US meat markets using a modified stochastic equilibrium displacement model originally developed by Dhoubhadel, Azzam, and Stockton. The results found that these subsidies have a minimal effect on meat production levels. Therefore, if a reduced meat sector is desirable then other avenues, such as improved regulation or taxation, should be pursued...|$|R
40|$|Although elementary, junior high, {{and senior}} high schools are {{perceived}} as different, their differences are essentially ignored when organizational theorists characterize schools as loosely linked systems. Such systems share two characteristics: absence of shared goals and decentralization of power. To facilitate development of a more differentiated theory of school linkage, a recent study explored empirical differences among schools at three levels and attempted to explain these differences. Elementary schools consistently have stronger linkages than junior high schools, which in <b>turn</b> have stronger <b>linkages</b> than senior high schonls. The data from a sample cf 104 public schools in Pennsylvania and New Jersey suggest that differences between levels cannot {{be attributed to the}} staff's personal characteristics or to such organizational characteristics as size and complexity. An institutional perspective helps explain the differences between elementary and secondary schools in terms of size, staff, specialization, and gender composition. Historical evidence indicates that these differences result from institutional forces creating different expectations about how older and younger children should be educated.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new computer-aided linkage design and simulation system for task driven path generation problem. Mechanism design {{is considered a}} mixture of science and art. The former is about utilizing computers to rigorously sizing a mechanism in meeting a set of design requirements. And the latter is about taking advantage of designers' experience to narrow down design domain and speed up the design process. The ultimate goal of the presented design system is to incorporate both science and art into the linkage design process by (1) developing an automatic design framework based on library searching and optimization techniques and (2) developing an interactive design framework based on advanced human-computer interfaces. To enable the design automation framework, we first built a library of open and closed planar curves generated by commonly used planar <b>linkages.</b> We then <b>turned</b> the classical <b>linkage</b> path generation problem into a library searching problem together with a local optimization problem. To enable the interactive design framework, we developed a set of design interfaces that facilitate designers intervene and steer the design process. This hybrid design system was developed based on our existing VRMDS (Virtual Reality Mechanism Design Studio) framework. The result is a versatile mechanism design tool that is beneficial to {{the early stages of}} the mechanism design process...|$|R
40|$|Two new photosensitizers {{featured}} with a cyanoacrylic acid {{electron acceptor}} (A) and a hybrid electron donor (D) of cyclopentadithiophene and dithiafulvenyl, either directly linked or {{separated by a}} phenyl ring, were synthesized and characterized. Both of them undergo two reversible oxidations and strongly absorb in the visible spectral region due to a photo-induced intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transition. To a great extent, the electronic interaction between the D and A units {{is affected by the}} presence of a phenyl spacer. Without a phenyl ring, the D unit appears more difficult to oxidize due to a strong electron-withdrawing effect of the A moiety. In sharp contrast, the insertion of the phenyl ring between the D and A units leads to a broken π-conjugation and therefore, the oxidation potentials remain almost unchanged compared to those of an analogue without the A group, suggesting that the electronic coupling between D and A units is relatively weak. As a consequence, the lowest-energy absorption band shows a slight hypsochromic shift upon the addition of the phenyl spacer, indicative of an increased HOMO–LUMO gap. In <b>turn,</b> the direct <b>linkage</b> of D and A units leads to an effective π-conjugation, thus substantially lowering the HOMO–LUMO gap. Moreover, the application in dye-sensitized solar cells was investigated, showing that the power conversion efficiency increases by the insertion of the phenyl unit...|$|R
40|$|Agentic Leadership Efficacy (ALE) {{offers a}} new {{theoretical}} framework to address what constitutes leader emergence, engagement, and performance. ALE advances leadership development theory by addressing how leaders 2 ̆ 7 self-schema adapt over time {{as part of the}} overall leader development process, and in defining the relation of those cognitive processes and frameworks to enhanced leader performance. ^ ALE is inclusive of elements of both self and means-efficacy and is defined as a leader 2 ̆ 7 s appropriation of his or her role and environment (agency), and the self-schematic efficacy beliefs (confidence) in his or her perceived leadership capabilities to organize the positive psychological capabilities, motivation, means and courses of action required to attain effective, sustainable performance across a specific leadership domain. ^ This study offers many practical implications for leadership development and performance. The nomological network of ALE was tested over a 38 week experimental design. Among other findings, results showed that ALE is malleable and can be developed through targeted leadership development. ALE can be measured in three distinct dimensions; specifically, agentic leadership efficacy for thought and self-motivation, action, and means. Leaders also have differing levels of efficacy for transactional and transformational leadership behaviors across those three domains. We established that specific domains of a leader 2 ̆ 7 s efficacy beliefs can be targeted and developed and that those areas of increased efficacy will in turn manifest in greater frequency of behaviors corresponding to those targeted domains. Levels of ALE were found to predict levels of leader motivation and also both transformational and transactional leadership behaviors. Transformational leadership behaviors in <b>turn</b> mediated the <b>linkage</b> between leadership efficacy and various leadership performance measures. ^ We also proposed a new construct called developmental readiness, and demonstrated that the three dimensions of meta-cognitive ability, self-concept clarity, and learning goal orientation have significant impacts on initial levels ALE and also on the propensity and ability for further development of ALE. We hold that these facets of developmental readiness will impact any leader development program. ...|$|R
40|$|We revisit {{foundational}} {{questions in}} the kinetic theory of linkages and origami, investigating their folding/unfolding behaviors and the computational complexity thereof. In Chapter 2, we exactly settle the complexity of realizability, rigidity, and global rigidy for graphs and linkages in the plane, even when the graphs are (1) promised to avoid crossings in all configurations, or (2) equilateral and required to be drawn without crossings ("matchstick graphs") : these problems are complete for the class IR defined by the Existential Theory of the Reals, or its complement. To accomplish this, we prove a strong form of Kempe's Universality Theorem for linkages that avoid crossings. Chapter 3 <b>turns</b> to "self-touching" <b>linkage</b> configurations, whose bars are allowed to rest against each other without passing through. We propose an elegant model for representing such configurations using infinitesimal perturbations, working over a field R(e) that includes formal infinitesimals. Using this model and the powerful Tarski-Seidenberg "transfer" principle for real closed fields, we prove a self-touching version of the celebrated Expansive Carpenter's Rule Theorem. We switch to folding polyhedra in Chapter 4 : we show a simple technique to continuously flatten the surface of any convex polyhedron without distorting intrinsic surface distances or letting the surface pierce itself. This origami motion is quite general, and applies to convex polytopes of any dimension. To prove that no piercing occurs, we apply the same infinitesimal techniques from Chapter 3 to formulate a new formal model of self-touching origami that is simpler to work with than existing models. Finally, Chapter 5 proves polyhedra are hard to edge unfold: it is NP-hard to decide whether a polyhedron may be cut along edges and unfolded into a non-overlapping net. This edge unfolding problem is not known to be solvable in NP due to precision issues, but we show {{this is not the}} only obstacle: it is NP complete for orthogonal polyhedra with integer coordinates (all of whose unfolding also have integer coordinates) by Zachary Abel.

40|$|Introduction] The {{prevailing}} view of {{the world}} economy is strikingly polarised. Analyses of macroeconomic linkages and transmission channels routinely represent the world with the US at the centre and other regions, among which Asia and Europe, at the periphery. Asia and Europe are obviously regarded as important players, but mainly in interaction with the US rather than with each other. In recent assessments of the short 2 ̆ 010 term economic outlook, the US is still widely seen as {{the driving force behind the}} global business cycle. The same bias has been apparent in discussions about exchange rates, as China, Japan, and the euro area have been discussing the relationship between their currencies and the US dollar separately without paying much attention to their bilateral relationships until the end of 2007. From innovation leadership to the issuance of the world 2 ̆ 019 s premier currency there are several objective reasons why the US economy still plays a leading economic role in the world and our intention is not to dispute this reality. But this reality cannot justify retaining an outdated or distorted view of international interdependence. Policymakers in Asia and Europe need to take the full measure of the international role of their economies and of their corresponding global responsibilities. Our aims in this paper are: - to provide an objective assessment of the weight and interdependence of the major regions; - to investigate the Asia 2 ̆ 010 Europe relationship in the context of the world economy; - to contribute to current discussions about the global repercussions of the financial turmoil; - to shed light on the implication of growing cross 2 ̆ 010 border assets and liabilities between the three regions. To this end we adopt a deliberately stylised {{view of the}} world economy and look at broad regions instead of countries. This overlooks many disparities within regions but has the advantage of allowing a consistent and tractable approach to trade and financial linkages in the context of scarce global supply of energy and food commodities. The paper is organised as follows. We start in section 2 from a decomposition of the world economy into four regions (North America, East Asia, Europe and the Rest of the World) and we assemble a number of stylised facts about their size and openness. We <b>turn</b> to bilateral <b>linkages</b> in section 3, looking separately at trade and financial linkages to investigate how the three main regions interact with each other. We take up the transmission of shocks in section 4 and the implications of exchange 2 ̆ 010 rate adjustments in section 5. Section 6 offers conclusions. Sections 2 and 3 are mainly descriptive and can be skipped by uninterested readers...|$|R
