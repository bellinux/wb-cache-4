5|$|Non-surgical {{treatment}} is rarely an option {{as the ability}} for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, stem cell transplantation, and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of immobilization and physical therapy. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During <b>the</b> <b>immobilization</b> period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once <b>the</b> <b>immobilization</b> period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.|$|E
5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once <b>the</b> <b>immobilization</b> period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E

By the Plackett & Burman experimental design only the variables sodium alginate and calcium chloride presented significant effect (p[*]<[*] 0.1). In the CCRD <b>the</b> optimal <b>immobilization</b> strategy was: chitosan (0.1 % w/v), glutaraldehyde (0.1 % v/v), sodium alginate (1 % w/v) and calcium chloride (4 % w/v). In this condition, the optimum temperature in the thermal stability studied was 50 °C and <b>the</b> inulinase <b>immobilization</b> retained 86.5 % of the relative activity during 240  minutes. The enzyme loading capacity was 668 U/g gel beads, which could be indicating that <b>the</b> inulinase <b>immobilization</b> on <b>the</b> alginate-chitosan beads is a promising technique.|$|R

500|$|There are {{divergent}} {{views as}} to whether everyone with an unprovoked episode of thrombosis should be investigated for thrombophilia. Even those with a form of thrombophilia {{may not necessarily be}} at risk of further thrombosis, while recurrent thrombosis is more likely in those who have had previous thrombosis even in those who have no detectable thrombophilic abnormalities. Recurrent thromboembolism, or thrombosis in unusual sites (e.g. the hepatic vein in Budd-Chiari syndrome), is a generally accepted indication for screening. It {{is more likely to be}} cost-effective in people with a strong personal or family history of thrombosis. In contrast, the combination of thrombophilia with other risk factors may provide an indication for preventative treatment, which is why thrombophilia testing may be performed even in those who would not meet the strict criteria for these tests. Searching for a coagulation abnormality is not normally undertaken in patients in whom thrombosis has an obvious trigger. For example, if the thrombosis is due to immobilization after recent orthopedic surgery, it is regarded as [...] "provoked" [...] by <b>the</b> <b>immobilization</b> and the surgery and it is less likely that investigations will yield clinically important results.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{technique and}} one that allows {{more control over the}} structural and electronic properties of active catalytic sites is <b>the</b> <b>immobilization</b> of catalysts that have been developed for homogeneous catalyis on a heterogeneous support. [...] Covalent bonding of the catalyst to a polymer or other solid support is perhaps most common, though immobilization of the catalyst may also be achieved by adsorption onto a surface, ion exchange, or even physical encapsulation. [...] One drawback of this approach is the potential for the proximity of the support to change the behaviour of the catalyst, lowering the enantioselectivity of the reaction. [...] To avoid this, the catalyst is often bound to the support by a long linker though cases are known where the proximity of the support can actually enhance the performance of the catalyst.|$|E

2500|$|Gamma {{spectroscopy}} is {{the study}} of the energetic transitions in atomic nuclei, which are generally associated with the absorption or emission of gamma rays. As in optical spectroscopy (see Franck Condon effect) the absorption of gamma rays by a nucleus is especially likely (i.e., peaks in a [...] "resonance") when the energy of the gamma ray is {{the same as that of}} an energy transition in the nucleus. In the case of gamma rays, such a resonance is seen in the technique of Mössbauer spectroscopy. In the Mössbauer effect the narrow resonance absorption for nuclear gamma absorption can be successfully attained by physically immobilizing atomic nuclei in a crystal. <b>The</b> <b>immobilization</b> of nuclei at both ends of a gamma resonance interaction is required so that no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition. Such loss of energy causes gamma ray resonance absorption to fail. However, when emitted gamma rays carry essentially all of the energy of the atomic nuclear de-excitation that produces them, this energy is also sufficient to excite the same energy state in a second immobilized nucleus of the same type.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{methods of}} holding a [...] reduced fracture involved using splints. [...] These are rigid strips laid parallel {{to each other}} alongside the bone. The Ancient Egyptians used wooden splints made of bark wrapped in linen. They also used stiff bandages for support that were probably derived from embalming techniques. The use of plaster of Paris to cover walls is evident, but it seems it was never used for bandages. [...] Ancient Hindus treated fractures with bamboo splints, and the writings of Hippocrates discuss management of fractures in some detail, recommending wooden splints plus exercise to prevent muscle atrophy during <b>the</b> <b>immobilization.</b> [...] The ancient Greeks also used waxes and resins to create stiffened bandages and the Roman Celsus, writing in AD 30, describes how to use splints and bandages stiffened with starch. Arabian doctors used lime derived from sea shells and albumen from egg whites to stiffen bandages. The Italian School of Salerno in the twelfth century recommended bandages hardened with a flour and egg mixture as did Medieval European bonesetters, who used casts made of egg white, flour, and animal fat. By the sixteenth century the famous French surgeon Ambroise Paré (1517–1590), who championed more humane treatments in medicine and promoted the use of artificial limbs, made casts of wax, cardboard, cloth, and parchment that hardened as they dried.|$|E
