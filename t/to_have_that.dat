5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 fan {{features}} dovetailed {{fan blades}} which {{allows them to}} be replaced without removing the entire engine, and GE/SNECMA claim that the CFM56 was the first engine <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> capability. This attachment method is useful for circumstances where only a few fan blades need to be repaired or replaced, such as following bird strikes.|$|E
5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> energy, as well.|$|E

5000|$|John E. Carroll {{was born}} in Buffalo, New York, in 1860. He was nicknamed [...] "Scrappy", likely due <b>to</b> him <b>having</b> a [...] "pugnacious disposition", {{and he may have}} been the first player <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> nickname.|$|R
5|$|After {{finishing}} the 2010 season strong, the Dodgers named Kershaw as the Opening Day Starter for the 2011 season. On May 29, he pitched the second complete-game shutout of his career, striking out 10 while winning a two-hitter against the Florida Marlins, 8–0; {{he also had}} two singles and an RBI, scoring twice in the game. He produced his third career shutout on June 20, a two-hit, 11-strikeout effort against the Detroit Tigers. Kershaw became the first Dodgers starter to strike out the side in the 9th inning since Sandy Koufax's perfect game. In his next start, on June 26, Kershaw pitched another complete game (against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim). He became the first Dodger starter to have back-to-back complete game victories since Jeff Weaver in the 2005 season and the first Dodger to have double-digit strikeouts in consecutive starts since Chan-Ho Park in the 2000 season. He was awarded the National League Player of the Week award for the week of June 20–26 {{as a result of}} those two starts. Midway through June, Kershaw had amassed 32 career victories, a 3.15 ERA and 593 career strikeouts in 568.2 innings. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Kershaw was the first 23-year-old pitcher <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> many victories, an ERA that low and an average of more than one strikeout per inning since ERA became an official statistic in 1910.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he moved}} back to Abingdon. During Reconstruction, Robertson {{was a member of}} the Committee of Nine, led by Alexander H. H. Stuart, that sought Virginia's {{readmission}} to the Union. At issue was the new state constitution, which included disenfranchisement of many white males. The committee successfully negotiated with the Federal government <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> clause voted on separately, so that Virginians would accept and ratify the new constitution and so rejoin the Union. He died on February 11, 1888, and was buried at Cobbs, Chesterfield County.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the 1820s, Oregon City {{developed}} near Willamette Falls. It {{was incorporated}} in 1844, {{becoming the first}} city west of the Rocky Mountains <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> distinction. John McLoughlin, a Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) official, {{was one of the}} major contributors to the founding of the town in 1829. McLoughlin attempted to persuade the British government (which still held sway over the area) to allow American settlers to live on the land, and provided significant help to American colonization of the area, all against the HBC's orders. Oregon City prospered because of the paper mills that were run by the water power of Willamette Falls, but the falls formed an impassable barrier to river navigation. Linn City (originally Robins Nest) was established across the Willamette from Oregon City.|$|E
5|$|This one I had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E
25|$|In other words, don't {{spend the}} money unless you're sure you're {{going to have the}} legal {{environment}} to go forward. Don't {{spend the money}} unless you're sure you're going to have the permit. No, I can't tell you that I'm going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> permit until June, but we need to plan like we're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> permit in June. And so probably the biggest lesson is to make sure we could smooth out the on/off switches wherever we could and take control of our own destiny.|$|E

25|$|Abuse {{of parents}} by their {{children}} is a common but under-reported and under-researched subject. Parents are quite often subject to levels of childhood aggression, typically {{in the form of}} verbal or physical abuse, in excess of normal childhood aggressive outbursts. Parents feel a sense of shame and humiliation <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> problem, so they rarely seek help; nor is much help available today.|$|E
25|$|The Alamodome is {{the site}} of the annual Alamo Bowl, which matches the second-choice teams from the Pac-12 Conference and the Big 12 Conference. The 2006 Alamo Bowl between the Texas Longhorns and the Iowa Hawkeyes was {{attended}} by 65,875, which set a facility-record crowd for a sporting event, only <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> record broken by an Alamo Bowl event the next year between Texas A and Penn State, which drew 66,166 attendees.|$|E
25|$|The C–C–G–C–E–G tuning uses {{some of the}} {{harmonic}} sequence (overtones) of the note C. When an open-note C-string is struck, its harmonic sequence begins with the notes C, C, G, C, E, G, B, C. This overtone-series tuning was modified by Mick Ralphs, who used a high C rather than the high G for “Can’t Get Enough” on Bad Company. Ralphs said, “It needs the open C <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> ring,” and “it never really sounds right in standard tuning”. Ralphs wrote these songs in the key of G on a guitar in Open-G tuning.|$|E

25|$|Set-theoretical {{definitions}} of natural numbers were initiated by Frege and he initially defined a natural number as {{the class of}} all sets that are in one-to-one correspondence with a particular set, but this definition turned out to lead to paradoxes including Russell's paradox. Therefore, this formalism was modified so that a natural number {{is defined as a}} particular set, and any set that can be put into one-to-one correspondence with that set is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> number of elements.|$|E

As of 2015 the group has raised funds and is currently {{in the process of}} building the E extension trail from the old Nanaimo train station to 7th Avenue in the south.
