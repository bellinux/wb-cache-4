40|$|Traditional Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) need {{a special}} {{care to be}} taken for {{starting}} and for operation at low motor speeds in <b>traction</b> <b>drives.</b> Indeed, the low-frequency current may cause a significant unbalance between the converter sub-module capacitor voltages and then disturb the output waveforms. MMCs with the battery cells integrated inside the sub-modules are an alternative configuration where the traditional battery management system of battery electric vehicles is replaced by {{the control of the}} converter, which individually balances all the cells. The paper evaluates the low frequency operation of the MMCs with embedded battery cells when used as <b>traction</b> <b>drives</b> for battery electric vehicles by means of numerical simulations obtained from Matlab/ Simulink and eexperimental results from a down-scaled prototype.

5000|$|The GTO {{thyristor}} achieves this by [...] "chopping" [...] {{the supply}} voltage {{in order to}} drive a sinusoidal current in the motor windings (pulse width modulation), creating the characteristic whine associated with the stock and with the Class 465 Networker trains that share its <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> system. The sound changes as the pulse length changes.

50|$|The entire <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> {{is mounted}} on an {{assisting}} beam {{in the center of}} the bogie, and attached to the outer sides via two pendulums. It is possible to mount in the center, since the bogies do not have pivot pins; the bogie is propped up above the frame by eight flexicoil springs. The resulting freedom of movement in all directions is limited by hydraulic buffers and rubber elements. By utilising this flexicoil suspension, many components, which either wore out or had to be expensively maintained, were eliminated.|$|E
50|$|The ChS3 (ЧС3) {{is a type}} of 4-axle {{passenger}} {{direct current}} (catenary voltage of 3 kV) electric locomotive, manufactured in 1961, which was used in the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation. In 1960, due to the increase in passenger trains, the Skoda factory was ordered to design and produce a more powerful locomotive type than the ChS1. The plant's management decided to base the new electric locomotives on the ChS1 class of locomotive. Therefore, the more powerful AL4846eT traction motors and <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> were installed in the experimental ChS1 locomotive (which had the factory designation 29E0). Thus, the ChS3 design was an improved version of the ChS1.|$|E

5000|$|The {{second factor}} is elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} (EHL). Transmissions that use EHL to transfer power {{are known as}} traction drives. A <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> transmission operates utilizing a traction fluid that, under normal circumstances, provides lubrication for the drive. When this fluid undergoes high contact pressures under rolling contact between the two very hard elements, the spheres and the discs, the fluid undergoes a near-instantaneous phase transition to an elastic solid. Within this patch of traction the molecules of the fluid stack up and link to form a solid, through which shear force and thus torque can be transferred. Note that the rolling elements are actually not in physical contact.|$|E
5000|$|HEVT {{is using}} a 4-cylinder, 2.4L E85-capable engine from a Chevrolet HHR to power a 4-speed {{automatic}} transmission from a Saturn Vue Green Line. This engine powers the front axle and acts as a range extender for the extended-range electric vehicle. The [...] "VT-REX" [...] vehicle has about a 45-mile all-electric range using a custom A123 Systems battery to power a Siemens electric <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> capable of about 80 kW of power. Since HEVT will have a large electric range with engine off operation, the air conditioning compressor will work off of high voltage and a DC-DC converter will create about 13.8 V from the high voltage bus to power the 12V accessory loads.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with other}} traction-type CVTs, {{transmission}} of torque through the NuVinci CVT involves some relative sliding between the torque-transmitting contact patches. This is because, {{for any given}} contact patch, parts of the ball are going {{in a slightly different}} direction and at slightly different speeds than the disc (this phenomenon of traction-type CVTs is referred to as [...] "contact spin"). [...] "The spin velocity (or drill speed) is defined as the difference in the rotational speed of the driving and driven rollers in a direction perpendicular to the contact patch plane. It is caused by the relative difference in surface speeds of both elements across the contact patch and is a major source of power loss in <b>traction</b> <b>drive</b> CVT’s." [...] In all traction-type CVTs, this relative sliding necessarily occurs between surfaces which are under the very high clamping pressures required to ensure torques are transmitted reliably. This relative sliding under high pressures cause transmission losses (inefficiency). Fallbrook Technology refuse to publish any efficiency data for the NuVinci CVT. However, The NuVinci is a variant on the [...] "Tilting-ball drive" [...] type of continuously variable transmission (CVT), and the efficiency of [...] "Tilting-ball drive" [...] type CVTs is typically in the range of 70% to 89%. However, its geometry does differ significantly from the Kopp type of tilting ball variator in the reference in that the NuVinci has its torque transfer contacts on the outside diameter rather than the inside diameter, which puts the idler (an element that reacts clamping load) in compression rather than tension, and because the idler contact surface is not conformal as in the Kopp design. In general {{because of the way the}} CVT is set up, it is more efficient at a 1:1 ratio compared to maximum overdrive or underdrive positions. Independent test results have shown that at 1:1 it is actually more efficient than comparable bicycle internal gear hubs, while at the ratio extremes it is slightly lower.|$|E

40|$|Robert Fusaro and Fred Oswald of the Mechanical Components Branch {{discussed}} 'Candidate Coatings and Dry <b>Traction</b> <b>Drives</b> for Planetary Vehicles'. Vehicles to {{be designed}} for exploration of planets and moons {{of the solar system}} will require reliable mechanical drives to operate efficiently. Long-term operation of these drives will be challenging because of extreme operating conditions. These extreme conditions include: very high and/or very cold temperatures, wide temperature ranges, dust, vacuum or low-pressure atmospheres, and corrosive environments. Most drives used on Earth involve oil-lubricated gears. However, due to the extreme conditions on planetary surfaces, it may not be advisable or even possible to use oil lubrication. Unfortunately, solid lubricants do not work well when applied to gears because of the high contact stress conditions and large sliding motion between the teeth, which cause wear and limit life. We believe <b>traction</b> <b>drives</b> will provide an attractive alternative to gear <b>drives.</b> <b>Traction</b> <b>drives</b> are composed of rollers that provide geometry more conducive to solid lubrication. Minimal slip occurs in this contact geometry and thus there is very low wear to the solid lubricant. The challenge for these solid-lubricated drives is finding materials or coatings that provide the required long-life while also providing high traction. We seek materials that provide low wear with high friction...|$|R
