5|$|A deck {{decompression}} chamber (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two compartment {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient space in the main chamber for two or more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant to be locked in or out during treatment of <b>the</b> <b>occupant(s)</b> of the main chamber. There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most {{deck decompression chamber}}s are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to <b>the</b> <b>occupants</b> (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E

50|$|For example, if <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> {{commands}} <b>the</b> {{vehicle to}} roll to the left, the visual displays must also roll {{by the same}} magnitude {{and at the same}} rate. Simultaneously, the cab tilts <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> to imitate <b>the</b> motion. <b>The</b> <b>occupant’s</b> proprioceptors and vestibular system sense this motion. The motion and change in the visual inputs must align well enough such that any discrepancy is below <b>the</b> <b>occupant’s</b> threshold to detect the differences in motion.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike air conditioners, which cool rooms, fans cool people. Ceiling fans {{increase}} {{air speed}} at <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> level, which facilitates more efficient heat rejection, cooling <b>the</b> <b>occupant,</b> rather than <b>the</b> space. Elevated air speed increases {{the rate of}} convective and evaporative heat loss from the body, thus making <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> feel cooler without changing the dry bulb temperature of the air.|$|R

5|$|Sebring Farms {{was reduced}} to piles of rubber, with four tall royal palm trees left standing. Only six people in the town survived. The hotel at Miami Locks (today known as Lake Harbor) was the sole {{structure}} to survive the storm. The bodies of many dead animals were resting on the canal banks. Ninety-nine people died in that town. In Chosen, only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people. At Henry Martin's store, the building lost its roof during the storm, forcing <b>the</b> <b>occupants</b> {{to move into the}} restroom. A house that was full of people floated about half a mile (0.8km) from its original location. <b>The</b> <b>occupants</b> were unaware that the house was moving until it collided with a railroad embankment. Twenty three people died in Chosen.|$|E
50|$|Motion {{simulators}} can {{be classified}} according to whether <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> is controlling <b>the</b> vehicle, or whether <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> is a passive rider, {{also referred to as}} a simulator ride or motion theater.|$|R

5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat may be self-propelled and can be operated by crew while the while <b>the</b> <b>occupants</b> are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, {{in case of a}} delay in rescue due to sea conditions. The crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching.|$|E
5000|$|The {{trend is}} {{increasing}} home ownership over time; in 1986, 41% of private dwellings were owned by <b>the</b> <b>occupant,</b> and by 2001 52% were owned by <b>the</b> <b>occupant.</b> [...] Most recently, 54% are owner-occupied, {{with the remaining}} 46% being rented.|$|R
50|$|In stage two, <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> {{is assumed}} to remain {{in contact with the}} {{compartment}} surface and experiences the same accelerations as the vehicle for the rest of <b>the</b> collision. <b>The</b> <b>occupant</b> may sustain injury at the end of stage one based on the velocity of impact with the compartment surfaces and due to vehicle accelerations during stage two. <b>The</b> <b>occupant</b> impact velocity and acceleration are computed from the vehicle collision acceleration history and the compartment geometry. Finally, <b>the</b> hypothetical <b>occupant</b> impact velocity and acceleration are then compared to threshold values of human tolerance to these forces.|$|R
50|$|Hawkridge {{appears to}} have existed {{subsequently}} for many years as a tenanted farm. In the 19th century the tenant was the Buckingham family. In 1903 <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> was William T. Scoynes. In 1948 <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> was Henry William John Hosking, a farmer.|$|R
5|$|After the war, {{several of}} the Secretaries-General were tried for {{collaboration}} with <b>the</b> <b>occupants.</b> Most were acquitted after basic examination. Romsée (Secretary-General for Internal Affairs) was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment and Schuind (responable for Justice) was sentenced to five years'. Many of the former Secretaries-General went on to careers in politics after the war. Both De Winter and Leemans served as a senators for the centre-right Christian Social Party (PSC-CVP) and Leemans ended his career as President of the European Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Behind the Horseshoe Cloister is the Curfew Tower, one of {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} parts of the Lower Ward and dating from the 13th century. The interior of the tower contains a former dungeon, and the remnants of a sally port, a secret exit for <b>the</b> <b>occupants</b> in a time of siege. The upper storey contains the castle bells placed there in 1478, and the castle clock of 1689. The French-style conical roof is a 19th-century attempt by Anthony Salvin to remodel the tower in the fashion of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc's recreation of Carcassonne.|$|E
5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, as well as {{in other parts of the}} world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect <b>the</b> <b>occupants</b> of the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results for}} thermal comfort assessment in non-uniform thermal environments. Three types of displacement ventilation (DV) units that created stratified condition in an environmental test chamber {{have been selected}} {{to carry out the}} thermal comfort assessment: a flat diffuser (DV 1), semi-circular diffuser (DV 2), and floor swirl diffuser (DV 3). The CBE (Center for the Built Environment at Berkeley) comfort model was implemented in this study to assess <b>the</b> <b>occupant’s</b> thermal comfort for the three DV types. The CBE model predicted <b>the</b> <b>occupant’s</b> mean skin as well as local skin temperatures very well when compared with measurements found in the literature, while it underestimated <b>the</b> <b>occupant’s</b> core temperature. <b>The</b> predicted <b>occupant’s</b> thermal sensation and thermal comfort for the case of (DV 2) were the best. Therefore, the semi-circular diffuser (DV 2) provided better thermal comfort for <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> in comparison with the other two DV types...|$|R
5|$|On {{capturing}} the second-line, {{elements of the}} Liverpool Scottish decided to consolidate the shallow trenches that afforded little protection. The battle had quickly degenerated into a disorganised and chaotic affair, with British battalions losing cohesion and becoming mixed up with each other. An intensive German barrage decimated <b>the</b> <b>occupants</b> of the second-line trenches, while the 10th's temporary commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel E.G. Thin, was wounded by gunfire. The remainder of the Liverpool Scottish continued onto the third-line with portions of the Royal Scots Fusiliers and 1st Northumberland Fusiliers.|$|E
5|$|Ptolemy's tribes located {{north of}} the Forth-Clyde isthmus include the Cornovii in Caithness, the Caereni, Smertae, Carnonacae, Decantae, Lugi and Creones also {{north of the}} Great Glen, the Taexali in the north-east, the Epidii in Argyll, the Venicones in Fife, the Caledonians in the central Highlands and the Vacomagi centred near Strathmore. It is likely {{that all of these}} {{cultures}} spoke a form of Celtic language known as Pritennic. <b>The</b> <b>occupants</b> of southern Scotland were the Damnonii in the Clyde valley, the Novantae in Galloway, the Selgovae on the south coast and the Votadini to the east.

5|$|Since {{at least}} the early modern period it was a common custom to hide objects such as written charms, dried cats, horse skulls, and witch bottles in the {{structure}} of a building, but concealed shoes are by far the most common items discovered. Archaeologist Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are found suggest that at least some were concealed as magical charms to protect <b>the</b> <b>occupants</b> of the building against evil influences.

50|$|The kingdom reconverted to Christianity under Sigeberht II the Good {{following}} a mission by St Cedd who established monasteries at Tilaburg (probably East Tilbury, but possibly West Tilbury) and Ithancester (almost certainly Bradwell-on-Sea). A royal tomb at Prittlewell was discovered and excavated in 2003. Finds included gold foil crosses, suggesting <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> was Christian. If <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> was a king, {{it was probably}} either Saebert or Sigeberht (murdered AD 653). It is, however, also possible that <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> was not royal, but simply a wealthy and powerful individual whose identity has gone unrecorded.|$|R
5000|$|Bertoncello {{started the}} search {{in the rear}} cargo area. He found two {{cardboard}} boxes. <b>The</b> other <b>occupant</b> of <b>the</b> vehicle advised that they contained dishes and books for his mother. Bertoncello testified that {{the look and feel}} of the boxes suggested they did not contain dishes or books, and asked <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> if <b>the</b> boxes contained drugs or weapons. <b>The</b> <b>occupant</b> became nervous, said [...] "yeah", then said he did not know.|$|R
5|$|Specialised armour {{arriving}} in the first wave included AVREs, mine flails, and armoured bulldozers. Clearing paths off the beach proved difficult, as the tanks got stuck in the mud or were taken out by mines. A lone mine flail tank finally cleared a path from the beach up toward the Mont Fleury Battery and Ver-Sur-Mer. This route {{was used by the}} Green Howards and tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, who cleared the remaining resistance at the Mont Fleury Battery. B Company moved on to attack trench positions and machine gun emplacements at Meuvaines Ridge, while C Company moved to the west of Ver-Sur-Mer to help cover the assault on Crépon, where roads led to the important targets of Bayeux and Caen. The 7th Green Howards attacked the gun battery at Ver-Sur-Mer, where they took 50 prisoners. Colour Sergeant-Major Stanley Hollis earned the only Victoria Cross to be bestowed for actions on D-Day. On the way to the Mont Fleury Battery, Hollis came under machine gun fire while investigating a pillbox, so he shot into the entrance with his Sten gun and dropped a grenade through the roof, killing most of <b>the</b> <b>occupants.</b> He cleared a nearby trench of enemy soldiers, whereupon <b>the</b> <b>occupants</b> of a second pillbox surrendered. Later in the day, he saved the lives of three men during an attempt to take out a field artillery installation at a farm near Crépon.|$|E
5|$|The Playford family {{heritage}} can {{be traced}} back to 1759, when a baby boy was left at the door of a house in Barnby Dun, Yorkshire, England, with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. <b>The</b> <b>occupants</b> of the house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed. The child grew up to be a simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 who he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this way has continued since.|$|E
