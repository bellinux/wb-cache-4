5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{representative}} peers {{were those}} peers {{elected by the}} members of the Peerage of Scotland and the Peerage of Ireland <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the British House of Lords.

5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger was allowed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the jump {{seat in the}} cockpit. The passenger had no connection with the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline.

From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the jump seat passenger continued <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention and concentration away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E
