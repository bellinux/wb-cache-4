5|$|On 2 March 2003, Arsenal {{opened up}} an eight-point lead {{at the top}} of the table, winning 2–0 against Charlton Athletic. The result was enough for Irish {{bookmaker}} Paddy Power to pay out on punters backing Arsenal to retain their lead, despite Manchester United having a game in hand. The gap was cut to two points after Arsenal suffered their first defeat in 2003, against Blackburn Rovers. By the time Arsenal played Everton on 23 March 2003, they were displaced {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> Manchester United. A goal by Vieira moved the team two points clear once more.|$|E

5|$|Domestically, Benfica {{started the}} season with {{consecutive}} wins, rising {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> early October. After a home loss in the Clássico, the team's results became poorer, with three draws and two losses that caused the team to drop to third place by New Year. Benfica continued to slip in January, losing the Lisbon derby and twice dropping to fifth place. A home win against Sporting CP for the Portuguese Cup had an apparent positive effect on the players; their best period all season came as they regained first place and opened a six-point lead over the team in second place.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 6 January 1934, Chapman died at his home in Hendon. Arsenal were top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> the New Year, but their league form stuttered as a result of Chapman's {{unexpected}} death. Joe Shaw stood in as caretaker manager and continued Chapman's good work, as Arsenal won the 1933–34 First Division title. In May 1934, Arsenal appointed George Allison, beginning a successful thirteen-year spell as manager. The club retained the league title in 1934–35 and in the next season defeated Sheffield United in the 1936 FA Cup Final. Arsenal won another championship in 1937–38, their fifth in eight years, to reinforce their position as the dominant team of the 1930s. Britain's involvement in the Second World War meant the ordinary football calendar was abandoned. In {{the early part of the}} 1940s, Arsenal participated in various wartime competitions, still managed by Allison.|$|E
5|$|Peacetime {{football}} resumed in 1946–47, {{with the}} same fixture list as the abandoned 1939–40 season. York endured a midseason run of 10 defeats from 11 matches, before their form improved, and five wins from the last eight matches saw them finish in 15th place in the Third Division North. They were top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> mid September 1947, before a run of two wins from 13 matches saw them drop to 18th place. York finished 1947–48 in 13th place, and the club recorded a net profit of £4,914; a balance surplus of £1,843 was carried forward. In September 1948, York purchased their Bootham Crescent ground, which had been leased since 1932, for £4,075. They achieved their record average league attendance of 10,412 during 1948–49 {{at the peak of}} the post-war attendance boom. The team enjoyed a run of eight successive league wins at home spanning September 1948 to January 1949, but failed to win any of their last seven fixtures to finish 1948–49 in 14th place.|$|E
5|$|The unbeaten run {{came to an}} end at Christmas, with {{back-to-back}} defeats in matches against West Bromwich Albion {{causing the}} club to fall to fourth place. The team commenced 1968 with a seven match unbeaten run, starting with consecutive 3–0 wins at Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United, and culminating in a 5–1 defeat of Fulham to go top of the table. The run {{came to an end}} with a defeat at Don Revie's Leeds United, which also meant City were overtaken at the top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> local rivals Manchester United. A visit to United's Old Trafford ground then followed. United took an early lead, but City rallied to win 3–1.|$|E

5|$|York {{appointed}} Aston Villa {{assistant manager}} John Ward in November 1991. Ward developed the team he inherited from Bird, and York were top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> December 1992. He left for Bristol Rovers in March 1993, and was succeeded by his assistant Alan Little. Two months later Little led York to promotion via the Third Division play-offs, with a penalty shoot-out victory over Crewe Alexandra in the final. In the 1993–94 season, York were beaten by Stockport County in the semi-final of the Second Division play-offs. York finished midtable the following season, but only avoided relegation in 1995–96 {{with a win}} {{on the final day}} of the season, although they knocked Manchester United out of the 1995–96 League Cup. In the following season's competition they eliminated Everton, but again narrowly avoided relegation that season. York's form continued to falter by the late 1990s, and Little was dismissed in March 1999 after a run of 10 matches without a win.|$|E
5|$|York started 2012–13 {{by winning}} five of 14 matches, and were ninth in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> late October 2012. They dropped down {{the table in}} the {{following}} months, but were still in contention for a play-off place after beating Burton Albion 3–0 in the New Year. After this match, York failed to win 11 consecutive matches, and Mills was dismissed in March 2013 after a 2–0 home defeat to Bradford City. Under his replacement, former Northern Ireland manager Nigel Worthington, York avoided relegation by winning four of their last five matches. They finished their first League Two season in 17th place. York won only four of their first 23 matches of 2013–14, and were third from the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> late December 2013. A number of influential signings in January 2014 helped York improve their form, and from early February they were unbeaten in 17 consecutive matches, conceding no goals from open play. York finished in seventh place and played Fleetwood Town in the play-off semi-final. After losing the first leg 1–0 at home, York drew 0–0 at Highbury Stadium in the second leg. Worthington resigned as manager in October 2014 after York won only one of their opening 14 matches of 2014–15. He was succeeded by former Scunthorpe United manager Russ Wilcox. York remained in the lower reaches of the table. They avoided relegation with a late-season run of four wins from five matches, finishing the season in 18th place.|$|E
5|$|Bengaluru FC {{began the}} season in good form and {{finished}} the first month {{on top of the}} table. Defeat to the previous season league champions Mohun Bagan in February saw the club slip into second place until the final month of the season. However, the club then went seven games unbeaten to return to the top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> April. The title was secured on 17 April when Bengaluru FC defeated Salgaocar at home. After the I-League season, the club were knocked out of the Federation Cup {{in the first round of}} the competition by Aizawl. The club started their AFC Cup campaign slowly, losing their first two group stage matches. Three victories in a row however saw Bengaluru FC qualify for the knockout stages. In the Round of 16 the club defeated Kitchee to qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time in club history. 26 different players represented the club in three competitions and there were 12 different goalscorers. Bengaluru FC's top goalscorer was Sunil Chhetri, who scored 9 goals in 20 games. This season was also the last that Bengaluru FC would be under their first coach Ashley Westwood. Westwood left the club after the season concluded.|$|E

5|$|During the close-season, Johnson {{sought a}} {{possible}} new club back in England, {{and before the}} start of the 2010 season in America, he was given a trial with Major League Soccer side Seattle Sounders FC joining them for their pre-season training camp. Having trained with Sounders, Johnson decided to stay with Austin Aztex and signed a new two-year contract. In the first game of the Aztex season, Johnson hit the goalpost with a 20-yard curling shot, but Lawrence Olum scored with the rebound, helping the Aztex to a 2–0 victory against Montreal Impact. During May, Johnson scored five goals, including two in a 3–3 draw with Tampa Bay and made two assists to help Austin record an unbeaten spell. He again scored two goals in a 2–1 Aztex victory over Miami and helped take his team to the top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> being the club's leading goalscorer throughout the campaign. Heath also used him in his original position in attack, including as a sole striker in a defeat to Puerto Rico Islanders. It was a result that saw the Aztex lose their top spot for the first time in three months. A week later, Johnson scored his tenth goal of the season to give his side their fourth win in five games by defeating Carolina RailHawks 3–2. The Aztex returned to the top of the table with a 2–0 victory against NSC Minnesota Stars with Johnson scoring the opening goal of the game. Aztex qualified for the end-of-season play-offs where they faced Montreal Impact over two legs. Johnson scored one of Aztex's two goals in the second leg but their season finished with a 5–2 aggregate defeat. Johnson played a total of 28 games during the season, scoring 15 goals, and earned a place in the 2010 season best XI.|$|E
5|$|Matteo Sereni and Finidi George arrived {{before the}} 2001–02 season {{to boost the}} squad for its foray into Europe. The club's league form was poor, and 18 games into the campaign, Ipswich were bottom of the table with just one league victory. However, there was some relief in the UEFA Cup with a victory over Inter Milan 1–0 {{at home in the}} third round, despite which the tie was lost over two legs after a 4–1 defeat at the San Siro. From bottom of the table at Christmas, a run of seven wins from eight {{fixtures}} appeared to have secured the team's league status, but another decline set in and relegation was confirmed {{on the final day of}} the season with a 5–0 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield. The loss of income due to relegation to the Championship contributed to the club going into financial administration, resulting in the sale of a number of players including Jamie Clapham, Darren Ambrose, and club captain Matt Holland. Ipswich had the consolation of again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, through UEFA's Fair Play system, losing in the second round to Czech side Slovan Liberec. A poor start to the domestic season, leaving the club 19th in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> mid-October, resulted in George Burley being sacked after nearly eight years as manager.|$|E
5|$|The {{season began}} with a 2–1 win over Mansfield Town at Field Mill on 19 August; Chris Marron put Mansfield ahead on 52 minutes, before Roy Sproson scored the {{equaliser}} on 69 minutes, Basil Hayward scored the winning goal three minutes later after being the first {{to react to the}} rebound that came when Colin Askey's shot hit the crossbar. The main surprise in the line-up of the opening day was that goalkeeper Ray Hancock had been dropped in favour of Ray King after King impressed in the pre-season friendly, the club's positive season meant that Hancock was unable to win back his place in the side. Vale were then held to two consecutive goalless draws but remained unbeaten in their first seven league games, conceding just two goals. This run included a 3–0 win over Darlington at Feethams, and a 4–0 win over Barrow in which Hayward scored a hat-trick. They had risen to the top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> the third game of the season and remained in first place {{until the end of the}} season. Of the Barrow first eleven that day three of the players were brothers: Jack, Alan and Bert Keen.|$|E

5|$|Winning six {{of their}} first eight matches in 1984–85, York were top of the Third Division by early October 1984. After a run of two wins from 11 matches, they slipped to 11th place in mid December 1984, though they {{continued}} to occupy a top half position before finishing the season in eighth place. In January 1985, York beat First Division team Arsenal 1–0 {{at home in the}} FA Cup fourth round, courtesty of a late penalty scored by Keith Houchen. They reached the fifth round for the third time and drew 1–1 at home to European Cup holders Liverpool. They lost 7–0 in the replay at Anfield—the club's record cup defeat. York started 1985–86 well and were second in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> late November 1985, before a poor midseason spell saw them drop into midtable. After being unbeaten in the last nine matches, they finished seventh in the table, marking the fifth consecutive season in which York's end-of-season league placing improved. They reached the FA Cup fifth round for the second consecutive season, again drawing 1–1 at home to Liverpool, before losing 3–1 after extra time at Anfield. York made a strong start to 1986–87, and in late September 1986 they were in second place. They won only seven of their remaining 38 matches and needed a point from their last match to avoid the danger of relegation, which they achieved with a 1–1 draw against Notts County. York finished 1986–87 in 20th place.|$|E
5|$|York started 1976–77 poorly, {{and they}} were in the bottom two of the Third Division for most {{of the first half of}} the season. The midseason signings Chris Galvin and Gordon Staniforth marked an {{improvement}} in results, but after winning only one of their last 15 matches they finished in bottom place and were relegated for the second successive season. The 1977–78 season also started poorly; York lost seven of their opening 12 matches, leaving them 17th in the table. McGuinness was dismissed in October 1977 and was succeeded the following month by Charlie Wright, a former Charlton Athletic player. York remained in the lower reaches of the table and finished the season in 22nd place, forcing the club to apply for re-election for the sixth time. This was successful, as the club polled the maximum number of votes. This season, attendances fell to an all-time low, and amid growing financial trouble, Michael Sinclair took over as chairman in April 1978 in a boardroom shuffle. Results improved in 1978–79; York finished 10th in the Fourth Division and reached the FA Cup fourth round. They played reigning First Division champions and European Cup winners-elect Nottingham Forest, and were beaten 3–1 at the City Ground. In 1979–80, York were consistently in the lower reaches of the table, before finishing 17th. With the club 18th in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> mid March 1980, Wright was dismissed. Youth coach Barry Lyons succeeded him, initially as caretaker manager, before being appointed permanently in May 1980.|$|E
5|$|York were {{fourth in}} the table 12 matches into 1969–70. Their {{promotion}} challenge faded and they finished the season 13th. York reached the fourth round of the FA Cup {{for the first time}} since 1958, and played two Second Division teams; after beating Cardiff City 3–1 at St Andrew's in a second replay, they lost 4–1 to Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park. Barry Jackson, who made a club-record 539 appearances for York, was released at the end of the season. York started 1970–71 strongly, and after faltering midseason they went unbeaten in 16 consecutive matches to enter the top four. Despite losing three of their last four fixtures, York remained in fourth place to earn a third promotion. They also reached the FA Cup fourth round for the second successive season; after drawing 3–3 at home to First Division team Southampton they were beaten 3–2 in the replay at the Dell. York started 1971–72 with three wins from eight matches, but after failing to win in 11 consecutive matches they dropped into the bottom four. They finished 19th on goal average and avoided relegation. In the third round of the League Cup, York played First Division team Sheffield United, losing 3–1 at Bramall Lane. York failed to win any of their first 11 matches in 1972–73, but results improved and they were 10th in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>by</b> early March 1973. Another downturn in form followed before York beat Rotherham United in the last match of the season to finish 18th, avoiding relegation from the Third Division on goal average for the second successive year.|$|E
