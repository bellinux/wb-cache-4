5|$|The {{algorithm}} {{accepts a}} 32-bit floating-point number as the input and stores a halved value for later use. Then, treating the bits representing the floating-point number as a 32-bit integer, a logical shift right by one bit is performed {{and the result}} subtracted from <b>the</b> <b>magic</b> <b>number</b> 0x5F3759DF. This is the first approximation of the inverse square root of the input. Treating the bits again as a floating-point number, it runs one iteration of Newton's method, yielding a more precise approximation.|$|E
5|$|The great {{rarity of}} the proton-rich 136Ce and 138Ce is {{explained}} by the fact that they cannot be made in the most common processes of stellar nucleosynthesis for elements beyond iron, the s-process (slow neutron capture) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture). This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides. Such nuclei are called p-nuclei, and their origin is not yet well understood: some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration. 140Ce is the most common isotope of cerium, as it can be produced in both the s- and r-processes, while 142Ce can only be produced in the r-process. Another reason for the abundance of 140Ce is that it is a magic nucleus, having a closed neutron shell (it has 82 neutrons), and hence it has a very low cross-section towards further neutron capture. Although its proton number of 58 is not magic, it is granted additional stability, as its eight additional protons past <b>the</b> <b>magic</b> <b>number</b> 50 enter and complete the 1g7/2 proton orbital. The abundances of the cerium isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources, because 138Ce and 140Ce are the daughters of the long-lived primordial radionuclides 138La and 144Nd, respectively.|$|E

Note the nearly pure tone at 2000Hz with a Strouhal number of 0.21 protruding above the turbulent sound spectrum. Once again <b>the</b> <b>magic</b> <b>number</b> of Strouhal appears. The characteristic speed was the mean speed of the jet, U and the characteristic dimension was chosen as the trailing edge thickness t. The better characteristic dimension would have been the boundary layer thickness, but fortunately the two dimensions were almost the same. The measured sound field was clearly dipole-like (modified slightly by the plate presence).|$|E
25|$|The Blue Jays, {{still looking}} to clinch the division, {{travelled}} to Baltimore for a 4-game series. Behind 3–1 {{in the first}} game, Toronto rallied and tied {{the game in the}} eighth inning, before taking the lead in the ninth and holding on to win 4–3. The win lowered the team's magic number to 2. The second game of the series was rained out, and rescheduled for a doubleheader the following day. While the Blue Jays were idle due to the rain out, the Yankees lost to the Red Sox, and <b>the</b> <b>magic</b> <b>number</b> was lowered to 1. The Blue Jays would clinch the division by winning {{the first game of the}} doubleheader, 15–2. The starters were rested in the second game of the doubleheader, as well as in the final game of the series. Toronto lost both games, 8–1 and 6–4. Still in contention for the best record and home field advantage throughout the playoffs, the Blue Jays played their final three regular season games in Tampa Bay against the Rays. Troy Tulowitzki returned to the lineup in the first game of the series, recording 2 hits as Toronto defeated Tampa 8–4. Roberto Osuna would take the blown save and loss in the second game, as the Rays rallied in the ninth inning to win 4–3. Mark Buehrle was given the start in the final game of the season, despite having started just two days prior, and entered the game just 2 innings short of reaching 200 for the 15th consecutive season. Unfortunately, Buehrle was not able to get out of the first inning, ending his streak as the Jays lost the game 12–3. The loss ensured that Kansas City would finish with the best record in the American League, and that the Blue Jays would play the Texas Rangers in the American League Division Series.|$|E

500|$|It is {{not known}} {{precisely}} how the exact value for <b>the</b> <b>magic</b> <b>number</b> was determined. [...] Chris Lomont developed a function to minimize approximation error by choosing <b>the</b> <b>magic</b> <b>number</b> R over a range. He first computed the optimal constant for the linear approximation step as 0x5F37642F, close to 0x5F3759DF, but this new constant gave slightly less accuracy after one iteration of Newton's method. Lomont then searched for a constant optimal even after one and two Newton iterations and found 0x5F375A86, which is more accurate than the original at every iteration stage. He concluded by asking whether the exact value of the original constant was chosen through derivation or trial and error. [...] Lomont pointed out that <b>the</b> <b>magic</b> <b>number</b> for 64 bit IEEE754 size type double is 0x5FE6EC85E7DE30DA, but it was later shown by Matthew Robertson to be exactly 0x5FE6EB50C7B537A9.|$|E

Of particular note is 298Fl, which would be [...] "doubly magic" [...] (both its proton number of 114 and neutron number of 184 are thought to be magic) and thus the most likely to have a very long half-life.

2500|$|Potter's last works went in new directions. In 1959 {{he wrote}} a {{corporate}} history of H.J. Heinz under the title <b>The</b> <b>Magic</b> <b>Number,</b> and his autobiography of his first 20 years, Steps to Immaturity. His publisher was doubtful about the latter, but it was well received. The Times Literary Supplement, called it [...] "this sympathetic, beguiling book" [...] and looked forward to a sequel, and other papers from The Daily Express to The New Statesman praised it in their reviews. [...] In 1965 when his youngest son was about 9 years old, Potter wrote a children's book, Squawky, illustrated by George Him, {{with whom he had}} earlier created the mythical County of Schweppshire as part of an advertising campaign for a soft-drink manufacturer. At {{the time of his death}} he was making notes on word origins from the natural world; they were posthumously edited and published in 1973 as Pedigree: Essays on the Etymology of Words from Nature.|$|E
2500|$|Anton Codelli ( [...] 22nd. March, † 28. April 1954), a Slovenian nobleman, was {{a passionate}} inventor. Among other things, he had devised a {{miniature}} refrigerator for cars {{and a new}} rotary engine design. Intrigued by television, he decided to apply his technical skills to the new medium. At the time, the biggest challenge in television technology was to transmit images with sufficient resolution to reproduce recognizable figures. As recounted by media historian Melita Zajc, most inventors were determined {{to increase the number}} of lines used by their systems – some were approaching what was then <b>the</b> <b>magic</b> <b>number</b> of 100 lines. But Baron Codelli had a different idea. In 1929, he developed a television device with a single line – but one that formed a continuous spiral on the screen. Codelli based his ingenious design on his understanding of the human eye. He knew that objects seen in peripheral vision don’t need to be as sharp as those in the center. The baron’s mechanical television system, whose image was sharpest in the middle, worked well, and he was soon able to transmit images of his wife, Ilona von Drasche-Lazar, over the air.|$|E
2500|$|Rick Porcello pitched {{his third}} {{complete}} {{game of the}} season for his 21st win on just 89 pitches. He allowed two runs on four hits and struck out seven. Mookie Betts went deep for the eighth time this season in Camden Yards to give the Red Sox a third inning 2–0 lead. Dustin Pedroia plated Andrew Benintendi and David Ortiz homered for the 35th time to pad the lead to 5–1 in the fifth. In game two, Mookie Betts became the first major league player with 200 hits, 100 RBI and 100 runs scored since Miguel Cabrera won the triple crown in 2012. David Ortiz opened the one-run game wide open with a three-run shot in the seventh. Eduardo Rodríguez bounced back from his performance against the Yankees, and went 6 [...] innings, allowing two runs on 4 hits. The Orioles took a 1–0 lead in game three into the sixth, avoiding two bases loaded situations in the first and fourth inning. In the sixth, Jackie Bradley Jr. struck out with the bases loaded and one out. Sandy León hit a ground ball to Chris Davis at first, but he threw it past the pitcher Brad Brach and two runs scored. On the very next pitch Andrew Benintendi drove the ball out of Camden Yards for his second career-home run. Clay Buchholz just allowed the one run on three hits in seven innings and Boston won the season series against Baltimore {{for the first time since}} 2011. In the last game of the series, Buck Showalter pulled his ace Chris Tillman after 1 [...] innings. He allowed three runs, including a bases loaded walk to David Ortiz. The O's came back on a three-run shot off of David Price by rookie Trey Mancini in the third. Andrew Benintendi drove in Travis Shaw in the fifth, which was the difference in this game. Hanley Ramírez continued his hot September, with his 29th home run of the season and his 10th in the month, to give the Red Sox some insurance. Price went seven innings and was backed up by Koji Uehara and Craig Kimbrel, who struck out a combined four batters. The Red Sox swept back-to-back four-game series for the first time since July 1 through 7 in 1968, against the Athletics and Twins. Boston went from 2 games back, to start the month, to a 5 [...] game lead over the Blue Jays in the AL East, with only nine games left on the season.
