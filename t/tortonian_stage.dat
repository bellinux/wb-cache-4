40|$|Abstract In the {{internal}} zones of the Betic cordilleras, extensional structures have {{developed from the}} Upper Oligocene to the present day; they are contemporaneous with compressional structures (folds and thrusts) in the external zones. From the Upper Oligocene to the Aquitanian, extension occurred in the Maláguide/Alpujárride detachment, and related structures show varying kinematics in different sectors. Younger deformations with a top-to-the-N sense of movement have affected Nevado-Filábride (ductile shear zones), Alpujárride (ductile and brittle shear zones) and Maláguide rocks (normal faults). At least from the Late Burdigalian up to the Lower Tortonian, displacements {{have occurred in the}} Alpujárride/Nevado-Filábride detachment. Deformations have been generally non-coaxial, with a topto-the-W sense of movement. Stretching lineation trends in the Nevado-Filábride rocks curve from E to W suggesting a progressive variation of the ductileshear-zone kinematics related to the Alpujárride/Nevado-Filábride detachment between the Aquitanian and Lower <b>Tortonian</b> <b>stages.</b> Deformations from the Lower Tortonian to the present day are normal faults, formed in extensional settings in {{the upper part of the}} crust, and folds and strike-slip faults which indicate N– S to NNW–SSE shortening directions and E–W to ENE–WSW extension directions...|$|R
40|$|The lateral {{ending of}} the South Shetland Trench is {{analysed}} {{on the basis of}} swath bathymetry and multichannel seismic profiles in order to establish the tectonic and stratigraphic features of the transition from an northeastward active to a southwestward passive margin style. This trench is associated with a lithospheric-scale thrust accommodating the internal deformation in the Antarctic Plate and its lateral end represents the tip-line of this thrust. The evolutionary model deduced from the structures and the stratigraphic record includes a first stage with a compressional deformation, predating the end of the subduction in the southwestern part of the study area that produced reverse faults in the oceanic crust during the <b>Tortonian.</b> The second <b>stage</b> occurred during the Messinian and includes distributed compressional deformation around the tip-line of the basal detachment, originating a high {{at the base of the}} slope and the collapse of the now inactive accretionary prism of the passive margin. The initial subduction of the high at the base of the slope induced the deformation of the accretionary prism and the formation of another high in the shelf—the Shelf Transition High.

40|$|Special Meeting of the APF on Biodiversity and Biodiversity Crisis in North Africa during Neogene, Paris, FRANCE, NOV 28 - 29, 2006 International audienceFifty {{calcareous}} nannofossil {{species were}} {{listed in the}} upper Miocene deposits of the Northern Chelif Basin (Dahra, Ben Dourda section). The frequence of some of them (Discoaster loeblichii, D. quinqueramus, Amaurolithus primus and A. amplificus) suggests the presence of four subzones (NN 10 a, NN 10 b, NN 11 b, NN 11 c) which are assigned to the <b>Tortonian</b> and Messinian <b>stages.</b> The NN 11 a subzone is absent (hiatus), testified by the (first) simultaneous occurrence (FO) of D. quinqueramus and A. primus. In the same samples, planktonic foraminifera analysis revealed a comparable succession of biozones (Neogloboquadrina acostaensis, N. humerosa-N. dutertrei and Globorotalia mediterranea) which make possible a good calibration between biostratigraphic scales (calcareous nannofossils, foraminifera). The Tortonian-Messinian boundary is pointed out at the sample 28 of the section and characterized by the first occurrence (FO) of A. delicatus and Reticulo/enestra rotaria {{on the one hand}} and G. mediterranea on the other hand.

5000|$|Mourasuchus is an extinct genus {{of giant}} crocodilian from the Miocene of South America. The skull has been {{described}} as duck like, being broad, flat and very elongate, closely resembling what is seen in Stomatosuchus, an unrelated crocodilian that may also have had a large gular sac similar to those of pelicans or baleen whales. [...] Mourasuchus had rows of small, conical teeth numbering around 40 {{on each side of the}} upper and lower jaws. Mourasuchus presumably obtained its food by filter feeding; the jaws were too gracile for the animal to have captured larger prey. It also probed the bottoms of lakes and rivers for food. Fossils have been found in the Fitzcarrald Arch of Peru, where it coexisted with many other crocodilians, including the giant gharial, Gryposuchus, and the alligatorid Purussaurus, both of which were 12 m. The great diversity of crocodylomorphs in this Miocene-age (<b>Tortonian</b> <b>stage,</b> 8 million years ago) wetland suggests that niche partitioning was efficient, which would have limited interspecific competition.|$|E
40|$|The glauconite-rich Diest Formation {{in central}} and north Belgium {{contains}} sands in the Campine subsurface and the hilly Hageland area that can be distinguished from each other. The Hageland Diest Sands member contains no stratigraphically relevant fossils while in the Campine subsurface dinoflagellate cysts are common and show a stratigraphic range covering the entire <b>Tortonian</b> <b>stage.</b> K-Ar dates were determined for glauconite from 13 selected samples spread over both areas. A glauconite date corresponding to the earliest Tortonian indicates newly formed glauconite was incorporated into a greensand {{at the base of}} the Diest Formation in the central Campine area. All other dates point at reworked glauconite and can be organized in two groups, one reflecting a Burdigalian age and another reflecting a Langhian age. These data and the thickness and glauconite content of the Diest Formation imply massive reworking of older Miocene deposits. The paleogeographic implications of these data lead to the tentative recognition of two Tortonian sedimentary sequences. An older one corresponding to dinoflagellate biochron DN 8 comprises the Deurne Member, part of the Dessel Member, the Hageland Diest member, the eastern Campine Diest member and some basal sands of the Diest Formation in the central Campine. A younger sequence corresponding to dinoflagellate biochrons DN 9 and 10 was strongly influenced by the prograding proto-Rhine delta front in the Roer Valley Graben to the northeast.

40|$|Lamproite volcanoes are {{uncommon}} in the geological record but are exceptionally well {{preserved in the}} Betic Cordilleras of SE Spain, where they erupted during the Late Miocene (<b>Tortonian</b> to Messinian <b>stages).</b> The parent melts {{are thought to have}} been channelled through major lithospheric faults to erupt at or near the faulted margins of Neogene sedimentary basins. Lamproite magmas are thought to be relatively CO 2 -poor (< 1 wt %) and are typically characterised by an effusive eruption style and the development of lava lakes and scoria cones. Cabezo María is a relatively small (∼ 550 m diameter) lamproite volcano that was emplaced within the shallow-water marine-influenced Vera Basin. The lamproites are compositionally {{similar to those of the}} Roman Province and generally less potassic (K 2 O< 5 wt%) than other (ultra-) potassic rocks in SE Spain (e. g. Cancarix, Fortuna). The initial eruption stages were dominated by explosive magma-water interactions and the formation of peperites. These are characterised by angular fragments of glassy lamproite lavas (and isolated lobes) incorporated in sediments, locally showing the effects of thermal metamorphism. Further, elutriation pipes and ‘jigsaw-fit’ textures are observed in the peperites. The lavas and peperites are overlain by outward-dipping well-stratified scoria deposits defining part of a cinder cone, which is inferred to have emerged above sea level. Steep internal contacts with inward-dipping, structureless breccias likely represent the inner wall deposits of a central conduit. The deposits are cross-cut by late-stage dykes, which supplied fissure eruptions of geochemically similar lavas capping the scoria cone. The transition from explosive to effusive behaviour may reflect the decreased availability of water, possibly due to downward migration of the feeder conduit below the level of water-saturated sediments...|$|R
40|$|The Middle to Late Miocene (15. 97 – 5. 33 Ma) is {{considered}} a time interval that was warmer than today. It is also a time interval of significant cooling. The {{aim of this study}} is to provide a new global view of this 10 Ma interval of global warmth and climate change, through the use of vegetation, mammals and modelling. The study begins in the UK and uses palynology to assign, the previously poorly constrained, Brassington Formation to the Tortonian. The pollen of the Brassington Formation shows the existence of a warm-temperate mixed forest in the UK with a mean annual temperature of 16 °C – roughly twice the modern mean annual temperature. Using this fossil site, as well as 633 others, the global biome distributions are determined for the Langhian, Seravallian, <b>Tortonian</b> and Messinian <b>stages.</b> The data show that the Langhian represents a world significantly warmer than today. Cooling occurred through the Seravallian and Tortonian and by the Messinian, this cooling trend had eliminated warm – temperate mixed forests from the western USA and Australia and had formed mid – latitude deserts. Using the palaeobotanical data for the Tortonian age a data – model hybrid vegetation map has been made, suitable for use in palaeoclimate modelling studies. This is then used as a boundary condition in the HadAM 3 climate model to show influence of vegetation on the Tortonian climate. Finally the palaeoecology of Late Miocene mammals is investigated to develop a new proxy for vegetation. The co–occurrence technique uses the biome tolerances of Late Miocene mammals to reconstruct regional vegetation. This has been successfully used to add further details to the vegetation maps from palaeobotanical data. This study presents a new approach to exploring vegetation and climate during the Miocene and provides novel details on this dynamic epoch...|$|R
40|$|The Sea of Marmara {{region is}} thought to have been a gateway between Paratethys and the Mediterranean since the Middle Miocene, and is {{therefore}} an important control on water mass exchange between the two realms. The Miocene successions in the northeastern Aegean and northwestern Marmara regions indicate that the first Mediterranean marine transgression to affect these areas occurred during the late Serravallian. In the northeastern Aegean region, frequent marine incursions occurred during the <b>Tortonian</b> and Messinian <b>stages.</b> The Messinian stage in this area is represented by a package of brackish- to fresh-water carbonates with some marine sandstone–siltstone interbeds (Alçıtepe Formation), which conformably overlies the Tortonian Kirazlı Formation. The Messinian sequence is overlain with an erosional contact by a shallow marine siliciclastic sequence (Göztepe Formation) of Zanclean age. With its brackish- to fresh-water carbonates and broadly constrained age, the Messinian sequence is interpreted as being coeval with the Upper Evaporite–Lago Mare sequence observed in western Mediterranean basins. In the western Marmara region, the Pontian (Messinian) Alçıtepe Formation consists of bioclastic and oolitic limestones with basal clastic rocks. It conformably overlies the fluvio-lacustrine siliciclastic sediments of the Middle to Upper Miocene Kirazlı Formation and is overlain by fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the Kimmerian (5. 5 – 3. 2 Ma) Truva and Tevfikiye formations with an erosional contact. The bioclastic limestones of the Alçıtepe Formation in the western Marmara region contain a molluscan and ostracod fauna that are endemic to Paratethys. These fauna indicate deposition in a shallow, brackish- to fresh-water environment. Faunal and paleomagnetic analyses of a section of the Alçıtepe Formation at Yenimahalle (Çanakkale) confirm that the formation is of Pontian age and represents chron C 3 r (6. 04 – 5. 24 Ma). The ostracod analysis indicates that during deposition of the Alçıtepe Formation, salinity increased from brackish in the lower part to more saline conditions in the upper part. Ostracod valves have low 87 Sr / 86 Sr values relative to coeval Late Miocene ocean water. This indicates that exchange between the Sea of Marmara region and the global ocean was restricted throughout this period. Fossil and Sr-isotope evidence suggests, however, that there was a Paratethyan–Marmara connection during the deposition of {{the lower part of the}} Alçıtepe Formation, with Paratethyan influence reaching the north Aegean. Connection via Marmara between Paratethys and the Mediterranean was not re-established until the late Aktchagylian (Late Pliocene). The re-connection was caused by both increased activity on the North Anatolian Fault and global sea level rise...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} integrated stratigraphy including biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, tephrostratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy {{is presented}} {{for the upper}} Tortonian and lower Messinian (Upper Miocene) at Monte dei Corvi. Numerical age control comes {{from a combination of}} magnetobiostratigrapic dating and astronomical tuning, while radioisotope dating of ash layers produced less reliable ages. The deep marine succession is characterized by large-scale non-repetitive stratigraphic changes allowing the discrimination between a Lower, Brownish, Rossini and Euxinic Shale Interval. The sedimentary cycles, which occur superimposed on these large-scale changes, are related to astronomical climate forcing. Astronomical tuning of the sedimentary cycles provides not only absolute ages for biostratigraphic events, reversal boundaries and volcanic ash layers, but also for the observed non-cyclic changes. These can be linked to environmental and geodynamic changes in the Mediterranean region preceding the Messinian Salinity Crisis. The beginning of the Brownish Interval marked by tripartite cycles at 8. 017  Ma coincides with tectonic re-arrangements in the Mediterranean, such as compression in the Betics and opening of the Rifian corridor. At 7. 616  Ma the change to the calcareous Rossini Interval can be linked to tectonic uplift in the northern Apennines and the deepening of the Rifian corridor, while the Betic corridor became restricted coinciding with the end of evaporite deposition in the eastern Betics. The change to euxinic shales at 7. 168  Ma reflects basin-wide restriction marked by diatomite and sapropel formation in the Mediterranean basin related to the severely constricted Betic and Rifian corridors. The occurrence of a tripartite construction of cycles in the euxinic shales at 6. 719  Ma coincides with diatomite formation in the eastern Mediterranean, uplift and shallowing in the Northern Apennines and further constriction of the Atlantic gateways. We conclude that late Tortonian-early Messinian tectonic and environmental events occur remarkably synchronously in the Mediterranean basin and most likely result from a combination of geodynamic processes and eccentricity-controlled climatic changes. In combination with the upper Serravallian and lower Tortonian interval, which includes the formal Tortonian Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), the Monte dei Corvi is the only complete section in the Mediterranean covering the entire <b>Tortonian</b> <b>Stage.</b> We therefore propose the Monte dei Corvi section as Tortonian reference section, particularly for the Mediterranean region. In addition, it may serve as a unit-stratotype for the Tortonian...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of microplankton occurrence (planktonic foraminifera, nannoplankton, dinocysts) in Neogene sediments {{situated at the}} north-western and south-eastern margins of Ukraine enabled us to distinguish 10 associations of oceanic plankton which specified the relative age of lithostratigraphic units of various regions and were used as correlation levels within the Central and Eastern Paratethys strata. Moreover, an attempt to correlate regional stages and the International Stratigraphic Chart (ISC) is performed. The Oligocene/Miocene boundary (of ISC) represented by the correlation level I was placed within the Central Paratethys regional stage Egerian {{and in the middle}} part of the Eastern Paratethys regional stage Caucasian s. l. The latter regional stage is subdivided by the correlation level into two substages: Lower Caucasian (Chattian of ISC) and Upper Caucasian (Aquitanian of ISC). The correlation level II was placed within {{the upper part of the}} Eggenburgian and lower part of the Batisifonian (Sakaraulian) regional stages and is correlated approximately with the middle part of the Burdigalian (of ISC). The base of the Middle Miocene is marked by level IV and was recognized only in deposits of the Eastern Paratethys belonging to the Tarkhanian regional stage. This level corresponds to the lowermost Badenian and Langhian (of ISC) stages. Correlation level V is traced in the Konkian sediments of the Eastern Paratethys and is compared with the Upper Badenian and Lower Serravalian (of ISC) stages. Level VI at the Middle/Upper Miocene boundary is situated in the middle part of the Bessarabian regional substage of the Eastern Paratethys and enables its correlation with the Serravallian/Tortonian boundary (of ISC). Level VII is recognized in the Baherovo Member (Meotian stage), while level VIII is fixed at the top of the Meotian regional stage in the Azov and Black Seas, Crimea and adjacent region named Northern Prichornomorye. Both these levels are also identified in the Berezhnytsya Formation of the Eastern Carpathian Foredeep. Correlation of these sediments is similar to the correlation of sediments of Lake Pannon (Pannonian regional stage), hence with the <b>Tortonian</b> <b>stage</b> (of ISC). Level IX was recognized in sediments of the Azov Member belonging to the Kimmerian regional stage of the Eastern Paratethys and represents the top of the Miocene strata. Level X occurs within the Taman Member of the Black Sea shelf and is correlated with the upper part of Kuyalnikian regional stage; corresponding to the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary...|$|E
40|$|The p 1 anktonic foraminifers and {{calcareous}} nannofossils assemblages of ten Miocene stratigraphic {{sections of}} the Tremiti Islands have been studied. The investigated succession includes the Cretaccio Formation (about 165 m thick) and the basal part (about 3 m thick) of the overling S. Nicola Formation. The first unit lies with angular unconformity on the S. Domino Formation (Oligocene in age) and its base (3 - 3. 80 m) is composed of green (red when wheathered) glauconitic doloarenites which are often thinly stratified or laminitic and with Elasmobranch teeth and apatite grains. Carbonatic fraction is absent in the glauconitic doloarenites because of dissolution. They are followed by about 22 m of stratified ocraceous-yellow dolomitic limestones (the thickness of the strata is from decimetric to beyond 2 m), more arenaceous in the lower part and more marly in the upper part. The carbonates dissolution characterizes {{the lower part of}} this interval and decreases progressively upwards; so the calcareous plankton becomes abundant and well preserved from {{the upper part of the}} interval. However the major lithology of the Cretaccio Formation is represented by decimetric-metric light marly layers (in particular whitish and reddish bands are alterned) (about 140 m thick); the calcareous plankton is constantly abundan. In the uppermost part of the formation, an interval 3 - 5 m thick, rich in glauconite and fossils (especially Flabellipecten and Neopycnodonte) was observed. In the studied sections, the S. Nicola Formation conformably lies on the glauconitic calcarenites; previously, the Authors reported an unconformable boundary between the two formations. Only the lowermost part (3 m thick) of S. Nicola Formation has been studied; it is composed of yellowish calcarenites and the whitish limestones with Cardium and Serpulids assemb 1 ages (calcareous plankton is rare or absent, while microbenthos is abundant). In the succession all the planktonic foraminifers and nannofossils gones and subzones of the Langhian-Messinian interval were recognized; from the biostratigraphic point of view the succession encompasses the interval from Praeorbulina glomerosa s. l Zone (P. glomerosa sicana Subzone) and Discoaster exilis-Sphenolithus heteromorphus Zone (D. exilis-Helicosphaera ampliaperta Subzone) to ’Xon distinctive” Zone and Amaurolithus delicatus-A. amplificus Zone, respectively. For each biostratigraphic units we provide: the lower and upper boun- dary, the thickness, the reliability and the succession of the bioevents and a short description of the associations. In the S. Domino, Caprara and Cretaccio islands, the Cretaccio Formation is Langhian. A Burdigalian age (G. trilobus Zone and S. heteromorphus Zone of the foraminifers and calcareous nannofossi 1 s, respectively) for the lower part of the formation, glauconitic and barren of calcareous plankton could not be excluded. In the S. Nicola Island the Cretaccio Formation includes also the Serravallian, <b>Tortonian</b> and Messinian <b>stages.</b> In particular, the glauconite rich levels of the upper part of the unit belong to the last two stages representing a condensed and perhaps also discontinuous sedimentation, probahly due to strong currents effects. For the first time, a Messinian age for the upper part of the Cretaccio Formation and for the lowermost part of the S. Nicola Formation has been documented on the basis of the calcareous plankton. In the past, the S. Nicola Formation has been considered of Middle Pliocene age. The Messinian age of these sediments is also confirmed by the presence of the benthonic forarniniferal assernblages with Bulimina echinata, Bolivina dentellata and Rectuvigerina gaudrynoides. Through the new bio-chronostratigraphic framing, the Miocene sedirnentary succession of the Tremiti Islands is perfectly correlable to that of central-southern Salento Peninsula. Infact, the two areas are very similar for theirs lythologic, chronological and dynamic features. Also the closure of Miocene cycle sedimentation is synchronous in both localities and realized during Messinian. In appendix, the cornplete list of the taxa and their original references are added.
