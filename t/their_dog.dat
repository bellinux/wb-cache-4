In-depth interviews were conducted and four major themes on purchase behavior of dog related products and services emerged, namely loving my pet dog means loving myself, sense of possession, attachment and sacrifice and my pet is like me. The findings show that generally these <b>dog</b> owners consider <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> as an extension of themselves with some participants demonstrating a stronger self-extension on <b>their</b> pets. <b>Dog</b> owners who view <b>their</b> <b>dogs</b> as <b>their</b> extended self, made purchase decisions as though they were purchasing and consuming these products and services for themselves.
