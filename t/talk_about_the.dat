5|$|The latter {{notation}} generalizes {{to yield}} the notation f for the nth derivative of f – this notation is most useful when {{we wish to}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> derivative as being a function itself, as {{in this case the}} Leibniz notation can become cumbersome.|$|E

5|$|Burnside, {{against the}} advice of the president, prematurely {{launched}} an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker, despite his record of loose <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> need for a military dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|Cope {{travels with}} Knight to Europe; Knight with the {{intention}} of visiting Paris zoos, Cope with the intent of selling off much of his bone collection. Cope has also spent much of his money buying The American Naturalist, a paper in which he plans to attack Marsh's dealings. Hatcher arrives in New York to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> find Laelaps; in his speech, he subtly hints at the folly of Marsh's elitism and backstabbing, as well as Cope's collecting obsession.|$|E
5000|$|... {{simply by}} letting [...] and {{extending}} linearly. Thus, {{representations of the}} group correspond exactly to representations of the algebra, and so, in a certain sense, <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> one is <b>the</b> same as <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|R

5|$|It's my {{definitive}} {{statement in}} regards to the incredible pay-back I've received for having the nerve to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> things that I did {{in the past few years}} with my Sex book and my record. It's getting it off my chest. It is defensive, absolutely. But it's also sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek. And I'm not sorry. I do not apologize for any of it.|$|E
5|$|Ketty's {{depiction}} as {{a double}} agent and Flammen's lover {{has also been}} contested by Birkelund.

Her involvement with the Gestapo leader Hoffmann, and her refusal to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> topic, were {{the main reasons for}} Madsen's conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Madame Schmidt did not <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter {{even after}} the war. She died in 1954 {{at the age of}} 71 without {{revealing}} the identity of any of her former employees. Total number of Gestapo recordings from the brothel was estimated by the Stasi (East German Security Service) to be about 25,000. Virtually all of the recordings have since been lost or destroyed due to their post-war unimportance. According to a 2005 article in Die Tageszeitung, the brothel continued to exist after World War II under the management of Schmidt's son and daughter. In the 1990s, it was turned into a home for asylum-seekers, which was closed soon after because of local protest against the residents.|$|E

5|$|The {{length of}} time that a typical {{prisoner}} was kept at the Bastille continued to decline, and by Louis XVI's reign {{the average length of}} detention was only two months. Prisoners would still be expected to sign a document on their release, promising not to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Bastille or their time within it, but by the 1780s this agreement was frequently broken. Prisoners leaving the Bastille could be granted pensions on their release by the Crown, either as a form of compensation or as a way of ensuring future good behaviour – Voltaire was granted 1,200 livres a year, for example, while Latude received an annual pension of 400 livres.|$|E
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of English {{soldiers}} by ship, and naval battles on the seas, areas used for salt water fishing became perilous, and lay dormant {{for much of the}} war. In addition, many of the fishing vessels were converted into warships. Before the war, there was often <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> excess of lobsters and cod off the shores of New England. This seemed to change during and after the war, due to the vast numbers of ships and artillery entering the ocean waters. Once lobster harvesting and cod fishing was reestablished, most fishermen found that the lobster and cod had migrated away from the shores.|$|E
