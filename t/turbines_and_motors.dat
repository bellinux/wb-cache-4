50|$|The artists {{collective}} {{known as}} The Werehouse began with five young men squatting {{on the second}} floor of an abandoned meat packing plant. With a grand purpose in mind, the building was officially rented in 1996 and purchased soon thereafter. The spirit of the five pioneers, setting out to simply render the building livable by installing windows, doors, plumbing and wiring has continued to this day with a new metamorphosis each year. Evidence of the structure's original incarnation can be found in the 2 ft cork ceiling, a covered trough running along the east wall which was used for animal waste and the three small rooms stacked atop one another filling what was once the freight elevator. Now antiquated photographs show evidence of the 67 VW-sized <b>turbines</b> <b>and</b> <b>motors</b> which were removed to begin what is now the performance space on the ground floor. In these early years a house party atmosphere was the rule when nationwide touring artists like, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Will Oldham and the Bindlestiff Family Cirkus dropped by.|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} is a {{new approach}} to designing foil bearings to increase their load capacity and improve their reliability through passive thermal management. In the present case, the bearing is designed {{in such a way as}} to prevent the carryover of lubricant from the exit of one sector to the inlet of the ensuing sector of the foil bearing. When such passive thermal management techniques are used, bearing load capacity is improved by multiples, and reliability is enhanced when compared to current foil bearings. This concept has recently been tested and validated, and shows that load capacity performance of foil bearings can be improved by a factor of two at relatively low speeds with potentially greater relative improvements at higher speeds. Such improvements in performance with respect to speed are typical of foil bearings. Additionally, operation of these newly conceived bearings shows much more reliability and repeatable performance. This trait can be exploited in machine design to enhance safety, reliability, and overall performance. Finally, lower frictional torque has been demonstrated when operating at lower (non-load capacity) loads, thus providing another improvement above the current state of the art. The objective of the invention is to incorporate features into a foil bearing that both enhance passive thermal management and temperature control, while at the same time improve the hydrodynamic (load capacity) performance of the foil bearing. Foil bearings are unique antifriction devices that can utilize the working fluid of a machine as a lubricant (typically air for <b>turbines</b> <b>and</b> <b>motors,</b> liquids for pumps), and as a coolant to remove excess energy due to frictional heating. The current state of the art of foil bearings utilizes forced cooling of the bearing and shaft, which represents poor efficiency and poor reliability. This invention embodies features that utilize the bearing geometry in such a manner as to both support load and provide an inherent and passive cooling mechanism. This cooling mechanism functions in such a way as to prevent used (higher temperature) lubricant from being carried over from the exit of one sector into the entry of the next sector of the foil bearing. The disclosed innovation is an improved foil bearing design that reduces or eliminates the need for force cooling of the bearing, while at the same time improving the load capacity of the bearing by at least a factor of two. These improvements are due to the elimination of lubricant carryover from the trailing edge of one sector into the leading edge of the next, and the mixing of used lubricant with the surrounding ambient fluid...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} an optimal load {{frequency}} controller for multi area electric power systems is presented. In multi area electric power systems if a large load is suddenly connected (or disconnected) to the system, or if a generating unit is suddenly disconnected by the protection equipment, {{there will be}} a long-term distortion in the power balance between that delivered by the <b>turbines</b> <b>and</b> that consumed by the loads. This imbalance is initially covered from the kinetic energy of rotating rotors of <b>turbines,</b> generators <b>and</b> <b>motors</b> <b>and,</b> as a result, the frequency in the system will change.

In order to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional PI controllers, numerous techniques have been proposed in literatures. In this paper a IP type controller is considered for LFC problem. The parameters of the proposed IP controller are tuned using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. A multi area electric power system with a wide range of parametric uncertainties is given to illustrate proposed method. To show effectiveness of the proposed method, a PI type controller optimized by PSO is incorporated in order to comparison with the proposed IP controller.
