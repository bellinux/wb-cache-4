In this work we applied AM to design and build a disposable bioreactor in combination with a scaffold. This work applies rapid prototyping {{to design and fabricate}} scaffolds pre-enclosed into a disposable and ready-to-use perfusion chamber. Computerized tomography was used to scan a 3 cm sheep <b>tibia</b> <b>section</b> and generate a porous computer model replica. A fully enclosed perfusion chamber was designed around the replica. As a proof of principle the perfusion chamber and porous implant within were prototyped in one single piece by fused deposition modeling of ABS. The device’s watertightness was conﬁrmed by micro-CT and high ﬂow perfusion studies. Micro-CT also conﬁrmed that although prototyped in one piece, one inside the other, the implant and surrounding chamber were not merged together at any point. Opening the chamber we observed that perfused ﬂuids had totally and homogenously reached the highly interconnected porous network of the scaffold. This device is currently being fabricated from PLA for performing in vitro perfusion cell cultures in its interior.  This work demonstrated {{the possibility to}} produce easy- and ready-to-use ﬂuid-efﬁcient culture chambers pre-enclosing tailor-made and patient-speciﬁc scaffolds...|$|E
40|$|The SKITTER 2 {{design is}} a {{monocoque}} {{version of the}} proposed lunar three-legged walker. By the definition of monocoque, the body and legs are a shell with no internal ribbing or supports added for absorbing stresses. The purpose of the monocoque is to encase the elements used for power transmission, power supply, {{and control of the}} motion. The material for the structure is a vinyl ester resin, Derakane 8084. This material is easily formable and locally obtainable. The body consists of a hexagonally shaped cylinder with truncated hexagonal pyramids on the top and botton. The legs are eight inch diameter cylinders. The legs are comprised of a <b>tibia</b> <b>section</b> and a femur section. The SKITTER 2 is powered by six actuators which provide linear forces that are transformed into rotary torques by a series of chains and sprockets. The joints connect the femur to the body and the tibia to the femur. Surrounding the joints are flexible rubber hoses that fully encase the chains and sprockets. The SKITTER 2 is capable of walking upside down, righting itself after being overturned, and has the ability to perform in many environments. Applications for this walker include lunar transport or drilling, undersea exploration, and operation in severe surroundings such as arctic temperatures or high radiation...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: In {{situations}} where the skeletal remains found are too fragmented, {{it is necessary to}} assess the human origin of such remains; for this purpose, various parameters are used, both anatomical and histological. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the various histomorphometric parameters to differentiate human from non-human bones, to further construct discriminatory functions that allow interspecies classification. <b>Tibia</b> bones <b>sections</b> from human, bovine, pig, hen, cat, and dog species were used, processed through conventional histological techniques and observed under the microscope with a 40 x magnification, analyzing the Haversian Canal Density parameters by mm 2, Diameter of the Haversian Canal and the Diameter of the Haversian System which were compared through one way ANOVA with Scheff post test, p< 0. 05. Subsequently, the discriminatory functions were constructed for each species and the percentage of well-diagnosed cases was determined. Meaningful differences were found in the parameters analyzed; the discriminatory functions allowed to correctly classify 88. 5 % of the cases. Our results suggest {{that it is possible to}} differentiate human skeletal remains from non-human through the observation of their histological characteristics and histomorphometric parameters, but interspecies differentiation requires a more complex analysis.

40|$|To {{interpret}} structural {{variation in}} the skeleton in biomechanical terms, accurate measurements of important structural characteristics, including cross-sectional geometry, must be available. In addition, because of normal inter-individual {{variation in the}}se properties, large numbers of individuals are necessary if clear sex and age differences are to be determined. In the present study, structural data, including cross-sectional geometric properties and bone mineral content, were gathered for a large sample of femora and tibiae from the Pecos Pueblo, New Mexico archaeological site. ^ 120 skeletons, equally divided {{between males and females}} and six adult age groups, were obtained from the Pecos collection (Harvard Peabody Museum). Femora and <b>tibiae</b> were <b>sectioned</b> at five diaphyseal sites and one site through the femoral neck. Using interactive computer software (SLICE) and an electronic digitizer, cross section photographic slides were manually traced and used to determine all important section properties [...] bone areas, principal moments and their orientations, polar moment, section modulus. Bone mineral content (BMC) was determined using (2 ̆ 7125) I photon absorptiometry. In addition, directly measured bone density was derived from femoral midshaft cores for a subset of the sample. ^ Major results of the study may be summarized as follows: (1) As in modern populations, with aging endosteal resorption and cortical thinning occur, more so in females. However, subperiosteal expansion with aging limits age-related losses in cortical area, and produces age-related increases in second moments of area, averaging 10...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a broader}} study of the uses of Raman {{spectroscopy}} to characterize the effects of metabolic diseases and genetic abnormalities on bone tissue, we have examined the tissue composition of transgenic mice with a defective parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). PTHrP {{plays an important role in}} normal development, especially in the regulation of bone formation and metabolism. A transgenic mouse model with a defective PTHrP gene sequence was used to assess the biological functions of this particular protein. These mice often do not survive longer than a few days and display abnormal skeletal features, including uncharacteristic bone and tooth morphology. To date, the role of PTHrP in bone or tooth composition has not been examined. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of PTHrP on bone mineral and matrix properties with Raman spectroscopy by comparing transgenic mice with a deficient PTHrP gene sequence to wild type mice with a normal PTHrP sequence. Three groups of mice were examined: wild type (+/+, n= 4), heterozygous (+/Δ, n= 6), and homozygous (Δ/Δ, n= 3). For each mouse, one <b>tibia</b> was <b>sectioned</b> at the mid-diaphysis to create two regions for Raman analysis. Raman spectra were acquired with an 830 -nm system at both the proximal and distal ends of each tibial section to assess both cortical and cancellous bone tissue, which may be affected differently by the PTHrP mutation. Standard measures of bone composition, including mineral-to-matrix ratio, carbonate-to-phosphate ratio, and crystallinity, were computed and compared across the three groups. The PTHrPΔ/Δ mice exhibited the most pronounced skeletal abnormalities, and bone composition was most compromised in this group. Bone composition in the PTHrPΔ/+ mice was more similar to that of the PTHrP+/+ mice but still exhibited defects in some metrics. This study is the first reported spectroscopic examination of bone composition in a mouse model of a genetic defect other than osteogenesis imperfecta. The results demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy may be generally useful for characterizing bone tissue composition abnormalities caused by genetic defects...|$|R
40|$|Disruption of {{articular}} cartilage homeostasis {{is important in}} osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis, key to which is activation of articular chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation. Healthy {{articular cartilage}} is resistant to hypertrophic differentiation, whereas growth-plate cartilage is destined to differentiate in this way: could genetics explain these differences and possibly lead {{to a better understanding}} of the pathophysiology of OA? Research by Marcel Karperien and colleagues now identifies the bone morphogenetic protein antagonist Gremlin 1 (GREM 1), as well as Frizzled–related protein (FRZB) and Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK 1) —two Wnt antagonists—as natural brakes on hypertrophic differentiation in healthy cartilage. Whole-genome expression microarray analysis of donor-paired healthy human articular and growth-plate cartilage revealed that expression levels of 35 genes differed more than 5 -fold between the tissues. Most differentially expressed were GREM 1, FRZB and DKK 1 —all overexpressed in articular cartilage compared with growth-plate cartilage—as confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Image courtesy of M. Karperien. Mouse <b>tibiae</b> (midsagittal <b>sections)</b> cultured for 7 days with recombinant Grem 1, Frzb and Dkk 1 have an increased resting zone. Next, the investigators showed that recombinant GREM 1, FRZB or DKK 1 could inhibit terminal hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation and mineralization of chondrogenically-differentiating human mesenchymal stem cells, without affecting chondrogenesis. Also, Grem 1, Frzb and Dkk 1 inhibited endochondral ossification in mouse explanted tibiae. So, if GREM 1, FRZB and DKK 1 control hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation in healthy articular cartilage are the genes encoding these proteins associated with OA risk? Associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near GREM 1 and DKK 1 and radiographic hip or knee OA were investigated in two population-based cohorts. SNP-rs 12593365, located in a genomic control region of GREM 1, was associated with a 20 % reduced risk of radiographic hip OA. “We succeeded in identifying specific markers to distinguish growth plate cartilage from articular cartilage and identified a mechanism likely to be involved in the regulation of articular cartilage homeostasis”, explains Karperien. “This new area of research may lead to new diagnostic markers for OA and hopefully new routes for therapeutic intervention. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether cross-sectional areal properties, calculated from densitometry, correlate to the true flexural properties. Right and left male embalmed tibiae were used in the study. Prior to scanning, the proximal end of each tibia was potted in a fixture with registration pins, flushed thoroughly with water under pressure to remove trapped air, and then placed in a constant thickness water bath attached to a precision indexer. Two sets of three scans of the entire tibia were taken with an Hologic QDR 1000 /W densitometer at rotations of 0, 45, and 90 degrees about the tibia long axis. An aluminum step phantom and a bone step phantom, machined from bovine cortical bone, were also in the bath and scanned separately. Pixel attenuation data from the two sets of scans were averaged to reduce noise. Pixel data from the high energy beam were then converted to equivalent thicknesses using calibration equations. Cross-sectional areal properties (centroid, principal area moments and principal angle) along the length were computed from the three registered scans using methods developed in our laboratory. Flexural rigidities. Four strain gages were bonded around the circumference of each of 5 cross-sections encompassing the entire diaphysis. A known transverse load was then applied to the distal end and the bone was rotated 360 degrees in eight increments of 45 degrees each. Strains from the eight orientations were analyzed along with the known applied bending moments at each section to compute section centroids, curvatures, principal flexural rigidities and principal angle. Reference axes between the two methods were maintained within +/- 0. 5 degrees using an electronic inclinometer. Principal angles (flexural - areal) differed by - 2. 0 +/- 4. 0 degrees, and 1. 0 +/- 2. 5 degrees for the right and left <b>tibia,</b> respectively. <b>Section</b> principal flexural rigidities were highly correlated to principal areal moments (right: r(sup 2) = 0. 997; left: r(sup 2) = 0. 978) indicating a nearly constant effective flexural modulus. Right and left tibia exhibited a very high degree of symmetry when comparing either flexural or areal properties. To our knowledge this is the first study to validate the use of densitometry (DXA) to predict three dimensional structural properties of long bones. Our initial results support the conclusion that bone mineral and its distribution are the primary determinants of flexural modulus and rigidity...|$|R
40|$|Murine {{models of}} {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) are increasingly important for understating pathogenesis and for testing new therapeutic approaches. Their translational potential is, however, {{limited by the}} reduced size of mouse limbs which requires a much higher resolution to evaluate their articular cartilage compared to clinical imaging tools. In experimental models, this tissue has been predominantly assessed by time-consuming histopathology using standardized semi-quantitative scoring systems. This study aimed to develop a novel imaging method for 3 -dimensional (3 D) histology of mouse articular cartilage, using a robotic system-termed here andquot; 3 D histocutterandquot;-which automatically sections tissue samples and serially acquires fluorescence microscopy images of each <b>section.</b> <b>Tibiae</b> dissected from C 57 Bl/ 6 mice, either naïve or OA-induced by surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM), were imaged using the 3 D histocutter by exploiting tissue autofluorescence. Accuracy of 3 D imaging was validated by ex vivo contrast-enhanced micro-CT and sensitivity to lesion detection compared with conventional histology. Reconstructions of tibiae obtained from 3 D histocutter serial sections showed an excellent agreement with contrast-enhanced micro-CT reconstructions. Furthermore, osteoarthritic features, including articular cartilage loss and osteophytes, were also visualized. An in-house developed software allowed to automatically evaluate articular cartilage morphology, eliminating the subjectivity associated to semi-quantitative scoring and considerably increasing analysis throughput. The novelty of this methodology is, not only the increased throughput in imaging and evaluating mouse articular cartilage morphology starting from conventionally embedded samples, but also the ability to add the third dimension to conventional histomorphometry which might be useful to improve disease assessment in the model. </p...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUÇÃO E OBJETIVO: O efeito da tibolona utilizada em alta dose e por tempo prolongado foi analisado mediante estudo histomorfométrico de tíbias e fêmures de ratas castradas. MÉTODOS: O experimento utilizou 20 ratas Wistar, com peso médio de 250 g. Os animais foram distribuídos aleatoriamente em três grupos: ooforectomizado recebendo tibolona (OVX + T) (n = 9), ooforectomizado (OVX) (n = 6) e grupo controle não ooforectomizado (C) (n = 5). Deu-se início ao protocolo {{experimental}} 30 dias após a ooforectomia, perdurando por 20 semanas, com administração de tibolona (1 mg/dia) a OVX + T e carboximetilcelulose a OVX. O grupo C não foi submetido a qualquer tratamento. Tíbias e fêmures direitos foram fixados em formol a 10 % tamponado, descalcificados e processados para inclusão em parafina. Os cortes histológicos foram corados mediante hematoxilina-eosina para análise histomorfométrica. Mediram-se a espessura cortical e a cavidade medular em cortes transversais de tíbia e fêmur e percentual de porosidade e densidade trabecular em cortes longitudinais de fêmur. RESULTADO E DISCUSSÃO: Não houve diferença estatística entre OVX e OVX + T nas diversas análises. Os resultados demonstram que a tibolona não melhorou de forma significativa a qualidade óssea, porém preservou a massa óssea cortical, nas diáfises femoral e tibial, e o osso trabecular, nos côndilos femorais. O uso prolongado de tibolona em concomitância com alta dose pode ter influenciado tais efeitos, já que estudos recentes têm preconizado a utilização de doses mais baixas na prevenção da osteoporose. CONCLUSÃO: A ooforectomia ocasionou perda óssea nas regiões analisadas; a tibolona, apesar de não ter aumentado a massa óssea, manteve-a em níveis satisfatórios. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The {{effect of}} tibolone administered in high dose over {{a prolonged period}} was analyzed through histomorphometry of tibia and femur samples from castrated rats. METHODS: The experiment was performed in 20 Wistar rats with average weight of 250 g. The animals were randomly divided into three groups: oophorectomized receiving tibolone (OVX + T) (n = 9), oophorectomized (OVX) (n = 6) and non-oophorectomized as control group (C) (n = 5). The experimental protocol was initiated 30 days after oophorectomy and lasted 20 weeks. Tibolone (1 mg/day) was administered to OVX + T rats and carboxymethyl cellulose to OVX. C rats did not go through any treatment. Right side tibias and femurs were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin, decalcified and embedded in paraffin. Histological sections were stained by hematoxylin-eosin for histomorphometric analysis. The cortical thickness and medullary cavity were measured in transverse <b>tibia</b> and femur <b>sections.</b> The percentage of porosity and the trabecular density were determined in longitudinal femur sections. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There was no significant statistical difference between OVX and OVX + T in several analyses. The results showed that tibolone did not improve bone quality significantly, although it preserved cortical bone mass in femoral and tibial diaphyses and the trabecular bone in femoral condyles. The administration of tibolone in high dose for a prolonged period may have influenced these effects inasmuch as recent studies have recommended the use of lower doses in osteoporosis prevention. CONCLUSION: Oophorectomy caused bone loss in the analyzed regions. Despite the fact tibolone did not augment bone mass, this was kept at satisfactory levels...|$|R
40|$|Thesis Abstract Background: While Paul Segond in 1879 already briefly {{mentioned}} {{the existence of}} a pearly, fibrous band at the anterolateral aspect of the human knee, current anatomic textbooks do not contain the notion of a ligamentous structure connecting the femur with the anterolateral tibia. The persistence of rotational instability reflected in the pivot-shift test still remains a major issue after contemporary reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Therefore, the goal of this doctoral thesis was to confirm the existence and to characterize the anatomy of Segonds pearly, fibrous band (further termed anterolateral ligament (ALL)), investigate its biomechanical function with regard to tibial rotation and to demonstrate the relevance of these findings for current clinical practice. Methods:(1) The effect of ACL reconstruction on tibial rotation was studied in a 3 -D in vivo kinematic analysis in patients performing various motor tasks including pivoting. (2) The ALL was investigated in 41 human cadaveric knees; the dimensions of the ALL and relation with anatomical landmarks were measured and recorded. (3) Navigated knee kinematics were obtained from 10 fresh-frozen cadavers in the native knee, after sequential cutting of the two bundles of the ACL and the ALL in different orders. (4) Segond fracture characteristics were studied on MRI images of 26 subjects and compared with the anatomical findings on the tibial ALL insertion. (5) The presence and injury pattern of the ALL was studied on MRI images of 271 ACL-injured subjects. Results: (1) Both single- and double-bundle ACL reconstruction did not affect tibial rotation witnessed in the ACL-deficient knee. (2) The ALL was found in 97 % of the dissected knees as a distinct ligamentous structure at the anterolateral aspect of the human knee, invariably originating on the lateral femoral epicondyle and inserting on the anterolateral <b>tibia.</b> (3) Selective <b>sectioning</b> of the ALL caused a significant increase in internal tibial rotation, and this in both the ACL-deficient {{as well as in the}} intact knee, while the ACL showed negligible restraint to tibial rotation. Sectioning of the ALL proved to be vital for the occurrence of an IKDC grade III pivot-shift in the ACL-deficient knee. (4) The Segond fracture was delineated as a bony avulsion of the ALL. (5) The ALL demonstrated a high incidence (78 %) of MRI abnormalities in ACL-injured patients. Discussion:Previously undescribed, the ALL was identified as a distinct anatomical structure of the human knee, exerting a restraining effect on internal tibial rotation and the pivot-shift. Contrary to general belief, the restraining effect of both the native and reconstructed human ACL on tibial rotation was demonstrated to be negligible. Although the concept of anterolateral rotatory knee instability developed by Jack Hughston in the 1970 s, already implied a combination of injuries to both the ACL and the anterolateral stabilizing structures, this interesting notion has become obsolete under the boom of arthroscopic knee surgery. However, the high incidence of ALL lesions witnessed on MR images of ACL-injured subjects and its causative relationship with the occurrence of a high-grade pivot-shift, yield new insights for the diagnosis and treatment of common knee instability patterns, previously attributed to isolated injuries of the ACL or one of its bundles. status: publishe...|$|R
