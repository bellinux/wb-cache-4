5|$|Calgary {{had been}} served for 30 {{years by the}} Stampede Corral when the Calgary Flames arrived in 1980. With a total {{capacity}} of 8,700, <b>the</b> <b>Corral</b> was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto in 1950, but had fallen below major league standards by the 1970s. <b>The</b> <b>Corral</b> was deemed insufficient for the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1977, leading the World Hockey Association's Calgary Cowboys to fold rather than hope {{to be a team}} selected to merge with the NHL.|$|E
5|$|The Stampede Corral {{has served}} as a second home for the odd home game when the Saddledome is unavailable. They used <b>the</b> <b>Corral</b> for regular season home games in 1995–1996 and playoff games in 1998 and 2016.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the Flames {{moved into}} their new home, the Olympic Saddledome (now {{known as the}} Scotiabank Saddledome). Located {{on the grounds of}} the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede, the Saddledome was built as a venue for the 1988 Winter Olympics. In three seasons in <b>the</b> <b>Corral,</b> the Flames lost only 32 home games. The Saddledome hosted the 37th NHL All-Star Game in 1985, a 6–4 victory by the Wales Conference.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} Bose-Einstein condensates in a corral-like potential. Compared to <b>the</b> electronic quantum <b>corrals,</b> <b>the</b> atomic quantum <b>corrals</b> have <b>the</b> advantage of allowing direct and convenient observation of the wave dynamics. Our numerical study shows that this advantage not only allows people to explore the rich dynamical structures in the density distribution but also makes <b>the</b> <b>corrals</b> useful in many other aspects. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>corrals</b> for atoms can be arranged into a stadium shape for the experimental visualization of quantum chaos, which has been elusive with <b>the</b> electronic quantum <b>corrals.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

5|$|Principal {{photography}} of Terminator 2 spanned 171 days between October 9, 1990, and March 28, 1991, {{during which}} the crew filmed at the Mojave Desert before visiting 20 different sites throughout California and New Mexico. These locations ran the gamut from the crowded Santa Monica Place shopping mall, where the two Terminators converged on John, with brief shots coming from the Westfield MainPlace and Los Cerritos Center, to flood control channels in the San Fernando Valley, which played host to the chase between the Terminators and John; a river had to be redirected to allow filming on the otherwise wet channels. Cameron and his crew also filmed Terminator 2 at <b>The</b> <b>Corral</b> Bar and the Lake View Medical Center (known as Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in the film), both located in Lake View Terrace. The external shots of Cyberdyne Systems Corporation were filmed on location at an office building {{on the corner of}} Gateway Boulevard and Bayside Parkway in Fremont, California. Working with up to 1,000 crew members, the production team oversaw numerous stunts and chase sequences, the most notable of which took place on the Los Angeles–Long Beach Terminal Island Freeway, prior to Terminator 2s climax. Tenmiles (16km) of electric cables were laid to illuminate the night-time chase, which saw a full-scale helicopter crash, a sliding tanker, and other elaborate paraphernalia.|$|E
25|$|The plan {{broke down}} when {{a number of}} fighters {{attacked}} an outlying camp of four woodcutters and four soldiers, killing three of the soldiers. The other soldier and the woodcutters escaped and warned the soldiers near <b>the</b> <b>corral.</b> The pursuing force halted at the woodcutter's camp to loot and seize {{the large number of}} horses and mules there, which gave the soldiers taking refuge in <b>the</b> <b>corral</b> time to prepare for the attack. There were 26 soldiers and six civilians in <b>the</b> <b>corral.</b>|$|E
25|$|Owasippe's equestrian {{programs}} are housed at the Horse Ranch, {{also known as}} the Diamond-O Ranch. There are many routes and trails near <b>the</b> <b>corral</b> which are used for trail rides and for teaching the Horsemanship merit badge. Also available is the Wrangler Outpost, which gives Scouts a cowboy-like experience learning lessons of how to care for a horse, eating a steak dinner, and sleeping under the stars.|$|E

50|$|On September 5, 2002, armed {{federal agents}} from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) raided the WAMM garden {{weeks prior to}} their annual harvest, arresting <b>the</b> <b>Corrals</b> and {{destroying}} all the collective's medicine (150 plants). Valerie and Mike were detained and later released. The government never filed charges, though <b>the</b> <b>Corrals</b> decided to challenge the federal ban with assistance from Santa Clara University law professor Gerald Uelmen and advocates at the Drug Policy Alliance.|$|R
25|$|Having {{already written}} nonfiction about {{military}} topics, including the 1922 book The Modern Cavalry, and fiction, including the Western hardcover novel Death at <b>the</b> <b>Corral,</b> also 1922, Wheeler-Nicholson now began writing short stories for the pulps. The major {{soon became a}} cover name, penning military and historical adventure fiction for such magazines as Adventure and Argosy. He additionally ghost wrote six adventure novels about air hero Bill Barnes for Street & Smith Publications.|$|E
25|$|The {{garrison}} at Fort Kearny {{learned of}} the fight from its observation station on Pilot Hill. About 11:30 a.m., Major Benjamin Smith led 103 soldiers out of the fort to the wood camp to relieve the soldiers in the wagon boxes. Smith took with him 10 wagons, driven by armed civilians, and a mountain howitzer. He proceeded carefully and, when he neared the wagon box corral, began firing his cannon at long range. The attackers were forced to withdraw. Smith advanced without opposition to <b>the</b> <b>corral,</b> collected the soldiers, and returned quickly to Fort Kearny. Additional civilian survivors, who had hidden in the woods during the battle, {{made it back to}} the fort that night.|$|E
25|$|Four of {{the five}} {{original}} buildings house historic exhibits. The storehouse details {{the history of the}} Colorado River and the steamboat era on it, and of the mule wagon trains. The office of the depot quartermaster houses two exhibits. One is an historic recreation of the depot as it appeared in its heyday. Another shows out the weather and telegraph stations appeared. The commanding officers quarters is a house museum which mimics how it would have looked in the 1870s, when army officers and their families lived in the space. A biologic exhibit of fish species in the Colorado River is found in <b>the</b> <b>corral</b> house. Outdoor exhibits at the park include ramadas, a steam boiler, a stone built reservoir and an encampment of wagons.|$|E

25|$|The next oldest {{buildings}} are the barn, the bunkhouse, the smaller {{of the wooden}} sheds, and the storage building (commissary), {{all of which were}} constructed circa 1910. The barn is the largest building in the district, measuring 60 feet long by 35 feet wide. Two stories tall, the walls are covered with board-and-batt siding, and has a corrugated metal roof of medium pitch. It has two single-story additions. The northern addition is 60 feet long with a shed roof, while the eastern addition runs the length of the original structure, widening the footprint of the barn by 15 feet. It has a lean-to structure. The entire barn complex is enclosed by a corral, which has a split rail fence approximately 5 feet high. Also within <b>the</b> <b>corral</b> is a 15 by 15 foot granary. Built circa 1940, it is constructed with the same materials as the barn, and has a shed roof.|$|E
500|$|Attendance {{records were}} broken nearly {{every year in}} the 1950s and overall {{attendance}} increased by 200,000 from 1949 to 1959. [...] The growth necessitated expansion of the exhibition grounds. [...] The 7,500-seat Stampede Corral was completed in 1950 as the largest indoor arena in Western Canada. It housed the Calgary Stampeders hockey team, which was operated by the Board of Governors and won the Western Hockey League championship in 1954. [...] Acts such as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra and Louis Armstrong played <b>the</b> <b>Corral,</b> although the arena's poor acoustics were a frequent concern to organizers and patrons.|$|E
500|$|Attendance {{continued}} to grow throughout the 1960s and 1970s, topping 500,000 {{for the first time}} in 1962 and reaching 654,000 in 1966. Organizers expanded the event from six days to nine in 1967 and then to ten the following year. The Stampede exceeded one million visitors {{for the first time in}} 1976. [...] The park, meanwhile, {{continued to}} grow. [...] The Round-Up Centre opened in 1979 as the new exhibition hall, and the Olympic Saddledome was completed in 1983. [...] The Saddledome replaced <b>the</b> <b>Corral</b> as the city's top sporting arena, and both facilities hosted hockey and figure skating events at the 1988 Winter Olympics.|$|E

60|$|The {{horsemen}} halted at <b>the</b> <b>corrals.</b> They were {{orderly and}} showed {{no evidence of}} hostility. They were, however, fully armed. Belding stalked out to meet them. Apparently a leader wanted to parley with him, but Belding would hear nothing. He shook his head, waved his arms, stamped to and fro, and his loud, angry voice could be heard clear back at the house. Whereupon the detachment of rebels retired to {{the bank of the}} river, beyond the white post that marked the boundary line, and there they once more drew rein. Belding remained by <b>the</b> <b>corrals</b> watching them, evidently still in threatening mood. Presently a single rider left the troop and trotted his horse back down the road. When he reached <b>the</b> <b>corrals</b> he was seen to halt and pass something to Belding. Then he galloped away to join his comrades.|$|R
500|$|McMahon Stadium, Calgary's primary outdoor facility, was {{the site}} of both the opening and closing ceremonies, the first time in 28years that the same venue hosted both events. [...] Three other {{existing}} venues served as secondary facilities: The Max Bell Centre hosted the demonstration events of curling and short track speed skating. The Father David Bauer Olympic Arena hosted some ice hockey matches, as did the Stampede Corral, which also played host to some figure skating events. Though <b>the</b> <b>Corral</b> did not support the size of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF)'s standard ice surface, the Calgary Organizing Committee (Olympiques Calgary Olympics '88 or OCO'88) was able to convince the IIHF to sanction the arena in exchange for a $1.2 million payment.|$|E
500|$|The Victoria Park Community Association {{fought the}} bid {{to build the}} arena in their neighborhood, {{threatening}} to oppose the city's Olympic bid if necessary. [...] City Council voted on March 3, 1981 to build the proposed 20,000 seat arena on the Stampede grounds, immediately east of <b>the</b> <b>Corral</b> and south of Victoria Park. The community continued to fight the city over rezoning the land {{to allow for the}} new arena amidst fears of traffic congestion in their neighbourhood which resulted in numerous costly delays to the start of construction. In a bid to end the battle, Mayor Ralph Klein asked the provincial government in July 1981 to take over the land designated for the arena to bypass the appeals process and force approval. The province supported the city amidst protests by community associations and invoked rarely used powers to overrule planning regulations, allowing construction to begin. The following day, on July 29, 1981, builders began construction of the arena. The International Olympic Committee was impressed that the project was underway, as noted in the XV Olympic Winter Games official report which stated [...] "The fact that this facility was already being built added credibility to (Calgary's) bid and proved to be a positive factor in demonstrating Calgary's commitment to hosting the Games".|$|E
500|$|The Gunfight at the OK Corral is {{a famous}} {{example of a}} real-life western shootout, between the Earp Brothers {{together}} with Doc Holliday, and the Clanton-McLaury gang. It lasted only 30 seconds, contrary to many movie adaptations. The gunfight itself did not actually happen in <b>the</b> <b>corral,</b> but in a vacant lot outside of it. The shooting started when Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury cocked their pistols. Both parties simultaneously drew their guns, which added to the confusion of who fired first. It is not known who fired the first shot, but Wyatt's bullet {{was the first to}} hit, tearing through Frank McLaury's belly and sending McLaury’s own shot wild through Wyatt’s coattail. Billy Clanton fired at Virgil, but his shot also went astray when he was hit with Morgan's shot through his ribcage. Billy Claiborne ran as soon as shots were fired and was already out of sight. Ike Clanton panicked as well and ran towards Wyatt pleading for his life. [...] "Go to fighting or get away!", Wyatt yelled and watched Ike desert his brother Billy and run. Doc instantly killed Tom with blasts from his shotgun. Frank was running to Fremont Street, and he challenged Holliday for killing his brother, but Doc dropped his shotgun, drew his pistol, and shot Frank in the right temple. Wounded and dying, Billy Clanton fired blindly into the gun smoke encircling him, striking Virgil's leg. Wyatt responded by sending several rounds into Billy.|$|E
