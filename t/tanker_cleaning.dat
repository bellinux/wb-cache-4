50|$|Converted to a <b>tanker</b> <b>cleaning</b> vessel, she {{continued}} in service for the ADM in Amsterdam harbour until 1985 as Droogdok 18, HOM7 and TCA1. She was transferred to a preservation society in 1995. The ship has been renamed Elfin, restored and preserved in Wormerveer, the Netherlands. In 2011 she {{was used in the}} Dutch film Bennie Stout.|$|E
50|$|There are {{records of}} a ferry service from Rock Ferry pier to Liverpool from 1709 onwards, until being {{discontinued}} on 30 June 1939. The ferry landing stage was removed in 1957 and the terminal building demolished. The pier {{became part of}} Tranmere Oil Terminal and modified {{for use as a}} berth for <b>tanker</b> <b>cleaning</b> and degreasing. It has since fallen into disuse and become very dilapidated. A stone slipway originally used by the ferry service also remains.|$|E
40|$|Engine oil {{is one of}} {{the several}} refined {{products}} of crude oil. It is composed of long chain saturated hydrocarbons (base oil) additives. Generally, engine oil can enter into the environment through leak of oil <b>tankers,</b> <b>cleaning</b> of tanks by merchants, warship carrying engine oil, and operations by motor mechanics which is a common industrial waste that is harmful to environment and human health. This research aims to produce lipase enzyme using microbial degradation of disposed engine oil. In this study hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium, GS- 3 was successfully isolated from oil contaminated area. GC-MS analysis revealed that this isolate was able to produce organic acid, methyl- 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxy- 2, 6 -dinitrobenzoate from disposed engine oil. Besides, GS- 3 isolate produced highest lipase activity, achieving 0. 097 ± 0. 007 Uml- 1 min- 1 during first 24 hrs when disposed engine oil (DEO) was used as carbon source. Data revealed new and broad band which is related to O-H stretching formed at 3421 cm- 1, though new band occurred at 3424 cm- 1 and 1645 cm- 1 after bioremediation. Subsequent lipase optimization parameters revealed that this bacterial isolate could produce highest lipase activity when the 4...|$|R
40|$|Pollution {{in marine}} and coastal waters is {{dispersed}} {{on its surface}} due to the wind and currents dynamics prevailing in the area. When that occurs, {{it is important to}} establish the extent and scope of the pollution in order to prevent damaging coastal and marine ecosystems. With rapid economic growing around the world there are potential sources of contamination in high seas, marine and submarine transport. Those activities include shipping, storage, washing and <b>cleaning</b> <b>tankers,</b> discharges of coastal cities, and accidents during operations (e. g. marine pipeline ruptures or leaks, spills and ship accidents...|$|R
40|$|Bio{{surfactants}} {{refers to}} surfactants from microbial origin {{and can be}} synthesized by several identified microorganisms including bacteria, yeast and fungi. They display excellent surface activity and emulsification properties with very low toxicity and higher biodegradability features as compared to chemical counterparts. They have also {{been found to be}} very effective at low concentrations and over a wide range of environmental conditions such as pH, temperature and salinity; better environmental compatibility, lower critical micelle concentration, higher selectivity, specific activity and the ability to be synthesized from renewable low cost resources. Generally chemical surfactants are preferred at industrial scale as compared to biosurfactants, mainly because of the cost difference. Nonetheless recently the trend has shifted worldwide towards producing biological counterparts at the industrial scale, because of the availability of cheaper biological alternatives, and awareness about their environmentally friendly and biodegradable nature. The global biosurfactant market is gathering pace and in the overall global market the European region is leading globally in terms of production and consumption. As recently reported by international firms in their recent reports, the global biosurfactant market is expected to grow quite rapidly with market revenues of around 25 billion by year 2018 - 2020. This lucrative biosurfactant market has already lured several world-leading chemical surfactant producing companies to venture into biosurfactant market. This Research Topic welcomes reviews and original research on the following but is not limited to: - OMICS applications: Applications of molecular biology tools for isolation and identification of biosurfactant producing microorganisms, and/or biosurfactant genes from different samples, sites itself, etc. - Recent advances in our knowledge of different types of biosurfactants, novel structural details – chemical modifications, and our understanding of the genetic, biochemical and molecular mechanisms for their production - Economically viable and competitive production using different strategies: like application of statistical optimization techniques for optimization of media, culture conditions; use of cheaper agro-industrial raw materials, etc. - Biosurfactant production: in-situ/ex-situ production, advances in laboratory scale production and industrial scale-up, highlighting refinements in both up-scale and downstream processing, etc. - Industrial and Environmental applications and case studies: such as enhanced light/heavy oil recovery (including in-situ production and field-scale applications), oil <b>tankers</b> <b>cleaning,</b> crude oil transport through the pipelines, heavy metal bioremediation, oil spill remediation, agricultural applications, antimicrobial role (antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral actions), medicinal and health applications (such as anticancer compounds), role in nanotechnology advances, etc...|$|R
