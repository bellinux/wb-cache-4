5|$|Arrington helped {{establish}} <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> History Association in 1965 {{and served as}} its first president from 1966 to 1967. After Arrington's article caused the suspension of BYU studies, BYU Studies was wary of publishing any controversial material. Arrington formed <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> History Association in part to make a place where controversial material could be discussed. The association welcomed anyone {{with an interest in}} Mormon history. Wesley Johnson attended the inaugural meeting, and proposed that the association could publish Mormon studies articles in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, a publication he helped form. Johnson's proposal was accepted and members of <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> History Association submitted papers to Dialogue.|$|E

40|$|For {{my thesis}} I {{decided to do}} a {{literature}} review about <b>the</b> 1838 <b>Mormon</b> War in Missouri. <b>The</b> <b>Mormons</b> started settling in Missouri in 1831 because Joseph Smith told his followers that Jackson County was set aside as {{the place where they}} would establish Zion. Almost right away there were conflicts between the Missourians and <b>the</b> <b>Mormons.</b> <b>The</b> Missourians were suspicious of <b>the</b> <b>Mormons</b> and their beliefs because <b>the</b> <b>Mormons</b> had told Missourians that God was going to take the land away from the Missourians and give the land to <b>the</b> <b>Mormons.</b> As a result of these suspicions, <b>the</b> <b>Mormons</b> were driven out of Jackson County in 1833 by Missouri residents and, later, from other counties in Missouri as well. They petitioned the Missouri government for help to get their property back but received very little help. In 1836, Caldwell County was set up by the Missouri legislature for <b>the</b> <b>Mormons</b> to settle. In the early part of 1838, Mormons started to settle outside of Caldwell which, once again, upset some Missourians so conflict broke out. As the year went on, {{there were a number of}} armed conflicts between Mormons and Missourians. Both sides had vigilante groups who plundered and destroyed property. At times, the state militia was involved as well, but they were not able to do much to end the conflict. In October 1838, Governor Boggs issued an extermination order against <b>the</b> <b>Mormons.</b> According to <b>the</b> order, <b>Mormons</b> were to be driven from Missouri or be killed. In November 1838, <b>the</b> <b>Mormons</b> surrendered and were forced to leave <b>the</b> state. <b>The</b> <b>Mormons</b> fled to Illinois in 1839...|$|R

5|$|Across Iowa they {{followed}} an existing road about 275 miles (443km) to Council Bluffs, following a route that {{is close to}} current U.S. Route 6. After crossing the Missouri River, they paused {{for a few days}} at a Mormon outpost in Florence, Nebraska (now part of Omaha), for repairs, before beginning the remaining 1,030-mile (1,658km) journey along <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> Trail to Salt Lake City.|$|E
5|$|After a brief stay among <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> {{community}} of southern Utah, Harrison {{enlisted in the}} Canadian Army Medical Corps in 1917 and was stationed at a French hospital, where he tended {{to the needs of}} the Chinese Labour Corps.

25|$|The Danites' role {{shifted from}} {{internal}} enforcement to external defense when the non-Mormon Missourian majority asked <b>the</b> <b>Mormons</b> to leave, at first making a request without threat of force. In coming months, hostilities between Mormons and Missourians would grow to the point, that the Missouri State Militia drove most of <b>the</b> <b>Mormons</b> out of Missouri. Governor Lilburn Boggs issued Missouri Executive Order 44 on October 27, 1838, which expelled <b>the</b> <b>Mormons</b> from Missouri.|$|R
5|$|Continuing toward Fort Bridger {{from the}} Green River, the main trail crosses Hams Fork near Granger and {{followed}} Blacks Fork to Fort Bridger. Established in 1842 by legendary frontiersman Jim Bridger {{and his partner}} Louis Vasquez, Fort Bridger was a vital refueling post and a welcome rest after the particularly difficult journey from South Pass. Even after the Sublette cutoff was established, settlers destined for Oregon who were low on livestock and supplies would bypass the cutoffs and make the longer trip to Fort Bridger to restock. Fort Bridger is {{the point at which}} <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> Trail splits from the Oregon Trail and California Trail for good. <b>The</b> <b>Mormon</b> Trail continues southwest, fording the Bear River and crossing into Utah south of the current town of Evanston. The other trails turn and proceed northwest, crossing the Bear River Divide and into the Bear River valley on the western side of the state. The trail meets the Sublette cutoff near Cokeville and the rejoined trails follow the Bear River upstream and into Idaho, heading for Fort Hall.|$|E

Christian and Julie work as waiters at Lila's, a trendy restaurant owned by retired actress Lila Montagne.|$|E
5|$|In July 1877, Young tried {{one more}} time at a {{spelling}} reform, ordering lead type designed for the orthography of Benn Pitman (Isaac's brother) {{with the intention of}} printing an edition of the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants using it. Most of the type had arrived by August, but with Young's death, the translation was never undertaken and the type never used. Young's death thus marked the end of <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> experimentation with English spelling reforms.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly afterward, Archibald Williams chaired {{a meeting}} in Quincy, Illinois, that sought to arrange for a {{peaceful}} departure of <b>the</b> <b>Mormons</b> from Illinois to the far western state of Utah. Archibald Williams appointed a delegation of Quincy citizens that traveled to Nauvoo and convinced <b>the</b> new <b>Mormon</b> leader, Brigham Young, to leave Illinois for Utah in an orderly manner. Brigham Young said <b>the</b> <b>Mormons</b> could not leave immediately, but when [...] "grass grows and water runs," [...] both signs of spring. The following spring <b>the</b> <b>Mormons</b> peacefully left Illinois for Utah, traveling mainly by wagon train.|$|R
50|$|From his Utah experience, Ferris {{wrote the}} 1854 book Utah and <b>the</b> <b>Mormons,</b> {{and his wife}} {{published}} her letters from this period in the 1856 book <b>The</b> <b>Mormons</b> at Home.

5|$|The Latter Day Saint {{settlers}} of modern-day Utah {{had established}} a provisional State of Deseret, an enormous swath of territory which had little hope of recognition by Congress. The Taylor administration considered combining the California and Utah territories, but instead opted to organize the Utah Territory. To alleviate <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> population's concerns over religious freedom, Taylor promised they would have relative independence from Congress despite being a federal territory.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mormon</b> Trail {{extends from}} Nauvoo, Illinois, {{which was the}} {{principal}} settlement of the Latter Day Saints from 1839 to 1846, to Salt Lake City, Utah, which was settled by Brigham Young and his followers beginning in 1847. From Council Bluffs, Iowa to Fort Bridger in Wyoming, the trail follows much the same route as the Oregon Trail and the California Trail; these trails are collectively known as the Emigrant Trail.|$|E
50|$|The {{graves of}} a number of Florence {{residents}} are also located in the cemetery.

2500|$|Captain Nehemiah Comstock's {{contingent}} of Livingston militia occupied the mill {{for nearly three}} weeks harassing and plundering <b>the</b> <b>Mormons.</b> Life during <b>the</b> winter of 1838-1839 became essentially that of day-to-day survival. [...] Most of the families banded together until they could make arrangements to move {{along with the rest}} of the Saints to Illinois. Non-Mormon Harrison Severe, who had refused to join the mob, left with <b>the</b> <b>Mormons.</b> [...] By <b>the</b> end of February 1839, all of <b>the</b> <b>Mormons</b> had left. Jacob Hawn moved to Oregon and became a pioneer settler of Yamhill County.|$|R
5|$|The {{handcart}} companies {{continued with}} more success until 1860, and traditional ox-and-wagon companies also continued {{for those who}} could afford the higher cost. After 1860, the church began sending wagon companies east each spring, to return to Utah in the summer with the emigrating Latter-day Saints. Finally, with {{the completion of the}} Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, future emigrants were able to travel by rail, and the era of <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> pioneer trail came to an end.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey from}} Winter Quarters to Fort Laramie took six weeks; the company {{arrived at the}} fort on June 1.

5|$|Young met {{mountain}} man Jim Bridger on June 28. They discussed routes into the Salt Lake Valley and {{the feasibility of}} viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin.

John Fremont's overly glowing reports of the area were published shortly after his expedition. Stansbury also published a formal report of his survey work which became very popular. His report of the area included a discussion of Mormon religious practices based on Stansbury's interaction with <b>the</b> <b>Mormon</b> community in Great Salt Lake City, which had been established three years earlier in 1847.|$|E
