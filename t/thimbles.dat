5|$|Tony Iommi {{has been}} {{credited}} as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The {{tips of his}} fingers were severed in a steel factory, and while using <b>thimbles</b> (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He found that there was only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with their}} third album, Master of Reality, Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi {{suffered}} an accident {{while working in}} a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two <b>thimbles</b> made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the newest}} of the three sites; current {{scholarship}} indicates that {{it was built in}} the 1830s and was operational until emancipation. Scholars believe that the site was home to a slave cabin likely occupied between 1840-1860. Archaeologists have uncovered a 3ft. pit that would have been located underneath the floor of the cabin, postholes, and remnants of a shone chimney. The excavation at Site A has yielded buttons, straight pins, needles, <b>thimbles,</b> and the bone cap of a needle case; this suggests that this site may have been the home of a seamstress.|$|E

25|$|Excavations at {{this site}} also yielded a number of objects related to slave life at Poplar Forest. Archaeologists {{discovered}} iron saw files, gimlets, wedges, croze irons, and a hinge from a folding ruler; {{it is likely that}} these objects are from tools used by slaves either in their work assignments or in their personal space. Scissors, straight pins, and <b>thimbles</b> found at the site suggest that women sewed for both work and for their families. The excavations uncovered stoneware and earthenware that scholars believe to have been used to prepare food; enslaved men and women at Poplar Forest ate fruits and vegetables as well as beef, pork, venison, opossum, rabbit, chicken, turkey, and fish, and possibly had access to firearms with which to hunt animals.|$|E

2500|$|In any case, {{he decided}} to {{continue}} playing left-handed. To do so, he fitted homemade <b>thimbles</b> to his injured fingers to extend and protect them; the <b>thimbles</b> were made from an old Fairy Liquid bottle – [...] "melted it down, got a hot soldering iron and shaped it like a finger" [...] – and cut sections from a leather jacket to cover his new homemade prosthetic, which created two technical problems. First, the <b>thimbles</b> prevented him from feeling the strings, causing a tendency to press down very hard on them. [...] Secondly, he had difficulty bending strings, leading him to seek light-gauge guitar strings {{to make it easier}} to do so. However, Iommi recalls that such strings were not manufactured at the time, so he used banjo strings instead, until around 1970–71 when Picato Strings began making light-gauge guitar strings. Furthermore, he used the injured fingers predominantly for fretting chords rather than single-note solos. In 1974, Iommi told Guitar Player magazine that the <b>thimbles</b> [...] "helped with his technique" [...] because he had to use his little finger more than he had before the accident. Later, he also began tuning his guitar to lower pitches, sometimes as far as three semitones below standard guitar tuning (e.g., on [...] "Children of the Grave", [...] "Lord of this World", and [...] "Into the Void", all on the album Master of Reality). Although Iommi states that the main purpose of doing so was to create a [...] "bigger, heavier sound", slackening the strings makes it easier to bend them.|$|E
2500|$|Many composers sought new timbres {{within the}} {{framework}} of traditional instruments. [...] "Composers begin to hear new timbres and new timbral combinations, which are as important to the new music of the twentieth century as the so-called breakdown of functional tonality," [...] writes music historian James McCalla. Examples are numerous: Bartók's Sonata for two pianos and percussion (1937), Schoenberg's Pierrot lunaire, Charles Ives's Quartertone Pieces for two pianos tuned a quartertone apart. Other composers used electronics and extended techniques to create new sonorities. An example is George Crumb's Black Angels, for electric string quartet (1970). The players not only bow their amplified instruments, they also beat on them with <b>thimbles,</b> pluck them with paper clips and play {{on the wrong side of}} the bridge or between the fingers and the nut.|$|E

2500|$|Performers such as [...] "Dr. Resisto", [...] "The Human Dynamo", [...] "Electrice", [...] "The Great Volta", and [...] "Madamoiselle Electra" [...] {{would have}} their body {{connected}} to the high voltage terminal of a hidden Tesla coil, causing sparks to shoot from their fingertips {{and other parts of}} their body, and neon lights and fluorescent tube lamps to light up when brought near them. They could also light candles or cigarettes with their fingers. Although they didn't usually cause electric shocks, RF arc discharges from the bare skin could cause painful burns; to prevent them performers sometimes wore metal <b>thimbles</b> on their fingertips (Rev. Moon, center image above, is using them). These acts were extremely dangerous and could kill the performer if the Tesla coil was misadjusted. In carny lingo this was called an [...] "electric chair act" [...] because it often included a spark-laced [...] "electrocution" [...] of the performer in an electric chair, exploiting public fascination with this exotic new method of capital punishment, which had become the United States' dominant method of execution around 1900. Today entertainers still perform high voltage acts with Tesla coils, but modern bioelectromagnetics has brought a new awareness of the hazards of Tesla coil currents, and allowing them to pass through the body is today considered extremely dangerous.|$|E
2500|$|A one-year archaeological {{survey was}} {{performed}} at the school in 2003. The survey found evidence of human activity in the campus' wooded property dating at least 3,600 years, with elements dating from around 1700 BCE and up until the mid-20th century. The survey was a requirement of New York's State Historic Preservation Office {{in order for the}} school to construct a new residential complex in a [...] expansion to its campus; it was funded by the CIA and conducted by Landmark Archaeology, a company based in Altamont, New York. The surveyors focused on a [...] site between the Hudson River and Route 9. The site contained two house structures, a dam, a mill, retaining walls, and outbuildings and barns, and was found to be eligible as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Excavations unearthed foundation walls, a well, cistern, and post molds, and about 40,000 artifacts. Prehistoric objects, dating to the Late Archaic period, included stone tools, byproducts of tool production, projectile points, and fire hearths found in the site's portion used for crop cultivation. A larger area held artifacts from the mid-to-late 1700s, including ceramics, tobacco pipes, coins, buttons, buckles, military objects, <b>thimbles,</b> domesticated animal remains, and an inscribed piece of slate. Due to the findings, the CIA revised its plans to prevent construction on {{a large portion of the}} site.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} calibration of a <b>thimble</b> that measures the forces applied by a user during manipulation of virtual and real objects. Haptic devices benefit from force measurement capabilities at their end-point. However, the heavy weight and cost of force sensors prevent their widespread incorporation in these applications. The design of a lightweight, user-adaptable, and cost-effective <b>thimble</b> with four contact force sensors is described in this paper. The sensors are calibrated before being placed in the <b>thimble</b> to provide normal and tangential forces. Normal forces are exerted directly by the fingertip and thus can be properly measured. Tangential forces are estimated by sensors strategically placed in the <b>thimble</b> sides. Two applications are provided {{in order to facilitate}} an evaluation of sensorized <b>thimble</b> performance. These applications focus on: (i) force signal edge detection, which determines task segmentation of virtual object manipulation, and (ii) the development of complex object manipulation models, wherein the mechanical features of a real object are obtained and these features are then reproduced for training by means of virtual object manipulation...|$|R
