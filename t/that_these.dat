5|$|A 2014 {{study of}} falcons of {{different}} species (gyrfalcon, saker falcon, and peregrine falcon) used video cameras mounted {{on their heads}} or backs to track their approaches to prey. Comparison of the observed paths with simulations of different pursuit strategies showed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> predatory birds used a motion camouflage path consistent with CATD.|$|E
5|$|A {{cladistic}} {{study of}} the skeletal and bone morphology of the classical Pelecaniformes and relatives found that the frigatebirds formed a clade with Limnofregata. Birds of the two genera have 15 cervical vertebrae, unlike almost all other Ciconiiformes, Suliformes and Pelecaniformes, which have 17. The age of Limnofregata indicates <b>that</b> <b>these</b> lineages had separated by the Eocene.|$|E
5|$|About 20 eruptions have {{occurred}} on the Mono–Inyo Craters chain at intervals of 250 to 700 years during the past 5,000 years. Seismic soundings and lava composition indicate <b>that</b> <b>these</b> eruptions most likely originated from discrete and small magma bodies. The rate of eruption over the last 1,000 years has increased, with at least 12eruptions occurring.|$|E

5|$|Although {{reference}} to major morphological {{categories such as}} root, stem, leaf, and trichome are useful, one has {{to keep in mind}} <b>that</b> <b>these</b> categories are linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories results.
