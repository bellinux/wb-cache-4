40|$|This chapter {{provides}} {{a case study}} of teaching an Honors Freshman Seminar at Georgia State University. The pedagogical goals for this course were: (1) to push the boundaries of the Association of College 2 ̆ 6 Research Libraries (ACRL) Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education; (2) to engage students in applying critical-theoretical and social-justice frameworks to the course topics via dialogic, problem-posing learning; and (3) to expand and challenge the students’ perceptions of librarianship by elucidating the role librarians play in social justice and democratizing efforts related to information access. Twelve students consented to content analyses of their assignment texts. <b>The</b> <b>content</b> <b>analyses</b> were conducted using Strauss and Corbin’s (1998) grounded theory methodology primarily, but also drew from Krippendorff’s (2010) content analysis framework. The analyses were facilitated by QSR International’s (2011) NVivo 9 qualitative research software. <b>The</b> <b>content</b> <b>analyses</b> were primarily focused on gauging: (1) students’ affirmation and/or challenging of the critical-theoretical and social-justice frameworks; and (2) whether and how students discussed librarians and libraries as social justice and/or democratizing agents...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of the 2008 Protection of the Information Bill and the 2010 proposed Media Appeals Tribunal, it is often argued that these two developments may affect the country’s press freedom problematically. The research question of this paper is: how has press freedom in South Africa developed since 1994 ? Firstly, two discourse analyses of presidential public speeches that refer to press freedom were carried out in order to gain an understanding of presidential discourse. Secondly, two content analyses of the Mail / Guardian were conducted in which the articles that refer to press freedom were analysed to examine {{the way in which they}} cover this issue. The time periods for <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>analyses</b> match those of the discourse analyses so the results of the comparisons can be compared safely. <b>The</b> <b>content</b> <b>analyses</b> show that journalistic rhetoric has changed while the political rhetoric seems to have remained the same. As an alternative to the Media Appeals Tribunal, the present writer suggests the appointment of an independent regulatory body which will be able to solve issues between the two opposing discourses in an easy and fair manner, and the media will be able to maintain its function as the ‘fourth estate’ while political figures can object to defamation...|$|E

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} a content {{analysis}} of lifestyle magazines Elle and Esquire. Through combining two basic approaches to content analysis (qualitative and quantitative) the thesis shall answer the question how the nature is depicted in Elle and Esquire magazines. The study {{is based on the}} theory of framing. Qualitative frame analysis leads to identification, description, definition and interpretation of the frames of nature that occur in surveyed content of magazines. Quantitative content analysis is instrumental towards quantification of the frames. It helps to explore what are the most frequent frames and which of them are not present at all. The analysis is preceded by a broad theoretical part. This part specifies the issues of different perception of nature, media and common concepts of nature. The frame analysis comes after. Particular depictions of nature have been organised into categories that represent nine frames of nature. At first, these frames are identificated right in <b>the</b> <b>content</b> and then interpreted. The analysis concerns not only on particular depictions of nature in the textual and visual part of <b>the</b> <b>content,</b> it takes into account wider context as well.

However, there has been little longitudinal research examining the experience of people with intellectual disabilities in the workplace. Methods   Thirty-five individuals with mild to borderline intellectual disabilities participated in this study. They were recruited from supported employment agencies in Scotland. A longitudinal approach was adopted, with the participants being interviewed around the time of starting their jobs, and again 9 – 12 months later. Results   <b>The</b> <b>content</b> <b>analyses</b> of the semi-structured interviews indicated that the participants perceived continuing benefits from entering mainstream employment, including more purposeful lives and increased social status. However, over the follow-up period the participants reported few social opportunities that extended beyond the workplace, and an anxiety about their competence to meet employers’ demands remained a concern for some.

40|$|Background: Clinical {{handover}} is {{the process}} by which information, knowledge and responsibility is transferred from one professional to another. In essence, handover is critical to the continued safe delivery of patient care. Patients are at increased risk of harm and poorer outcomes may ensue if inaccurate, ambiguous or incomplete information is provided. Each shift has a designated team leader who is ultimately responsible for the provision of care and management. Despite a wealth of evidence pertaining to handover communication and the effectiveness of standardised tools, there is limited knowledge that offers guidance to facilitate effective nurse in charge handover in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit. Objective: The study aim is to uncover <b>the</b> <b>content</b> of clinical handover that is delivered from nurse in charge of the preceding shift to the nurse in charge of the subsequent shift using the SBAR; a standardised tool adopted throughout this Trust. Design: A prospective observational study. Setting: A 20 bedded regional adult cardiothoracic intensive care unit in the North of England.
