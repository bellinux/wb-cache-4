5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New Testament as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure. <b>They</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament as divinely inspired and historically accurate, {{but they do not}} consider its laws to be binding under the New Covenant in Christ (unless they are repeated in the New Testament) (Hebrews 8: 7-13). They believe that the New Testament demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Jeunet {{included}} an alternate {{version of the}} film on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set with different opening and closing credits, which were originally cut due to budget restrictions. The deleted scenes included references to the character Newt from Aliens, Vriess making a joke to Call, Ripley's clone {{waking up in the}} middle of her operation, an extended conversation in the mess hall that reveals the details of Ripley's former employers, Weyland-Yutani, an extended dialogue between Call and Ripley's clone in the chapel and scenes of the Betty landing on Earth and the planet's landscape during the final dialogue between Ripley and Call, as <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> ruins of Paris. The special edition restores 13 minutes and 5 seconds worth of footage (including the new opening and ending), and is 7 minutes longer than theatrical version. Jeunet has stated that the special edition is not a director's cut as his preferred version is the theatrical cut.|$|E

25|$|The Omega Nebula is {{a fairly}} bright nebula; it has an {{integrated}} magnitude of 6.0 and is 4890 light-years from Earth. It was discovered in 1746 by Philippe Loys de Chésaux; observers since him have differed greatly in how <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> nebula, hence its myriad of names.

25|$|In some cultures, {{societies}} utilize toys {{as a way}} {{to enhance}} a child's skillset within the traditional boundaries of their future roles in the community. In Saharan and North African cultures, play is facilitated by children through the use of toys to enact scenes recognizable in their community such as hunting and herding. The value is placed in a realistic version of development in preparing a child for the future they are likely to grow up into. This allows the child to imagine and create a personal interpretation of how <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> adult world.|$|E

25|$|This {{practice}} {{is not as}} widely held by Brethren as it once was. Many assemblies throughout the world have developed to leave questions of head coverings, levels of female participation and responsibility to {{the discretion of the}} individual. But there are still some Brethren assemblies that seek to be completely untouched by changing attitudes within society regarding the role of women. <b>They</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> abandonment of the traditionally practised doctrine of Headship as evidence of an overall apostasy (or moral deterioration) within Christendom and as leading to disorder and eventual anarchy within their fellowships.|$|E
25|$|Indépendentistes {{are fully}} {{nationalist}} in outlook. <b>They</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> federal {{government as a}} successor state to the British Empire, and as a de facto colonizing agent of English Canada. Consequently, they demand complete independence for Quebec, which they view {{in the context of}} national liberation movements in Africa and the Caribbean of the 1960s. Independence is seen as the culmination of a natural societal progression, from colonization to provincial autonomy to outright independence. Accordingly, they tend to favor assertive declarations of independence over negotiations, idealizing the Patriote movement of the 1830s. Their ideological origins can be found within the Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale headed by Pierre Bourgault, a founding organization of the Parti Québécois.|$|E
25|$|Anticipating {{attempts}} to re-enslave more {{members of their}} community, Black Seminoles opposed removal to the West. In councils before the war, they threw their support behind the most militant Seminole faction, led by Osceola. After war broke out, individual black leaders, such as John Caesar, Abraham, and John Horse, played key roles. In addition to aiding the Indians in their fight, Black Seminoles recruited plantation slaves to rebellion {{at the start of}} the war. The slaves joined Indians and maroons in the destruction of 21 sugar plantations from Christmas Day, December 25, 1835, through the summer of 1836. Historians do not agree on whether these events should be considered a separate slave rebellion; generally <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> attacks on the sugar plantations as part of the Seminole War.|$|E

5000|$|The {{black cat}} in {{folklore}} {{has been able}} to change into human shape to act as a spy or courier for witches or demons. When the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock, they brought with them a devout faith in the Bible. They also brought a deepening suspicion of anything deemed of Satan and were a deeply suspicious group. <b>They</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>the</b> black cat as a companion, or a familiar to witches. Anyone caught with a black cat would be severely punished or even killed. <b>They</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>the</b> black cat as part demon and part sorcery. These superstitions led people to kill black cats. There is no evidence from England of regular large-scale massacres of [...] "satanic" [...] cats, or of burning them in midsummer bonfires, as sometimes occurred elsewhere in Europe.|$|R

25|$|Given the definition, {{once the}} child is aware of their gender they will start to behave in gender roles that their {{same-sex}} models would normally adopt. Therefore, these individual responses become internalized and function according to the appropriate gender-role standards. The responses that individuals receive from their social group will mold their identity – becoming more feminine or masculine – and thus affect the way <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> world. Other facets of the process can also result in atypical development. Albeit, whether a child develops shared traits, cross-gender identities, or androgyny, their decision begins with the identification of a gender and the models he or she chooses to emulate. The behaviors they adopt will ultimately shape their knowledge and identity for {{who they are and}} how they should behave.|$|E
25|$|Many historians {{argue that}} the Compromise {{played a major role}} in postponing the American Civil War for a decade, while the Northwest was growing more wealthy and more populous and was being brought into closer {{relations}} with the Northeast. During that decade, the Whig Party had completely broken down, to be replaced with the new Republican Party dominant in the North and the Democrats in the South. Others {{argue that the}} Compromise only made more obvious the pre-existing sectional divisions and laid the groundwork for future conflict. <b>They</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> Fugitive Slave Law ad helping to polarize the US, as shown in the enormous reaction to Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law aroused feelings of bitterness in the North. Furthermore, the Compromise of 1850 led to a breakdown in the spirit of compromise in the United States in the antebellum period, directly before the Civil War. The Compromise exemplifies that spirit, but the deaths of influential senators who worked on the compromise, primarily Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, contributed to the feeling of increasing disparity between the North and South.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined how}} responses to female imagery displayed in Cosmopolitan magazine vary {{as a function}} of females’ conceptualizations of their own sexual identities. After completing the Sexual Self-Schema Scale (SSSS; Andersen & Cyranowski, 1994), female students were randomly assigned to either a sexualized or non-sexualized advertisement condition. Participants rated how they felt as <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> three images, reported their attitudes toward the images, and completed a post-task mood assessment. Findings revealed significant main effects for condition and schema, but no interactions. First, women exposed to the non-sexualized series reported more favorable attitudes and felt happier as <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>the</b> advertisements than those exposed to the sexualized series. Second, women with positive sexual self-schemas indicated more favorable attitudes than negatively schematic women, felt the happiest and most excited as <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>the</b> series, and reported the most positive affect afterward. Suggestions for future research and marketing implications are discussed. Department of Counseling Psychology and Guidance ServicesThesis (M. A. ...|$|R
500|$|As part of Ed Dubinsky's APOS {{theory of}} {{mathematical}} learning, {{he and his}} collaborators (2005) propose that students who conceive of 0.999... as a finite, indeterminate string with an infinitely small distance from 1 have [...] "not yet constructed a complete process conception of the infinite decimal". Other students who have a complete process conception of 0.999... may not yet be able to [...] "encapsulate" [...] that process into an [...] "object conception", like the object conception they have of 1, and so <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> process 0.999... and the object 1 as incompatible. Dubinsky et al. also link this mental ability of encapsulation to viewing [...] as a number {{in its own right}} and to dealing with the set of natural numbers as a whole.|$|E
500|$|In the {{underside}} of the sculpture is the omphalos, an indentation whose mirrored surface provides multiple reflections of any subject situated beneath it. The apex of the omphalos is [...] above the ground. The concave underside allows visitors to walk underneath to see the omphalos, and through its arch to the other side so that <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> entire structure. During the grand opening week in July 2004, press reports described the omphalos as the [...] "spoon-like underbelly". The stainless steel sculpture was originally envisioned as the centerpiece of the Lurie Garden at the southeast corner of the park. However, Park officials believed the piece was too large for the Lurie Garden and decided to locate it at AT Plaza, despite Kapoor's objections. Skyscrapers to the north along East Randolph Street, including The Heritage, the Smurfit-Stone Building, Two Prudential Plaza, One Prudential Plaza, and Aon Center are visible, reflected on both the east and west sides of the sculpture.|$|E
500|$|Her {{attitude}} and language often sharply polarized debate, and made Dworkin herself {{a figure of}} intense controversy. After her death, the conservative gay writer Andrew Sullivan claimed that [...] "Many on the social right liked Andrea Dworkin.

Like Dworkin, they are horrified by male sexuality, and see men as such as a problem to be tamed. Like Dworkin, they believe {{in the power of the}} state to censor and coerce sexual freedoms. Like Dworkin, <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> enormous new freedom that women and gay people have acquired since the 1960s as a terrible development for human culture." [...] Libertarian/conservative journalist Cathy Young complained of a [...] "whitewash" [...] in feminist obituaries for Dworkin, argued that Dworkin's positions were manifestly misandrist, stated that Dworkin was in fact insane, criticized what she called Dworkin's [...] "destructive legacy", and described Dworkin as a [...] "sad ghost" [...] that feminism needs to exorcise.|$|E
