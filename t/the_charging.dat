5|$|USB Battery Charging {{defines a}} new port type, <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> port, {{as opposed to}} the {{standard}} downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. Charging ports are divided into 2 further types: <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> downstream port (CDP), which has data signals, and the dedicated charging port (DCP), which does not. Dedicated charging ports can be found on USB power adapters that convert utility power or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and battery packs. On a host (such as a laptop computer) with both standard and charging USB ports, <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> ports should be labeled as such.|$|E
5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the {{portable}} device, which {{is required to}} have a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which is required to have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> port, which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. <b>The</b> <b>charging</b> port does not pass data, but does use the D± signals for charging port detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device can charge from the bus power {{as if there were}} a charging port present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory port from <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> port transparently.|$|E

40|$|We study <b>the</b> <b>charged</b> slowly {{rotating}} {{black holes}} in the Einstein-Maxwell theory in the large dimensions. By using the 1 /D expansion in the near region of the black hole we obtain the effective equations for <b>the</b> <b>charged</b> slowly rotating black holes.

This indicates that all <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> on C has been transferred to the container, and has exactly neutralized <b>the</b> opposite <b>charge</b> on <b>the</b> inside surface of the container, leaving only <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> on <b>the</b> outside.

5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and {{swelling of the}} graphite moderator known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In {{order to maintain the}} supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction process as an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily be recovered.|$|E
5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{are currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead blast furnaces {{are constructed using}} water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> bell used in iron blast furnaces.|$|E

5|$|Calvin {{thought that}} {{agriculture}} {{and the traditional}} crafts were normal human activities. With regard to trade and the financial world he was more liberal than Luther, but both were strictly opposed to usury. Calvin allowed <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> of modest interest rates on loans. Like the other Reformers Calvin understood work as a means through which the believers expressed their gratitude to God for their redemption in Christ and as a service to their neighbors. Everybody was obliged to work; loafing and begging were rejected. The idea that economic success was a visible sign of God's grace played only a minor role in Calvin's thinking. It became more important in later, partly secularized forms of Calvinism and became the starting-point of Max Weber's theory about the rise of capitalism.|$|E
5|$|General Motors is {{sponsoring}} the Pecan Street demonstration project in Austin, Texas. The project {{objective is to}} learn <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and to study how a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same, {{which is what the}} preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening.

5000|$|Conductive metal objects contain mobile {{electric}} charges (electrons) {{that can}} move about freely in the metal. [...] In an uncharged state, {{each part of}} the metal contains equal quantities of positive and negative charges, intimately mixed, so no part of it has a net charge. If an external charged object is brought near a piece of metal, the force of <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> causes these internal charges to separate. [...] <b>The</b> <b>charges</b> of opposite polarity to <b>the</b> external <b>charge</b> are attracted to it, and move {{to the surface of the}} object facing <b>the</b> <b>charge.</b> <b>The</b> <b>charges</b> of <b>the</b> same polarity are repelled and move to the surface of the metal away from <b>the</b> <b>charge.</b> This is called electrostatic induction. In Procedure 2 above, as <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> C is lowered into <b>the</b> container, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> in <b>the</b> metal of the container separate. If C has a positive <b>charge,</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>charges</b> in <b>the</b> metal are attracted to it and move to the inner surface of the container, while <b>the</b> positive <b>charges</b> are repelled and move to the outside surface. If C has a negative <b>charge,</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> have opposite polarity. Since the container was originally uncharged, the two regions have equal and opposite <b>charges.</b> <b>The</b> induction process is reversible: in Procedure 4, when C is removed, the attraction of <b>the</b> opposite <b>charges</b> cause them to intermingle again, and <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> on <b>the</b> surfaces reduces to zero.|$|R

The Great Famine shook the English economy severely and population growth ceased; the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 then killed around half the English population. The agricultural sector shrank rapidly, with higher wages, lower prices and diminishing profits leading to the final demise of the old demesne system and the advent of the modern farming system centring on <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> of cash rents for lands. As returns on land fell, many estates, and in some cases entire settlements, were simply abandoned, and nearly 1,500 villages were deserted during this period.
