500|$|In late 2008 {{and again}} in September 2009, the {{government}} watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Rangel one of the 15 most corrupt members of Congress. [...] Media pieces compared Rangel's woes with those unethical former Ways and Means chairs Wilbur Mills and Dan Rostenkowski. [...] Pelosi, a long-time friend of Rangel's, withheld any possible action against Rangel pending the House Ethics Committee report. [...] Rangel evinced impatience with that body, saying [...] "I don't have a complaint now, except that it's taking too goddamn long to review <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> report back." ...|$|E
500|$|Neuroscientists Bevil Conway and Jay Neitz {{believe that}} the {{differences}} in opinions {{are a result of}} how the human brain perceives colour, and chromatic adaptation. Conway believes that it has a connection to how the brain processes the various hues of a daylight sky, noting that [...] "your visual system is looking at <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> you're trying to discount the chromatic bias of the daylight axis. ... people either discount the blue side, in which case they end up seeing white and gold, or discount the gold side, in which case they end up with blue and black." [...] Neitz remarked: ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{they had}} been asked to put {{together}} a 90-minute TV special, Seinfeld and David wrote a TV pilot as they felt their [...] "show about nothing" [...] concept would fit better in a shorter format. The storyline, and the main characters, were inspired by real-life events and people. Though the NBC executives were unsure about the show, they, as Warren Littlefield would later state, [...] "all said, ah what the hell, let's try a pilot on <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> see what happens". The test audiences, however, reacted extremely negatively. Although NBC would still broadcast the episode to see how audiences and TV critics would react, the network had already decided not to pick up the show, {{as a result of the}} test-results.|$|E

500|$|Lee {{stated the}} song was {{inspired}} by and talked about her relationship with the band's fans, and the realization that following a music career [...] "is what I'm supposed to do". She also explained that the theme of {{the song was}} freedom, saying that the song's lyric [...] "Remember who you really are" [...] was [...] "exactly everything you could assume it means". Another inspiration for the song came from Lee's life, [...] "That song is me talking to myself about not being afraid and coming back to <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> living the life I was born to live. Sometimes, it takes a lot to do this. And I do love it very much, but there is always that fear of putting yourself under the microscope." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{new version}} of the dance single with Inna's vocals was {{initially}} made available for consumption as credited to Bob Taylor and Anni (backwards to Inna), as the artists wanted to [...] "stay in the shade" [...] reportedly because [...] "the Romanian audience has some bias". Following a time of speculation and controversy, the performers of the recording were finally revealed, with Inna writing on her website; [...] "I consider that a good song can be promoted and listened to without knowing by whom it is composed or who interprets it. With the help of 'Déjà Vu', I have showed <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and,</b> look, again, you – the audience – had the biggest intake. I thank you and don't forget that you are the only ones that can make a hit out of a song." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Schmirler {{worked as}} colour {{commentator}} for CBC during Canada's national junior curling championships. During her illness, Schmirler {{had been largely}} removed from the public eye. While in Moncton for the championships, Schmirler {{held a press conference}} to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: [...] "There were three goals I had coming out of <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm going to put my feet in the sand in a warm place. And the last one was to actually be here today, and I thank CBC, I thank Lawrence (Kimber), and Joan Mead." ...|$|E

500|$|David and Seinfeld re-wrote {{the script}} {{several times before}} {{submitting}} it to the network, dropping and adding various elements. Originally George, who was called Bennett in early drafts, was a comedian as well, and the first scene of the episode focussed on Jerry and George discussing their stand-up material. The character of Kramer, {{was not included in}} the first draft of the script, and in another draft he was called [...] "Hoffman". Another element that was added was Kessler's dog, since it was originally planned that Jerry's stand-up routines would match the events of each episode. Though the stand-up routine about dogs was eventually dropped, the scene in which Kessler enters with his dog remained in the episode. When David and Seinfeld eventually submitted the script, the network executives were unsure whether or not to produce the pilot, but as NBC executive Warren Littlefield would later state [...] "we all said, ah what the hell, let's try a pilot on <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> see what happens".|$|E
500|$|Developers tasked both art and map design {{personnel}} {{with creating}} levels, ensuring visual quality. Hall implemented a [...] "grow as you play" [...] philosophy, choosing to show certain features and statistics (like [...] "Beat" [...] {{or the use}} of MysTech) only after the player enabled their use. Developers sought to make the game accessible to expert and casual players through two statistic displays—numerical or qualitative (using categories such as [...] "very good" [...] or [...] "bad"). Hall disparaged complicated number systems found in other games: [...] "One of the things I hate about RPGs is, you've got, like, 'here's <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> here's that thing' and it's like 'this is 52 and that's 53' I mean, what's the difference? It's like, OK it's 'a point,' and the formula will come up to be like 'two points' and like, sure, that's going to make a difference. So now I have to hit the guy three times..." [...] Hall also sought to ensure players knew their next goal, and invented the character of Fatima Doohan to keep track of missions. Fatima's name is a pun born from the phrase, [...] "What am I doing?" [...] Hall named her after the experience of loading an old saved game in an RPG and having forgotten what comes next in the current quest or storyline.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the lack}} of success in NAACP's actions to ban the film, on April 17, 1915, NAACP {{secretary}} Mary Childs Nerney wrote to NAACP Executive Committee member George Packard: [...] "I am utterly disgusted with the situation in regard to The Birth of a Nation ... kindly remember that we have put six weeks of constant effort of <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> have gotten nowhere." ...|$|E

[...] No date was given by Long for Hammermeister's observation, but it apparently came well after the relatives' observation, as implied by the word [...] "still" [...] in the justification Heironimus gave Hammermeister for requesting his silence: [...] "There was still {{supposed to be a}} payola on <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> he didn't have it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fraud {{involving}} {{the appointment of}} a senator to fill the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama is the most notable charge against Blagojevich. Blagojevich was overheard on a recorded phone call saying [...] "I've got <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> it's f**king golden. I'm just not giving it up for f**king nothing." [...] He was also recorded as saying, [...] "it's a f**king valuable thing, you just don't give it away for nothing", and that [...] "If I don't get what I want ...

2500|$|In Campbell's book Pathways to Bliss, Campbell {{recalls his}} {{reaction}} to the similarities he noted between Wilder's play and Joyce's novel:hen I went to see Thornton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth, which was the big Broadway hit at the time...all I heard was Finnegans Wake. [...] I phoned Robinson, and I said, [...] "Good God, here's Wilder making tons of money {{and a lot of}} fame on <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> it's simply Finnegans Wake."

2500|$|Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai {{compared}} Cain and Abel to two gladiators fighting {{before a}} king. Had the king wished, {{he could have}} separated them, {{but he did not}} do so. One overcame the other and killed him. Before he died, the victim cried out to the king for help. Rabbi Simeon thus noted that changing one letter in [...] would cause God's statement to read, [...] "The voice of your brother's blood cries out against Me." [...] Rabbi Simeon said {{that it is difficult to}} say <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> the mouth cannot utter it plainly (but by God's inaction, God was involved in Abel's murder).|$|E
2500|$|In a July 1995 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, Gibson said President Bill Clinton was a [...] "low-level opportunist" [...] and someone was [...] "telling {{him what to}} do". He said that the Rhodes Scholarship was established for {{young men and women}} who want to strive for a [...] "new world order" [...] and this was a campaign for Marxism. Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, [...] "It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'...so I laid out <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> suddenly, it was like I was talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I believed in it." [...] In the same 1995 Playboy interview, Gibson argued against ordaining women to the priesthood.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1924, Darrow took {{on the case of}} Nathan Leopold Jr. and Richard Loeb, the teenage sons of two wealthy Chicago {{families}} who were accused of kidnapping and killing Bobby Franks, a 14-year-old boy, from their stylish southside Kenwood neighborhood. Leopold was a law student at the University of Chicago about to transfer to Harvard Law School, and Loeb was the youngest graduate ever from the University of Michigan; they were 18 and 17, respectively, when they were arrested. When asked why they committed the crime, Leopold told his captors: [...] "The thing that prompted Dick to want to do <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> prompted me to want to do this thing was a sort of pure love of excitement... the imaginary love of thrills, doing something different... the satisfaction and the ego of putting something over." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an August 2017 {{review of}} the {{aircraft}} done by AVweb's Paul Bertorelli, he said: [...] "is it a great airplane or just a good airplane? If the measure of greatness isn’t defined by absolute speed, pure efficiency or herculean payload, but of how well the design resonates with the intended buyer, the Vision Jet is both a great airplane and a significant one. It’s great because I think SR22 owners will swoon over <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> significant because it represents a class of its own, expanding practical (if not cheap) jet ownership downward. At a typical invoice of $2.1 million, the Vision Jet is the least expensive jet out there and on a speed vs. dollars matrix, it more than holds its own against whatever competition {{it has in the}} low-and-slow tier, and that’s basically nothing in the turbojet category."

2500|$|The Illinois House and Senate {{moved quickly}} {{thereafter}} to impeach the governor for {{abuse of power}} and corruption. On January 8, the Illinois House voted 114–1 (with three abstentions) to impeach Blagojevich. The charges brought by the House emphasized Blagojevich's alleged abuses of power and his alleged attempts to sell gubernatorial appointments and legislative authorizations and/or vetoes. One of the accusations was an alleged attempt to sell the appointment to the United States Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Barack Obama. Blagojevich was taped by the FBI saying [...] "I've got <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> it's fucking golden. I'm just not giving it up for fucking nothing." [...] He was removed from office and prohibited from ever holding public office {{in the state of}} Illinois again, by two separate and unanimous votes of 59–0 by the Illinois Senate on January 29, 2009. Blagojevich's lieutenant governor Patrick Quinn subsequently became governor of Illinois. Blagojevich's impeachment trial and removal from office did not have any effect or bearing on his federal indictment in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, as impeachment is a political, not a criminal, sanction.|$|E
