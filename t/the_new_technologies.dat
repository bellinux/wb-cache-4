However, the expense of the larger ships was prohibitive, and many of them stayed in shipyards half-completed, in readiness for another war, until the Age of Sail had almost completely passed. The main force of the Navy continued to be large sailing frigates with a number of smaller sloops during the three decades of peace. By the 1840s, the Navy began to adopt steam power and shell guns, but they lagged behind the French and British in adopting <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce repeatable experimental results was {{essential for the}} {{development of}} molecular genetics. After early work with Drosophila and maize, the adoption of simpler model systems like the bread mold Neurospora crassa made it possible to connect genetics to biochemistry, most importantly with Beadle and Tatum's one gene-one enzyme hypothesis in 1941. Genetics experiments on even simpler systems like tobacco mosaic virus and bacteriophage, aided by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> of electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation, forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of life; virus heredity and reproducing nucleoprotein cell structures outside the nucleus ("plasmagenes") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.|$|E

The war led to a change in McKinley's cabinet, as the President accepted Sherman's resignation as Secretary of State; Day agreed to serve as Secretary until the war's end.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend toward}} {{artificial}} ice was hastened by the regular ice famines during the period, {{such as the}} 1898 British famine, which typically caused rapid price increases, fuelled demand for plant ice and encouraged investment in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies.</b> Concerns also grew over the safety of natural ice. Initial reports concerning ice being produced from polluted or unclean lakes and rivers had first emerged in the U.S. {{as early as the}} 1870s. The British public health authorities believed Norwegian ice was generally much purer and safer than American sourced ice, but reports in 1904 noted the risk of contamination in transit and recommended moving to the use of plant ice. In 1907, New York specialists claimed ice from the Hudson River to be unsafe for consumption and potentially containing typhoid germs; the report was successfully challenged by the natural ice industry, but public opinion was turning against natural ice on safety grounds. These fears of contamination was often played on by artificial ice manufacturers in their advertising. Major damage was also done to the industry by fire, including a famous blaze at the American Ice Company facilities at Iceoboro in 1910, which destroyed the buildings and the adjacent schooners, causing around $130,000 ($2,300,000 in 2010 terms) of damage and crippling the Maine ice industry.|$|E

40|$|By early {{adopting}} a <b>new</b> <b>technology,</b> firms may attempt {{to improve their}} production efficiency and become further involved in the supply chain of the technology. These two different advantages derived from learning a <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> are identified as motives for adopting the technology. When learning for supplying (LFS) (becoming involved in the supply chain of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology)</b> highlighted in this paper is significant enough, potential adopters may still be willing to adopt <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology,</b> even though learning for using (LFU) (increasing current production efficiency) is not significant.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the incentives}} to adopt cost-reducing technology by firms in a horizontally differentiated industry. In our model {{there are several}} suppliers of a <b>new</b> <b>technology.</b> <b>The</b> extent of the cost reduction depends {{on the quality of}} <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology.</b> A firm has to buy the technology in a 'scoring auction'. This means that both the price and the quality (which affects marginal cost of production) of this <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> are no longer given but depend on the equilibrium outcome in the 'scoring auction'. We show that the nature of competition (Cournot or Bertrand) has no effect on the equilibrium decision of the firms to adopt <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> when <b>the</b> quality of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> offered by <b>the</b> suppliers lies in the interior of the feasible range of qualities. In this case, both firms adopt <b>new</b> <b>technology.</b> However, when there is a corner solution, then it is possible to have equilibria where only one firm (or no firm) adopts <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology.</b> With corner solution the nature of competition (Cournot or Bertrand) makes a difference to the equilibrium outcomes...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{a dynamic}} duopoly in which firms compete in <b>the</b> {{adoption}} of <b>new</b> <b>technologies.</b> <b>The</b> innovation process is exogenous to the firms. Both firms {{have the possibility}} to adopt a current technology or {{to wait for a}} better technology that arrives at an unknown point of time in the future. At the moment that a firm invests it enters a new market with a profit flow that follows a stochastic Brownian motion process. Results turn out to largely depend on the probability that a <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> arrives in <b>the</b> immediate future. If this probability is low, firms only take the current technology into account, which results in the usual preemption game. Increasing this probability gradually changes the outcome from a preemption game where both firms adopt the current technology, to a preemption game where the follower will adopt <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology.</b> Increasing <b>the</b> probability of arrival of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> further, turns <b>the</b> preemption game into a war of attrition where the follower adopting <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> is better of than the leader.
