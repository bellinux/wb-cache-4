5|$|In the 1970s {{job losses}} due <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> {{restructuring}} caused New York City, including Manhattan, {{to suffer from}} economic problems and rising crime rates. While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through the decade and into {{the beginning of the}} 1990s.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{scientific}} consensus linking human activities {{to global warming}} due <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> carbon dioxide emissions.

5|$|Around this time, veteran {{industrial}} metal artists (Ministry, Godflesh, and White Zombie) {{began to}} repudiate the industrial label. Sales remained high throughout 2000–2005; at least 10 million records were sold {{during that time}} frame. Many groups began to take influence from hip hop and electronic music, in addition <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> metal. As a result, acts like Powerman 5000 are often described as industrial metal as well as nu metal.|$|E

5|$|Despite segregationist {{and racist}} attitudes, St. Louis {{acted as a}} haven during the 1917 East St. Louis Riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to shelter and food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East St. Louis and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from the rural South <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> cities, the black population of St. Louis increased more rapidly than the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> {{waste and}} automobiles, Manila suffers from air pollution, {{affecting}} 98% of the population. Annually, the air pollution causes more than 4,000 deaths. Ermita is Manila's most air polluted district due to open dump sites and industrial waste. According {{to a report}} in 2003, the Pasig River {{is one of the most}} polluted rivers in the world with 150 tons of domestic waste and 75 tons of industrial waste dumped daily.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E

5|$|In 1969 Brookley Air Force Base {{was closed}} by the Department of Defense, dealing Mobile's economy a severe blow. The closing {{resulted}} in a 10% unemployment rate in the city. This and other factors related <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> restructuring ushered {{in a period of}} economic depression that lasted through the 1970s. The loss of jobs created numerous problems and resulted in loss of population as residents moved away for work.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> growth, the 1880s and 1890s were {{a period}} of significant growth in downtown commercial building. The retail district was centered at Fourth Street and Washington Avenue, while banking and business was centered to the south, at Fourth and Olive streets. During the 1890s, significant retailers and businesses moved westward; among the new buildings constructed {{as a result of}} this movement was the Wainwright Building. Designed by Louis Sullivan in 1891, the Wainwright was the tallest building in the city at the time of its construction and remains an example of early skyscraper design.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the economy of the city of Split and its {{surrounding}} area started to recover and Split soon became hub of the central Dalmatia, connecting the hinterland and the neighboring islands. This spurred development of the city port and its transport connections, including construction of a new breakwater and the Split–Knin railway. In 1925, the railway was linked to the Rijeka–Zagreb railway via Gospić, allowing development of a modern port. Since 1957, cargo terminals of the Port of Split were relocated from the city centre <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> zones in Solin and Kaštela areas, while passenger traffic still uses the centrally positioned harbor.|$|E

5|$|Modi also relaxed or {{abolished}} {{a number}} of other environmental regulations, particularly those related <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|Other uses of organobromine {{compounds}} include high-density drilling fluids, dyes (such as Tyrian {{purple and}} the indicator bromothymol blue), and pharmaceuticals. Bromine itself, {{as well as}} some of its compounds, are used in water treatment, and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds with an enormous number of applications (e.g. silver bromide for photography). Zinc–bromine batteries are hybrid flow batteries used for stationary electrical power backup and storage; from household scale <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> scale.|$|E
5|$|Production of the fissile {{isotopes}} uranium-235 and plutonium-239 were enormous undertakings {{given the}} technology of the 1940s, and accounted for 80% of the total costs of the project. Uranium enrichment was carried out at the Clinton Engineer Works near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Theoretically, enriching uranium was feasible through pre-existing techniques, but it proved difficult to scale <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> levels and was extremely costly. Only 0.71 percent of natural uranium was uranium-235, and {{it was estimated that}} it would take 27,000 years to produce a gram of uranium with mass spectrometers, but kilogram amounts were required.|$|E

5|$|Salford is {{credited}} as {{the birthplace of}} the Bush Roller Chain. Hans Renold, a Swiss-born engineer, came to Salford in the late 19th century. In 1879 he purchased a small textile-chain making business in Ordsall from James Slater and founded the Hans Renold Company, what is now Renold, a firm which still produces chains. Renold invented the bush roller chain shortly after and began producing it. It is the type of chain most commonly used for transmission of mechanical power on bicycles, motorbikes, <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> and agricultural machinery to uses as varied as rollercoasters and escalators.|$|E
5|$|South Wales miners, {{including}} those at Universal, were paid on a rate {{determined by the}} Sliding Scale Committee, which fixed wages on the price coal fetched at market. When the price of coal slumped in the late 1890s, low wages led <b>to</b> <b>industrial</b> unrest and, in 1898, a strike that the men at Universal joined {{at the end of}} April. The Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners' Association refused to replace the scale, and the strike ended on 1 September with some small concessions granted by the owners. The colliery resumed production and in 1899 was producing 3,000 long tons (3,400short tons) of coal a week.|$|E
