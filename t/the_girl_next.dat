Lucy Davies of the BBC noted, [...] "Swift deals in the prosaic imagery {{of high school}} boys". In one verse, Swift contrasts herself with her friend's girlfriend and states, [...] "She wears high heels, I wear sneakers / She's cheer captain, I'm on the bleachers", which Davies interpreted as the song's protagonist feeling envy towards cheerleaders, in particular, the one dating her male friend. In the choruses, Swift attempts [...] "to persuade some boy {{to come to his}} senses and submit to her everygirl charms".|$|E

500|$|Susan is {{primarily}} characterized as <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> door. Teri Hatcher stated [...] "I’m not exactly her, but I get her. I get her insecurities, her flaws." [...] She called the character [...] "a great representation of what [...] deals with daily. Our responsibilities {{can be overwhelming}} and things often don't go as you planned, {{so you have to}} roll with it. Susan celebrates rolling with it". She is a hopeless romantic and often expresses her more openly and vulnerably than the other characters in the series. The series begins a year after Susan's first divorce, when she is still emotionally raw. Throughout the series, several other characters have confronted Susan about her inability to live happily and without drama. Susan has a close relationship with her daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), who often acts as the parent figure in the relationship.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the show, Lana Lang is {{characterized}} as <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> door. As Kreuk describes her, she is the [...] "beautiful, popular girl who is really lonely". She has a [...] "hole in her heart", because of the loss of her parents, and feels empathy for everyone. Kristin feels that deep down the character is a [...] "tough girl", and that Lex manages to bring that side of her out more. For instance, he convinces her to fight back against a rival coffee shop that is spreading rumors about The Talon – the coffee shop that she joint owns with Lex. Unfortunately, that tough side is not seen in the first season. According to Kreuk, the character was never placed in situations where she could show her outgoing side, because she was left to communicate primarily with Whitney and Clark. Kreuk thinks that Lana [...] "lived in her head a little bit"; she was intelligent enough to read classical books, but would also read romantic novels [...] "on the sly".|$|E
500|$|According to MTV, {{the initial}} concept {{for the music}} video was to portray Spears {{on the porch of}} a beachfront home {{watching}} a group of kids having fun, prompting flashbacks about her former boyfriend. The video begins with Spears going to the telescope, and Spears is looking through a telescope. The concept was later changed a man and a dog walk on the beach, portraying the singer as <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> door, watching her love interest, played by model Chad Cole, from afar. The beach location was kept, and the music video intercuts with scenes of Spears' dancing on the Paradise Cove pier with her dancers dressed all in beach-friendly white attire, then Spears sits near a car. A writer of Rolling Stone noted the video is best known for [...] "purifying the sexy persona Spears introduced in the '... Baby One More Time' video", while describing it as [...] "a virginal Britney in a long, flowing white dress (and other demure outfits) gazes at a clean-cut boy on the beach, then she walks on the balcony with a pink ball, then does some chaste choreography that features her dancers forming a heart while she sings that she only wants to [...] "hold you tight, treat you right." [...] Spears is sitting on a picnic blanket wishing she was there with him. She leaves alone." [...] On February 20, 2012, behind the scenes footage of the music video leaked online.|$|E

500|$|Butterfly {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Nathan Brackett, {{senior editor of}} Rolling Stone and author of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, praised the album's producers and Carey's [...] "more controlled" [...] vocals. Brackett noticed a connection between much of Carey's lyrics and her separation from Mottola. Jon Pareles, editor of The New York Times called Butterfly [...] "a new turn" [...] in Carey's career. He wrote, [...] "Carey has sold {{tens of millions of}} albums by being <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> door with the startling vocal range... but for most of [...] "Butterfly" [...] Carey turned her voice into an airy whisper, as if she would rather charm listeners" [...] compared to over-powering them. Aside from commenting on its deviance from Carey's previous work, he noted songs in which Carey alludes to her failed marriage to Mottola, such as [...] "Butterfly" [...] and [...] "Close My Eyes" [...] which were both released on the album following the divorce with lyrics about letting love go and life struggles. Additionally he wrote, [...] "Since Carey writes her own lyrics, fans might expect a glimpse of marital discord or pride in her new-found autonomy." [...] David Browne from Entertainment Weekly gave Butterfly a B- in his review. Browne wrote: [...] "In Breakdown, [...] demonstrates she can match the staccato, lite-reggae phrasing of her guests, two members of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony." [...] He described an increased intimacy in the music but noted the arrangement made it difficult to hear the lyrics Carey was singing. [...] "Butterfly is undeniably pleasant, with little of the all-conquering bombast usually associated with Carey. But it's also the last thing anyone would have expected from her: blandly self-effacing." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, [...] "If 2001's Britney was a {{transitional}} album, capturing Spears {{at the point}} when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman." [...] Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs, but while Aguilera [...] "comes across like a natural-born skank, Britney is <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> door cutting loose at college, drinking and smoking and dancing and sexing {{just a little too}} recklessly, since {{this is the first time}} she can indulge herself." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated, [...] "For a girl who's always seemed too sexed-up for her age, In the Zone finds Britney finally filling her britches, so-to-speak. Her little girl coquettishness actually works now—maybe because, at 21, she's finally a woman." [...] Jason King of Vibe said the album showcased a transformed Spears, [...] "no longer a girl, and all the woman any man can handle." [...] In 2009, Amy Schriefer of NPR listed the album on The 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade list. Calling it [...] "a primer on the sound of pop in the '00s", she deemed Spears as the ideal vehicle for a futuristic sound, since she was still trying to break away from her teen pop past. Schriefer praised [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime", and also stated, [...] "While the decade's history of celebrity obsession, paparazzi voyeurism and conflicted constructions of female sexuality and motherhood are written on Spears' body, the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} series of Torchwood, Gwen functioned as an {{audience}} surrogate. Russell T Davies likened her character type {{to that of}} 2005–06 Doctor Who lead female Rose Tyler (Billie Piper): [...] "She is the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal." [...] Eve Myles characterised Gwen as an ambitious and feisty young woman, who {{at the same time}} embodies many aspects of <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> door archetype. [...] Her distinct role within the team {{stems from the fact that}} [...] "she's there for the people", who she feels [...] "instinctive and passionate" [...] about. Producer Richard Stokes noted that Gwen possesses more [...] "human empathy" [...] than the more mercenary members of the team, who are seen to be [...] "technology-and-alien-obsessed". In this vein, lead actor John Barrowman commented that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack. Describing the ways in which Gwen's methods differ from the rest of the team, Myles explained how her police procedural training relates to the job: [...] "she deals with the families, she deals with profiling, she deals with searching people's backgrounds. It's a new way of working she brings in". Myles stated that Gwen would have made a [...] "fantastic policewoman" [...] prior to joining Torchwood, drawing on the character's ability to get vulnerable characters to [...] "open up by making them feel comfortable". Myles perceived Gwen to be [...] "the heart and emotion of Torchwood", and [...] "Torchwood's social worker" [...] who can [...] "run and fight and stand in her own corner and win". Gaining insight into Torchwood through curiosity, Gwen becomes part of Torchwood because they need her, just as she needs them. Gwen's friendship with former colleague Andy is used by the production team to juxtapose her extraordinary life with a mundane one, as well as highlighting her transformation into a harder woman. Andy is present immediately before Gwen first encounters Torchwood, and Myles feels his later appearances [...] "takes you right back to the beginning, it reminds you where she came from, how Jack found Gwen". Myles observed that Gwen's many facets prevent her from getting bored; she feels constantly challenged [...] "physically", [...] "mentally" [...] and [...] "morally" [...] through portraying the character.|$|E
