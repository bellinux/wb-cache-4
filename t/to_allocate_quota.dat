40|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> <b>quotas</b> for {{sustainable}} harvests, {{that account for}} climate warming, {{it is important to}} incorporate species vulnerabilities that will underlie likely changes in population dynamics. Hotspots, regions with rapidly changing climate, are important locations for rapid advances in mechanistic understanding of the factors driving these changes, particularly if they coincide with regions with a high incidence of range limits, such as the sub-Antarctic Island of South Georgia. This archipelago is at the Northern limit of the Southern Ocean and therefore the northern distribution limit for many Southern Ocean shallow water marine species, which are amongst the most sensitive fauna to increasing temperature. At range limits species may either be living close to their physiological limits, or they may have more resistant phenotypes. In case studies, the northern range limit population of the gastropod limpet, Nacella concinna, has greater physiological plasticity at South Georgia than those from further south, allowing them to cope better with the warmer and more variable seasonal temperatures. Bivalve species, however, alter their depth distributions at South Georgia, to avoid the warmer water masses, indicating that {{they may not be able}} to cope with the warmer temperatures. Mackerel icefish, Champsocephalus gunnari, has a unique Antarctic trait, the loss of haemoglobin. A combination of temperature driven change in food web structure, and this extreme physiological cold adaptation, may explain why rapid warming at its northern range limit of South Georgia, has prevented stocks fully recovering from over fishing in the 1980 s, despite highly conservative management strategies...|$|R

Results indicate that estimates of gains to developing countries from an MFA removal are larger and by significant orders of magnitude (we suggest a factor of 8) when internal quota allocation schemes are also included.

The Act also introduced a cartel scheme <b>to</b> <b>allocate</b> production <b>quotas</b> <b>to</b> pits under the control of a central council, while a Mines Reorganisation Commission was established to encourage efficiency through amalgamations. However, this legislation largely ignored by the mine owners due to Labours' lack of enforcement powers.

The 1930 Housing Act also allowed local authorities to set up differential rent schemes, with rents related to the incomes of the tenants concerned.|$|R

The role of secondary markets in correcting inefficiencies in initial quota allocation is also examined. It is shown that, in these other industries, an auction process has evolved which can lead to the achievement {{of a wide range of}} public policy objectives in an economically efficient manner.

As of 2008, 148 major fisheries (generally, a single species in a single fishing ground) around the world had adopted some variant of this approach, along with approximately 100 smaller fisheries in individual countries. Approximately 10% of the marine harvest was managed by ITQs as of 2008. The ﬁrst countries to adopt individual fishing quotas were the Netherlands, Iceland and Canada in the late 1970s, and the most recent is the United States Scallop General Category IFQ Program in 2010.
