5|$|The tickets {{along the}} Northeast Extension of <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> Turnpike were {{originally}} handed out by person. In 1987, machines started to replace humans in distributing tickets.

The motorist would be billed later. The multi-state electronic tolling system, which was to be called E-ZPass, was planned to be implemented by 1998. The planned installation date was later pushed back to 2000. On December2, 2000, E-ZPass debuted along the Northeast Extension of <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> Turnpike between Mid-County and Lehigh Valley.

5|$|As {{a part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> system, the CL {{continued}} to operate its own property (which included the line north of Dodds after 1914) until January 1, 1921, when it was leased to <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania.</b> Starting {{at the end of}} 1918, the Interstate Commerce Commission classified the CL as a Class I railroad, meaning that it made at least $1 million per year in operating revenue. (This designation was dropped in 1921 when the CL was leased.) However, net operating income, revenue minus costs, which had steadily climbed from the 1890s, began falling in 1916, becoming a deficit in 1920. Subsequently, effective January 1, 1926, <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> merged the CL with several other small companies—the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Manufacturers Railway, Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad, and Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroadto create <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania,</b> Ohio and Detroit Railroad, a non-operating subsidiary.

5|$|Because of the {{construction}} of an embankment at nearby Bainbridge Street, <b>the</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> Railroad was forced to build a new station at West High Street in 1900.

On July4, 1915, the Liberty Bell made a stop at the station while being transported to the PanamaPacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California. <b>The</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> began electrifying its line between Philadelphia and Harrisburg in 1937, a task which was completed on January15, 1938.

Prior to the introduction of the Keystone Service in 1981, the Elizabethtown station was served by the Big Apple, the Silverliner Service, and the Keystone.
