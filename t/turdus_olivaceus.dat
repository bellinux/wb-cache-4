50|$|The {{olive thrush}} (<b>Turdus</b> <b>olivaceus)</b> is, in its range, {{one of the}} most common members of the thrush family (Turdidae). It occurs in east African {{highlands}} from Tanzania and Zimbabwe in the north to the Cape of Good Hope in south. It is a bird of forest and woodland, but has locally adapted to parks and large gardens in suburban areas.|$|E
50|$|With its 120 ha, Ngangao is {{the second}} largest forest {{and one of the}} lesser {{disturbed}} forests of the Taita Hills. As a result, it is a stronghold for many plant and animal species. There are three endemic birds species of the Taita Hills. The Taita thrush (<b>Turdus</b> (<b>olivaceus)</b> helleri), Taita apalis (Apalis (thoracica) fuscigularis) and Taita white-eye (Zosterops (poliogaster) silvanus) occur in relative large numbers. Some plants, like the Zimmermannia ovata, are only found in the dryer parts of Ngangao Forest.|$|E
50|$|The Taita thrush was {{previously}} classified as subspecies {{of the olive}} thrush (<b>Turdus</b> <b>olivaceus),</b> but it is regarded as distinct species since 1985. It reaches a length between 20 and 22 centimetres. Head, breast and upperparts are coloured darkly. The underparts are white and the flanks have a rufous hue. The eyes and the bill exhibit a pale orange coloration. It was named after zoologist Edmund Heller (1875-1939) a workmate of the American ornithologist Edgar Alexander Mearns (1856-1916) who described this species scientifically in 1913.|$|E
50|$|The Abyssinian thrush, African {{mountain}} thrush or Northern {{olive thrush}} (Turdus abyssinicus) is a passerine {{bird in the}} family Turdidae. In 2010, the species was confirmed as separate from the olive thrush (<b>Turdus</b> <b>olivaceus)</b> due to genetic differences. Their ranges do not overlap. The southern and northern populations may be distinct species. The Abyssinian thrush is found in Eritrea {{and other parts of}} the Horn of Africa, as well as an area to the southeast extending from the African Great Lakes region to north eastern Zambia and Malawi.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} daily visitation frequency indices by 4 large (> 150 g), 7 medium-size (50 – 150 g), 5 small (30 – 50 g) and 8 {{and tiny}} (< 30 g) frugivorous bird species on fleshy fruits of two native shrubs (Olea europaea subsp. africana and Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. monilifera), two established alien shrubs (Solanum mauritianum and Lantana camara) and two emerging alien shrubs (Myoporum tenuifolium and Pittosporum undulatum) at nine different {{sites in the}} Cape Floristic Region. Large, medium-size and tiny birds as groups displayed significantly higher visitation frequency indices on fruits of both emerging alien shrub species than the other shrub species. Small birds as a group displayed insignificantly different visitation frequency indices on fruits of both emerging and established alien shrub species but significantly higher visitation frequency indices on fruits of both emerging and established alien shrub species than on fruits of the native shrub species. However, {{there were significant differences}} in foraging frequency indices of the bird species included within each of these body size groups on fruits of the different shrub species. Among the large birds, Columba guinea and among the medium size birds Sturnus vulgaris, Streptopelia senegalensis, <b>Turdus</b> <b>olivaceus</b> and Onychognathus morio all exhibited significantly higher visitation frequency indices on fruits of both emerging alien shrub species than on fruits of the other shrub species. These findings indicate that alien plant control measures should be focused on eradicating localised populations of emerging aliens to limit preferential consumption of their fruits by birds and consequent dispersal of their seeds that germinate readily into natural areas...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the biology of the Olive Thrush <b>Turdus</b> <b>olivaceus</b> olivaceus in Grahamstown, South Africa from 1998 to 2003. Behavioural differences between males and females, parent-young interactions, development of fledglings, {{and the role of}} song and moult in territorial behaviour were investigated. Comparisons of biometrics, moult and survival were made using Olive Thrush ringing data from other regions. There {{were no significant differences in}} mass, wing length or survival rate between the Eastern and Western Cape provinces, but primary wing moult started earlier in the Western Cape and coincided with the end of the main breeding periods in both provinces. Both males and females of breeding pairs remained in and defended their territories throughout the year, but there was some evidence that territorial defence was strongest during the breeding periods. Roughly, every 100 eggs laid produce 50 fledglings. Out of these 20 to 30 reach the age of independence at approximately 50 days, and only five of these juvenile birds reach maturity. Adult survival was estimated at 80 %, with a mean life expectancy of 4. 5 years and a conservative estimate of maximum lifespan of 11 years. Using ringing data and museum specimens, the Olive Thrush was compared with the Karoo Thrush Turdus smithi, a former race of the Olive Thrush. Olive Thrushes had shorter bills and wings, but were heavier than Karoo Thrushes from the Cradock district. There were also differences in bill and eye-ring colouration between these populations. No morphological differences were found between the sexes in either species...|$|E
