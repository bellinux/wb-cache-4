5|$|The Sanny and Jerry Ryan Center for Prevention and Genetics, {{housed in}} Choice Health & Fitness, {{encourages}} individuals to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> health through preventive measures {{before it becomes}} medically necessary to seek care. The {{first of its kind}} in the region, the Center provides a unique opportunity for individuals to take an active approach to a healthier life. Truyu Aesthetic Center, with locations in Grand Forks, East Grand Forks and across the region, offers surgical and non-surgical procedures, services and products under the support of Altru. Altru Health System is the result of a 1997 merger of United Hospital (formerly Deaconess and St. Michael's Hospitals) and the Grand Forks Clinic.|$|E
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E
5|$|During the reception, Grace learns {{many things}} {{she did not}} know about Leo, {{including}} that his first name is Marvin (revealed by his mother, Eleanor (Judith Ivey)). So many unsettling details about Leo come to light that Grace becomes uneasy and leaves the reception; Leo follows her. The two run into Katie in the lobby who tells them that The Today Show has scrapped the wedding segment because the judge who performed the ceremony was not licensed in New York so their marriage is not valid. Upon learning this, Grace tells Leo that she needs time to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> relationship. Leo returns to the reception and announces to everyone that his marriage to Grace is not legitimate. Grace returns to the reception later, and reveals that she does want to marry Leo.|$|E

25|$|There are {{obviously}} many other treatment options, with cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy and Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing being {{some of the}} more popular options, all these involve an individual changing the way they <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> disease and experiences in life.|$|E
25|$|Some {{producers}} also {{profit from}} the indirect benefits of fair trade practices. Fair trade cooperatives create a space of solidarity and promote an entrepreneurial spirit among growers. When growers {{feel like they have}} control over their own lives within the network of their cooperative, it can be very empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> future, rather than worrying about how they are going to survive in poverty.|$|E
25|$|Another {{influence}} on the perception of student sexuality is school culture, as illustrated by Louisa Allen’s study “Denying the Sexual Subject: Schools' Regulation of Student Sexuality.” This study outlines how school culture can lead students to perceive themselves as having varying levels of sexual agency based on gender while also creating a normalized sexuality {{similar to that in}} the Bay-Cheng study. Regardless of the material included in the curricula of school based sex education, the general attitude surrounding sex within individual schools can influence the ways students <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> own sexuality and sexual experiences.|$|E

25|$|The {{composition}} pedagogy {{of moderate}} expressivism {{is characterized by}} a focus on language as a tool for personal rather than social expression, based on the process theory of composition, a belief that the process of writing should be more important than the final product. Further, moderate expressivist pedagogy calls for less grammatical standards and an increased focus on the writer’s process of discovery and expression. W.E. Coles, Jr. suggests that teaching writing should be approached as teaching art, with the teacher serving as facilitator or guide for the student-writer’s free expression; he also calls for classroom practices such as peer-reviews, class discussions, and the absence of grades, in order to best guide the self-identification he sees as crucial to the writing process. Fellow moderate expressivist Donald Murray maintains that writing is a process of discovery and experimentation, a search for truth in a specious world; his manifesto-like essay provides an apt summation of the arguments against the dated pedagogy of CTR. Likewise, Maxine Hairston recognizes the paradigm shift occurring in rhetoric and composition and calls for a non-prescriptive atmosphere in teaching, including less focus on grammar and syntax and, again, more concern with the process of growth experienced by the writer. Peter Elbow reflects moderate expressivist ideals in his claim that audience should be ignored during {{the early stages of the}} writing process, in order to avoid the hindrance of audience expectation and facilitate writer-based rather than reader-based text. Elbow writes, “It’s not that writers should never <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> audience. It’s a question of when.” Simply put, moderate expressivism promotes the notion of process over product, a pedagogy that evolved in the height of the 1960s and in many ways reflects the ideologies of the era in its emphasis on freedom, expression, discovery, and a search for the writer’s authentic self.|$|E

It was nice being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character. Because actors, a lot of times, <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> characters more than the writers because they’re focused on that single character for months of their lives, if not years.

500|$|On a South Pacific island during World War II, two half-Polynesian children, Ngana and Jerome, happily sing as {{they play}} {{together}} ("Dites-Moi"). Ensign Nellie Forbush, a naïve U.S. Navy nurse from Little Rock, Arkansas, {{has fallen in}} love with Emile de Becque, a middle-aged French plantation owner, though she has known him only briefly. Even though everyone else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is sure everything will turn out all right ("A Cockeyed Optimist"). Emile also loves Nellie, and each wonders if the other reciprocates those feelings ("Twin Soliloquies"). Emile expresses his love for Nellie, recalling how they met at the officers' club dance and instantly were attracted to each other ("Some Enchanted Evening"). [...] Nellie, promising to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> relationship, returns to the hospital.

2500|$|Research {{performed}} by Sellen et al. (1997) compared event-based and time-based cues on prospective memory tasks. The experimenters gave participants a place (event-based cue) {{and a time}} (time-based cue) and were told to press a button each time those cues appeared during the study. [...] It was found that performance on event-based tasks was better than performance on time-based tasks, even when participants took more time to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> responses. The difference in task performance between {{the two types of}} prospective memory suggests that the intended action was better triggered by external cues of the event-based task than internal cues of the time-based task. External cues, as opposed to internal cues, act as a prompt for better performance, making it easier to complete event-based tasks.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the goals}} of BioShock 2s {{developers}} was to capitalize or improve aspects of the first game that were received less positively. One such element was the Pipe Mania-inspired hacking minigame. Thomas said that even players who enjoyed the minigames became [...] "numb" [...] to it after repetition; {{the replacement of the}} mini game with hacking that didn't allow you to pause the game added more urgency to the gameplay. Another aspect was the choice to harvest or save Little Sisters; by allowing players to adopt the Little Sisters before deciding their fate, Thomas hoped it would help players form a bond with the characters and <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> choice. Among the other goals the developers had for the sequel was adding more unspliced characters and give players a greater chance to make decisions that impacted the course of the game. [...] "You make decisions about their fate as well, all of which play into the way the story ends," [...] Thomas said. [...] "There's definitely more granularity and dynamism in the narrative of BioShock 2." [...] The game uses Unreal Engine 2.5.|$|E
