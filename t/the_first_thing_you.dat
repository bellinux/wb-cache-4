However, changes in licensing agreements permitted the general public to buy them as well. They have since become a staple at games and other Indiana basketball events. Beginning in 2014, during Hoosier Hysteria, former IU basketball players have presented to the new players their first pair of candy striped pants.

We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor".
