5|$|American Cocker Spaniels in UK and USA/Canada surveys had {{a median}} {{lifespan}} of about 10 to 11 years, {{which is on}} {{the low end of the}} <b>typical</b> <b>range</b> for purebred dogs, and one to two years less than other breeds of their size. The larger English Cocker Spaniel typically lives about a year longer than the American Cocker Spaniel. In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (23%), old age (20%), cardiac (8%), and immune-mediated (8%). In a 2003 USA/Canada Health Survey with a smaller sample size, the leading causes of death were cancer, hepatic disease, and immune-mediated.|$|E

Qatar Airways was the launch customer, receiving two A319-100LRs, PrivatAir received two A319LRs in 2003, and Eurofly acquired two in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} Inspired Gifts is wide; however the {{selection}} changes periodically, {{depending on where}} the need is greatest.

25|$|These {{thermocouples}} {{are well}} suited for measuring extremely high temperatures. Typical uses are hydrogen and inert atmospheres, as well as vacuum furnaces. They are not used in oxidizing environments at high temperatures because of embrittlement. A <b>typical</b> <b>range</b> is 0 to 2315°C, which can be extended to 2760°C in inert atmosphere and to 3000°C for brief measurements.|$|E
25|$|ACARS {{can send}} {{messages}} over VHF if a VHF ground station network {{exists in the}} current area of the aircraft. VHF communication is line-of-sight propagation and the <b>typical</b> <b>range</b> is up to 200 nautical miles at high altitudes. Where VHF is absent, an HF network or satellite communication may be used if available. Satellite coverage may be limited at high latitudes (trans-polar flights).|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Mercury the maximal apparent brightness of Venus {{as seen from}} Earth does not occur at phase angle zero. Since the phase curve of Venus is relatively flat while its distance from the Earth can vary greatly, maximum brightness occurs when the planet is a crescent, at phase angle 125°, at which time Venus can be as bright as magnitude −4.9. Near inferior conjunction the planet typically fades to about magnitude −3 although the exact value depends on the phase angle. The <b>typical</b> <b>range</b> in apparent brightness for Venus {{over the course of}} one apparition is less than a factor of 10 or merely 1% that of Mercury.|$|E

25|$|The highest {{stud fees}} are {{generally}} for racing Thoroughbreds, which may charge {{from two to}} three thousand dollars for a breeding to a new or unproven stallion, to {{several hundred thousand dollars}} for a breeding to a proven producer of stakes winners. Stallions in other disciplines often have stud fees that begin in the range of $1,000 to $3,000, with top contenders who produce champions in certain disciplines able to command as much as $20,000 for one breeding. The lowest stud fees to breed to a grade horse or an animal of low-quality pedigree may only be $100–$200, but there are trade-offs: the horse will probably be unproven, and likely to produce lower-quality offspring than a horse with a stud fee that is in the <b>typical</b> <b>range</b> for quality breeding stock.|$|E
