50|$|For the US and UK {{release the}} next year, {{the system was}} updated by {{replacing}} the mechanical <b>tuning</b> <b>dials</b> with a push-button system with eight pre-selected channels. A panel in the top flipped up to access small mechanical <b>tuning</b> <b>dials</b> {{for each of the}} eight channels. Push-button tuning was relatively rare at this time. The UK model was also released under the Ferguson brand name.|$|R

50|$|The new Royal line sold well, but Zenith's {{lead was}} {{steadily}} eroded. By {{the time of}} the release of the 'R7000' in 1979, fierce competition from Sony in Japan - who, with their digital readout <b>tuning</b> <b>dial</b> had, in many ways, a superior product - meant the end of a famous product line.|$|E
5000|$|Packard Bell radios had {{a unique}} styling {{that makes them}} easy to identify. Being a US West Coast radio maker, they {{maintained}} that image by [...] "stationizing" [...] their radio dials. Major US West Coast and Canadian (west of the Rocky Mountain range) radio station call letters were printed on the <b>tuning</b> <b>dial.</b> From 1926 through 1950, the marketing area for Packard Bell radios consisted of the states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Many Packard Bell models made during this period have stationized dials with the call letters of the major stations from these states marked in their proper places on the dial. These [...] "stationized" [...] dials also include KSL 1160 in Salt Lake City and KOA 850 in Denver. This was an idea inspired by Herb's mother who had trouble reading the <b>tuning</b> <b>dial.</b> After 1950, Packard Bell discontinued its [...] "stationized" [...] dials when it began selling radios and televisions throughout North America.|$|E
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} TR-3, Drake adopted a scheme for {{illuminating}} <b>tuning</b> <b>dials</b> and panel meters on its equipment using small incandescent bulbs behind greenish-blue transparent plastic filters.

50|$|The 75S-1 {{receiver}} and 32S-1 transmitter, comprising {{the heart of}} the S/Line, operated separately or together to transceive. The units included crystal bandpass filters and a new compact PTO design that provided stable, highly linear tuning across 200 kHz band segments. The S/Line <b>tuning</b> <b>dial</b> mechanism was unique when introduced. It used concentric dials and a gear mechanism that provided precise dial resolution, better than 1 kHz.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{distinguishing}} {{design features}} of that generation of Swan transceivers was their dual rate, gear-driven <b>tuning</b> <b>dial.</b> A front knob provided slow rate tuning while a metal, outer collar tuned much faster enabling rapid frequency changes across a band. Improved {{models of the}} two transceivers were periodically introduced well into the 1970s along with accessories, including a remote VFO (for separate control of receiver and transmitter frequency) and the Mark-I and Mark-II linear amplifiers.|$|E
50|$|Tivoli Audio is an American audio {{equipment}} company founded in 2001 by Henry Kloss. They {{are known for}} mid-century modern design inspired radios and other {{audio equipment}} that emphasize simple and functional design without redundant switches, knobs or lights. Many types, including the Model One and Model Two, incorporate visual elements similar to Kloss' KLH Model Eight table radio; most prominent is the geared rotary <b>tuning</b> <b>dial,</b> which allows the user to carefully dial in a station without requiring excessively-steady hands.|$|E
50|$|Students at ESU {{can listen}} in by <b>tuning</b> their radio <b>dials</b> to FM {{frequency}} 90.3, {{as well as}} tuning to Channel 14 or 15 on Cable TV in the dorms, or by listening online.|$|R
50|$|On the {{receiver}} side, frequency drift was mainly {{a problem in}} early tuners, particularly for analog <b>dial</b> <b>tuning,</b> and especially on FM, which exhibits a capture effect. However, {{the use of a}} phase-locked loop (PLL) essentially eliminates the drift issue. For transmitters, a numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) also does not have problems with drift.|$|R
50|$|The {{front panel}} {{controls}} are typically more comprehensive {{than those on}} a broadcasting receiver. Usual features include: signal strength meter; RF gain control; AVC/AGC adjustments; band switching or preselector switching; selectable bandwidth filters; BFO tuning; and audio limiters or attenuators. Precise, calibrated, analog <b>tuning</b> and display <b>dials</b> are used, with a separate bandspread control to allow selective tuning of signals close in frequency. In more recent units, electronic digital frequency displays are provided. In communication receivers, the decorative wooden cabinets typical of early broadcast receivers were replaced with utilitarian metal cabinets to provide electromagnetic shielding and mechanical ruggedness.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Leutz 9-tube {{receiver}} from 1927 {{clearly shows}} the component {{parts of a}} TRF set. Each RF stage is in a separate compartment. Within each compartment can be seen (from top): the triode tube, the interstage coupling coil, and the capacitor attached to its front panel <b>tuning</b> <b>dial.</b> The compartments contain (from left): the 4 RF stages, the detector stage, and the 4 tube audio amplifier. The capacitors could be linked to a common shaft and tuned together, or tuned separately.|$|E
50|$|DTV {{broadcasters}} can broadcast multiple separate video programs {{over one}} channel frequency {{in a digital}} subchannel, so {{it is necessary for}} a portable radio equipped with a digital audio decoder to do more than simply tune in to the frequency as with older analog receivers. It also needs to provide a way for the listener to choose among these digital subchannels, usually labeled as *.1, *.2, *.3, etc., on digital televisions with ATSC tuners. This is possible using an analog <b>tuning</b> <b>dial</b> to tune in to a digital TV broadcast, coupled with a button to select the digital subchannel.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} obtain a British Post Office license for the {{official}} opening, strict regulations had to be met. Because no budget was available, all of the work {{had to be done}} with minimum expenditure. An Amateur Radio KW [...] "Vanguard" [...] transmitter was modified by John Rabson to operate at 998 kHz, using a crystal-controlled exciter made by Robin Gape to replace the original Geloso VFO. Since the transmitter frequency was fixed, the large <b>tuning</b> <b>dial</b> was removed. An active filter was built into the Vanguard's modulator by Rick Jenkins, to avoid exceeding the allotted bandwidth.|$|E
40|$|A novel CIS, {{called the}} backside-illuminated (BSI) CIS, is more {{light-sensitive}} and less noisy {{than the traditional}} front-illuminated (FI) CIS. The key parameters in BSI etch are sidewall profile angle, micro-trenching, and silicon loss macro-loading. In this paper, theh Applied Centura ® AdvantEdge ™ Mesa ™ etch chamber was used to develop a BSI CIS etch process. The target profile for sidewall angle {{can be achieved by}} tuning C 4 F 8 flow. Tuning the pressure minimizes micro-trenching {{at the bottom of the}} BSI pad. For macro-loading of silicon loss, DC (Div. Cap) and MRAD (Motorized Radial Assembly <b>Dial)</b> <b>tuning</b> can achieve minimal silicon loss with good uniformity...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album is}} a single track that was sold on Amazon.com's Amazon MP3 service for 49 U.S. cents. According to Westerberg's manager, Darren Hill, the 49-cent price was {{initially}} a joke suggested by Westerberg: fans would pay [...] "a penny a minute." [...] Hill then shopped the idea to various retailers; Amazon {{was the only one}} willing to distribute the album for the 49 cent price. The album was later listed on Tunecore for worldwide distribution, as Amazon MP3 limits purchases to customers in the United States. The long sound collage is intended to mirror the experience of <b>tuning</b> a radio <b>dial,</b> with songs abruptly cutting off and starting.|$|R
5000|$|One {{method of}} adding a {{bandspread}} control {{was to put}} a relatively small value variable <b>tuning</b> capacitor and <b>dial</b> directly in parallel with the main tuning variable capacitor ( [...] or connected to a tap on the coil of the tuned circuit). The smaller capacitor would have much less effect on the resonant frequency than the main capacitor, allowing fine discrimination of the tuned frequency. A second method, mechanical bandspread, was a second tuning knob connected through a gear train to the main tuning knob; each turn of the bandspread dial moved the main dial through {{a small part of}} its range, improving the precision of tuning.|$|R
50|$|When used together, the SB-300 {{receiver}} and SB-400 transmitter could transceive and had many other {{features of the}} S/Line, including crystal bandwidth filters and 1 kHz <b>tuning</b> <b>dial</b> resolution.

The matching SB-200 1200-watt input/700-800-watt output linear amplifier completed the line for 1965.|$|E
5000|$|Following World War II {{came the}} HRO-7 (1947-1949, 12 tubes, {{including}} 2 miniature tubes), HRO-50 (1949-1950, built-in tuning dials and power supply, push-pull audio amplifier, improved styling and performance), HRO-50-1 (1951, increased IF selectivity), and HRO-60 (1952-1964, dual conversion for coils B (7-14.4 MHz) and A (14-30 MHz), heater current regulation for the HF oscillator and mixer tubes). These {{were followed by}} two solid-state receivers that did not use plug-in coils: the HRO-500 (October 1964 - 1972, 5 kHz - 30 MHz, and HRO-600 (1970-1972?, 16 kHz - 30 MHz). Breaking with tradition, the HRO-600 used a frequency counter instead of a micrometer <b>tuning</b> <b>dial.</b> Ironically, the HRO-600 used tubes for its digital frequency display and thus was, technically, no longer [...] "all solid-state" [...] as its predecessor, the HRO-500, had been.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} television {{remote control}} was a wired version, released in 1950, that soon attracted complaints about an unsightly length of cable from the viewer's chair to the television receiver. Cmdr. Eugene F. McDonald, Zenith President and founder, ordered his engineers to develop a wireless version, {{but the use of}} radio waves was soon discounted due to poor interference rejection inherent in 1950s radio receivers. The 1955 Flash-Matic remote system, invented by Eugene Polley, used a highly directional photo flash tube in the hand held unit that was aimed at sensitive photoreceivers in the four front corners of the television cabinet. However, bright sunlight falling on the television was found to activate the controls. It is worth noting that these remote controls would activate a motor, causing the <b>tuning</b> <b>dial</b> on the television to switch by itself, and this could be used for mischief if someone else was attempting to tune the television.|$|E
50|$|Rather than {{produce a}} {{transmitter}} {{to match the}} 2B, Drake designed {{a new line of}} equipment beginning with an SSB transceiver, the TR-3, in 1963. Again emphasizing size efficiency, the TR-3 was designed as a complete SSB station in a small package. Other design innovations included crystal bandwidth filters and a permeability tuned oscillator (PTO) capable of extremely linear, stable <b>tuning</b> and a <b>dial</b> resolution of better than 1 kHz across all amateur HF (shortwave) bands. Its size was so small, in part, because the power supply was in a separate chassis, connected to the transceiver with a multi-conductor cable. The AC-3 power supply could be installed inside a matching speaker cabinet, later designated the MS-4. An optional remote VFO (PTO), the RV-3 could be added to the system to enable split frequency operation (i.e., transmitting on a frequency different from the receiving frequency). The RV-3 (and, later, the RV-4) also contained a speaker.|$|R
50|$|The {{best example}} {{here is an}} analog radio <b>tuning</b> <b>dial</b> where one may make precise tuning {{movements}} both forwards and backwards. Specialized gear designs allow this. One of the more common designs splits the gear into two gears, each half {{the thickness of the}} original. One half of the gear is fixed to its shaft while {{the other half of the}} gear is allowed to turn on the shaft, but pre-loaded in rotation by small coil springs that rotate the free gear relative to the fixed gear. In this way, the spring tension rotates the free gear until all of the backlash in the system has been taken out; the teeth of the fixed gear press against one side of the teeth of the pinion while the teeth of the free gear press against the other side of the teeth on the pinion. Loads smaller than the force of the springs do not compress the springs and with no gaps between the teeth to be taken up, backlash is eliminated.|$|E
5000|$|Early ICBMs and bombers were {{relatively}} inaccurate, {{which led to}} the concept of countervalue strikes — attacks directly on the enemy population, which would theoretically lead to a collapse of the enemy's will to fight. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union invested in extensive protected civilian infrastructure, such as large [...] "nuclear-proof" [...] bunkers and non-perishable food stores. By comparison, smaller scale civil defense programs were instituted in the United States starting in the 1950s, where schools and other public buildings had basements stocked with non-perishable food supplies, canned water, first aid, and dosimeter and Geiger counter radiation-measuring devices. Many of the locations were given [...] "Fallout shelter" [...] designation signs. CONELRAD radio information systems were adopted, whereby the commercial radio sector (later supplemented by the National Emergency Alarm Repeaters) would broadcast on two AM frequencies {{in the event of a}} Civil Defense (CD) emergency. These two frequencies, 640 and 1240 kHz, were marked with small CD triangles on the <b>tuning</b> <b>dial</b> of radios of the period, as can still be seen on 1950s-vintage radios on online auction sites and museums. A few backyard fallout shelters were built by private individuals.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This thesis, {{submitted}} for completion for the Masters of Fine Arts in Creative Writing, is a manuscript of poems entitled Radio Spring. The collection reckons with distance. The poems move through a domestic landscape, observing the ecstasy and despairs {{of a variety}} of relationships within a widespread community. Through subjective, sensual experience, the distinct movements of the collection explore the process of separation, lamenting loss, and the process of acclimation to the limits of distance. In the final movement the poems reach an acceptance that the members of any relationship must remain individual and that there is joy in this separation. The collection tries to learn from the liminal space between together and apart, between refusal and acceptance. Together, the poems argue that balance is not a condition but an unending process of adaptation, a constant shifting, a dance. The manuscript tends toward equilibrium, seeking balance in distance. Khalil Gibran’s frequently-invoked “On Marriage” insists that those in love “stand together yet not too near together: / For the pillars of the temple stand apart”. Radio Spring explores the difficulty of complying with that demand. With motifs of horticulture and the body, coupled with attention to the melodic composition of the poems, I hope the collection plays like a radio placed in a backyard garden. The pieces are stylistically and tonally varied and have no shortage of garden flowers: I hope moving from poem to poem feels like adjusting the <b>tuning</b> <b>dial</b> and listening to a new song play over the fragrances of the blooms...|$|E
