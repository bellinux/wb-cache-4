5|$|Situated {{between the}} incus {{and the inner}} ear, the stapes transmits sound {{vibrations}} from the incus to the oval window, a membrane-covered opening to the inner ear. The stapes is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle, which is innervated by <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E
50|$|Heerfordt syndrome, also {{referred}} to as uveoparotid fever, Heerfordt-Mylius syndrome, Heerfordt-Waldenström syndrome, and Waldenström's uveoparotitis, is a rare manifestation of sarcoidosis. The symptoms include inflammation of the eye (uveitis), swelling of the parotid gland, chronic fever, and in some cases, palsy of <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Treatment is {{symptomatic}} and {{may include}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids to reduce swelling, antibiotics and immunosuppressants. Surgery may be indicated to relieve pressure on <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerves</b> and reduce swelling, but its efficacy is uncertain.

However, <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> can be reconstructed. When <b>the</b> proximal <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> stump is not available, a donor nerve, like the hypoglossus, can be used to neurotise <b>the</b> distal <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> stump.

5|$|The {{adverse effects}} of {{long-term}} linezolid therapy were first identified during postmarketing surveillance. Bone marrow suppression was not identified during Phase III trials, in which treatment did not exceed 21 days. Although some participants of early trials did experience thrombocytopenia, it {{was found to be}} reversible and did not occur significantly more frequently than in controls (participants not taking linezolid). There have also been postmarketing reports of seizures, and, , a single case each of Bell's palsy (paralysis of <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve)</b> and kidney toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Two sets {{of muscles}} are {{associated}} with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna. In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve,</b> which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, {{as well as to the}} external ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. <b>The</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E

30|$|Since Scaramella’s {{report in}} 1971, cross-facial nerve graft has been {{considered}} the treatment of choice for patients with <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> damage at <b>the</b> proximal stump level [2, 3]. Traditionally, long skin incisions and wide dissections were required for skin flap elevation and to locate specific branches of <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerves</b> in this technique. In our cases, however, a cross-facial nerve graft was successfully performed via an intraoral mucosal incision and dissection without wide elevation of <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> skin. This per-oral approach was advantageous over the conventional extraoral approaches for several reasons.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{complication}} can be bleeding which usually requires {{a return to}} the operating room. Less common, but potentially serious, complications may include damage to <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerves</b> and necrosis of the skin flaps or infection. Although <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> plastic surgeon attempts to prevent and minimise the risk of complications, a rhytidectomy can have complications.

25|$|After {{surgical}} trauma, {{the muscles}} of mastication can become reinnervated by <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> {{as opposed to the}} trigeminal nerve. This causes weakness in voluntary chewing; also, facial movements such as blinking cause the muscles to contract.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} {{that as a result}} of {{inflammation}} of <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve,</b> pressure is produced on the nerve where it exits the skull within its bony canal (the stylomastoid foramen), blocking the transmission of neural signals or damaging the nerve. Patients with facial palsy for which an underlying cause can be found are not considered to have Bell's palsy per se. Possible causes include tumor, meningitis, stroke, diabetes mellitus, head trauma and inflammatory diseases of the cranial nerves (sarcoidosis, brucellosis, etc.). In these conditions, the neurologic findings are rarely restricted to <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve.</b> Babies can be born with facial palsy. In a few cases, bilateral facial palsy has been associated with acute HIV infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{aberrant}} {{nerve regeneration}} hypothesis {{is the most}} widely accepted mechanism for synkinesis. The hypothesis states that, after trauma, axons project from the facial nucleus to incorrect peripheral muscle groups.

Results: A 5 -year-old male was referred to the otolaryngology clinic for evaluation of recurrent acute otitis media and hearing loss. He also developed recurrent left peripheral FN palsy associated with episodes of bilateral acute otitis media. High resolution computed tomography of the temporal bones revealed incomplete bony coverage of the tympanic segment of <b>the</b> left <b>facial</b> <b>nerve.</b> Conclusions: Recurrent peripheral FN palsy may occur in children with recurrent acute otitis media {{in the presence of a}} dehiscent <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> canal. <b>Facial</b> <b>nerve</b> canal dehiscence should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children with recurrent peripheral FN palsy...|$|R
50|$|Symptoms {{result from}} the {{functional}} loss of several anatomical structures of the pons, including the sixth and seventh cranial nerves and fibers of the corticospinal tract. Paralysis of the abducens (CN VI) leads to diplopia, internal strabismus (i.e., esotropia), and loss of power to rotate the affected eye outward), and disruption of <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerves</b> (CN VII) leads to symptoms including flaccid paralysis of <b>the</b> muscles of <b>facial</b> expression and loss of the corneal reflex. Disruption of the corticospinal tract leads to contralateral hemiplegia of the extremities.|$|R
50|$|Nerve fibres of the {{parasympathetic}} {{nervous system}} arise from the central nervous system. Specific nerves include several cranial nerves, specifically <b>the</b> oculomotor <b>nerve,</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve,</b> glossopharyngeal nerve, and vagus nerve.
