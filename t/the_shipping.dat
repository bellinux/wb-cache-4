5|$|A new route was {{launched}} by Bømlo Mayor Malvin Meling, who proposed a pontoon bridge which would cross Stokksundet. He {{was inspired by}} the plans to build what would become the Nordhordland Bridge north of Bergen. In 1973, the municipal councils of Bømlo, Stord and Fitjar decided to launch a planning process, which concluded that a pontoon bridge between Sørstokken and Foldrøyholmen would be optimal. The report also considered bridges across the Fitjar Archipelago and a crossing via Spissøy and Føyno. There were protests from Wichmann Motorfabrikk who were concerned about their operations if the sound was closed for shipping traffic. Similar protests also came from <b>the</b> <b>shipping</b> industry, who wished to continue using Stokksundet; the protests were not remedied by the plans including a suspension bridge across Foldrøysundet. To illustrate their point, one shipowner let two of his ships cross in the middle of Foldrøysundet. <b>The</b> <b>shipping</b> industry received support from Norwegian Coastal Administration and the plans were abandoned in 1974.|$|E

5|$|After her commissioning, Karlsruhe was {{assigned}} to overseas duties in the Caribbean. She arrived {{in the area in}} July 1914, days before the outbreak of World War I. Once the war began, she armed the passenger liner , but while the ships were transferring equipment, British ships located them and pursued Karlsruhe. Her superior speed allowed her to escape, after which she operated off the northeastern coast of Brazil. Here, she captured or sank sixteen ships. While en route to attack <b>the</b> <b>shipping</b> lanes to Barbados on 4 November 1914, a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship and killed the majority of the crew. The survivors used one of Karlsruhes colliers to return to Germany in December 1914.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{permission to}} do so, the Coast Guard boarded the KD II. The stench of decaying flesh quickly led them to a large quantity of shark fins. They were in bundles on the deck, <b>the</b> <b>shipping</b> container and filling most of the 40-ton (36-tonne) hold, where the ammonia odor {{was so strong that}} the Coast Guardsman who found them had to breathe through his mouth since it burned his nose. Since no corresponding carcasses could be found, the task force told the boarding party that this indicated a likely violation of the SFPA, and to consider the ship a crime scene as the fins were contraband.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the cotton {{industry}} was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was booming, as was poultry production, especially chicken. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>shipping</b> of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become {{an important part of the}} economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy plummeted. Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so <b>the</b> <b>shipping</b> industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.|$|E

50|$|Torpedo nets {{could be}} hung out from <b>the</b> {{defending}} <b>ship,</b> when moored or otherwise stationary in the water, on multiple horizontal booms.

A series of such booms was so fixed at intervals along each side of <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> was moored, <b>the</b> free ends of the booms could be swung out with the net hung on the outer ends, thus suspending the net at a distance from <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> equal to <b>the</b> length of the boom, all around <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> With <b>the</b> net mounted, a torpedo aimed at <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> would hit <b>the</b> mesh net and explode at a sufficient distance from the hull to prevent serious damage to <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|R
