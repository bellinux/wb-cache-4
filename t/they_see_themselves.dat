25|$|Self-verification theory {{predicts that}} when people {{interact}} with others, {{there is a general}} tendency for them to bring others to see them as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves.</b> This tendency is especially pronounced when they start out believing that the other person has misconstrued them, apparently because people compensate by working especially hard to bring others to confirm their self-views. People will even stop working on tasks to which they have been assigned if they sense that their performance is eliciting non-verifying feedback.|$|E

25|$|Many working mathematicians {{have been}} {{mathematical}} realists; <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as discoverers of naturally occurring objects. Examples include Paul Erdős and Kurt Gödel. Gödel believed in an objective mathematical reality {{that could be}} perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (e.g., for any two objects, there {{is a collection of}} objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but the continuum hypothesis conjecture might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. Gödel suggested that quasi-empirical methodology could be used to provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture.|$|E
25|$|The extreme {{reaction}} to Mr Bigley's murder is {{fed by the}} fact that he was a Liverpudlian. Liverpool is a handsome city with a tribal sense of community. A combination of economic misfortune—its docks were, fundamentally, on the wrong side of England when Britain entered what is now the European Union—and an excessive predilection for welfarism have created a peculiar, and deeply unattractive, psyche among many Liverpudlians. <b>They</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> whenever possible as victims, and resent their victim status; yet at the same time they wallow in it. Part of this flawed psychological state is that they cannot accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes, but seek rather to blame someone else for it, thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance against the rest of society. The deaths of more than 50 Liverpool football supporters at Hillsborough in 1989 was undeniably a greater tragedy than the single death, however horrible, of Mr Bigley; but that is no excuse for Liverpool's failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon. The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the Sun newspaper a whipping-boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, to hint at the wider causes of the incident.|$|E
25|$|Some Xing Yi {{practitioners}} {{also use}} the five elements as an interpretative framework for reacting and responding to attacks. This follows the five element theory, a general combat formula which assumes two types of cyclic interactions and three types of adverse interactions. The two cyclic interactions are the mutual nourishment (constructive) and mutual restraint (destructive) cycles. The adverse reactions are lesser known and rarely trained but exist from the understanding that nothing would exist if the mutual nourishment and restraint cycles existed alone, the adverse reactions are mutual over-restraint (overwhelming destructive interation), mutual reverse restraint (reversal of the destructive cycle), and mutual burdening (unbalancing or reversal of the constructive cycle). Practitioners abiding by these concepts train to react to and execute specific techniques {{in such a way}} that a desirable cycle will form based on these interactions of the five element theory. Where to aim, where to hit and with what technique—and how those motions should work defensively, is determined by what point of which cycle <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> in. Each of the elements has many variant applications that allow it to be used to defend against all of the elements (including itself), so any set sequences are ultimately entirely arbitrary in real combat but present a frame work for developing a more practical skill, the destructive cycle is often taught to 'beginners' as it is generally easier to visualize and consists of easier applications.|$|E

Shakespeare displayed characters as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as well as how others see them, and showed the effects each has on the others. Shakespeare's characters were so distinctive that it is as if each were expressed by a distinct [...] "faculty" [...] of his mind; and, in effect, these faculties could be considered as showing [...] "excessive sociability", notable for [...] "how they gossiped and compared notes together."

2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{expanded to}} include renewed harassment of prominent feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian, who had previously been a target of online harassment {{due in part to}} her YouTube video series Tropes vs. Women in Video Games, which analyzes sexist stereotypes in video games.

After a new episode of Tropes vs. Women was released on August 24, 2014, Sarkeesian received rape and death threats, and private information including her home address was leaked; she was compelled to flee her home. At the XOXO arts and technology conference in Portland, Oregon, she said, in regard to the accusations that high-profile women were making up the threats against them, that [...] "one of the most radical things you can do is to actually believe women when they talk about their experiences".

2500|$|While Tyler herself {{does not}} {{like to think of}} her novels in terms of themes, {{numerous}} reviewers and scholars have noted the importance of family and marriage relationships to her characters and stories. Liesl Schillinger summarized: “Taken together, the distinct but overlapping worlds of her novels have formed a Sensurround literary record of the 20th century American family—or, at least, of the proud but troubled archetypal families that…interested her most." [...] Michiko Kakutani, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for The New York Times, has been reviewing Tyler novels for over 25 years. [...] She has frequently noted Tyler’s themes with regard to family and marriage. [...] Reviewing Noah's Compass, Kakutani states that “the central concern of most of this author’s characters has always been their need to define themselves in terms of family — the degree to which <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as creatures shaped by genetics, childhood memories and parental and spousal expectations, {{and the degree to which}} they are driven to embrace independent identities of their own.”.
