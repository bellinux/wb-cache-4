It ran on Canadian National track from near the Du Collège metro station to Repentigny with an intermediate station near the Sauvé Metro station. Two trips ran each way in each weekday rush hour. There was no direct service to central Montreal. As there was no existing regional <b>transit</b> <b>coordinator</b> at the time, the line was never very successful.|$|E

40|$|The New Jersey Transit Villages Initiative {{demonstrates}} {{a new role}} for state planning in the United States, one that is more European-like in nature. In an attempt to promote mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented, dense developments around transit stations in New Jersey — transit-oriented developments — the planning process {{has proven to be}} innovative and not typically American. This paper presents an overview of the Initiative and a summary of its evaluation conducted by the authors as part of a project at the Voorhees Transportation Policy Institute at Rutgers University. We conclude that the Transit Villages program in New Jersey is a good model of smart growth, which stems from active planning and intergovernmental cooperation on land use and transportation issues.

5000|$|Hochstein {{encouraged}} European {{countries to}} find new oil, gas, coal, and nuclear sources, to alleviate their dependence on Russian energy. In response to President Vladimir Putins plans for new gas pipelines to bypass an existing <b>transit</b> <b>coordinator</b> through Ukraine towards Greece and Italy, Hochstein described the plans as [...] "political projects that have questionable economic value" [...] to the European energy market. He has also stated that the U.S.s position isnt to exclude Russia from the European market entirely, but rather that Russia should be an equal player, remarking that [...] "European countries {{should be able to}} choose their supplier and force their suppliers to compete for their business. That is what is good for energy security of Europe, economic security and ultimately for the national security of those countries involved." ...|$|E
