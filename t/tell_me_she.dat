500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E

2500|$|Merkerson {{has often}} been reticent about {{revealing}} what her first name really was (Sharon). On the June 11, 2005, episode of NPR's Wait Wait... Don't <b>Tell</b> <b>Me!,</b> <b>she</b> jokingly claimed that the initial [...] "S," [...] "stands for 'Sweet' [...] {{so many people have}} difficulty with Epatha, which is what I prefer to be called". She has legally changed her first name to S. During a segment on the January 31, 2012, episode of The Wendy Williams Show, when questioned about the origin of her name, Merkerson shared that [...] "Epatha" [...] was the name of [...] "a grade-school teacher who was influential in keeping [...] in school." [...] She further went on to clarify that she prefers to be addressed as [...] "Epatha" [...] as opposed to [...] "S. Epatha." [...] But in an interview in 2013 for the Archive of American Television, Merkerson confirmed that the [...] "S" [...] stood for Sharon, adding that [...] "some knucklehead" [...] she had gone to high school with started telling people what the [...] "S" [...] stood for.|$|E

6000|$|... “I don’t {{think he}} knows her. She knows him—which is very different. When I ask him about her he merely <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>she’s</b> fascinating. She is fascinating,” said her ladyship with inimitable dryness.|$|R
6000|$|Countess. My sister <b>tells</b> <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> {{was more}} {{collected}} [...] After her {{conversation with the}} Swede. [...] She has now retired to rest.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And my sister,'--added Nicholas. 'Is {{she still}} {{engaged in the}} {{business}} which she wrote to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> thought she should like so much?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll hold any man fifty pounds,' said Sir Mulberry, 'that Miss Nickleby can't look in my face, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> wasn't {{thinking}} so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{difference}} does that make?" [...] Janet retorted. [...] "And you can't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> didn't {{know what she}} was up to all along--with that face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The divine Queen did not <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> Pharaoh," [...] {{answered}} Asti stubbornly, [...] "but my own skill <b>tells</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> is Merytra, your favourite, and {{the magician}} is Kaku, whom she visited last night." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No. Mr. Poyser <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> was {{not come}} when he left. They're afraid the letter has not reached her. It seems {{they had no}} exact address." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What--what did {{she come}} here for? Do {{you mean to}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> thinks I took the money?" [...] he said, huskily, after a long pause.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{must have}} been forever grateful," [...] Paula challenged, her eyes {{directly}} on Graham's. [...] "Don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> wasn't young, wasn't beautiful, wasn't a golden brown young goddess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her acting was {{no great}} things, they say-—ladylike, but frightened. Her voice is lovely, and as to her looks-—people rave about them. <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> is not Lady Travis Underwood's daughter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but Phyllis <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> has burst forth into liberty, bicycles, {{and wild}} doings that would drive {{her parents to}} {{distraction}} if she dreamt of them." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, yes, {{it was her}} doing. <b>She</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> doesn't mean to come to Egypt so much as in {{the past}} and wants her brother nearer to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Princess," [...] he said, [...] "you did not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> was so very farouche, so {{very shy}} indeed. I {{speak to her}} quite kindly, and <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> does not like <b>me,</b> and that <b>she</b> wished <b>me</b> to go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is what I'D like to know," [...] said Peter. [...] "How did Peg Bowen know {{my father}} was coming home? Don't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> isn't a witch after that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come right in," [...] he said. [...] "Barbara <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> has met you, but you haven't seen Mrs. Devine. Mr. Brooke, who is {{building}} the new flume for me, Katty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but miserable. I {{want to see}} Nell. Dave <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> is {{not exactly}} ill, but {{something}} is wrong with her. Perhaps I ought not to see her just yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she's</b> so nice," [...] she said. [...] "No nice {{unencumbered}} woman lies in bed after half-past seven. Which is {{the very}} shortest way? No, Ann, we can't take you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Pshaw! That's missish nonsense, Mary, and {{you know}} it. If a girl were to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> fell in love because she couldn't help it, I should {{tell her that she}} wasn't worth any man's love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{promise is}} a promise, Mr. Holmes. If Elsie wished to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> would. If not, {{it is not}} for me to force her confidence. But I am {{justified}} in taking my own line--and I will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't know. Live on my money, I suppose, {{and on that}} of my {{respected}} aunt {{after her}} lamented decease which, although I see no signs of it, <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> considers imminent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, the over-particular girls {{generally}} get left, I notice. And what's this I {{hear about}} Gilbert Blythe being engaged to a Miss Stuart? Charlie Sloane <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> is perfectly beautiful. Is it true?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “She <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> never {{leaves her}} room till noon,” he heard Lady Demesne {{say to the}} General, her {{companion}} of the previous evening, who had asked about her. “She takes three hours to dress.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Honor {{undertook}} {{for her own}} {{taste for}} the kind of thing, and her ladyship continued, 'Yes, you must find it uncommonly dull to be so much alone. Where did Juliana <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had heard of Lucy Sandbrook?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How she trembled {{when she}} began to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> knew it!' thought Tom, recalling all the little {{incidents}} and circumstances; 'and how her face flushed! But that was natural! Oh, quite natural! That needs no accounting for.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{what do you}} mean?" [...] {{asked the}} don, his face {{suddenly}} growing grave, while his voice had not yet lost its humorous tone. [...] "She has not eloped? You don't mean to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> has run away from you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expect the}} fact is, you haven't time," [...] he said; [...] "You're always about with June. I expect you're useful {{to her with}} her young man, chaperoning, and one thing and another. They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she's</b> never at home now; your Uncle Jolyon he doesn't like it, I fancy, being left so much alone as he is. They <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>she's</b> always hanging about for this young Bosinney; I suppose he comes here every day. Now, {{what do you think}} of him? D'you think he knows his own mind? He seems to me a poor thing. I should say the grey mare was the better horse!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to go}} to the Hall Farm too," [...] said Mr. Irwine, [...] "to {{have another}} look at the little Methodist who is staying there. Joshua <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> was preaching on the Green last night." ...|$|R
