Think of Him who, in His utter love to us, endured the cross, despising the shame. And what a cross! Truly said the prophet, [...] "His visage was marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men:" [...] in hunger and thirst, in tears and sighs, bruised and bleeding, His {{forehead}} crowned with thorns, His sides torn with scourges, His hands and feet gored with nails, His limbs stretched from their sockets, naked upon the shameful cross, the Son of God hung, lingering slowly towards the last gasp, {{in the death of}} the felon and the slave! The most shameful sight that this earth ever saw, and yet the most glorious sight. The most shameful sight, at which the sun in heaven veiled his face, as if ashamed, and the skies grew black, as if to hide those bleeding limbs from the foul eyes of men; and yet the noblest sight, for in that death upon the cross shone out <b>the</b> utter <b>fullness</b> <b>of</b> all holiness, <b>the</b> utter <b>fullness</b> <b>of</b> all fortitude, <b>the</b> utter <b>fullness</b> <b>of</b> that self- sacrificing love, which had said, [...] "The Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost;" [...] <b>the</b> utter <b>fullness</b> <b>of</b> obedient patience, which could say, [...] "Father, not My will but Thine be done;" [...] <b>the</b> utter <b>fullness</b> <b>of</b> generous forgiveness, which could pray, [...] "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do;" [...] <b>the</b> utter <b>fullness</b> <b>of</b> noble fortitude and endurance, which could say at the very moment when a fearful death stared Him in the face, [...] "Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to the Father, and He will send me at once more than twelve armies of angels?

25|$|The Church {{teaches that}} God {{revealed}} himself gradually, {{beginning in the}} Old Testament, and completing this revelation by sending his son, Jesus Christ, to Earth as a man. This revelation started with Adam and Eve, and was not broken off by their original sin; rather, God promised to send a redeemer. God further revealed himself through covenants between Noah and Abraham. God delivered the law to Moses on Mount Sinai, and spoke through the Old Testament prophets. <b>The</b> <b>fullness</b> <b>of</b> God's revelation was made manifest through {{the coming of the}} Son of God, Jesus Christ.|$|E

25|$|Up {{through at}} least the 1970s, most types of popular music used bowed string sections. They were {{extensively}} used in popular music throughout the 1920s and early 1930s. With the rise of swing music, however, from 1935 to 1945, the string sound was often used to add to <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> <b>of</b> big band music. Following the swing era, from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s, strings began to be revived in traditional pop music. This trend accelerated in the late 1960s, with a significant revival {{of the use of}} strings, especially in soul music. Popular Motown recordings of the late 1960s and 1970s relied heavily on strings as part of their trademark texture. The rise of disco music in the 1970s continued this trend with the heavy use of string instruments in popular disco orchestras (e.g., Love Unlimited Orchestra, Biddu Orchestra, Monster Orchestra, Salsoul Orchestra, MFSB).|$|E

25|$|The Orthodox believe {{themselves}} to be the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church; that is, the true Church established by Jesus Christ and placed into {{the care of the}} apostles. As almost all other Christian groups are in indirect schism with the Orthodox Church, mostly {{as a result of the}} Great Schism with the Roman Catholic Church at the turn of the second Christian millennium (before the schisms of the Protestant Reformation), these other groups are viewed as being Christian, but who, to varying degrees, lack full theological orthodoxy and orthopraxy. As such, all groups outside of the Orthodox Church are not seen as being members of the Church proper, but rather separated brethren who have failed to retain <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> <b>of</b> the Christian faith and theology. These deviations from orthodoxy have traditionally been called heresy, but due to the term's perceived pejorative connotations, some prefer the more technical designation of the term heterodoxy.|$|E
25|$|In Roman Catholic theology, the {{doctrine}} of apostolic succession states that Christ gave the full sacramental authority {{of the church to}} the Twelve Apostles in the sacrament of Holy Orders, making them the first bishops. By conferring <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> <b>of</b> the sacrament of Holy Orders on the apostles, they were given the authority to confer the sacrament of Holy Orders on others, thus consecrating more bishops in a direct lineage that can trace its origin back to the Twelve Apostles and Christ himself. This direct succession of bishops from the apostles to the present day bishops is referred to as apostolic succession. The Roman Catholic Church also holds that within the College of Apostles, Peter was picked out for the unique role of leadership and to serve as the source of unity among the apostles, a role among the bishops and within the church inherited by the pope as Peter's successor today.|$|E
25|$|The Madhyamakālaṃkāra is an eighth-century Buddhist text, {{believed}} to have been originally composed in Sanskrit by Śāntarakṣita (725–788), Though somewhat lyrical, it is a summary and a key to his encyclopedic Tattvasamgraha. It has <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> <b>of</b> the Sutrayana and Mahayana traditions' development in its place of origin before the Buddhist tradition of India was transposed by the cultures of the Far East (such as China and Japan) and elsewhere (such as Ceylon and Kashmir), where Buddhism was already flourishing in culturally specific forms. The text refutes challenges of Buddhist systems and tenets from within the tradition, and is a pedagogical discourse {{on the development of the}} yana; the philosophical challenges posed by the non-Buddhist religions and non-Dharmic traditions of India, and crystallizes a dialectical sophistication of Indian logic and the clarity of debate expected of a Khenpo of Nalanda Vihara. The text was seminal in the tradition of Samye which became known as a Nyingma institution in contrast to the emergent Sarma traditions of Atisha's (980-1054) translation phase. It documents the Nyingma view of the Two Truths, making it a canonical work. Although the text was marginalized due to the rise of the Prasaṅgika subschool of Mādhyamaka, it was revived by Ju Mipham's (1846–1912) 1876 Commentary.|$|E
50|$|Pseudo-goitre is <b>the</b> {{apparent}} <b>fullness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{front part}} of the neck. It may be mistakenly diagnosed as thyroid enlargement. The cause for pseudogoitre can be fat tissue of the neck, cervical lordosis, cervical masses (such as cervical lymphadenopathy, branchial cleft cyst, pharyngeal diverticulum) or high lying thyroid or trachea. Pseudogoitre due to cervical lordosis (swan shaped-neck) is called Modigliani syndrome after the artist Amedeo Modigliani, who was famous for painting women with exaggerated curved neck. Pseudogoitre can be distinguished from other disease conditions of the neck by physical examination. Normal thyroid moves up with swallowing, and any structure attached to the thyroid such as a true goitre, also moves along with thyroid. A pseudogoitre is unlikely if <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>fullness</b> moves with swallowing. If pseudogoitre is due to cervical lordosis, <b>the</b> <b>fullness</b> disappears on straightening of the neck. A high-lying thyroid can be excluded by palpation. If the diagnosis is uncertain after clinical examination, an ultrasonogram is taken to rule out pathology of the neck.|$|R
