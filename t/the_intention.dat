50|$|An {{example of}} this can be seen in {{identifying}} <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> of specific behaviors. We as a society also operate in that way because the same outcome or behavior can be considered acceptable had <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> for it been good versus another time where <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> were bad and in that case it would be unacceptable. In a situation where a child is trying to help their parent clean and misplaces something accidentally, it is easily forgiven and is considered morally acceptable because his/her intentions were good. However, if the child purposely hid the object so their parent would not find it, it is morally unacceptable because <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> were bad. Ultimately, it is the same situation and same outcome but <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> are different. At the age of 10-11 years children realize this concept and start justifying their actions and behaviors by weighing their intentions.|$|R
