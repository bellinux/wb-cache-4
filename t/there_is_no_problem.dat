Quatermass leaves the inquiry, then returns with Fowler to find that Broadhead has been 'marked' and now claims <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with the project. Fowler takes Quatermass to meet with civil servant Rupert Ward, who {{has the authority to}} inspect the plant. Back at the Rocket Group, Leo and Paula deduce and discover with a radio telescope that an asteroid is orbiting the Earth invisibly and discharging the meteorites when it reaches the near point, 400 000 miles over Southern England every 14 hours.|$|E

25|$|The ball {{travels in}} the air, {{and there is}} no net force upon it. To the {{stationary}} observer the ball follows a straight-line path, so <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> squaring this trajectory with zero net force. However, the rotating observer sees a curved path. Kinematics insists that a force (pushing {{to the right of the}} instantaneous direction of travel for a counter-clockwise rotation) must be present to cause this curvature, so the rotating observer is forced to invoke a combination of centrifugal and Coriolis forces to provide the net force required to cause the curved trajectory.|$|E
25|$|Under normal circumstances, a tiny {{amount of}} urobilinogen, if any, is {{excreted}} in the urine. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, {{some of the}} conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing {{an increase in the}} amount of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase in urine urobilinogen. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems.|$|E

2500|$|Devotions are prayers or pious {{exercises}} used {{to demonstrate}} reverence {{for a particular}} aspect of God or the person of Jesus, or for a particular saint. Catholic devotions have various forms, ranging from formalized prayers such as novenas to activities which do not involve any prayers, such as Eucharistic adoration, the veneration of the saints, and even horticultural practices such as maintaining a Mary garden. Common examples of Catholic devotions include the Rosary, the Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Holy Face of Jesus, the Immaculate Heart of Mary, and the veneration of various saints, etc. The Congregation for Divine Worship at the Vatican publishes a Directory of devotions and pious practices. The Rosary is a devotion for the meditation of the mysteries of joy, of sorrow and the glory of Jesus and Mary.Sister Lucia dos Santos said:"The Most Holy Virgin in these last times {{in which we live}} has given a new efficacy to the recitation of the Rosary {{to such an extent that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem,</b> no matter how difficult it is, whether temporal or above all spiritual, in the personal life of each one of us, of our families...that cannot be solved by the Rosary. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem,</b> I tell you, no matter how difficult it is, that we cannot resolve by the prayer of the Holy Rosary." ...|$|E
