40|$|In November 2008 the Spanish {{government}} authorized a <b>voluntary</b> <b>return</b> {{program for}} foreign workers {{in order to}} decrease unemployment pressures {{in the wake of}} 2008 / 09 financial crisis. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>return</b> programs are not new.

This paper analyzes the Spanish <b>voluntary</b> <b>return</b> program against the background of lessons provided by the thirty years long experience with similar programs in France.

5000|$|There is {{a related}} process called <b>voluntary</b> <b>return</b> or, in more formal parlance, {{administrative}} voluntary departure. This {{refers to a}} case where an alien is stopped from entering at a land border (by United States Border Patrol) and agrees to voluntarily return instead of undergoing expedited removal. A key difference between voluntary departure and <b>voluntary</b> <b>return</b> {{is that in the}} case of <b>voluntary</b> <b>return,</b> the alien never enters the United States, and therefore accrues no unlawful presence. The time between the alien arriving at the port and agreeing to return voluntarily can vary between a few hours and a few days, and throughout that duration the alien is under the supervision of either U.S. Customs and Border Protection or the carrier. Nonetheless, a number of commentators use the term <b>voluntary</b> <b>return</b> to refer to both voluntary departure and <b>voluntary</b> <b>return.</b> To add to the confusion, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses the term [...] "return" [...] when reporting the number of voluntary departures.|$|R

50|$|The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) offers Assisted <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Return</b> and Reintegration (AVRR) to {{migrants}} whose {{application for}} asylum was rejected or withdrawn, stranded migrants, victims of trafficking, and other vulnerable groups, such as unaccompanied children, or those with health-related needs.|$|R

25|$|Twenty-five of the 34 cases {{listed in}} the {{previous}} Compliance Report have been closed, with approximately one-third resulting in {{the return of the}} children to the United States. There have been ten Hague court hearings since Fall 1999, with all children except one returned to the U.S. In one case, children were returned to the United States only six months after the abduction. In addition, there have been <b>voluntary</b> <b>returns</b> in more than 30 cases, with the existence of a pending Hague case a factor in the <b>voluntary</b> <b>return</b> decision. Once a child has been located, the taking parent must be notified of the hearing date. Mexico’s new procedure of taking children into custody at that time has been very effective in ensuring that the taking parent does not go into hiding with the children.|$|R
