5|$|In {{his second}} {{meeting of the}} day with Scully and Doggett, Wells {{explains}} that he cannot remember the last few days. Scully suggests <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> did do it. Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a nanny cam from his house reveals that {{the only person to}} arrive between the police’s arrival and the last time his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|E
25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E
500|$|Jesus reveals He goes to Earth every 100 {{years or}} so {{to check on the}} world, and since His Father had become highly {{irritable}} after giving up smoking, He needed some time away. He and Peter become friends, and Peter invites Him to dinner, along with Brian. Brian asks Jesus for proof He is Jesus Christ, so Jesus proves He is, by turning everyone's dinner into sundaes and, on Peter's request, makes Lois' breasts enlarge to massive proportions. Peter convinces Him to make his second coming public. Jesus walks on water to retrieve a dollar bill that blew out of Peter's hand. Consequently, He becomes famous and makes celebrity appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and the MTV Movie Awards. He begins to neglect His friendship with Peter, due to Him now being popular. The next day, Peter watches the news, where Tom Tucker reports that Jesus was found in Mary-Kate Olsen's apartment that morning face down and unconscious. Tom reports that police have revived and arrested the disoriented Jesus, who quoted [...] "Jews are responsible for all the world's wars". Jesus is arrested for His illegal prank and is sent to jail. Peter is asked by Jesus to bail Him out. Now in disrepute, Jesus decides <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>He</b> was not mature enough to return to the world yet and bids farewell to the family. Before He leaves this world, Jesus gives Peter a present, another record of [...] "Surfin' Bird", and it ends with Stewie groaning in genuine rage when Peter begins annoying his family with the song again.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, Chris Van Allsburg visited Wenders' office, and Wenders {{showed him}} Burdick's drawings. Van Allsburg decided <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> if <b>he</b> {{published}} the drawings, {{they may find}} out who Harris Burdick was.|$|R

However, this isn't really confirmed by other canon sources, and this theory came only from the voice of the character Courtney, who was a self-proclaimed [...] "Michael-worshipper".|$|R
500|$|The {{miscarriage}} leaves Steffy devastated and {{she decides}} to leave town, ending her marriage to Liam. Wood noted that [...] "Steffy was so set on she really messed this up" [...] and noticed that Liam still had feelings for Hope. Speaking of the miscarriage {{and the end of}} Liam and Steffy's marriage, Wood explained: [...] "She is obviously trying a reason to get out of it. In her heart and soul, she wants to be with him. She felt he was her soulmate, but with everything that has happened, she feels it was her fault and she can't change that. She should never have gotten on that motorcycle and he told her not to. There have been so many things that happened that it opens her eyes to the possibility <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> should be with Hope." [...] Upon Steffy's brief return to the show in 2015, she realizes that she still loves Liam, despite believing that these feelings were gone. Wood explained [...] "They lost a child together, so they’ll always have that emotional connection." [...] Despite liking the fact that Steffy [...] "speaks up" [...] and [...] "fights for love", Wood said that she wanted [...] "to see someone come in and sweep her off her feet and take that pain away", not wanting her to fight for [...] "a man that flip flops". However, Liam is involved with Steffy's cousin Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy does not win him back. Wood noted that [...] "in Steffy's mind, Ivy is just some new woman in town and Liam is fair game. He and Ivy have no history." [...] Eventually Liam breaks up with Ivy and after Steffy's marriage to Wyatt breaks down, Steffy and Liam rekindle their love and romance and they marry each other again for the third time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Menzel {{said that}} Arnold may have merely seen spots {{of water on}} his airplane's windows; Maccabee says that this contradicts Arnold's {{testimony}} that he had specifically ruled out water spots or reflections shortly after seeing the nine UFOs. For example, the early Bill Bequette article of June 26 in the East Oregonian has Arnold saying he at first thought <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was seeing reflections off his window, but [...] "he still saw the objects after rolling it down." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Faugheen's career took a major turn as {{just before}} the start of the Punchestown festival in late April 2014, his stablemate Vautour [...] "failed a late fitness test" [...] {{according}} to Mullins, that made them switch targets during that week with Faugheen running instead in the early Tuesday's race Herald Champion Novice Hurdle which was over the 2 miles trip. In the race he was against a couple of Vautour's former rivals of which Faugheen [...] "made light work" [...] and made Mullins to reconsider his future prospect: [...] "You'd have to consider staying hurdling with him next season. Looking at him beforehand, I thought he was a chaser, but there's no harm in having another good hurdler and that would certainly make you think <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> should stay at this game".|$|E
50|$|It {{reminded}} me of Alanis Morissette's 'Ironic' video, where she's got her and her two other egos in the car...I think it was him living in the now as a person going through it and him living {{as a person who}} is witnessing it and can make other choices to not be in <b>that</b> scenario. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> would've chose differently, so now he's watching himself.|$|R

I {{dare say}} I shall {{do as well}} as other folks there; and if I do go to the bottom, as seems likely, there's plenty of room for a respectable person there, I should hope. Look here, dear. You'll never be happy unless you marry Mr. Arthur; so don't you go and throw away a chance, just out of foolishness, and for fear of what folks say. That's how dozens of women make a mess of it. Folks say one thing to-day and another to-morrow, but you'll remain you for all <b>that.</b> <b>Maybe</b> <b>he's</b> married; and, if so, it's a bad business, and there's an end of it; but <b>maybe,</b> too, <b>he</b> isn't. As for that letter, as likely as not the other one will put it in the fire. I should, I doubt, if I were in her shoes. So don't you lose any time, for, if he isn't married, it's like enough he soon will be." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later {{on in the}} day, Christina {{tries to}} sort out a costume for the baby while Betty calls Daniel again. He's enjoying decorating her tree; {{it was just a}} photo {{opportunity}} in his family. He tells her that she should look after things; she always wants more responsibility. The designer then goes into a panic. He just received a photo of the baby and it's hideous. Betty says <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> not the right person for the job if he doesn't think he can find something beautiful in a baby. He tells her she should find someone who designs installations for the zoo and storms out. On the way out, he asks Sofia who she was. Sofia answers 'Today, she's the boss'. Sofia offers to help Betty, but Betty explains that Daniel's heart is broken and he's drunk himself sick. Amanda then walks in and announces that 'team Baby Chutney has arrived and is waiting.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Arnold flew {{on to an}} {{air show}} in Pendleton, Oregon, not knowing that {{somebody}} in Yakima had phoned in ahead to say that Arnold had seen some strange new aircraft. It was {{at this time that}} Arnold studied his maps, determined the distance between Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams, and calculated the rather astonishing speed. He told a number of pilot friends, and wrote in his account to AAF intelligence that they did not scoff or laugh. Instead they suggested <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> had seen guided missiles or something new, though Arnold felt this explanation to be inadequate. He also wrote that some former Army pilots told him that they had been briefed before going into combat [...] "that they might see objects of similar shape and design as I described and assured me that I wasn't dreaming or going crazy." [...] (See Foo fighter.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 1, 2010, Jackson, {{after giving}} it {{tremendous}} thought and consulting with his doctors over health concerns, {{announced that he}} would return to coach the Lakers for the 2010–11 season. On August 2, 2010, Jackson signed a new contract with the Lakers to return for what he mentioned was [...] "his last stand", meaning the 2010–11 season would be his last. In January 2011, he reiterated that it would be his final season, explaining that in the past there was the possibility <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would reconsider. [...] "This year, there's no maybe", said Jackson. He retired after the Lakers were swept out of the playoffs in the conference semifinals by that season's eventual NBA champions, the Dallas Mavericks, meaning that he would not get a fourth three-peat (after previously achieving that feat in 1993, 1998 and 2002). In his final news conference that season, he noted {{that he did not have}} much of a relationship with Jerry or Jim Buss, and said, [...] "When I leave here, I don't anticipate Lakers management will call me up and ask my advice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The last of McManaman's caps came in 2001 when Sven-Göran Eriksson {{utilised}} him for {{his first}} games in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, including a game back at Anfield against Finland – where McManaman set up David Beckham's winner– but then apparently {{left a message on}} McManaman's answering machine to inform him {{that he was not going}} to be in the final World Cup squad in early 2002. Despite the pleas of McManaman's Real Madrid team mates Zidane and Fernando Hierro for McManaman's case, McManaman said he never ever heard from or met Eriksson again. Zidane went on to state England had made a mistake, and described McManaman with a rare passion as one of the highest quality players he ever played with: [...] "I was surprised when McManaman was left out of the last England squad. I couldn't believe they would ignore a player of his quality. Now people are talking about the fact <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> will get his chance because David Beckham is injured. But McManaman is far better than just being a replacement for Beckham. McManaman should be in the starting line-up anyway." [...] Support for McManaman also came before the 2002 World Cup in the British media, after Sky Sports published an article based on OPTA statistics, revealing that despite a poor goalscoring record, McManaman had in fact an 88% dribbling completion rate (having embarked on a run every 17 minutes), and an 84% pass completion rate, all three of which were higher by over 15% than any English midfield Premiership player at the time.|$|E

50|$|H.D. Darby, a young {{undertaker}} {{who worked}} for the McClure Funeral Parlor in nearby Ruston, and Sophia Stone, a home demonstration agent also from Ruston, came to Arcadia to identify the bodies. They had been kidnapped by the Barrow gang the previous year in Ruston, on April 27, 1933, and released near Waldo, Arkansas. Parker reportedly had laughed when she asked Darby his profession and discovered he was an undertaker. She remarked <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> someday <b>he</b> would be working on her. Darby assisted Bailey in embalming the outlaws.|$|R
5000|$|Several days later, {{following}} the club's 2-0 victory over Volga Nizhny Novgorod, star striker Danko Lazović was tasered by police for giving his jersey to a fan in the crowd. [...] "I {{just went to}} give my jersey to the fans after the match, when a police officer appeared behind me and tasered {{me in the back}} with his electric shocker. I don't know why <b>that</b> happened. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>that</b> I was one of the fans," [...] explained Lazović on Zenit's official website, while the club itself vented its anger against the actions of the police.|$|R
60|$|It {{did just}} occur to him <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> {{had not made}} that descent quite as {{successfully}} as he had thought he had; <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> had come down on his head; that in consequence he had done with the experiences of Flight Commander Raffleton and was now about to enter on a new and less circumscribed existence. If so, the beginning, to an adventuresome young spirit, seemed promising. It was Malvina's voice that recalled him from this train of musing.|$|E

5000|$|Some critics {{took issue}} with added scenes that appear to imply Barbara Gordon was raped during the torture she {{suffered}} at the Joker's hands. Jamie Righetti of Film School Rejects writes, [...] "It's made even worse by a follow-up scene in which Batman is questioning a group of prostitutes about the whereabouts of The Joker. The girls tell Batman that The Joker normally comes to see them after he escapes custody and that he likes a good time ... But {{then one of the}} girls says that The Joker hasn't come to see them this time and <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> found a new girl instead. Let that sink in for a minute: Barbara is that new girl. Barbara, who has just been shot in the stomach and raped." [...] Bruce Timm has denied the implication, stating, [...] "I did not think of it as supporting that. If I had, I probably would have changed the line. I never, ever thought that he actually raped her. Even in my first read of the comic, I never thought that." [...] It {{is not the first time}} that Brian Azzarello has depicted the Joker as a rapist.|$|R
