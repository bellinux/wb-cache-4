You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E

Although Hamilton Finlay {{is considered one of}} the most important Scottish artists of the 20th century, Stoddart profoundly disagrees with his working methods: [...] "Finlay was the godfather of a problem that's rampant everywhere today. He called <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> his work 'collaborators'. What we call them nowadays is 'fabricators'. They're talented people who are plastically capable, but they never meet their 'artist'. They're grateful, desperate and thwarted." ...|$|E

During this season Wurtenburg made his most famous play: with Yale leading rival Harvard by a score of 11–8 late in the season's final contest, Wurtenburg made [...] "a brilliant run" [...] of 35 yards and scored a touchdown, which secured the game for Yale.

Salon.com named Fun Home the best nonfiction debut of 2006, admitting that they were fudging the definition of [...] "debut" [...] and saying, [...] "Fun Home shimmers with regret, compassion, annoyance, frustration, pity and love—usually all at the same time and never without a pervasive, deeply literary irony about the near-impossible task of staying true to yourself, and to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> you who you are." [...] Entertainment Weekly called it the best nonfiction book of the year, and Time named Fun Home the best book of 2006, describing it as [...] "the unlikeliest literary success of 2006" [...] and [...] "a masterpiece about two people who live in the same house but different worlds, and their mysterious debts to each other." ...|$|E

[...] Tim Karan of Alternative Press called The Black Parade [...] "MCR's whole raison d'etre rolled up into one mega-decibel calling card". Ed Thompson of IGN stated, [...] "The Black Parade is a rock and roll gem that celebrates everything that was over the top about the 1970s rock scene." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone praised the classic rock feel of the album. Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "On their third studio album, a musical H-bomb of an effort, the Jersey quintet combine the rock-opera pomp of Queen with the darker, dirtier tones of their screamo past: Call it a Bro-hemian Rhapsody. Even without its broad concept — a dying cancer patient seeks revenge and redemption — Parade stands {{as one of the most}} cohesive, engaging rock records of 2006." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention (...) and said, [...] "In prog, a good sense of humor means so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Laserblast has {{received}} largely negative reviews, and consistently {{ranks among the}} Bottom 100 list of films on the Internet Movie Database. A 1978 critique in The Review of the News said, [...] "The only thing eerie about Laserblast is the thought that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> this loser are still running around loose." [...] In the review, Laserblast was described as [...] "an incomprehensible blending" [...] of popular recent films like Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, with a script [...] "so disordered we could not be certain that the reels were being run in proper sequence". It also criticized the props, particularly the laser gun, which they compared to a cereal box prize. A review by Variety magazine said the special effects were decent, but the script [...] "has more holes than the laser-ravaged landscape." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times said Kim Milford's performance was dull and that the script included plot-holes and inconsistencies. The Los Angeles Times critic Linda Gross said the script lacked [...] "credibility, psychological motivation and narrative cohesiveness", although she praised Terry Bowen's cinematography, saying it [...] "effectively captures the ambience of desert small-town life." [...] It was described {{as one of the}} worst films {{of the year in the}} book, The Golden Turkey Awards.|$|E
