40|$|In {{order to}} compare solar-hydrogen {{and the most}} used fossil fuels, the {{evaluation}} of the “external” costs related to their use is required. These costs involve the environmental damage produced by the combustion reactions, the health problems caused by air pollution, the damage to land from fuel mining, and the environmental degradation linked to the global warming, the acid rains, and the water pollution. For each fuel, the global cost is determined as sum of the market price and of the correspondent external costs. In order to obtain a quantitative comparison, the quality of the different combustion reactions and the efficiency of the <b>technologies</b> <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> the specific application sector have to be considered adequately. At this purpose, an entropic index that considers the degree of irreversibility produced during the combustion process and the degradation of surroundings is introduced. Additionally, an environmental index that measures the pollutants released during the combustions is proposed. The combination of these indexes and the efficiency of the several <b>technologies</b> <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> four energy sectors have allowed {{the evaluation of the}} total costs, highlighting an economic scenario from which the real advantages concerning the exploitation of different energy carrier are determined...|$|R

30|$|Carbon-based {{pigments}} {{have been}} identified in archaeological artifacts [5], rock art [6], and in easel and wall paintings [1, 3, 4, 7]. In most cases, the pigment was assumed to be charcoal or simply “carbon black”, a term generally used to mean any pigment based on carbon [8]. As the precise identification of pigments is important for understanding the <b>technology</b> <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> the manufacture of an artwork as well as the resources available, an unambiguous characterization of carbon-based pigments remains a big challenge.|$|R
50|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war in}} Europe that same year further served {{as a catalyst for}} the creation of an American agency, as the <b>technology</b> <b>employed</b> <b>in</b> combat there emphasized the shortcomings of the American aviation program. In 1915, utilizing reports by American attachés and other observers, Brigadier General Scriven published a report on the new status of aviation in Europe. He noted that airplanes were not only used for information-gathering activities but also now conducted attacks on enemy personnel and material.|$|R

Also, with the proper synergistic design, individual green building technologies may work together to produce a greater cumulative effect.|$|R
