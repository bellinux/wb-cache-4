5|$|Vilhelm Moberg, in {{his history}} of the Swedish people, {{provides}} a thoughtful discussion of the atrocities which were committed by {{both sides in the}} struggle over the border provinces, and identified them as the source of propaganda to inflame the peoples' passions to continue the struggle. These lopsided representations were incorporated into history text books on the respective sides. As an example, Moberg compares the history texts he grew up with in Sweden which represented the Swedish soldier as ever pure and honorable to a letter written by Gustavus Adolphus celebrating the 24Scanian parishes he had helped level by fire, with the troops encouraged to rape and murder the population at will, behavior <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been mirrored equally on the Danish side.

25|$|Infants {{begin the}} process of {{language}} acquisition by being able to detect very small differences between speech sounds. They can discriminate all possible speech contrasts (phonemes). Gradually, as they are exposed to their native language, their perception becomes language-specific, i.e. they learn how to ignore the differences within phonemic categories of the language (differences <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> be contrastive in other languages – for example, English distinguishes two voicing categories of plosives, whereas Thai has three categories; infants must learn which differences are distinctive in their native language uses, and which are not). As infants learn how to sort incoming speech sounds into categories, ignoring irrelevant differences and reinforcing the contrastive ones, their perception becomes categorical. Infants learn to contrast different vowel phonemes of their native language by approximately 6 months of age. The native consonantal contrasts are acquired by 11 or 12 months of age. Some researchers have proposed that infants may be able to learn the sound categories of their native language through passive listening, using a process called statistical learning. Others even claim that certain sound categories are innate, that is, they are genetically specified (see discussion about innate vs. acquired categorical distinctiveness).|$|E

500|$|Because {{the church}} {{continued}} to be rich, most of the rectors were well connected clerics, some, like Bradwardine, with distinguished careers. Others were less august – or respectable. One of the rectors, Robert Stretton, who may have succeeded Bradwardine, and was in post by 1353, was nominated Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield in 1359. His appointment was however (unsuccessfully) opposed by the Archbishop of Canterbury {{on the grounds that}} Stretton could neither read nor write – a charge <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been politically motivated and may have been untrue. Wharton included in Anglia Sacra a continuation of the history of Lichfield by William Whitlocke, which describes Stretton as [...] "eximius vir" [...] – an exceptional man – and goes on to make probably exaggerated claims for his attainments in jurisprudence. Bradwardine was a formidable scholar; Stretton may have been of a more practical bent – he was concurrently Constable of Aberystwyth Castle.|$|E
500|$|Italian {{physician}} Andrea Caesalpino (1519–1603) studied {{medicine and}} taught botany at the University of Pisa for about 40 years eventually becoming Director of the Botanic Garden of Pisa from 1554 to 1558. His sixteen-volume De Plantis (1583) described 1500 plants and his herbarium of 260 pages and 768 mounted specimens still remains. Caesalpino proposed classes {{based largely on}} the detailed structure of the flowers and fruit; [...] he also applied {{the concept of the}} genus. He was the first to try and derive principles of natural classification reflecting the overall similarities between plants and he produced a classification scheme well in advance of its day. Gaspard Bauhin (1560–1624) produced two influential publications [...] (1620) and [...] (1623). These brought order to the 6000 species now described and in the latter he used binomials and synonyms <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have influenced Linnaeus's thinking. He also insisted that taxonomy should be based on natural affinities.|$|E

500|$|Animal {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics upon its release. The album holds a score 54 out of 100 based on 18 critical reviews, {{according to the}} music review aggregator Metacritic. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times stated that Kesha was [...] "offer a thoroughly fleshed-out character to embrace or despise," [...] comparing her persona to [...] "classic screwball blond" [...] such as Jean Harlow and Mae West, while praising her and Dr. Luke for [...] "refashion the screwball heroine role to suit {{a new era of}} aggressive superficiality and libertine self-empowerment". Her conclusion about Kesha and the album was that [...] "er total commitment to the deliberately stupid script Animal provides makes [...] work." [...] Ailbhe Malone of NME gave Animal a mixed review but concluded that [...] "eneath the patina of skeezy Freshers'-Week-LOLZ lyrics ('got a water-bottle full of whiskey in my handbag')" [...] it seems there [...] "lies a talent." [...] Andrew Burgess of musicOMH was impressed with Kesha, calling her an [...] "auto-tuned talk-singing, gum-smacker" [...] <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> be [...] "a pop-genius, a gutter-glam Jonathan Swift." [...] He described the album as [...] "an infectiously good dance-pop album."

500|$|A static, frontal {{image is}} typical of {{religious}} images intended for worship. Symmetric compositions are common in Mesopotamian art when the context is not narrative. Many examples have been found on cylinder seals. Three-part arrangements of a god and two other figures are common, but five-part arrangements exist as well. In this respect, the relief follows established conventions. In terms of representation, the deity is sculpted with a naturalistic but [...] "modest" [...] nudity, reminiscent of Egyptian goddess sculptures, which are sculpted with a well-defined navel and pubic region but no details; there, the lower hemline of a dress indicates that some covering is intended, {{even if it does}} not conceal. In a typical statue of the genre, Pharao Menkaura and two goddesses, Hathor and Bat are shown in human form and sculpted naturalistically, just as in the Burney Relief; in fact, Hathor has been given the features of Queen KhamerernebtyII (see image and article). Depicting an anthropomorphic god as a naturalistic human is an innovative artistic idea <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have diffused from Egypt to Mesopotamia, just like a number of concepts of religious rites, architecture, the [...] "banquet plaques", and other artistic innovations previously. In this respect, the Burney Relief shows a clear departure from the schematic style of the worshiping men and women that were found in temples from periods about 500 years earlier (see image). It is also distinct from the next major style in the region: Assyrian art, with its rigid, detailed representations, mostly of scenes of war and hunting (see image).|$|E
500|$|After {{consultations}} with its allies, Sparta sent a deputation to Athens demanding certain concessions, {{such as the}} immediate expulsion of the Alcmaeonidae family including Pericles and the retraction of the Megarian Decree, threatening war if the demands were not met. The obvious purpose of these proposals was the instigation of a confrontation between Pericles and the people; this event, indeed, would come about a few years later. At that time, the Athenians unhesitatingly followed Pericles' instructions. In the first legendary oration Thucydides puts in his mouth, Pericles advised the Athenians not to yield to their opponents' demands, since they were militarily stronger. Pericles {{was not prepared to}} make unilateral concessions, believing that [...] "if Athens conceded on that issue, then Sparta was sure to come up with further demands". Consequently, Pericles asked the Spartans to offer a quid pro quo. In exchange for retracting the Megarian Decree, the Athenians demanded from Sparta to abandon their practice of periodic expulsion of foreigners from their territory (xenelasia) and to recognize the autonomy of its allied cities, a request implying that Sparta's hegemony was also ruthless. The terms were rejected by the Spartans, and with neither side willing to back down, the two cities prepared for war. According to Athanasios G. Platias and Constantinos Koliopoulos, professors of strategic studies and international politics, [...] "rather than to submit to coercive demands, Pericles chose war". Another consideration <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have influenced Pericles' stance was the concern that revolts in the empire might spread if Athens showed itself weak.|$|E
