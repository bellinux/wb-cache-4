40|$|<b>Trends</b> <b>of</b> {{subjective}} well-being (SWB) {{in transition}} countries are peculiar: they show substantial {{changes that are}} more strongly correlated with <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> GDP than in other developed countries. This paper examines <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> GDP and of social trust in predicting <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> well-being. We find that {{the strength of the}} relationship between social trust and SWB over the medium-term is comparable to that of GDP. We conclude that in the medium-term, even in countries where material concerns strongly affect well-being, social trust is a powerful predictor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> SWB.

The boiling point of ununennium is expected to be around 630°C, which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group, following the downward periodic trend. The density of ununennium has been variously predicted to be between 3 and 4g·cm−3, continuing <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> increasing density down the group, using the predicted value for francium between 2.8 and 3.0g·cm−3.|$|E

40|$|What {{predicts the}} {{evolution}} over time of subjective well-being?

In the short-term this relationship weakens. Indeed, in the short run, changes in social capital predict a much smaller portion of the changes in subjective well-being than over longer periods. GDP follows a reverse path, thus confirming the Easterlin paradox: in the short run GDP is more positively correlated to well-being than in the medium-term, while in the long run this correlation vanishes.

Other objectives were to reverse <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and patterns.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{necessarily}} holistic {{as opposed to}} reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations {{without reference to the}} whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, {{a remote}} {{parallel}} was {{the development of}} Shibuya-kei, which also revisited <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> foregrounding instruments like strings and horns in its arrangements. The genre was informed by classic Western pop music, especially the orchestral domains occupied by Burt Bacharach, Brian Wilson, Phil Spector, and Serge Gainsbourg. Unlike other Japanese music scenes, its audiences did not necessarily cross over into anime fandoms, but rather indie pop enthusiasts. This was partly because many of its bands were distributed in the United States through major indie labels like Matador and Grand Royal. Shibuya-kei ultimately peaked in the late 1990s and declined after its principal players began moving into other music styles.|$|E
5|$|In fall 1903, {{the flood}} of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks.

Gold extraction was slow, because almost no heavy machinery was available to remove the overburden above the layers of gold. The gold discoveries of 1903 reversed <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> people away from the Tanana Valley. By Christmas 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley.

5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> hair styles is now favouring short over long in men.

Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic and a sign of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E
