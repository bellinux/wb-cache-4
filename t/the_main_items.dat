25|$|Before {{the advent}} of the 7-8th century CE, Japan used {{commodity}} money for its exchanges. It generally consisted of material that was compact, easily transportable and had a widely recognized value. Commodity money was a great improvement over simple barter, in which commodities were simply exchanged against others. Ideally, commodity money had to be widely accepted, easily portable and storable, and easily combined and divided in order to correspond to different values. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>items</b> of commodity money in Japan were arrowheads, rice grains and gold powder.|$|E

He explained, [...] "each of us was asking for {{more than the other}} could give. This situation ended with my departure, and with very deep regret I was unable to see Perfect Dark to completion". By the end of 1998, half of the team members, including Doak and Ellis, also left Rare to form Free Radical Design. What followed by those remaining on the project was a comprehensive re-design of the game, with the story and characters being <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>items</b> kept intact. Game designer Mark Edmonds was promoted to team leader because he was familiar with most of the game engine at the time. Rare also assigned more people to the development team, which eventually became three times bigger than GoldenEye 007s. The new team was [...] "uniquely shielded from the outside world" [...] and did not have a production manager, a schedule, meetings, or any sort of deadlines.

2500|$|Japan's first formal {{currency}} {{system was}} the Kōchōsen (Japanese: 皇朝銭, [...] "Imperial currency"). It was {{exemplified by the}} adoption of Japan's first official coin type, the Wadōkaichin. It was first minted in 708 CE on order of Empress Genmei, Japan's 43rd Imperial ruler.

60|$|My first {{interview}} with Dr. James Winter was under dramatic circumstances. It occurred {{at two in}} the morning in the bedroom of an old country house. I kicked him twice on the white waistcoat and knocked off his gold spectacles, while he with the aid of a female accomplice stifled my angry cries in a flannel petticoat and thrust me into a warm bath. I am told that one of my parents, who happened to be present, remarked in a whisper that there was nothing the matter with my lungs. I cannot recall how Dr. Winter looked at the time, for I had other things to think of, but his description of my own appearance is far from flattering.

50|$|The {{arrangement}} and overall styling of food upon {{bringing it to}} the plate is termed plating.
