25|$|When alfalfa {{is to be}} used as hay, it {{is usually}} cut and baled. Loose haystacks are still used in some areas, but bales are easier for use in transportation, storage, and feed. Ideally, the first cutting should be taken at the bud stage, and the {{subsequent}} cuttings just as the field is beginning to flower, or one-tenth bloom because carbohydrates are at their highest. When using farm equipment rather than hand-harvesting, a swather cuts the alfalfa and arranges it in windrows. In areas where the alfalfa does not immediately dry out on its own, a machine known as a mower-conditioner is used to cut the hay. The mower-conditioner has a set of rollers or flails that crimp and break the stems as they pass through <b>the</b> <b>mower,</b> making the alfalfa dry faster. After the alfalfa has dried, a tractor pulling a baler collects the hay into bales.|$|E

2500|$|Fertile land, trapping, {{and ease}} of access brought first trappers and then the early pioneers to this region. The rich gameland {{attracted}} a trapper named Austin Nichols, who built the first log cabin in 1853. At that time there were [...] "about twenty families in the area." [...] More settlers began to arrive by wagon train in 1855, and by 1856, enough people were present to organize Mower County. [...] It was in 1856 that the settlement adopted the name Austin, in honor of its first settler. [...] That year the first hotel opened to travelers and the first physician moved to town, Dr. Ormanzo Allen. The first newspaper, <b>the</b> <b>Mower</b> County Mirror, was started in 1858.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Clark was {{competing}} in the Australasia based Tasman series, run for older F1 cars, and was series champion in 1965, 1967 and 1968 driving for Lotus. He won fourteen races in all, a record for the series. This included winning the 1968 Australian Grand Prix at the Sandown International Raceway in Melbourne where he defeated the Ferrari 246T of Chris Amon by just 0.1 seconds after 55 laps of the 3.1km (1.92mi) circuit, the closest finish {{in the history of}} the Australian Grand Prix. The 1968 Tasman Series and Australian Grand Prix would prove to be his last major wins before his untimely death. According to Australian driver and regular Tasman Series driver Leo Geoghegan, during his time down under for the 1967 series, Clark arrived at the Sydney home that Leo shared with his parents and his younger brother Ian [...] "Pete" [...] Geoghegan. Neither Leo, Pete or their father Tom were home at the time, however Mrs Geoghean (Tom's wife) was. Not actually knowing who Clark was, Mrs Geoghegan thought that he was there to mow their lawns and told him that <b>the</b> <b>mower</b> was in the shed and he could start at any time. When the trio arrived home a short time later they were surprised to find a shirtless Clark casually mowing their front lawn.|$|E

50|$|Racers vary in {{age from}} six to seventy in five {{separate}} classes. Kids (6-12 years old) run in the Youth Class. Their mowers are limited to a stock lawn mower engine with a governor set {{to no more than}} 3650 rpm and a 10:1 gear ratio. Adults classes are split by running time trials. Time trials are set up like a qualifying run in NASCAR. A-Class is <b>the</b> <b>mowers</b> that run <b>the</b> fastest times. D-Class is <b>the</b> <b>mowers</b> that run <b>the</b> slowest during time trials. B and C-Class are in between the other two.|$|R

60|$|Now, {{artificial}} grasses {{are seldom}} sown {{on the prairie}} where usually the natural product grows {{only a few inches}} high, and as building logs are scarce, implements are often kept just where they last were used. It was therefore necessary to seek hay worth cutting in a dried-out slough, or swamp, and next to find <b>the</b> <b>mower,</b> which might lie anywhere within a radius of four miles or so. We came upon them both together, <b>the</b> <b>mower</b> lying on its side, red with rust, amid a stretch of waist-high grass. The latter was harsh and wiry, heavy-scented with wild peppermint, and made ready for us by the sun.|$|E

50|$|Idigicon {{released}} a PC version under its Kool Dog label. This version was not programmed by Jeff Minter and introduced {{a number of}} game elements seen as undesirable by many fans: most notably, the lawn was made to scroll and <b>the</b> <b>mower's</b> slow initial movement and later acceleration were nowhere near as pronounced. The player had 5 lives instead of 3, {{and the names of}} the people from which <b>the</b> <b>mowers</b> were taken were altered to those involved {{in the development of the}} game: they included George (George Bray, Producer at Idigicon at the time), and Jeff (Jeff Minter).|$|R
60|$|Sweet is the swallow twittering on {{the eaves}} At daybreak, when <b>the</b> <b>mower</b> whets his scythe, And stock-doves murmur, and the milkmaid leaves Her little lonely bed, and carols blithe To see the heavy-lowing cattle wait Stretching their huge and {{dripping}} mouths across the farmyard gate.|$|E
60|$|The Indians in front, {{surprised}} and confused, were mown {{down by the}} long rifles like grass before <b>the</b> <b>mower,</b> and those behind, after one moment's hesitation, broke and fled; in another two minutes the fight was over, and the Indians in full flight to their village.|$|E
60|$|Leland {{caught the}} packet from him, and handed {{one or two}} of the letters to Urmston. The man drove on again.

Gallwey, who was passing, pulled his team up and looked down at him inquiringly.|$|E
5000|$|The player again {{had five}} lives instead of three: <b>the</b> <b>mowers</b> were {{provided}} by Jim, Tom, and Alf (as in the original game) followed by [...] "The Ex-Queen Mother's Flunky" [...] and Yak.|$|R

50|$|In {{the medieval}} {{agricultural}} year, Lammas also {{marked the end}} of the hay harvest that had begun after Midsummer. At the end of hay-making a sheep would be loosed in the meadow among <b>the</b> <b>mowers,</b> for him to keep who could catch it.|$|R
60|$|I {{could see}} no {{reasonable}} objection to this, and presently we sat together under the wagon {{for the sake of}} coolness, while, when <b>the</b> <b>mower</b> ceased its rattle, the dust once more settled down upon the slough. It was almost too hot to eat; there was no breath of wind, and the glare of the sun-scorched prairie grew blinding.|$|E

"My roses are yellow," [...] it answered; [...] "as yellow as {{the hair}} of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the {{daffodil}} that blooms in the meadow before <b>the</b> <b>mower</b> comes with his scythe.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{attachment}} for a rotary <b>mower,</b> either using <b>the</b> three-point hitch or via a draw bar. The height of the cut on models attached on the three-point hitch is adjusted using the hitch control lever. This adjusts the height of <b>the</b> front of <b>mower.</b> For more radical height adjustment the rear wheel can also be adjusted. Typically <b>the</b> <b>mowers</b> in this category range from 3.3 to 22 ft mowing widths.|$|R
6000|$|... "Martial was {{a little}} mulish, and I'm afraid I'm troubled with a {{shortness}} of temper now and then.

60|$|Mr. Oliver {{broke into}} a run and the rest followed. When they reached the clump of trees they could {{discover}} no sign of <b>the</b> <b>mower,</b> except for the track of wheels among the withered needles and undergrowth. This led toward the ravine, {{at the bottom of}} which a little water flowed, and Frank saw Mr. Oliver's face harden as he followed this guide. A minute later they stood on the brink of the declivity and saw <b>the</b> <b>mower</b> lying upon its side among the stones thirty or forty feet below them. The slope was almost precipitous, but Mr. Oliver went down sliding amidst a rush of loosened soil, and Frank and Harry with some difficulty scrambled down after him. A glance was sufficient to show them that the implement was not likely to be of the least use to its owner. Mr. Oliver examined it quietly and then clambered back {{up the side of the}} ravine, after which he sat down and took out his pipe before he turned to Jake.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a certain}} grimness in Wyllard's laugh. [...] "Martial was a little muleish, and I'm afraid I'm troubled with a {{shortness}} of temper now and then.
