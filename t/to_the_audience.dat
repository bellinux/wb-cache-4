5|$|A female human {{trafficking}} victim is interviewed {{with her face}} hidden. She describes how she and other {{human trafficking}} victims in Eastern Europe were held in buildings with security cameras, where {{they were forced to}} walk naked down a runway before a group of men who watched under the guise of attending a fashion show. She then describes being auctioned off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> members, who she says examined her off the runway as one might examine cattle.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} show the {{differences}} between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals. Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal {{as a symbol of}} aggression and especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; and because the Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals {{in order to make the}} differences in communication clearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{there were four}} notable Christian heavy metal groups: Messiah Prophet, Leviticus, Saint, and Stryper. Although it is {{debatable}} as to which band was formed first, the Orange County native glam metal group Stryper {{was the most popular}} one. Stryper was also the first band to identify as Christian metal. Stryper gained attention with their way of throwing Bibles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> at their concerts. In the beginning, mostly Christians went to Stryper's concerts but soon they reached non-Christian audience. In the 1980s, Christian metal bands closely followed the trends of mainstream metal bands.|$|E

50|$|Risk {{communication}} {{is a complex}} cross-disciplinary academic field related to core values of <b>the</b> targeted <b>audiences.</b> Problems for risk communicators involve how <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> intended <b>audience,</b> how <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> risk comprehensible and relatable to other risks, how to pay appropriate respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> values related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> risk, how <b>to</b> predict <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> communication, etc. A main goal of risk {{communication is}} to improve collective and individual decision making. Risk communication is somewhat related to crisis communication.|$|R
5|$|In the show, Angel {{revealed}} the secrets behind {{some of his}} illusions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> This included the Lord of Illusions trick, where he revealed {{that he had the}} swords in a preset order so that he could avoid them. The episode featuring this illusion also includes a meeting between Angel and his team discussing a problem with the trick and how to ensure it doesn't happen again.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days {{in what would}} become his only visit to that region. He was greeted {{as if he were}} a head of state, rather than a physicist, which {{included}} a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein's talk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Maktab Khana ("Clerk's Quarters") {{originally}} {{known as}} Dawlat Khana-e-Jahangir, {{was constructed in}} 1617 {{under the supervision of}} Mamur Khan during the reign of Jahangir as a set of cloisters near the Moti Masjid. Designed by Khawaja Jahan Muhammad Dost, it was used as passage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Audience</b> Hall from the palace buildings to the north. Clerks in the Maktab Khana would also record the entry of guests into the fort. It features iwans in the Persian-Timurid style in each of its four sides. Each iwan is flanked by arches.|$|E

5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{premiere of}} Prometheus {{took place on}} May 31, 2012, at the Empire cinema in Leicester Square, London.

5|$|Yaron {{had never}} {{acted in a}} role with a romance before and at certain points found it {{difficult}} to portray the emotions her character felt when interacting with Yochay. Cinematographer Asaf Sudry assisted in conveying <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> that the marriage between the lead characters would eventually take place by frequently using sunlight for their scenes.|$|E

5000|$|Storytelling is innate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> human condition. Its {{underpinnings}} are cerebral, emotional, communal, psychological. One of the storyteller's main responsibilities is <b>to</b> resonate in <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> psyche {{a certain}} {{something at the}} end of it all, <b>to</b> emotionally move <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> <b>to</b> compel <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> [...] "get it" [...] on a visceral level.|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} of Shelly is used <b>to</b> show <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> what <b>the</b> ideal family should be. Her disgust {{with what she}} expects and what is actually reality helps <b>to</b> show <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> what <b>the</b> American dream should be.|$|R
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|Dan Tucker is {{both the}} teller and subject of the story. Verses 1, 3, and 5 of the 1843 edition are in the first person, whereas verses 2, 4, and 7 are in the third. This {{reflects}} the song's intended performance by an entire minstrel troupe. The lead minstrel played Tucker and began the song, but backup singers took over at times to allow Tucker to act out the scenario, dance, and do another comedy bit. There was probably an element of competition to the various dance and music solos. The third-person verses also allowed for commentary to suggest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> how they were to judge the character and his antics.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{introduces}} {{himself and}} Bart to Kashmir, who is preoccupied with getting on stage for her performance, though she understands what Homer {{is trying to}} get through for his son. Without knowing it, Homer accidentally finds himself on stage at the burlesque show. Homer is about to be thrown offstage when the audience recognize him from the picture. The audience applauds and Homer gets caught up in the fanfare and starts dancing with the showgirls, until he sees Bart and realizes what he is supposed to do. Homer stops the show and successfully manages to make a plea <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> to treat women with respect. Marge, who is in the audience, accepts Homer's apology and the two make up.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Parker {{played the}} male lead in Rome & Jewel, a hip-hop take on Romeo and Juliet that got mothballed and re-released in 2008. Parker's title character, who is {{supposed}} to be the modern day Romeo, was a Compton youth with both tenderness and toughness. Despite a troubled script, Parker's rap performance earned comparisons to Will Smith from Nathan Lee of The New York Times. In 2007, he had a small role in Pride, about an African American swim team. Parker was tasked with depicting the visual expectations of an athletic proficiency that was new to him but very familiar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June 1988 the {{producer}} Tim Taylor invited Aston {{to work on}} a new four-episode television series for Channel 4 called Time Signs, broadcast in June and July 1991. The series focused on the historical development of the area about to be flooded by the Roadford Reservoir in Devon, making heavy use of archaeological data. Aston brought archaeologist Phil Harding into the project in order to explain techniques of experimental archaeology <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> Meanwhile, in August 1989, Aston was promoted to the position of Reader in Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University. He also continued to write on the subject, authoring the book Monasteries (1993); he had initially planned to title the volume Monasteries in the Landscape but his publisher, Batsford, had insisted on the shorter title.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mercury {{refused to}} let the band record, {{and at the same}} time Stratton-Smith {{refused to let}} the other members of the band sign to Mercury too, as he did not think the deal was fair to the band (only Hammill {{remained}} now of the original three who had signed with Mercury). On top of that in late January 1969 the band's van and equipment were stolen. The theft aggravated their financial difficulties. Although the band was touring successfully, which included a concert in February at the Royal Albert Hall in support of Jimi Hendrix, it broke up in June after playing a final gig at Nottingham's Pop & Blues Festival on 10 May entirely with borrowed equipment. John Peel, who was compering the show, announced their break-up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pathos {{represents}} an appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience’s</b> emotions. This appeal {{can be achieved}} by the use of metaphors, storytelling, or general passion. In order to appeal to an <b>audience’s</b> emotions during <b>the</b> speech’s delivery, the speaker must first take <b>the</b> <b>audience’s</b> emotion into account during the early invention phase. For example, if a presidential candidate grew up poor and managed to succeed in life through hard work and education, then the candidate would have to apply that story <b>to</b> <b>the</b> speech-inventing process in order <b>to</b> appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience’s</b> emotions. This storytelling draws upon the common [...] "bootstraps" [...] narrative of American culture, one that often appeals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> emotions of the U.S. electorate.|$|R
