[...] Upon writing the novel, McBride conducted his own research and learned of the 92nd Infantry Division, which consisted of 15,000 African-American soldiers, who served in Italy during World War II from August 1944 to November 1945. McBride interviewed several remaining members of the 92nd Division. [...] "I studied Italian at The New School in New York City," [...] he explained. [...] "I moved to Italy with my family for six months. I interviewed dozens of Italians—Partisans and Fascists. I interviewed dozens of African-American soldiers who fought in the war, most who have since passed away. I must have read at least 20 books. I went to the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

London has five major business districts: the City, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8million m2 of office space.

[...] the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion – same value as that of Brazil annual GDP. The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics. On average the price per square metre in central London is €24,252 (April 2014).

500|$|Silveri and Goldberg-Meehan {{deliberately}} {{intended to}} keep Monica and Chandler's union [...] "low-key" [...] {{in order to further}} differentiate it from Ross and Rachel's, which had been very public. In order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> how audiences would react to Monica and Chandler hooking up at Ross and Emily's wedding in London, the scene in which a clearly nude Monica suddenly emerges from under the sheets of Chandler's hotel bed was filmed in front of three separate test audiences, each of whom responded very enthusiastically to the surprise, several months before the episode was actually taped. Despite the warm reception received from the audience, Silveri and Goldberg-Meehan were at first uncertain {{as to whether or not}} they should continue expanding upon their relationship even further, and proceeded with caution by having Monica and Chandler initially keep their relationship hidden from their peers. Protective of their characters, Cox and Perry shared similar hesitations at first, but ultimately grew to accept Monica and Chandler as a couple. The characters' relationship is eventually revealed to their friends in the episode [...] "The One Where Everybody Finds Out". While each character very much approves of their union, Monica's parents initially resent their daughter's feelings for Chandler due to an age-old misunderstanding involving Chandler.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{released}} {{more than}} eight remixes of the song in different formats. At the time, [...] "Secret" [...] was experiencing success on the US record charts, to keep the song current in dance clubs, Madonna requested remixes of the song from Junior Vasquez, who was a DJ at the Sound Factory nightclub in New York. According to him Madonna's representatives [...] "sent me a cassette of the song, just <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> what the song was... nd when it was 100 beats per minute I said, 'Oh god, what am I gonna do with this?'" [...] Vasquez {{and his team of}} engineers first experimented with the track by making remixes closer to the original version. Then he used only Madonna's vocals for the mixed versions, and re-wrote and composed the music as brand new. He was sure of doing house mixes of the track but had to [...] "speed-up" [...] Madonna's vocals. Recording engineer Dennis Mitchell explained, [...] "To do that we have to digitally manipulate her vocals, which is time compression... It just digitally goes in and snipes out tiny little digital slices of the actual sound and squeezes it together so that her tempo is a new tempo but her pitch stays the same." [...] According to Vasquez, Madonna was [...] "on top of everything" [...] including the house mixes {{as well as the other}} mixes created.|$|E

500|$|Part of this {{creative}} experimentation was a trial-and-error approach. Liszt constructed compositions {{with varying}} sections of music not necessarily having distinct beginnings and ends. He sketched sections, sometimes without fully completing them, {{on a small}} number of staves with some indication of the orchestration. After an assistantAugust Conradi from 1848 to 1849, Joachim Raff from 1850 to 1853had realized Liszt's ideas and provided a score of an acceptable standard, Liszt would then make further revisions; he moved sections to form different structural relationships, and modified connective materials or composed them anew, completing the piece of music. The score was copied, then tried out in rehearsals with the Weimarian Court orchestra and further changes made in the light of practical experience. Many years later, Liszt reminisced how his compositional development hinged on hearing an orchestra perform his works: [...] "I needed to hear them in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of them." [...] He added that it was much more for this reason, and not simply for securing a public for his own works, that he promoted them in Weimar and elsewhere. After many such stages of composition, rehearsal and revision, Liszt might reach a version where the musical form seemed balanced and he was satisfied. However, it was his habit to write modifications to already printed scores. From his perspective, his compositions remained [...] "works in progress" [...] as he continued to reshape, rework, or add and subtract material. In some instances, a composition could exist in four or five versions simultaneously.|$|E
