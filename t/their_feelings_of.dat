25|$|The {{identity}} synergy {{principle of}} fusion {{assumes that the}} borders between the personal and social selves are highly permeable for strongly fused individuals. These porous borders encourage people to channel their personal agency into group behavior, raising the possibility that strongly fused individuals will channel <b>their</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> personal agency into pro-group behavior. Perceptions of agency {{have been shown to}} mediate the effect of fusion on pro-group behavior.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{provided}} us with mixed results {{as to whether or}} not a person's involvement in social networking can affect <b>their</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> loneliness. Studies have indicated that how a person chooses to use social networking can change <b>their</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> loneliness in either a negative or positive way. Some companies with mobile workers have encouraged their workers to use social networking to feel connected, educators are using it to keep connected with their students and individuals are benefiting from social networking to keep connect with already close relationships that they've developed under circumstances that would otherwise make it difficult to do so. Each social networking user is able to create a community that centers around a personal identity they choose to create online. In his book Digital Identities: Creating and Communicating the Online Self, Rob Cover argues that social networking's foundation in Web 2.0, high-speed networking shifts online representation to one which is both visual and relational to other people, complexifying the identity process for younger people and creating new forms of anxiety. In 2016, news reports stated that excessive usage of SNS sites may be associated with an increase in the rates of depression, to almost triple the rate for non-SNS users. Experts worldwide have said that 2030 people who use SNS more have higher levels of depression than those who use SNS less.|$|E

25|$|Self-verification strivings {{may have}} {{undesirable}} consequences {{for people with}} negative self-views (depressed people and those who suffer from low self-esteem). For example, self-verification strivings may cause people with negative self-views to gravitate toward partners who mistreat them, undermine <b>their</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> self-worth, or even abuse them. And if people with negative self-views seek therapy, returning home to a self-verifying partner may undo the progress that was made there. Finally, in the workplace, the feelings of worthlessness that plague people with low self-esteem may foster feelings of ambivalence about receiving fair treatment, feelings that may undercut their propensity to insist that they get what they deserve from their employers (see: workplace bullying).|$|E
25|$|A {{person can}} have a high {{self-esteem}} and hold it confidently where {{they do not need}} reassurance from others to maintain their positive self view, whereas others with defensive, high self-esteem may still report positive self-evaluations on the Rosenberg Scale, as all high self-esteem individuals do; however, their positive self-views are fragile and vulnerable to criticism. Defensive high self-esteem individuals internalize subconscious self-doubts and insecurities, causing them to react very negatively to any criticism they may receive. There is a need for constant positive feedback from others for these individuals to maintain <b>their</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> self-worth. The necessity of repeated praise can be associated with boastful, arrogant behavior or sometimes even aggressive and hostile feelings toward anyone who questions the individual's self-worth, an example of threatened egotism.|$|E
25|$|Klaas A. Posthuma {{argues that}} neither Tristan nor Isolde try {{for one moment}} to ignore <b>their</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> {{love for each other}} nor do they try to {{overcome}} them. On the contrary, they yield to their feelings with all their hearts – but secretly. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the Schopenhauer doctrine. Another important point in this philosophy is Schopenhauer's opinion about finding happiness with one woman only, which he rejected – his reason for never marrying. But for Tristan there is only one woman, Isolde, with Death as alternative. And this leads to the inevitable conclusion that it was not Schopenhauer and his doctrine that were responsible for the creation of Wagner's sublime music drama but his unfulfilled love for the woman he met and loved during these years, Mathilde Wesendonck.|$|E

25|$|The peasants were discontented {{because of}} many other factors, as well, {{including}} crop failure, and epidemics, especially a major epidemic in 1771. The nobles were also imposing a stricter rule than ever, reducing the land of each serf and restricting their freedoms further beginning around 1767. Their discontent led to widespread outbreaks of violence and rioting during Pugachev's Rebellion of 1774. The serfs probably followed someone who was pretending to be the true tsar because of <b>their</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> disconnection to Catherine and her policies empowering the nobles, {{but this was not}} the first time they followed a pretender under Catherine’s reign. Pugachev had made stories about himself acting as a real tsar should, helping the common people, listening to their problems, praying for them, and generally acting saintly, and this helped rally the peasants and serfs, with their very conservative values, to his cause. With all this discontent in mind, Catherine did rule for 10 years before the anger of the serfs boiled over into a rebellion as extensive as Pugachev’s. Under Catherine’s rule, though, despite her enlightened ideals, the serfs were generally unhappy and discontented.|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} boys and girls who {{manipulate}} their body in a permanent way with tattoo and body piercing is an ever-increasing number.

These kinds of manipulation of the body may be related to self injury phenomenon, or common adolescential behavior, such as use of tobacco, drugs or alcohol abuse, or to family conflicts and abnormal temperament traits.

40|$|We {{propose that}} {{satisfaction}} with one 2 ̆ 7 s life arises pan-culturally from {{the achievement of}} better health, greater financial satisfaction, stronger <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> happiness {{and a sense of}} personal control over events. This four-factor model was tested for more than 70, 000 persons across 53 nations using the representative samples provided by the World Values Survey, Wave 5. Using an HLM analysis, we show that the model components of health and control apply with equal strength to individuals regardless <b>of</b> <b>their</b> nationality. <b>Feelings</b> <b>of</b> happiness and judgments of one 2 ̆ 7 s wealth were, however, variable in their impact, being moderated by the two socialization goals extracted from the WVS, Self-directedness versus Other-directedness and Civility versus Practicality. In nations where Self-directedness is endorsed more strongly in socializing children, citizens 2 ̆ 7 life satisfaction was more strongly driven by <b>their</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> happiness and less strongly by the judgment of their financial condition; in countries where Civility is endorsed more strongly, citizens 2 ̆ 7 life satisfaction was more strongly driven by <b>their</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> happiness and less by the judgment of their financial condition. These results show that the socialization emphases characterizing one 2 ̆ 7 s national-cultural context operate to make some key components of life satisfaction more or less important.

500|$|When {{the book}} was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them. [...] The {{first part of the}} novel {{concerns}} the children's fascination with Boo Radley and <b>their</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> safety and comfort in the neighborhood. [...] Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. [...] One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism. [...] This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to genealogy (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks), and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. [...] This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of [...] "fine folks" [...] being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have. [...] The South itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.|$|E
