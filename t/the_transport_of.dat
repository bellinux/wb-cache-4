5|$|By around 1900, {{there were}} {{between five and}} seven {{services}} operating daily along the Cheddar Valley Line, with a mixed mail train on Sundays.

5|$|Decaying {{organic matter}} {{is a primary}} diet for many species. This can range from dung, which is {{consumed}} by coprophagous species (such as certain scarab beetles in the Scarabaeidae), to dead animals, which are eaten by necrophagous species (such as the carrion beetles, Silphidae). Some beetles found in dung and carrion are in fact predatory. These include members of the Histeridae and Silphidae, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects. Many beetles feed under bark, some feed on wood while others feed on fungi growing on wood or leaf-litter. Some beetles have special mycangia, structures for <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> fungal spores.|$|E
