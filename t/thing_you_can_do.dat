500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the season written and {{produced}} separately from the second season. The previous six episodes from the third season were filmed almost immediately after the second season ended {{as part of an}} early shooting schedule to accommodate Poehler's pregnancy. Series co-creator Michael Schur described it as a particularly empowering episode for the Leslie Knope character: [...] "When you see this episode [...] it makes you love her even more. This episode is about Leslie being noticed for the incredible hard work she does." [...] Schur also said he believed the subplot with April and Andy was one that several young people in their situation have faced in real life: [...] "Andy is put into a situation {{that a lot of people}} have been put into in our lives and he does the exact wrong <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> And that's sort of the template for them going forward is what's the wrongest <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do?</b> That's sort of how we follow them." [...] Chris Pratt said he believed the conflict provided strong romantic and comedic potential for the characters: [...] "There definitely will be conflict in their relationship [...] there's still a lot of room for comedy in there, because we have good writers." ...|$|E
500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would like to be the one who would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is keep your mouth shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 1 June, Gusmão {{visited a}} refugee camp near the United Nations headquarters, telling people [...] "The best <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is {{go back to your}} homes", and urging them not to take {{security}} matters into their own hands. On the same day, Interior Minister Rogerio Lobato and Defence Minister Roque Rodriguez resigned, Lobato blaming the crisis on opponents to the government resorting to violence rather than political means. Foreign Minister Ramos-Horta subsequently took over the Defence ministry, while Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar urged Ramos-Horta to act strongly in his new capacity, in the interests of achieving political stability, while emphasising that the United Nations should be prepared to resume greater role.|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Rowling {{described}} Snape's {{character as}} an [...] "antihero". She {{has said that}} she drew inspiration for Snape's character from a disliked teacher from her own childhood, and described Snape as a horrible teacher, saying the [...] "worst, shabbiest <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> as a teacher is to bully students." [...] However, she does suggest in the books that he is generally an effective teacher. Although Rowling has said that Gilderoy Lockhart is her only character that she [...] "deliberately based on a real person", Snape was reportedly based, at least in part, on John Nettleship, who taught Rowling chemistry and employed her mother as an assistant at Wyedean School near Chepstow. For Snape's surname, Rowling borrowed {{the name of the}} village of Snape, Suffolk.|$|E

2500|$|Including {{the butt}} fumble, Sanchez lost the ball 24 {{times in the}} 2011 and 2012 seasons. In 2013, the Jets' new quarterbacks coach, David Lee, instituted a program {{to cut down on}} the fumbles by {{teaching}} Sanchez to hold the ball with both hands. In what Lee calls [...] "The Sanchez Drill," [...] the quarterback runs a gauntlet of people trying to knock the ball out of his hands with foam bats. Lee explained to the press, [...] "Mark can win in this league. He has proven that. He’s played for championships. I'm blatantly honest, brutally truthful at times. I told him, 'Hey, the best <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to help our football team—the No.1 thing—is take care of the ball.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Work on Lightning {{was done}} between January 1 and July 2012, in Matt and Kim's old {{apartment}} on Grand Street in Brooklyn, New York. The album was written and recorded using the music production software Logic Pro. The 10 tracks of Lightning were pared from 25-26 songs originally {{written for the}} album, which Matt Johnson said that [...] "it gave us [...] {{a lot more to}} choose from, which let Kim and I really broaden this album out." [...] He {{said in an interview that}} the group [...] "felt there was a lot going on in the songs" [...] on their album Sidewalks. [...] "In a way, the safest <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with a song is to make it have a lot of stuff. The more you put on, the less the actual songwriting is exposed. For the new album , I was excited to do as little possible to the songs production-wise and still have them be strong." [...] He also said that the album's recording location [...] "was a nice farewell" [...] to the apartment.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Havins {{was asked}} if she felt that Babe had been {{redeemed}} since the baby switch. Havins replied, [...] "More or less. That's not {{something that can be}} done overnight; it takes time. And I don't think it's necessarily acts, like one heroic act, that redeem someone." [...] She clarified: It's just showing change. She's very remorseful and there's regret with the whole situation. It's one thing if somebody didn't feel sorry for what they did, but she repented for her sins. Everyone has a past. Everyone makes mistakes. The only <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is move on and try to be a better person from that point forward. When Bianca forgives Babe in 2007 for keeping her child from her, there were viewers who still felt that it was due to Bianca being in love with Babe, and were upset that Bianca could not seem to resist any interaction with her. In a 2007 interview with TV Guide, Havins seemed perplexed that a significant number of viewers had still not forgiven Babe for the baby switch, and felt that the character had been redeeming herself.|$|E

2500|$|The secretive {{attitude}} and gradual unfolding of Snape's character was broadly admired, with Stephen Fry, the UK audio books narrator, saying in 2003: [...] "Most characters like Snape {{are hard to}} love {{but there is a}} sort of ambiguity—you can’t quite decide—something sad about him—lonely and it’s fascinating when you think he’s going to be the evil one..., then slowly you get this idea he’s not so bad after all." [...] David Yates, who directed the final four films of the series, also expressed his views on the character, saying: [...] "A character like Snape, where you're not really sure if he's a good guy or a bad guy, that gives you a latent tension... I think the coolest <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with an audience is deny them a little bit of information." [...] Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself. Joyce Millman suggests in her essay [...] "To Sir with Love" [...] in the book Mapping the World of Harry Potter, that Snape is derived from a tradition of Byronic heroes such as Wuthering Heights Heathcliff.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning on November 14, 1965, Lt. Col. Moore led the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) in the week-long Battle of Ia Drang. Encircled by enemy {{soldiers}} {{with no clear}} landing zone {{that would allow them}} to leave, Moore managed to persevere despite being significantly outnumbered by North Vietnamese Army (NVA) forces that would go on to defeat the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry only two-and-a-half miles away the next day. Moore's dictum that [...] "there is always one more <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to increase your odds of success" [...] and the courage of his entire command are credited [...] with this outcome. Blond haired Moore was known as [...] "Yellow Hair" [...] to his troops at the battle at Ia Drang, and as a tongue-in-cheek homage referencing the legendary General George Armstrong Custer, who commanded as a lieutenant colonel the same 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn just under a century before. Moore was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism at Ia Drang. After the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley, Moore was promoted to colonel and took over the command of the Garry Owen (3rd) Brigade.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 Matson began a decades-long {{separation}} from the Beats. The seeds were evident in a discussion with Ginsberg, when Matson asserted that [...] "Every user is a pusher." [...] Ginsberg countered, [...] "That isn’t literally true," [...] {{at least in the}} eyes of the judicial system. Matson's experience, especially with Huncke and Erin Black, led him to question the Beats’ elitism and their patriarchal, anti-feminist bias. Moving away from the bias that savage aspects are at the apex of our personalities, showed Matson the larger landscape. At Huncke's Memorial in 1996, Matson addressed Huncke's impulse that [...] "the only <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with the pain inside is medicate it. That's shitty, Herb." [...] Gregory Corso complained Matson was criticizing Beat behavior, and Matson replied that other options were available. [...] Matson had become by then an avid participant in 12-step programs. Matson's most influential teachers, besides poetry and Huncke, were women. [...] "I am a person!" [...] Erin Black proclaimed in 1964, with proto-feminist exactness. Eila Kokkinen, who was conversant with the Beats, provided a balanced perspective and included psychoanalytic insights. Relationships with Martha Muhs, Maggie Clougherty, and Phyllis Ideal, and the general atmosphere of the 1970s engendered the sense that whatever strategies worked for Matson needed to include women. [...] The strategies needed to work for women, also. Fundamental threads prevail throughout Matson's work: the urge to honesty and to give messages from the body first regard. The stage was set, through training with the Beat Generation, for the development of his writing and of his career. Matson's evolution points directly toward his recent conception of [...] "Paleo Poetry" [...] and the primitive heart.|$|E

2500|$|To {{complement}} the gameplay, distinctive, stylistic visuals were decided upon {{and carried out}} through the CANVAS graphics engine. Adding a touch of fantasy to the mix, the development team hoped {{to be able to}} garner attention from gamers who did not play games with similar settings but more realistic combat. The use of a warm color palette took emphasis away from the [...] "grotesque, realistic nature of war itself," [...] as Nonaka had stated, and focused instead on the characters and story. Tanaka added that, [...] "we wanted to show that realism isn't the only <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with 3D graphics." [...] The character designs for the game were created by Raita Honjou, who, {{along with the rest of}} the development staff, aimed for a look that was described by 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish as [...] "rustic." [...] In early stages designs drew more directly on examples from World War II, however they proved to be too modern for what the team wanted to achieve. Thus, Raita aimed for a motif closer to that found in World War I, first creating Alicia and Welkin's concept illustrations and using them as a basis for the rest of the Gallian cast. World War II influence can still be seen in the designs of Imperial characters such as Gregor, whose uniform is heavily based on German officers' uniforms from that period. The end result of these efforts was described by Japanese director Mamoru Oshii as giving him [...] "an impression similar to ... the Nausicaä manga," [...] and Nonaka admits to aiming for the style found in World Masterpiece Theater.|$|E
