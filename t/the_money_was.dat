The entire process was expected to take six weeks to demolish the bridge. It was estimated that another $450,000 would be needed to remove the bridge's concrete counter-weights and $8 million to remove the approaches.

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>was</b> duly {{raised and}} the bronze {{cast of the}} statue was finally {{completed}} in 1856, a lengthy dispute delayed its installation for several years. The original idea had been to erect the statue as a memorial to the Great Exhibition. This prompted opposition, as did proposals to place it outside Charles Barry's newly completed Palace of Westminster. Various other locations to display the statue were initially considered before agreement was reached {{that it would be}} placed in Old Palace Yard, Marochetti's preferred location.

Berry contended that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>was</b> a gift, and a judge {{dismissed}} the case because Ronan did not list Berry as a debtor when he filed for bankruptcy in 1992.

5|$|Both {{the sale}} of weapons to Iran, and the funding of the Contras, {{attempted}} to circumvent not only stated administration policy, but also the Boland Amendment.

Funding from one foreign country, Brunei, was botched when North's secretary, Fawn Hall, transposed the numbers of North's Swiss bank account number. A Swiss businessman, suddenly $10 million richer, alerted the authorities of the mistake. <b>The</b> <b>money</b> <b>was</b> eventually returned to the Sultan of Brunei, with interest.|$|E

5|$|Enrollment {{continued}} to rise, {{and by the}} end of his tenure, Ross requested that parents first communicate with his office before sending their sons to the school. The increase in students necessitated an improvement in facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898, the college spent over $97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction of a mess hall, which could seat 500 diners at once, an infirmary, which included the first indoor toilets on campus, an artesian well, a natatorium, four faculty residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a cold storage room, a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery shed. Despite the expenditures on facilities, the school treasury held a surplus in 1893 and 1894. The 1894 financial report credited the surplus to Ross's leadership, and Ross ensured <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>was</b> returned to the students in the form of lower fees.|$|E
