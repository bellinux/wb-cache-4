50|$|The 2013 <b>triple</b> <b>motor</b> is {{more compact}} {{and a little}} more powerful. The bike has a smaller, lighter and {{narrower}} frame. It has a bigger airbox, new swingarm, slipper clutch and lighter wheels. Other changes include a fuel gauge and a side mounted exhaust instead of the underseat setup from previous models, rear brembo brakes on the Standard 675. ABS is an option on the standard bike.|$|E
50|$|Dolby later {{introduced}} Dolby C and Dolby S noise reduction, which achieved {{higher levels}} of noise reduction; Dolby C became common on high-fidelity decks, but Dolby S, released when cassette sales had begun to decline, never achieved widespread use. It was only licensed for use on higher end tape decks that included dual <b>motors,</b> <b>triple</b> heads, and other refinements.|$|R
40|$|In 2008, {{the number}} of {{poisoning}} deaths exceeded {{the number of}} motor vehicle traffic deaths and was {{the leading cause of}} injury death {{for the first time since}} at least 1980. During the past three decades, the poisoning death rate nearly <b>tripled,</b> while the <b>motor</b> vehicle traffic death rate decreased by one-half. During this period, the percentage of poisoning deaths that were caused by drugs increased from about 60...|$|R
50|$|The {{basic and}} most popular {{structure}} is of a slatted base with a twin drive or a <b>triple</b> drive <b>motor.</b> The {{support of the}} mattress comes from {{the flexibility of the}} slats and their elastic mountings on the frame. The slatted bases are economic price-wise and can be lifted with lightweight actuators. The more advanced structure is the fully flexible base; it provides support to the mattress in every pressure point. They also require more powerful motors due to their weight. Fully flexible bases are usually made of zoned fillings of HR or of cold foam, sometimes covered with either latex or 3D mesh (spacer fabric) layer. The fully flexible bases are more solid and many would say more comfortable in providing a better support to the mattress.|$|R
40|$|On October 7, 2003, California Governor Gray Davis {{became the}} second Governor in American history to be recalled. Multiple factors {{contributed to his}} lack of popularity, from natural {{disasters}} to record budget shortfalls {{in the wake of}} the dotcom bust, but for many the tipping point came when he declared that he would be <b>tripling</b> California’s <b>motor</b> vehicle tax to shore up the state’s budget. Most of Davis’s challengers pledged to repeal the increase. Tom McClintock, who came in third in the recall election and now serves as one of California’s Representatives, made lowering vehicle taxes the main focus of his campaign. Eventual winner Arnold Schwarzenegger made his feelings on the increase clear by dropping a wrecking ball onto a junker with the words “Davis Car Tax” spray painted onto the side. Governor Schwarzenegger reduced vehicle taxes down to their previous levels his first day in office...|$|R
50|$|Points {{are given}} for driving {{offences}} by law courts, and the licence is endorsed accordingly.An Indian driving licence may be {{endorsed by the}} courts for various offences, not only for those committed whilst driving or {{in charge of a}} vehicle. If the individual committing the offence does not hold a valid driving licence the driver is subject to be penalised or face imprisonment of up to 3 months.Violation of traffic signals, <b>triple</b> driving on <b>motor</b> cycle, using vehicles without registration or in unsafe condition may endorse and attract 3 negative points in each case.|$|R
50|$|FIFA {{awarded the}} final match {{of the tournament}} to this famous college sports stadium near Los Angeles on June 30, 1992; the Rose Bowl was the largest stadium used for this tournament. The World Cup trophy was {{presented}} to Brazil captain Dunga by then-Vice President of the United States Al Gore. The Brazilian team dedicated their win to the late <b>triple</b> Formula One <b>motor</b> racing world champion Ayrton Senna, {{who had died in}} an accident at that year's San Marino Grand Prix in Italy {{two and a half months}} before. With Italy finishing as runners-up, Franco Baresi became the sixth player in history to win gold, silver and bronze medals at the FIFA World Cup.|$|R
40|$|During this semester's work term I designed, built, {{packaged}} {{and tested}} nine channels of isolation amplifiers {{for each of}} the <b>Triple</b> Axis Servo <b>Motor</b> Controllers to reduce the noise on the analog input and output signals from the motor controller that is under test. This assembly {{has to be able to}} be mounted inside each of the two motor controller enclosures so as not to disturb other components in there. This noise gets jumbled together with the signal and distorts the signal by amplifying it or decreasing the signal giving a false reading. Direct connection can also produce zero shifts in the data mechanical loading. This is referenced to as a "ground loop". This noise and ground loops must be reduced or eliminated. This report discusses how to reduce noise and ground produced when the motor controller analog output signals are connected to the data collecting system. The report outlines the parts needed to build the isolation amplifier and its connecting hardware. Another important topic to be discussed will be the actual testing of the isolation amplifier box to ensure correct operation. The operation of the isolation amplifier chip and motor controller will not be discussed in great detail, as that would be another project all by itself. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
