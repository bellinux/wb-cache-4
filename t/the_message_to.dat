5|$|At 23:00 on 30 March, with {{a strong}} wind from the south, Guillaume Tell sailed from Valletta, Decrés hoping to use the cover of {{darkness}} to escape the British blockade. Dixon had deployed his ships around the island, with Valletta watched by the frigate HMS Penelope under Captain Henry Blackwood. At 23:55, Blackwood's lookouts spotted Guillaume Tell and the captain gave chase, ordering the brig HMS Minorca under Commander George Miller to convey <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> Dixon, whose ships were just visible in the distance. Blackwood also attempted to signal his discovery to his commanding officer as Penelope gave chase.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the insurrection in the Austrian Netherlands, he {{received}} permission from Field Marshal Laudon, shortly before the latter's death, to take a one year novitiate in the Teutonic Order, at Bonn where he remained until April 1792. The outbreak of the War of the First Coalition against France required his military talents and Mervelt rejoined the Habsburg army at as adjutant to Josias, Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. He led two infantry battalions in the Austrian victory at Neerwinden (18March 1793), during which his battalions repulsed a strong French column. For his role at the head of his battalions of grenadiers, which his commander considered greater than duty required, in this victory, Merveldt received the honor of carrying <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the Emperor Francis in Vienna. There, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 7July 1794. Subsequently, he was appointed as an attaché to the staff of Frederick, Duke of York.|$|E

5|$|Janeway {{begins to}} share Seven's suspicions and warns {{the crew to}} stay alert, but remains optimistic. The new engine system is {{compatible}} with Voyager, but the ship wouldn't {{be able to stand}} the stresses of the slipstream for long. The crew would have to abandon the ship to use the Dauntless to travel home. Seven states to Janeway that she would opt to stay behind, feeling that she {{would not be able to}} integrate back on Earth. Janeway reviews the message decoded by Arturis, and discovers <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> be fake. She transports to the Dauntless to confront Arturis. He tries to pin the blame on Seven, but Janeway rejects his claims. Arturis activates a panel on the ship, igniting the engines. All but Janeway and Seven are able to be transported out before the ship enters the slipstream.|$|E
5|$|Not long afterwards, the Kriegsmarine {{launched}} Operation Rheinübung. The Bismarck {{and heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen set {{out into the}} Atlantic from Norway. Their target was the Atlantic Convoys. During the later stage of the Bismarck operation, a Catalina of No. 209 Squadron RAF spotted the vessel, just 650 miles short of his destination port of Brest, France. It relayed <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the British Fleet, enabling Fairey Swordfish aircraft to intercept. An 818 Naval Air Squadron FAA aircraft piloted by Sub-Lieutenant John Moffat hit the Bismarck with a torpedo on its stern, jamming its rudder gears, which eventually led to its sinking. Prinz Eugen had been detached prior to Bismarck last battle. Despite her discovery by Coastal Command's aircraft further south, she escaped to Brest on 1 June. Rheinübung was the last attempt by a Kriegsmarine surface ship to breakout into the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} a maid whose home is {{occupied}} by the Hessian officers when they enter Trenton. Despite her hatred of the British red coats she accepts them and by her conduct dismisses their doubts about her loyalty. When they are resigned to a drunken sleep, for which the maid gladly offered, she takes a message from her wounded American sweetheart. She disguises herself and sets off to deliver <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> George Washington. The maid then leads Washington and his men in crossing the icy Delaware River. When they arrive at the maid's home, her wounded sweetheart lets them in so the historic capture can take place.|$|E

5|$|Under {{pressure}} from Pretoria {{to accept the}} terms, the Rhodesians agreed on 11 December 1974 and followed {{the terms of the}} ceasefire; Rhodesian military actions were temporarily halted and troops were ordered to allow retreating guerrillas to leave unhindered. Vorster withdrew some 2,000 members of the South African Police (SAP) from forward bases in Rhodesia, and by August 1975 had pulled the SAP out of Rhodesia completely. The nationalists used the sudden cessation of security force activity as an opportunity to regroup and re-establish themselves {{both inside and outside the}} country. Guerrilla operations continued: an average of six incidents a day were reported inside Rhodesia over the following months. Far from being seen as a gesture of potential reconciliation, the ceasefire and release of the nationalist leaders gave <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the rural population that the security forces had been defeated and that the guerrillas were in the process of emulating FRELIMO's victory in Mozambique. The détente terms led to the Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, which collapsed after nine-and-a-half hours, each side blaming the other for the break-up.|$|E
5|$|On 17 and 18 June, Tonogal and Lieutenant Colonel Aganović, {{gendarmerie}} commander {{for eastern}} Herzegovina, made {{an attempt to}} calm the situation by visiting villages east of the Gacko–Avtovac road to re-establish peace in the area. They received a written message from four villages {{that they did not}} acknowledge the NDH authorities, and wanted <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> be passed on to the Italians. The residents of the villages of Jasenik and Lipnik were willing to talk and return to work, but they asked that the gendarmerie not visit their villages, as this would tempt the Montenegrins to attack. Aganović assessed that while this was probably true, their request was insincere. The gendarmerie commander in Bileća believed that the reason for the rebellion was that the local Serbs were wedded to the idea of Greater Serbia, and did not accept that their villages were part of the NDH. This approach essentially meant that local Serbs wanted the NDH authorities to leave them alone and not impose on their lives. According to the historian Davor Marijan, this was a poor choice that gave the Ustaše an excuse to take radical action.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attacks on}} the final climb came from Barguil and Van Avermaet, {{followed}} by Yates, while Rodríguez and Valverde waited in the main group. Yates passed Barguil and was chasing Van Avermaet, {{who was in the}} lead of the race. Towards the top of the climb, however, Van Avermaet was hit from behind by one of the motorbikes providing television coverage of the race. He was knocked to the ground and the frame of the bike was broken; Van Avermaet was unable to finish the race. Yates therefore led the race alone {{at the top of the}} final climb as the race descended into San Sebastián. Unlike in the 2014 race, when he had crashed out of the lead group on the final descent, Yates extended his lead to 15 seconds as the road flattened out and was able to keep this advantage to the end of the race. As he crossed the finish line, Yates was unaware that he had won the race, as he believed that the initial breakaway had not been caught. It took some time for <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> come through from his team that he had won. In the group behind, Gilbert sprinted to second place ahead of Valverde.|$|E

Our framework supports a loosely-coupled interaction among web services, based on the publish and subscribe pattern. Moreover, it manages web services as event-driven systems, in order {{to enable them to}} perform their operations in context-dependent way. By decoupling the web service interaction, our framework addresses several interaction protocol mismatches, ranging from differences in the signatures of <b>the</b> <b>messages,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> order and number of <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> be exchanged, including cross-protocol mismatches involving more than two peers...|$|R

50|$|In message-oriented {{middleware}} solutions, fan-out is a <b>messaging</b> pattern used <b>to</b> model an information exchange that implies the delivery (or spreading) of a <b>message</b> <b>to</b> one or multiple destinations possibly in parallel, and not halting {{the process that}} executes <b>the</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>to</b> wait for any response <b>to</b> that <b>message.</b>|$|R
