Due to the {{extremely}} poor living conditions of the family the girls were removed and have since been living with foster carers. Care proceedings commenced in January 2014 and involved communication with the Hungarian Central Authority. Later in 2014 the mother moved back to Hungary and applied for the care proceedings to be transferred to Hungary on the basis of article 15 of Brussels II which allows for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> to a court in another member state that is [...] "better placed to hear the case".|$|E
5000|$|Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 21 (a) {{provides}} for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> to another district if the judge is satisfied that there exists a prejudicial atmosphere. To meet the requirements for a transfer, the trial judge must determine that there exists so great a prejudice {{in favor of the}} prosecution or against the defendant that there is a reasonable likelihood the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial. In the famous 1966 Sam Sheppard case, (Sheppard v. Maxwell) [...] the United States Supreme Court held that where there was a reasonable likelihood that the prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge should continue the case until the threat abates, or transfer it to another county not so permeated with publicity. This doctrine has been annunciated in other cases.|$|E

40|$|Petitioner, a fourteen-year-old girl, {{was charged}} with {{murder in the first}} degree in the county court of Lancaster County. The county court entered an order that there be a {{preliminary}} hearing and the petitioner be held without bail. The youth moved for a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>proceedings</b> against her to the juvenile court on the ground that section 43 - 2111 imposed a mandatory duty upon a magistrate to <b>transfer</b> the case <b>of</b> a delinquent child under sixteen years of age to the juvenile court. This motion was overruled by the county judge of Lancaster County. The petitioner filed in the district court of Lancaster County a petition for a writ of prohibition prohibiting the county judge from holding a preliminary hearing upon the complaint. From an order of the district court denying the writ of prohibition, the petitioner appealed. Held: The juvenile courts do not have the sole or exclusive jurisdiction of children under eighteen years of age who have violated Nebraska law; the county attorney is not limited by the Juvenile Court Act in his duty to file proper complaints against wrongdoers and prosecute the same; a preliminary hearing on a felony charge is not a case within the meaning of section 43 - 2112...|$|R

The starting point for any consideration is the place where the criminal conduct took place. Sometimes the crime is such that criminal jurisdiction will be fixed - such as theft of property, crimes of violence - where others have an impact or criminal conduct in more than one jurisdiction - drug importation, major transnational drug dealing, human trafficking, terrorism...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Princeton Principles on Universal Jurisdiction define {{universal}} jurisdiction as “criminal jurisdiction {{based solely on}} the nature of the crime, without regard to where the crime was committed, the nationality of the alleged or the convicted perpetrator, the nationality of the victim, or any other connection to the state exercising such jurisdiction. ” This is not the appropriate forum in which to attempt to define {{universal jurisdiction}}; a general understanding of the theory is essential to distinguish what universality is not, especially with respect to an assessment of conventional law. Both the Council of Europe and the European Union have legislated on the issue of concurrent jurisdiction and the solution of conflicts of jurisdiction. It is irrelevant whether the jurisdictional principle applied is universal jurisdiction or any other principle of jurisdiction: what matters is the fact that there is overlapping jurisdiction. But there is no country that would establish express “criteria” to decide upon competing national jurisdictions. According to the Rome Statute, International Criminal Court jurisdiction is complementary to national ones. The ICC cannot request the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> as long as they are pending in a domestic Court...|$|E
40|$|Resumé International {{trafficking}} in drugs {{is one of}} the gravest global issues. Its combating deserves due attention. In {{the course of the last}} hundred years, a series of international conventions were adopted for this cause. The crucial international legal instruments for combating illicit drug trafficking are the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971) and foremost, the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988). The first two Conventions focus primarily on legal manipulation with narcotic and psychotropic substances via administrative measures. The goal is to limit them for medical and scientific use only and thus prevent their transfer into illegal channels. The third Convention deals with drug control via criminal law measures. The Parties to the Convention are to incriminate certain offences connected to drug trafficking and apply appropriate sanctions. The Convention also introduces measures against the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> of crime. It further deals with confiscation, extradition, jurisdiction issues and mutual legal assistance. The main bodies in the international fight against illegal trafficking are the UN Commission on Narcotics, International Narcotics Control Board and UN Office [...] ...|$|E

Concentration <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> {{is a means of}} ensuring expeditious, economical and effective civil process. In Czech law, it applies in particular in the contentious <b>proceedings.</b> Concentration <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> is closely related to the principle of concentration which one of the general principles of civil law procedure, and is opposed to the principle of unitary process. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> may take place at several points in time in the process in connection {{with the end of the}} preparatory meeting, of the first hearing and the announcement of the first instance judicial ruling. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> is necessarily interconnected with the "principle of partial appelation" which applies in appeal proceedings against first instance judicial rulings under the Act.
