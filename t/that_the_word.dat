5|$|It {{is claimed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> orange has no true rhyme. There are, however, several half rhymes or near-rhymes, {{as well as}} some proper nouns and {{compound}} words or phrases that rhyme with it. This lack of rhymes has inspired many humorous poems and songs.|$|E
5|$|Nozaki also {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> kitsune was originally onomatopoetic. Kitsu represented a fox's yelp {{and came to}} be the general word for fox. -Ne signifies an affectionate mood.|$|E

5|$|Ōtsuki Fumihiko in Daigenkai (1932–1935) proposes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> {{comes from}} kitsu, which is onomatopoeia for {{the bark of}} a fox, and ne, which may be an affix or an honorific word meaning a servant of an Inari shrine.|$|E
5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required {{the permission of}} the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Operation Ten-Go is revered {{to some degree}} in modern Japan as {{evidenced}} by appearances of the story in popular Japanese culture which usually portray the event as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland. One {{of the reasons the}} event may have such significance in Japanese culture is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Yamato was often used as a poetic name for Japan. Thus, the end of battleship Yamato could serve {{as a metaphor for the}} end of the Japanese empire.|$|E
5|$|Three major {{theological}} controversies {{occurred during}} Manuel's reign. In 1156–1157 {{the question was}} raised whether Christ had offered himself as a sacrifice {{for the sins of}} the world to the Father and to the Holy Spirit only, or also to the Logos (i.e., to himself). In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with Müllerian mimicry, a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may have a degree of protection itself, the distinction is not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of mimicry. Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive mimicry, where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Sifra {{reported}} <b>that</b> Rabbi Akiva taught <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of [...] "you shall {{love your}} neighbor as yourself," [...] state the encompassing {{principle of the}} Torah. But Ben Azzai taught <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of [...] "This is {{the book of the}} generations of Adam," [...] state a still more encompassing principle. Similarly, a Midrash reported that Ben Azzai taught <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of [...] "This is the book of the descendants of Adam," [...] teach a great principle of the Torah. But Rabbi Akiva replied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of [...] "you shall love your neighbor as yourself," [...] teach an even greater principle. Hence, one must not say, [...] "Since I have been put to shame, let my neighbor be put to shame." [...] And Rabbi Tanhuma taught that those who do so must know Whom they put to shame, for [...] reports of humankind, [...] "In the likeness of God made He him." ...|$|R

5|$|Further, {{he points}} out that the {{language}} used by the Beowulf poet was already archaic, and the choice of words was at the time recognisably poetic. Tolkien gives as an example beorn, which meant both 'bear' and 'warrior', but only in heroic poetry could it be used to mean 'man'. He advises the translator to prefer 'striking' and 'smiting', and to avoid 'hitting' and 'whacking'. But on the other hand, he criticises William Morris for using the dead and unintelligible 'leeds' for OE leode ('freemen', 'people'; cf German leute), even if antiquarians feel <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> ought to have survived. Tolkien does not accept the etymological fallacy either: mod means 'pride', not 'mood'; burg is 'stronghold', not 'borough', even though the modern word derives from the old one.|$|E
5|$|In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is {{attributed}} {{with the power}} of working miracles. In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life. While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman whose husband is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true. Tulsidas said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> has passed his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to close their eyes and uttered the name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.|$|E
5|$|While Zwingli {{carried on}} the {{political}} work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist originated when Andreas Karlstadt, Luther's former colleague from Wittenberg, published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a real presence in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including de Eucharistia (On the Eucharist). He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> is {{in the words of the}} institution—"This is my body, this is my blood"—means signifies. Hence, the words are understood as a metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the eucharist. In effect, the meal was symbolic of the Last Supper.|$|E

5|$|Du Bois was {{the first}} African American invited by the American Historical Association (AHA) to present a paper at their annual conference. He read his paper, Reconstruction and Its Benefits, to an astounded {{audience}} at the AHA's December 1909 conference. The paper went against the mainstream historical view, promoted by the Dunning School of scholars at Columbia University, that Reconstruction was a disaster, caused by the ineptitude and sloth of blacks. To the contrary, Du Bois asserted that the brief period of African-American leadership in the South accomplished three important goals: democracy, free public schools, and new social welfare legislation. He asserted {{that it was the}} federal government's failure to manage the Freedmen's Bureau, to distribute land, and to establish an educational system, that doomed African-American prospects in the South. When Du Bois submitted the paper for publication a few months later in the American Historical Review, he asked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Negro be capitalized. The editor, J. Franklin Jameson, refused, and published the paper without the capitalization. The paper was mostly ignored by white historians. Du Bois later developed his paper as his ground-breaking 1935 book, Black Reconstruction, which marshaled extensive facts to support his assertions. The AHA did not invite another African-American speaker until 1940.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people even}} claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> soldier itself {{comes from the}} Latin sal dare (to give salt), but {{mainstream}} sources disagree, noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> soldier more likely derives from the gold solidus introduced by Diocletian in 301 CE.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> medieval manuscript {{represents the}} 4th-century tradition (or even earlier), while others believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Words</b> of Institution were originally present and were later dropped, {{probably due to}} the liturgical reform of Mar Isho-Yab III in about AD 650. The former include Macomber and Spinks, the latter H. Engerding and E. Mazza. B.
