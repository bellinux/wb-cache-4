40|$|Development of a fast spatial {{scanning}} pyrometer for {{temperature measurements}} above 1500 K is described. The salient {{features of the}} pyrometer are: (1) it measures spectral radiance temperature (at 0. 65 micron) at 1024 points along a straight line (25 mm long) on the target; (2) it has no moving parts and uses a self-scanning linear array of silicon photodiodes as the detector; (3) its output is recorded digitally every 1 microsec with a full-scale resolution of about 1 part in 4000, permitting performance of a complete cycle of measurements (1024 points) in about 1 ms. Operational characteristics of the pyrometer are given. Examples of measurements of the temperature along rapidly heated (resistive self-heating) specimens (rod, <b>tube,</b> <b>strip)</b> are presented. Potential use of the pyrometer in the experiments, both ground-based and in microgravity, requiring temperature mapping and property distribution of the specimen at high temperatures is discussed...|$|E

30|$|KPC gene. This {{molecular}} method couples {{nucleic acid}} sequence-based amplification (NASBA) with real-time procedure assay. NASBA is a sensitive, isothermal, transcription-based amplification system {{designed specifically for}} the detection of KPC RNA target in real time mode. Nucleic acid amplification uses primers that are specific for KPC RNA sequences and for the synthetic KPC internal control RNA. Any KPC RNA present in the sample is co-amplified along with the internal control otherwise other nucleic acid sequences will not be amplified. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, a 0.5 McFarland suspension of each isolate was prepared from an overnight non selective culture plate and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The reaction mixture was prepared in the <b>tube</b> <b>strip</b> by transferring 2.5 μl of internal control solution, 2.5 μl of heated bacterial suspension, 10 μl of primers solution (including both primers, molecular beacon probes and nucleotides) and incubated for 2 minutes at 65 °C and 2 minutes at 41 °C. After addition of 5 μL of enzyme mix (AMV-RT, RNase H and T 7 RNA polymerase, bovine serum albumin), amplification was followed for 90 minutes at 41 °C in NucliSENSE EasyQ Analyzer (bioMérieux, France) according to the assay protocol. Results were validated for each isolate according to the amplification of the internal control.|$|E

Indium in the form of indium tin oxide (ITO) is used as a capacitive sensor in a wide array of high-tech applications such as liquid crystal displays, light emitting diodes, touch screens, and photovoltaics. Indium is a by-product of zinc mining and the primary zinc ore mineral is sphalerite (ZnS). Sphalerite is the most important indium-bearing mineral; indium is incorporated into sphalerite by way of the coupled substitution, Cu I +In III↔ 2 ZnII. The purpose of my research is to identify the thermodynamic parameters that determine the indium concentration in hydrothermal ore systems.

50|$|In antiquity, jewelry often contains, in {{the form}} of chains and applied decoration, large amounts of wire that is {{accurately}} made and which must have been produced by some efficient, if not technically advanced, means. In some cases, strips cut from metal sheet were made into wire by pulling them through perforations in stone beads. This causes the strips to fold round on themselves to form thin <b>tubes.</b> This <b>strip</b> drawing technique was in use in Egypt by the 2nd Dynasty. From the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE most of the gold wires in jewellery are characterised by seam lines that follow a spiral path along the wire. Such twisted strips can be converted into solid round wires by rolling them between flat surfaces or the strip wire drawing method. The strip twist wire manufacturing method was superseded by drawing in the ancient Old World sometime between about the 8th and 10th centuries AD. There is some evidence for the use of drawing further East prior to this period.|$|R
