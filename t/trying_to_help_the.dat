The Opposition, as well as Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, criticized the Government on the issue, stating they were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> Republicans by helping Hillary Clinton win the Democratic nomination instead of Obama. They also alleged the leak would hurt relations with the United States if Obama ever were to become President. Obama was elected President in November. In February, Obama made his first foreign visit, as president, to Ottawa, in which he affirmed support for free trade with Canada, as well as complimenting Canada on its involvement in Afghanistan.|$|E

25|$|On October 7, 1822, Judge Elihu Bay convicted {{four white}} men for a {{misdemeanor}} in inciting slaves to insurrection during the Denmark Vesey slave conspiracy. These four white men were William Allen, John Igneshias, Andrew S. Rhodes, and Jacob Danders; they {{were sentenced to}} varied fines and reasonably short jail time. Historians have {{found no evidence that}} any of these men was a known abolitionist; they do not seem to have had contact with each other or any of the plotters of the rebellion. William Allen received twelve months in prison and a $1,000 fine, which was the harshest punishment of the four. When tried in court, Allen admitted to <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> slave conspiracy, but said that he did so because he was promised a large sum of money for his services. Reports from the judge show that the court believed that Allen was motivated by greed rather than any sympathy for the slaves.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Dunham {{opened the}} Performing Arts Training Center (PATC) in East St. Louis {{as an attempt}} to use the arts to combat poverty and urban unrest. It served as a {{catharsis}} after the 1968 riots, during which she encouraged gang members in the ghetto to vent their frustrations with drumming and dance. The PATC drew on former members of Dunham's touring company as well as local residents for its teaching staff. While <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> young people in the community she was even jailed herself, making international headlines which quickly embarrassed local police officials to release her. She also continued refining and teaching the Dunham Technique to transmit that knowledge to succeeding generations of dance students, and lecturing at annual Masters' Seminars in St. Louis that attracted dance students from around the world every summer until her death. She also established the Katherine Dunham Centers for Arts and Humanities in East St. Louis to preserve Haitian and African instruments and artifacts from her own personal collection.|$|E
25|$|On {{the death}} of Miro, his son Eburic was made king, but {{apparently}} not before sending tokens of appreciation and of friendship to Leovigild. Not a year later his brother-in-law, named Audeca, accompanied by the army seized power. He took Eburic into a monastery and ordered him a priest, so preventing him regaining the throne. Then Audeca married Siseguntia, king Miro's widow, and made himself king. This usurpation and the friendship granted by Eboric gave Leovigild the opportunity to seize the neighboring kingdom. In 585 Leovigild went to war against the Sueves, invading Galicia. In words of John of Biclaro: “King Leovigild devastates Galicia and deprives Audeca of {{the totality of the}} Kingdom; the nation of the Sueves, their treasure and fatherland are conduced to his own power and turned into a province of the Goths.” During the campaign, the Franks of king Guntram attacked Septimania, maybe <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> Sueves, at the same time sending ships to Galicia which were intercepted by Leovigild's troops, who took their cargo and killed or enslaved most of their crews. Thus was the kingdom transferred to the Goths as one of their three administrative regions, Gallaecia, Hispania and Galia Narboniensis. Audeca, captured, was tonsured and ordered a priest, then sent into exile in Beja, in Southern Lusitania.|$|E

25|$|Their {{preliminary}} versions used primitive art {{assets to}} allow them to focus on the game. This helped them to realize that they were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> player become invested in the characters they controlled, allowing their imagination to fill in what their graphics at the time could not. Only as they neared the August 2011 Game Developers Conference in China after about six months of work, where they planned to submit FTL as part of the Independent Games Festival there, did they start focusing on the game's art. The game was named as a finalist at the IGF China competition, leading to initial media exposure for the game. PC Gamer magazine offered an early preview of the game that created more media interest in time for the Independent Games Festival at the March 2012 Games Developer Conference. The OnLive cloud-based gaming service included FTL and other Independent Games Festival finalists for several weeks around the conference. At the Festival, FTL was nominated for, though did not win, the Grand Prize and the Excellent in Design award; these accolades further helped spark interest in the game. Davis considered that the game's involvement in these competitions were important to keep the game's development on a forward schedule, as judges and members of the press would be expecting playable prototypes of the completed title. He believed that the publicity of being a part of these competitions, even if not as a nominated title, helped to garner interest in FTL by the larger public.|$|E

However, Oppong informed the Power's management {{that he wanted to}} [...] attend the University of Windsor so that he could become a teacher in the future. The Power negotiated a trade with the Windsor Express that saw Oppong join the Express in exchange for a second-round draft pick. He signed with the Express on September 8, the same day as fellow acquisitions Quinnel Brown and DeAndre Thomas. Oppong debuted for his new team on November 1, 2013, with 15 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists in a win over the London Lightning. He surpassed the 20-point mark against his former team, the Power, on December 21, as he added a season-best 23 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 steals. Early the 2013 playoffs, head coach Bill Jones was forced to use Oppong as a substitute for star guard Stefan Bonneau, who was struggling with a knee injury. The backup most notably notched 16 points in Game 4 of his team's semifinal series vs the Lightning. Oppong said, [...] "I wouldn't say it's a lot of pressure.
