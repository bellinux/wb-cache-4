His arrival – now almost <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> and just married – in Bloemfontein in August 1874 {{was the start of}} a residency of twenty-one years, as well as the start of a glowing career, to be crowned with his election as State President.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from three}} destroyers {{launched}} in 1940 and four submarines from the inter-war years, Brazil's warships were old and mostly obsolete pre-First World War vessels. The mainstays of the fleet, Minas Geraes, São Paulo, , and , {{were all over}} <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> Although Minas Geraes had been further refitted from 1939 to 1943, the ship was still too old and in too poor a condition for any {{active role in the}} Second World War; instead, the dreadnought was anchored as a floating battery in the port of Salvador {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Clark {{was just}} <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> when the Revolutionary War ended, but his {{greatest}} military achievements were already behind him. After Clark's {{victories in the}} Illinois country, settlers continued to pour into Kentucky and live illegally on Indian land north of the Ohio River. From 1784 to 1788 Clark served as the superintendent-surveyor for Virginia's war veterans, surveying lands granted to them for their service in the war. The position brought Clark a small income, but he devoted very little time to the enterprise.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{about one}} percent of the total {{vegetation}} in the park consisted of grasses, bracken, thistle, and fireweed in sections of the forest cleared two to five years earlier. Another two percent had reached the shrub stage, between three and <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> with small trees dominated by such plants as thimbleberry, salmonberry, and blackberry. Forest areas 10 to 30years old that contained tall alder and maple trees and smaller conifers accounted for about 20percent of the park.|$|E
5|$|To become {{lieutenant}} governor of Indiana, a candidate {{must have been}} a United States citizen and lived within Indiana for the period of five consecutive years before the election. The candidate must also be at least <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> when sworn into office. The {{lieutenant governor}} may not hold any federal office during his term, and must resign from any such position before being eligible to be sworn in as lieutenant governor. Before taking the office, the candidate must swear an oath of office administered by the Chief Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court, promising to uphold the constitution and laws of Indiana.|$|E

5|$|According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan was <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> {{when he came}} to {{the throne}} in 924, which would mean that he was born in about 894. He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest. He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying {{descriptions}} of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also disagree about her status. Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine. However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that there is no reason to doubt that she was Edward's legitimate wife. She may have been related to St Dunstan.|$|E

He was <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> and recently widowed. Nothing ever came of these rumors however.|$|E

25|$|In the gospels, the {{ministry}} of Jesus starts with his Baptism by John the Baptist, when he is about <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> Jesus then begins preaching in Galilee and gathers disciples. After the proclamation of Jesus as Christ, three of the disciples witness his Transfiguration. After the death of John the Baptist and the Transfiguration, Jesus starts his final journey to Jerusalem, having predicted his own death there. Jesus makes a triumphal entry into Jerusalem, and once there friction with the Pharisees increases {{and one of his}} disciples agrees to betray him for thirty pieces of silver.|$|E
25|$|At the Sixth Congress, Zhou {{delivered}} a long speech insisting that conditions in China were not favorable for immediate revolution, {{and that the}} main task of the CCP should be to develop revolutionary momentum by winning over {{the support of the}} masses in the countryside and establishing a Soviet regime in southern China, similar to the one that Mao Zedong and Zhu De were already establishing around Jiangxi. The Congress generally accepted Zhou's assessment as accurate. Xiang Zhongfa was made secretary general of the Party, but was soon found incapable of fulfilling his role, so Zhou emerged as the de facto leader of the CCP.

25|$|Bastion Properties was {{in trouble}} because of {{building}} costs and an unsatisfactory building manager. After rapid expansion, Heseltine's businesses were badly hit by the Selwyn Lloyd financial squeeze of 1961 and, still not yet <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> he would eventually owe £250,000 (around £4.5 million at 2016 prices). He claims to have been lent a badly needed £85,000 in December 1962 by a bank manager who retired the same day. Later, during the 1990s, Heseltine joked about how he had avoided bankruptcy by such stratagems as paying bills only when threatened with legal action, although he eventually settled all his debts. It was during this stressful period of his life that he took up gardening as a serious hobby.|$|E
25|$|Offences against ecclesiastical {{laws are}} dealt with {{differently}} {{based on whether}} the laws in question involve church doctrine. For non-doctrinal cases, {{the lowest level of}} the court is the Archdeaconry Court, which is presided over by the local archdeacon. The next court in the hierarchy is the bishop's court, which is in the Diocese of Canterbury called the Commissary Court and in other dioceses the consistory court. The Commissary Court is presided over by a commissary-general; a consistory Court is presided over by a chancellor. The chancellor or commissary-general must be <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> and either have a seven-year general qualification under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 section 71 or have held high judicial office.|$|E
25|$|Diocesan bishops are {{required}} to appoint a judicial vicar to whom is delegated the bishop's ordinary power to judge cases (canon 1420 of the Code of Canon Law, canon 191 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches). In the Latin church, the judicial vicar may also be called officialis. The person holding this post must be a priest, have earned a doctorate in canon law (or at least a license), be at least <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> and, unless the smallness of the diocese or {{the limited number of}} cases suggests otherwise, must not be the vicar general. As one of the jobs of the judicial vicar is to preside over collegiate tribunals, many dioceses have adjutant judicial vicars who can preside over collegiate tribunals in place of the judicial vicar and must have the same qualifications.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{different}} statements on why the couple's relationship ended in 1973. Robert Lacey wrote in his 2008 book, Royal: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, that Charles had met Camilla too early, {{and that he had}} not asked her to wait for him when he went overseas for military duties. Sarah Bradford wrote in her 2007 book, Diana, that a member of the close circle of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten claimed Mountbatten arranged for Charles to be taken overseas to end the relationship with Camilla to make way for an engagement between his granddaughter, Amanda Knatchbull, and Charles. Some sources suggest the Queen Mother did not approve of the marriage because she wanted Charles to marry one of the Spencer family granddaughters of her close friend, Lady Fermoy. Other sources also suggest Camilla did not want to marry Charles but instead wanted to marry Andrew Parker Bowles since she had an on and off relationship with Parker Bowles that began in the 1960s or that Charles had decided he would not marry until he was <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b>|$|E
