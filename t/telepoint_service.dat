50|$|Rabbit was a British location-specific (<b>Telepoint)</b> {{telephone}} <b>service</b> {{backed by}} Hutchison, which later created the Orange GSM mobile network, followed by 3. The Rabbit network was the best-known of four such services {{introduced in the}} 1980s, the others being Phonepoint, Mercury Callpoint and Zonephone. Although Hutchison had been issued a licence for Rabbit in 1989, the service was not launched until May 1992. <b>Telepoint</b> <b>services</b> such as Rabbit allowed subscribers to carry specially designed (CT2) home phone handsets with them and make outgoing calls whenever they were within 100 metres of a Rabbit transmitter.|$|R
