5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's <b>The</b> <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising. During the publicity for <b>The</b> <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E
5|$|Daybreaker debuted {{at number}} one on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart and at number 42 on the UK Album Charts for selling 3,208 copies. It became the highest-charting release by Architects in their five-album career; <b>The</b> <b>Here</b> <b>And</b> Now had reached number 57. The next week, the album fell to number 12 on the Rock & Metal, then to number 33, and it left the chart the {{following}} week. The album debuted on the US Top Heatseekers chart at number 28, selling 1,200 copies in its first week. In Belgium, the album charted at number 182, and in Germany at number 93.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 Harris's {{short stories}} were {{collected}} {{under the title}} Away from <b>the</b> <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> Now. Her stories have also been reprinted in anthologies such as Daughters of Earth: Feminist Science Fiction in the 20th Century (with a critical essay), Sci-Fi Womanthology, Amazing Science Fiction Anthology: The Wonder Years 1926-1935, and Gosh Wow! Sense of Wonder Science Fiction. She wrote one novel, Persephone of Eleusis: A Romance of Ancient Greece (1923).|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 2000s, Astley {{continued}} touring across the globe, touring with various other 1980s acts, such as Boy George and Belinda Carlisle, in <b>the</b> <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> Now Tour. In April 2009, he {{wrote an article}} for Time about moot.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to humanistic counseling and therapy is Gestalt therapy, which puts {{a focus on}} <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now, especially {{as an opportunity to}} look past any preconceived notions and focus on how the present is affected by the past. Role playing also plays a large role in Gestalt therapy and allows for a true expression of feelings that may not have been shared in other circumstances. In Gestalt therapy, non-verbal cues are an important indicator of how the client may actually be feeling, despite the feelings expressed.|$|E

25|$|Early 20th century theorists, such as Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler (students of Carl Stumpf) saw {{objects as}} {{perceived}} within an environment {{according to all}} of their elements taken together as a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to define principles of perception—seemingly innate mental laws that determined the way objects were perceived. It is based on <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now, {{and in the way}} things are seen. Images can be divided into figure or ground. The question is what is perceived at first glance: the figure in front, or the background.|$|E
25|$|In Terry Hands' 1977 {{production}} for the Royal Shakespeare Company, Margaret (played by Helen Mirren) {{tried to bring}} Henry {{back from the brink}} of madness by engaging his mind in an elaborate, difficult to follow verbal dance. Henry's preceding speech to Suffolk, where he demands Suffolk not look at him, and then immediately demands that he wants to look into Suffolk's eyes was played by Alan Howard {{in such a way as}} to suggest that Henry was losing his grip on reality, and in response to this, Mirren played the speech in such a way as to engage Henry's mind in <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now, focus his thoughts and prevent them drifting away.|$|E
25|$|His poems display {{neither the}} {{incoherence}} of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, {{the possibility of}} the future. All he had was the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for all he {{had to say about the}} present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently Kees did not feel the imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|E

25|$|Rosenzweig's major work is The Star of Redemption (first {{published}} in 1921). It is {{a description of}} the relationships between God, humanity, and the world, as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. If one makes a diagram with God at the top, and the World and the Self below, the inter-relationships generate a Star of David map. He is critical of any attempt to replace actual human existence with an ideal. In Rosenzweig's scheme, revelation arises not in metaphysics but in <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now. We are called to love God, and to do so is to return to the world, and that is redemption.|$|E
25|$|The Maritime Festivals {{were founded}} by Gerard Richardson MBE and {{organised}} by the Whitehaven Festival Company, {{made up of}} a board of volunteers, who organised 17 major events between 1999 and 2015. The Company was closed in 2016. They organised the Queen's visit to Whitehaven in June 2008, followed by the Status Quo gig in August of that year. The company staged two events in August 2009. The first was the redesigned festival (known for this year as the Whitehaven Food Festival, although it did still feature tall ships) which offered the usual wide variety of attractions, both around the southern half of the harbour and at St. Nicholas' Church, on 8–9 August. The second event, the following week, was <b>the</b> <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> Now Gig (a music concert with 1980s pop icons). For the June 2010 festival, which was similar in format to 2009, the music performances (Status Quo, N-Dubz and Katherine Jenkins) were moved to the harbour area.|$|E

500|$|For Ursula Franklin, {{technology}} {{is a set of}} practices in the [...] "here and now" [...] rather than an array of machines or gadgets. It is also a comprehensive system. [...] "Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset." [...] Her definition is similar to the French thinker Jacques Ellul's concept of technique. Like Ellul, Franklin asserts that technological methods dominate the modern world. [...] "Technology has built the house in which we all live," [...] she writes, [...] "today there is hardly any human activity that does not occur within this house." [...] As such, {{technology is}} a central element of <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now. [...] "In the broadest sense of the term, <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now is our environment, that is, all that is around us—the ever-changing overlay of nature, the built environment, the institutional and social structures within which human activities take place, as well as the activities themselves—'the way things are done around here.'" [...] Franklin sees her studies of technology as an attempt to understand how technological practices affect the advancement of justice and peace.|$|E
500|$|According to Andrew Kelham, Daybreaker is an [...] "urgent and resurgent" [...] record; it {{has been}} {{identified}} by critics as metalcore, progressive metal, mathcore and post-hardcore. Architects have been credited for fusing the intense technicality and metallic style of Hollow Crown with the [...] "soaring vocals" [...] and the much improved production of <b>The</b> <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> Now. The album is defined {{by a number of}} features, including a contrast of singing and extreme metal screaming, and melodic choruses complemented by [...] "soaring" [...] vocals, technical guitar work with palm muted breakdowns and the use of string instruments and piano to generate atmosphere. Daybreaker is noted for fusing influences from Architects' previous two albums <b>The</b> <b>Here</b> <b>And</b> Now and Hollow Crown; many reviewers have cited the album as a return to the band's heavier, more technical roots. When he interviewed the band, Kelham wrote, [...] "some will see Daybreaker as an apology, but it's not. Others will view it as a hasty attempt to claw back the glories of third album Hollow Crown, but it's not that either. It's a collection of songs about moving on, growing up and making sense of what has come before".|$|E
500|$|Harris began {{publishing}} in 1926, {{and soon}} became well liked by readers. [...] She sold {{a total of}} eleven stories, which were collected in 1947 as Away From <b>the</b> <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> Now. [...] Her gender {{was a surprise to}} Gernsback, the editor who first bought her work, as she was the first woman to publish science fiction stories under her own name. [...] Her stories, which often feature strong female characters, have been occasionally reprinted and have received some positive critical response, including a recognition of her pioneering role as a woman writer in a male-dominated field.|$|E

500|$|In {{a session}} of psychodrama, one client {{of the group}} becomes the protagonist, and focuses on a particular, personal, emotionally {{problematic}} situation to enact on stage. A variety of scenes may be enacted, depicting, for example, memories of specific happenings in the client's past, unfinished situations, inner dramas, fantasies, dreams, preparations for future risk-taking situations, or unrehearsed expressions of mental states in <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now. [...] These scenes either approximate real-life situations or are externalizations of inner mental processes. Other {{members of the group}} may become auxiliaries, and support the protagonist by playing other significant roles in the scene or may step in, as a [...] "double" [...] who plays the role of the protagonist.|$|E
500|$|Songs {{recorded}} {{during early}} demo sessions after <b>The</b> <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> Now became b-sides for re-releases. During this time, the band became certain {{they wished to}} make another [...] "heavy" [...] record. Tom Searle said, [...] "some people might say we've regressed, but I think we've found our enthusiasm for playing heavy music again. I'm excited again by what I've come up with on guitar and lyrically it's much more political and less personal." [...] The band started to write socially aware lyrics during the writing phase of Daybreaker; vocalist Sam Carter {{said this was a}} result of the band touring the world and seeing things he felt were downplayed by the media.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} {{discussing}} the religious themes in Harrison's songwriting, Allison qualifies the literal message of [...] "Be Here Now" [...] by stating, [...] "this song {{must be understood}} as an endorsement [...] ", yet it is [...] "hardly the typical George". Allison cites a number of compositions from throughout Harrison's career, all covering issues of karma and reincarnation, as evidence that Harrison [...] "encourages {{all of us to}} ponder our inescapable end and so imagine the future", rather than focusing only on <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now. Harrison would return to the specific theme of [...] "Be Here Now" [...] in later songs such as [...] "Flying Hour" [...] and [...] "Just for Today", the last of which adopts the here-and-now message as an inspirational statement for members of Alcoholics Anonymous.|$|E
