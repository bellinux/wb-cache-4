40|$|In this paper, two {{preprocessing}} {{methods are}} presented: <b>the</b> <b>Hamming</b> window and <b>the</b> flip and reverse in time methods, {{to process the}} incoming signale before the FFT routine. The reason for doing this preprocessing adjustments is that the FFT routine requires the input signals start and end at the lame level. With <b>the</b> <b>Hamming</b> window method, <b>the</b> original signal is multiplied it by <b>the</b> <b>Hamming</b> window function. With the flip and reverse in time method, simply flip and reverse the original signal. The saccadic eye movements were used in this research. These signals do not start and end at the same level. The {{results show that the}} flip and reverse technique is better than <b>the</b> <b>Hamming</b> window for saccadic eye movement data. <b>The</b> <b>Hamming</b> window technique multiplies the original signal with a cosine wave. Multiplication in the time domain is equivalent to convolution in the frequency domain, which would be the same a ~ filtering or averaging in the time domain. Therefore, FFT produced with <b>the</b> <b>Hamming</b> window is smoother than the one produced with the flip and reverse method. ...|$|R
