500|$|Writer David Wolstencroft {{decided that}} Tom Quinn would use IT as his cover story for Ellie Simm, because IT has, {{according}} to Wolstencroft, [...] "something {{that has an}} enormous amount of thought and technical fact behind it that nobody would really understand," [...] and according to series producer Jane Featherstone, has people reluctant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> questions about. A scene where a cat escaped during Zoe's operation to bug Kane's cottage, and the ensuing search in the rain mirrored an experience during Wolstencroft's early career. It was also intended that the episode established that although spies plan heavily before operations, things can go wrong. Among the main cast, Peter Firth was attracted to appearing on Spooks after hearing of Howard Brenton's involvement in the series. The cast were advised by ex-MI5 officers in order to help give insight into how the characters operate in the spy world and how their personal lives would be affected by it. The character Maisie Simm (Heather Cave), Ellie's daughter, was created because Featherstone believed that [...] "children are the best spies of all"; Maisie is often seen [...] "spying" [...] on Tom throughout the episode and first series. Megan Dodds guest starred as Christine Dale; the producers were sufficiently impressed with her performance that she would later return as Dale in the second series.|$|E

[...] "He should have been playing,” said test {{selector}} Mark Waugh. “From an Australian point of view, he’s quite capable of playing Test match cricket. You need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> the Victorian selectors why they left him out. It surely can’t be cricket-related because {{he would be in}} the team.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Idol Gives Back is {{the name}} of a {{charitable}} campaign that spanned two episodes of American Idol during its sixth season. [...] A second Idol Gives Back concert and fundraiser occurred on April 9, 2008, during the seventh season of the show. Idol Gives Back was not held in 2009 due to the ongoing economic crisis and recession. The executive producer released a statement saying that it [...] was not the time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> for money from the American public. However, the fundraiser returned on April 21, 2010 during the top 7 results show of season 9. It did not return in future seasons.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lively and}} {{protracted}} trial included [...] "abuse and threats against , deposition changes, excommunications of priests, abusive arrests, assassination attempts and threats of suicide." [...] An actress and a homemaker {{were called in}} to testify whether they were the Metropolitan's mistresses, while Chiricescu produced as evidence a letter in which Atanasie appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> for antivenereal medicine. Of those who retracted their testimony in a more visible way was Nifon Niculescu, who, as Bishop of the Lower Danube, also held {{a seat on the}} Synod itself. The press claimed that his change of heart was induced by a government sponsorship. On June 20, 1911, the Synod offered the parties a final chance to withdraw their accusations; both refused. The Synod also offered both bishops a chance to sign in their resignation and vacate their seats simultaneously. Prompted by Chiricescu, Safirin refused—he feared that Arion was setting a trap for him.|$|E
