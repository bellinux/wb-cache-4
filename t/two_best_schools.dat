However both schools, have received heavy criticism in the past for their Christian-only admissions policies. These used to ensure that the children of non-Anglican families were excluded from the <b>two</b> <b>best</b> <b>schools</b> in the Oldham area on entirely religious grounds. This faith-based admissions policy proved controversial, and led to accusations that the predominantly white, Christian school was wholly unrepresentative of the ethnic makeup of the local area. It should be noted that approximately 25% of Oldham's 250,000 strong population consists of Muslim families, the majority of which are originally of Pakistani and Bangladeshi extraction ...|$|E

40|$|Institutional Ranking {{has become}} a common {{practice}} in higher educational institutions, and business schools are the most benefitted by such ranking announced worldwide based on various ranking criteria. The ranking is usually based on pedagogy, placement, research output, faculty-student ratio, international linkage, management of technology etc. In this paper, based on six postulates, we have argued and analysed why the performance of higher educational institutions {{should be based on}} sole criteria of Institutional Research Performance (IRP). We have developed a model of measuring research productivity for higher educational institutions based on calculating institutional research index and weighted research index. The institutional research productivity is calculated using a metric which consists of three institutional variables and one parameter. The three variables identified are the following : Number of Articles published in peer reviewed journals (A), Number of Books published (B), and Number of Case studies and/or Book Chapters (C) published during a given time of observation. The parameter used is a number of full-time Faculty members (F) which remains constant during a given period of observation. A framework for institutional ranking based on institutional research productivity by considering calculated Institutional Research Index is also developed which can be used to give grades to higher educational institutions. Further, the model is tested by making use of case example of <b>two</b> <b>best</b> Business <b>Schools</b> from the USA and <b>two</b> <b>best</b> Business <b>Schools</b> from India. The value of research index and weighted research index are calculated for these institutions and observed variation of research productivity during last four years is also studied and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Background: Admission to {{undergraduate}} {{medical training}} in Germany occurs by central and local pathways. Central admission includes two distinct groups: Students with top school-leaving grades (best-SLG group) {{and students with}} inferior school-leaving grades who are admitted with a delay of up to seven years (delayed admission group). Students with academic difficulties and early dropouts are present in both groups. Local admission at our university involves the German Test for Medical Studies (TMS) and allows the admission by merit of students {{with a wide range}} of school-leaving grades. Aims: To examine the justification of a TMS-based strategy to reduce the admission of potentially weak best school-leavers and enhance the admission of potentially able candidates with mediocre school-leaving grades. Method: The prognostic contribution of the school-leaving (SL) GPA and the TMS to academic performance and to continuity in the pre-clinical part of the undergraduate medical program was examined in <b>two</b> study groups: <b>best</b> <b>school</b> leavers (SL grade 1. 0, SL-GPA 823 - 900 points) and mediocre school leavers (SL grades 2. 0 - 2. 3, SL-GPA 689 - 660 points). The outcomes in both groups were compared in relation to their TMS results. The prospective study included four consecutive cohorts. Results: In each study group the TMS predicted the academic performance (β= 0. 442 - 0. 446) and the continuity of studies (OR= 0. 890 - 0. 853) better than the SL-GPA (β= 0. 238 - 0. 047; OR= 1. 009 - 0. 998). Attrition was most strongly associated with failing to take the TMS (OR= 0. 230 - 0. 380). Mediocre school leavers with TMS scores ≥ 125 performed as well as the <b>best</b> <b>school</b> leavers. Mediocre school leavers with TMS scores between 110 - 124 performed on average less well but within the required standards. Best school leavers with mediocre TMS scores and 30 % of the <b>best</b> <b>school</b> leavers who hadn't taken the TMS performed less well than most mediocre school leavers with high TMS scores. Discussion: The TMS appears to differentiate between potentially successful and less successful students in both GPA categories. Mediocre school leavers (SLG 2. 0 - 2. 3) with exceptionally high TMS results reach better pre-clinical examination results than <b>best</b> <b>school</b> leavers (SLG 1. 0) with mediocre TMS results. Thus, the present data justify the use of the TMS to facilitate the participation of mediocre school leavers in the competition for admission slots...|$|R
