25|$|If {{it is so}} {{difficult}} to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} written by Glen Morgan and James Wong and {{directed}} by David Nutter. Originally, the season two premiere {{was supposed to be}} written by series creator Chris Carter. In the rough draft of this version, Mulder would have been sent to Moscow. Carter, instead, assigned Morgan and Wong the task of writing the season opener. Before working on The X-Files, Morgan had written a script with the same name about a man who goes to a telescope located in Chile. The script was never made, but Morgan liked various elements of it, so he cannibalized parts for [...] "Little Green Men". In addition, the episode was specifically written for Mulder to question himself and his beliefs. According to the two writers, one of the main themes of the episode is “the idea <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> to fight our own little green men and carry on.” ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Hindustan Times, Kaminey [...] "is {{the first}} attempt to deal with reality in a mature, matter of fact manner." [...] Unlike other Hindi films, in which the female lead is Sita, the protagonist is Rama and the {{antagonist}} is Ravana, the characters in Kaminey are nuanced humans in [...] "layered and complex" [...] situations. Namrata Joshi from Outlook wrote that Kaminey reflects Bhardwaj's [...] "enduring fascination for underdogs, characters {{on the margins of}} society and the morally compromised". Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with [...] "themes that affect our lives directly", and [...] "is a reminder <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> a dark side, and often we are not fully aware of that side". Rakesh Bedi from The Economic Times wrote, [...] "Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no one understands. Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show that the world has now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect to hash things out." [...] He continued, [...] "ith some glitches, Bhardwaj has almost re-birthed the Hindi film". The film also explores sex and sexuality, which according to Bedi were explored in a [...] "radically different and refreshing" [...] way, and the director [...] "daringly takes it a step further". When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple [...] "decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage. (Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage, {{it would have been a}} complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film.)" [...] The Daily Beast said that [...] "for aficionados of the Hindi-language genre, Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto. It takes classic Bollywood tropes—estranged brothers, a case of mistaken identity, high drama approaching slapstick comedy—and presents them with Hollywood-style realism instead of Bollywood's wink-nudge mix of melodrama and posturing.|$|E

500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E
500|$|Webb {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a story about a kid who grows up looking for his father and finds himself." [...] Both Webb and star Garfield described Parker as an outsider by choice, someone hard to get close to. As in the early comic books, the character [...] "is a science whiz. If you look {{back to the early}} Stan Lee and Steve Ditko comics, he's a nerd with big glasses," [...] said Webb. He explained [...] "the idea of what a nerd is has changed in 40 or 50 years. Nerds are running the world. Andrew Garfield made a movie [...] about it. ... What was important in those early comics was this notion that Peter Parker is an outsider and how we define that in a contemporary context." [...] Garfield compared his Spider-Man façade as a metaphor for internet anonymity, saying, [...] "You feel the power of it, the power of not being seen, the power of the mask. Peter becomes witty when he's got that protective layer. It's like he's on a message board. He's got the anonymity of the Internet within that suit, and he can say whatever the [...] @#!*% [...] he likes, and he can get away with anything." [...] Garfield tried to explore Parker as an orphan, whom he feels [...] "are the strongest human beings on the planet." [...] He said Parker is [...] "a human hero [...] goes through all of the same struggles <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> gone through, especially the skinny ones [...] want more power than they feel they have." [...] He believes Parker represents [...] "a very inspiring, aspirational character that symbolizes goodness—and {{how difficult it is to}} be good—but how worth it it is." [...] Rhys Ifans compared this film to William Shakespeare's Hamlet on the grounds that Spider-Man can be redone over and over in different ways. He felt that they are similar in that they both represent meaningful archetypal young men grappling with the loss of their father. Critics like Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that Garfield's character as the superhero [...] "embodies the nerdy Parker, the anguished fatherless teen and the cocky super-hero in equal doses". Boyd Hoij of Variety noted that Garfield's character as Spider-Man makes an interesting hero in the film because of how it establishes early on that Peter's growing pains along with his search for an identity are common to any teenager and that [...] "his struggles involve real people—and real lives." ...|$|E

So we thought, maybe <b>we</b> should do <b>that.</b> It would be fun and <b>we</b> were <b>all</b> friends going into it. It was just a cool spontaneous thing, you know." [...] From 14 to 28 March 2003 they played nine concerts: Brisbane, Gold Coast, Newcastle, Sydney (twice), Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. A proposed tenth show at a Melbourne shopping centre was cancelled.|$|R
2500|$|Nor is it {{satisfactory}} {{to print}} {{a little red}} square as {{at the top of}} the article, for, since each person has a slightly different registration of the light-rays, it confusingly suggests <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> the same response.

2500|$|In February 2015, Khan stated {{his views}} at a popular online comedy group All India Bakchod for its celebrity Roast episode. He said, [...] "I {{completely}} believe in freedom of speech, no issues. But {{we have to}} understand <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> a certain responsibility. When I heard what was being described to me I felt it was a violent event." [...] He further said violence is not just physical but it has verbal aspects to it. Calling the roast a shameless act, Khan did not spare even his friends from the film industry Karan, Ranveer and Arjun.|$|E
2500|$|On January 2, 2012, a lyric {{video was}} released.

[...] He added he preferred this video to the official one. The official music video was directed by Mark Pellington and released on February 17, 2012. Mraz explained [...] "The story of the video is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> our stories.

60|$|Fascination {{wished to}} know if the colour were not called rose-colour? Yes, said Mr Lammle; {{actually}} he knew everything; it was really rose-colour. Fascination took rose-colour to mean the colour of roses. (In this he was very warmly supported by Mr and Mrs Lammle.) Fascination had heard the term Queen of Flowers applied to the Rose. Similarly, it might be said that the dress was the Queen of Dresses. ('Very happy, Fledgeby!' from Mr Lammle.) Notwithstanding, Fascination's opinion was <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> our eyes--or at least a large majority of us--and that--and--and his farther opinion was several ands, with nothing beyond them.|$|R

2500|$|At Marquette University, {{philosophy}} department chairman James South ordered {{graduate student}} Stuart Ditsler to remove an unattributed Dave Barry {{quote from the}} door to the office that Ditsler shared with three other teaching assistants, calling the quote patently offensive. (The quote was: [...] "As Americans we must always remember <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> a common enemy, an enemy that is dangerous, powerful, and relentless. I refer, of course, to the federal government.") South claimed that the University's free-speech zone rules required Ditsler to take it down. University spokeswoman Brigid O'Brien Miller stated that it was [...] "a workplace issue, not one of academic freedom." [...] Ultimately, the quote was allowed to remain, albeit with attribution.|$|E
2500|$|By way of translations, Tagore {{influenced}} Chileans Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral; Mexican writer Octavio Paz; and Spaniards José Ortega y Gasset, Zenobia Camprubí, and Juan Ramón Jiménez. In {{the period}} 1914–1922, the Jiménez-Camprubí pair produced twenty-two Spanish translations of Tagore's English corpus; they heavily revised The Crescent Moon {{and other key}} titles. In these years, Jiménez developed [...] "naked poetry". Ortega y Gasset wrote that [...] "Tagore's wide appeal [...] he speaks of longings for perfection <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> Tagore awakens a dormant sense of childish wonder, and he saturates the air {{with all kinds of}} enchanting promises for the reader, who pays little attention to the deeper import of Oriental mysticism". Tagore's works circulated in free editions around 1920—alongside those of Plato, Dante, Cervantes, Goethe, and Tolstoy.|$|E
2500|$|Muir {{often used}} the term [...] "home" [...] {{as a metaphor for}} both nature and his general {{attitude}} toward the [...] "natural world itself," [...] notes Holmes. He often used domestic language to describe his scientific observations, as when he saw nature as providing a home for even the smallest plant life: [...] "the little purple plant, tended by its Maker, closed its petals, crouched low in its crevice of a home, and enjoyed the storm in safety." [...] Muir also saw nature as his own home, as when he wrote friends and described the Sierra as [...] "God's mountain mansion." [...] He considered not only the mountains as home, however, as he also felt a closeness even to the smallest objects: [...] "The very stones seem talkative, sympathetic, brotherly. No wonder when we consider <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> the same Father and Mother." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>We</b> <b>All</b> Had Doctors' Papers is a live {{recording}} {{similar to}} Boyce's {{recording of the}} previous year Live at Treorchy. Just as Live at Treorchy was recorded at the town's local rugby club, Boyce continued his connection with the sport of rugby union by recording <b>We</b> <b>All</b> Had Doctors' Papers at Pontarddulais Rugby Club. The album was recorded in one take over one night. The album title comes from the song 9-3 which appeared on Live at Treorchy. Celebrating Llanelli RFC's 1972 win over New Zealand, the lyrics of the fourth verse follow; But <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> doctors' papers, and they all said just the same, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> Scarlet Fever, and we caught it at the game.|$|R

2500|$|Nagoya University Graduate School of Law {{academic}} Frank Bennett had {{wished to}} include {{support for the}} Bluebook—a widely used system of legal citations, into the open source citation management software Zotero. However, lawyers representing the Harvard Law Review Association, who publishes the Bluebook, asserted that the Bluebooks inclusion of [...] "carefully curated examples, explanations and other textual materials" [...] made it a copyrighted work. Carl Malamud, head of the organization Public.Resource.Org, was informed by Bennett about the refusals. New York University School of Law professor Christopher Jon Sprigman caught wind of Malamud's correspondence; he had argued that the system of citation expressed in the Bluebook was {{in the public domain}} because its widely mandated use in the court system made it an edict of government, going on to state that [...] "in this case, a copyright is being used to keep something private <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> to use."
