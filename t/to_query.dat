5|$|With the {{introduction}} of printing, written legal texts became more available, reducing the need for students to attend readings and lectures. However, {{this meant that the}} students denied themselves the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>query</b> what they had learnt or discuss it in greater detail. Eventually, students now had a way to learn without attending lectures, they began to excuse themselves from lectures, meetings and moots altogether; in the early 17th century they developed a way of deputising other students to do their moots for them. The Benchers and Readers did little to arrest the decline of the practice of lecturers and readings, first because many probably believed (as the students did) that books were an adequate substitute, and secondly because many were keen to avoid the work of preparing a reading, which cut into their time as practising barristers. These problems were endemic to all the Inns, not just Gray's Inn.|$|E

25|$|A {{controller}} is a server-side {{component of}} Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application, by determining which view file to render. The controller {{may also have}} <b>to</b> <b>query</b> one or more models for information and pass these on to the view. For example, in an airline reservation system, a controller implementing a flight-search function would need <b>to</b> <b>query</b> a model representing individual flights to find flights matching the search, and might also need <b>to</b> <b>query</b> models representing airports and airlines to find related secondary data. The controller might then pass some subset of the flight data to the corresponding view, which would contain a mixture of static HTML and logic that use the flight data to create an HTML document containing a table with one row per flight. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes {{how to respond to}} a specific external web-browser request. Also, note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use RESTful routes, which include actions such as create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes.rb configuration file.|$|E
25|$|The API {{provides}} a suitable method for retrieving {{data in a}} programmatic way. It uses a RESTful system that allows users <b>to</b> <b>query</b> URI endpoints and receive XML as results. The API has URI endpoints {{for a number of}} different types of requests. These requests can be used to, find specific samples, find specific groups, search for groups, search for samples and to search for samples within a group.|$|E
25|$|The Domain Name System is {{maintained}} by a distributed database system, which uses the client–server model. The nodes of this database are the name servers. Each domain {{has at least}} one authoritative DNS server that publishes information about that domain and the name servers of any domains subordinate to it.

25|$|This passive {{learning}} type is {{also the}} most common scheme in supervised learning: a learning algorithm typically takes the training examples fixed, without the ability <b>to</b> <b>query</b> the label of unlabelled examples. Outputting a hypothesis h is a step of induction. Classically, an inductive model splits into a training and an application phase: the model parameters are estimated in the training phase, and the learned model is applied an arbitrary many times in the application phase. In the asymptotic limit of the number of applications, this splitting of phases is also present with quantum resources.|$|E
25|$|The general {{analysis}} strategy begins with high resolution cameras {{to look for}} features of interest. If a particular surface is of interest, Curiosity can vaporize {{a small portion of}} it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting spectra signature <b>to</b> <b>query</b> the rock's elemental composition. If that signature intrigues, the rover will use its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer to take a closer look. If the specimen warrants further analysis, Curiosity can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either the SAM or the CheMin analytical laboratories inside the rover.|$|E
25|$|The SAG {{standardization}} efforts {{presented an}} opportunity for Microsoft to adapt their Jet system to the new CLI standard. This would not only make Windows a premier platform for CLI development, but also allow users to use SQL to access both Jet and other databases as well. What was missing was the SQL parser that could convert those calls from their text form into the C-interface used in Jet. To solve this, MS partnered with PageAhead Software to use their existing query processor, SIMBA. SIMBA {{was used as a}} parser above Jet's C library, turning Jet into an SQL database. And because Jet could forward those C-based calls to other databases, this also allowed SIMBA <b>to</b> <b>query</b> other systems. Microsoft included drivers for Excel to turn its spreadsheet documents into SQL-accessible database tables.|$|E

40|$|Causality and {{responsibility}} {{is an essential}} tool in the database community for providing intuitive explanations for answers/non-answers <b>to</b> <b>queries.</b> Causality denotes the causes for the answers/non-answers <b>to</b> <b>queries,</b> {{and responsibility}} represents the degree of a cause which reflects its influence on the answers/non-answers <b>to</b> <b>queries.</b> In this paper, we study the causality and responsibility problem (CRP) for the non-answers to probabilistic reverse skyline queries (PRSQ). We first formalize CRP on PRSQ, and then, we propose an efficient algorithm termed as CP to compute the causality and responsibility for the non-answers to PRSQ. CP first finds candidate causes, and then, it performs verification to obtain actual causes with their responsibilities, during which several strategies are used to boost efficiency. Further, we explore the CRP for the non-answers <b>to</b> reverse skyline <b>queries.</b> Towards this, we extend CP to identify directly all the actual causes and their responsibilities for a non-answer <b>to</b> reverse skyline <b>queries</b> without additional verification. Extensive experiments using both real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our presented algorithms...|$|R

25|$|In October 2013, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, {{author of}} the Patriot Act, {{introduced}} a proposal to the House of Representatives called the USA Freedom Act to end the bulk collection of Americans' metadata and reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court. Senators introduced two different reform proposals. One, the USA Freedom Act (H.R. 3361/ S. 1599), would effectively halt “bulk” records collection under the USA Patriot Act, while it also would require a warrant to deliberately search for the e-mail and phone call content of Americans that is collected {{as part of a}} surveillance program targeting foreigners located overseas. Another proposal is the FISA Improvements Act that would preserve the program while strengthening privacy protections. It would also codifying the requirement that analysts have a “reasonable articulable suspicion” that a phone number is associated with terrorism <b>to</b> <b>query</b> the NSA phone records database; requiring that the FISA court promptly review each such determination; and limiting the retention period for phone records. Both proposals share the introduction of a special advocate to promote privacy interests before the FISA court.|$|E
25|$|Fox's {{relationship}} with Seddon soon deteriorated {{to the point}} where he attempted to resign in March 1894. This was refused by Seddon, who was angered when a list of grievances listed in Fox's resignation letter was subsequently leaked to the press. Seddon, already under pressure from W. R. Russell, a political opponent, was further put on the defensive when the Governor of New Zealand, Lord Glasgow, began <b>to</b> <b>query</b> the state of the country's defences. Seddon strongly suspected Fox, who was courting and would later marry Russell's daughter Cara, of agitating with both men. After some negotiation, Fox accepted a position as advisor to the government on defence matters with the title of Inspector of Volunteers and Military Advisor. Later that year Fox retired from the British Army but remained in his advisory role until November 1896. In his new role, he did implement some of the recommendations that he made in his report on the Volunteer Forces and in 1895 he reported to Seddon that he considered the country's defences much improved.|$|E
25|$|An {{increased}} {{build up}} of Soviet forces opposite Army Group Centre was largely ignored by Busch. Despite {{some of his}} subordinate's efforts to reduce their frontage, he refused to let them do so and blindly reiterated Hitler's orders that there be no retreat. In particular, the towns of Vitebsk, Orsha, Mogilev, and Bobruisk were {{to be held in}} force. Busch had attempted <b>to</b> <b>query</b> this with Hitler but was rebuffed and ridiculed. This only strengthened Busch's resolve to follow Hitler's directives without question. By mid-June, the 700,000 troops of Army Group Centre were outnumbered by 2,500,000 Soviet soldiers. When the Soviet summer offensive of 1944, Operation Bagration, began on 22 June, Army Group Centre's 34 divisions were overwhelmed by nearly 200 Red Army divisions. His army commanders immediately sought permission to withdraw to the Dnieper River but this was denied by Busch, who insisted their positions be held. Within two days, most of his divisions were effectively destroyed. Having overseen the loss of 300,000 men, the biggest defeat for Germany on the Eastern Front, Busch was relieved of his command by Hitler on 28 June. He was replaced by Generalfeldmarschall Walter Model who managed to stop the advance of the Red Army but only after they had moved the front lines back to the Vistula. In the meantime, Busch became depressed after his sacking which effectively came about because of his adherence to Hitler's orders.|$|E
