5|$|In {{the course}} of the 1960s and 1970s, Cold War {{participants}} struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs.

5|$|As {{a result}} of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue {{operations}} of the Soviet Union were not coordinated with <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> South Korea, and Japan. Consequently no information was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels {{in the event that}} they were found. International boundaries are not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number of opposing naval ships that were assembled in the area.|$|E
5|$|Presently, most {{armed forces}} are {{composed}} of people from different ethnic backgrounds.

Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} {{to adopt the}} Pentropic organisation was driven {{by a desire to}} modernise the Army and ensure that Australian units were able to integrate with <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Army. While the US Pentomic organisation had been implemented in 1957 to improve the Army's ability to operate during a nuclear war, the Australian organisation was optimised for limited wars in South East Asia in which there was a chance that nuclear weapons might be used. Both structures were designed to facilitate independent operations by the sub-units of divisions. The Australian Pentropic division was intended to be air portable, capable of fighting in a limited war and capable of conducting anti-guerrilla operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{region has}} been an area of study for archeologists, anthropologists and historians, who have worked on prehispanic ruins and fossilized bones. However, much of the {{research}} in this area is still in its initial descriptive stage with many basic questions still unanswered. Sonora is considered a cultural zone separate from Mesoamerica, although there may have been some Mesoamerican influence. The major differences between Sonoran cultures and Mesoamerica include dry climate farming, although the same basics of corn, squash and beans are produced. There is also a heavier reliance on wild resources. More important was the lack of true cities during this area’s prehispanic history, with small settlements clustered around water sources and weak hierarchical systems. The cultures here also share some traits with <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Southwest, but are distinct from these as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} film production, Turkey {{shared the same}} fate {{with many of the}} {{national}} cinemas of the 20th century. Film production wasn't continuous until around the 1950s and the film market in general was run by a few major import companies that struggled for domination in the most population-dense and profitable cities such as Istanbul and İzmir. Film theatres rarely ever screened any locally produced films and the majority of the programs consisted of films of the stronger western film industries, especially <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> France, Italy and Germany. Attempts at film production came primarily from multinational studios, which could rely on their comprehensive distribution networks together with their own theatre chains, thus guaranteeing them a return on their investment. Between the years 1896–1945, the number of locally produced films did not even reach 50 films in total, equal to less than a single year's annual film production in the 1950s and 1960s. Domestically produced films constituted {{only a small fraction of}} the total number of films screened in Turkey prior to the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|The modern Islamic {{fundamentalist}} {{movements have}} their {{origins in the}} late 19th century. The Wahhabi movement, an Arabian fundamentalist movement {{that began in the}} 18th century, gained traction and spread during the 19th and 20th centuries. During the Cold War following World War II, some NATO governments, particularly <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and the United Kingdom, launched covert and overt campaigns to encourage and strengthen fundamentalist groups in the Middle East and southern Asia. These groups were seen as a hedge against potential expansion by the Soviet Union, and as a means to prevent the growth of nationalistic movements that were not necessarily favorable toward the interests of the Western nations. By the 1970s, the Islamists had become important allies in supporting governments, such as Egypt, which were friendly to U.S. interests. By the late 1970s, however, some fundamentalist groups had become militaristic leading to threats and changes to existing regimes. The overthrow of the Shah in Iran and rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini {{was one of the most}} significant signs of this shift. Subsequently, fundamentalist forces in Algeria caused a civil war, caused a near-civil war in Egypt, and caused the downfall of the Soviet occupation in Afghanistan. In many cases the military wings of these groups were supplied with money and arms by the U.S. and U.K.|$|E
