Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E

This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E

The study focus on <b>the</b> <b>discourses</b> that arise during {{interviews}} about FGM/C with five activists. To examine this we asked the following questions: What discourses are presented in the interviews? How do these discourses interact together – are there any discourse conflicts? How do the activists talk about FGM/C in comparison to our western view? The study is based on discourse theory. We also use feminism and postcolonialism as theories in our analyze.

5|$|Sensibility in {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, of the eighteenth century. But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E

5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> {{level it}} tends to use a topic-comment structure, where the known {{information}} (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E

A discussion of Bakhtin‟s theories of heteroglossia, hybridization, language stratification, dialogism, and <b>discourse</b> laid <b>the</b> foundation for the analysis of Song‟s transformation from an outsider (a non-native of West Virginia) to an accepted and productive member of a West Virginia coal mining community (other).

40|$|This study aims to {{critically}} explore <b>the</b> <b>discourses</b> therapists use {{to construct}} trauma. Five therapists (two counselling psychologists, one clinical psychologist, one gestalt therapist and one psychotherapist), who self-identified as working with trauma, were interviewed. The transcripts were analysed using Foucauldian <b>discourse</b> analysis. <b>The</b> results {{were divided into}} ‘pathologising’ and ‘non-pathologising’ <b>discourses</b> of trauma. <b>The</b> ‘pathologising’ theme includes <b>the</b> <b>discourses</b> of ‘psychiatry’, ‘cognitive behavioural therapy’, ‘vicarious trauma’ and ‘developmental trauma and resilience’. <b>The</b> ‘non-pathologising’ <b>discourses</b> are ‘posttraumatic growth’, ‘embodiment’ and ‘feminism’. The findings are used to argue that <b>the</b> ‘pathologising’ <b>discourses</b> of trauma exacerbate power imbalance in the therapeutic relationship through the way the therapist and client are positioned, and that a more fluid, aligned relationship may be allowed from <b>the</b> ‘non-pathologising’ <b>discourses.</b> <b>The</b> way <b>the</b> ‘pathologising’ <b>discourses</b> construct emotion in binary terms {{of positive and negative}} is critiqued, as <b>the</b> ‘nonpathologising’ <b>discourses</b> allow difficult emotions to be constructed as a potentially enriching experience rather than a symptom to be alleviated. It is suggested that <b>the</b> ‘pathologising’ <b>discourses</b> neglect <b>the</b> body or construct it as a site for the experience of symptoms, and <b>the</b> ‘non-pathologising’ <b>discourses</b> may allow <b>the</b> embodied experiences of trauma to be constructed as useful in the process of recovery.
