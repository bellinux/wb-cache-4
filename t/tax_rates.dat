5|$|A June 1965 {{ruling by}} the Kentucky Court of Appeals that {{property}} must be assessed at its full value prompted calls for a special session from Kentucky taxpayers. Breathitt obliged, calling the session in July. He proposed a reduction in property <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> to offset {{the increase in the}} assessed value of property, and also advocated small increased in other <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> to benefit public schools. The plan passed despite opposition from Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield.|$|E

5000|$|The {{combined}} <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> of all local {{sales taxes}} in any county {{is generally not}} allowed to exceed 2.00 percent. [...] However, this is a statutory restriction and the California Legislature routinely allows local governments, through the adoption of separate legislation, to exceed the 2.00 percent local <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> cap. The 2.00 percent local <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> cap is exceeded in any city with a combined sales <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> in excess of 9.25% (7.25% statewide <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> plus the 2.00% <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> cap). As of July 1, 2017, 22 California cities have a combined sales <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> {{in excess of the}} 2.00 percent local <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> cap.|$|R
50|$|A {{marginal}} <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> is the <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> {{an individual}} would pay on one additional dollar of income. Thus, the marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> is the <b>tax</b> percentage {{on the last}} dollar earned. In the United States in 2016, for example, the highest marginal federal income <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> was 39.6%, applying to earnings over $415,050. Earnings under $415,050 that year had a lower <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> of 35% or less.|$|R
5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies. Just {{as he had done}} in Liaoning, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{business}} career, Romney and his wife had a net worth of between $190 and $250million, including their retirement account, worth between $20 and $100million. Most of that wealth has been held in blind trusts since 2003, some of it offshore. An additional blind trust, valued at $100million in 2012, exists in the name of their children. In 2010, Romney and his wife received about $22million in income, almost all of it from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest; and they paid about $3million in federal income taxes, for an effective tax rate of 14percent. For the years 1990–2010, their effective federal <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> were above 13percent with an average rate of about 20percent.|$|E

5|$|During Reagan's presidency, {{federal income}} <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> were lowered {{significantly}} with {{the signing of}} the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%. Other tax increases passed by Congress and signed by Reagan ensured however that tax revenues over his two terms were 18.2% of GDP as compared to 18.1% over the 40-year period of 1970–2010. Then, in 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 was signed into law, initiating one of the United States' first public–private partnerships and {{a major part of the}} president's job creation program. Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Labor and Chief of Staff, Al Angrisani, was a primary architect of the bill.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{who should}} decide the corporation <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> under {{the situation in}} which a local public good has a spillover effect and the central government cannot realize residents’ actual preference of the public good. This paper makes the following conclusions. When a local government decides the <b>tax</b> <b>rate,</b> it has an incentive to not only decide an inadequate <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> because of the incentive to free-ride but also an incentive to decide an excessive <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> because of the tax export effect. As such, because the incentive to decide an excessive <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> is dominant, the local government decides a <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> higher than the socially optimal one. With regard to the problem of who should decide the <b>tax</b> <b>rate,</b> this paper demonstrates the following: when the spillover effect is large (small), the local (central) government should decide the corporation <b>tax</b> <b>rate.</b> This result is unlike those in previous studies...|$|R

5|$|Johnson helped {{organize}} a mechanics' (working men's) ticket in the 1829 Greeneville municipal election. He was elected town alderman, {{along with his}} friends Blackston McDannel and Mordecai Lincoln. Following the 1831 Nat Turner slave rebellion, a state convention was called to pass a new constitution, including provisions to disenfranchise free people of color. The convention also wanted to reform real estate <b>tax</b> <b>rates,</b> and provide ways of funding improvements to Tennessee's infrastructure. The constitution was submitted for a public vote, and Johnson spoke widely for its adoption; the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure. On January 4, 1834, his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of Greeneville.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland has an {{overwhelmingly}} private sector economy and low <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> by Western World standards; overall taxation {{is one of}} the smallest of developed countries. Switzerland is a relatively easy place to do business, currently ranking 20th of 189 countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index. The slow growth Switzerland experienced in the 1990s and the early 2000s has brought greater support for economic reforms and harmonisation with the European Union. According to Credit Suisse, only about 37% of residents own their own homes, one of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe. Housing and food price levels were 171% and 145% of the EU-25 index in 2007, compared to 113% and 104% in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Taxes in the United States are levied at the federal, state, {{and local}} {{government}} levels. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP. During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%). Based on CBO estimates, under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.|$|E
50|$|The flat <b>rate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> of 25% is {{significantly}} lower than the highest income <b>tax</b> <b>rate.</b> Advantages on apply for investors whose marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> on the remaining income is equal or higher than the flat <b>tax</b> <b>rate.</b> There might be a breach of the principle of taxation based upon the competitiveness of the taxpayers. Before 2009 gains from capital income were taxed with 45% and from 2009 on are taxed with 25% plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge and church tax. That is the same for taxpayers with a personal income <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> of 27%.|$|R
50|$|Capital {{gains are}} profits from {{investments}} in capital assets such as bonds, stocks, and real estate. These gains are taxed, for individuals, as ordinary income when held {{for less than}} one year which means that they have the same marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> as the marginal income <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> of their recipient. This is known as the capital gains <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> on a short-term capital gains. Accordingly, the capital gains <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> for short-term capital gains paid by an individual is equal to the marginal income <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> of that individual. The <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> then decreases once the capital gain becomes a long-term capital gain, or is held for 1 year or more.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, {{the small}} {{business}} <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> is the <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> paid by a small business.

5|$|The top 10% paid 51.8% {{of total}} federal taxes in 2009, {{and the top}} 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax {{national}} income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes. In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile. The incidence of corporate income tax has {{been a matter of}} considerable ongoing controversy for decades. State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Han dynasty, {{the land}} tax rate was reduced to one-hundredth, with lost revenue recouped by {{increasing}} the poll and property <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> The poll tax for most adults was 120 coins annually, 240 coins for merchants, and 20 coins for minors aged between three and fourteen years. The lower taxable threshold age for minors increased to seven years during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 48–33 BC) and onwards. Historian Charles Hucker writes that underreporting of the population by local authorities was deliberate and widespread, since this reduced their tax and labor service obligations rendered to the central government.|$|E
5|$|Truman cooperated {{closely with}} the Republican leaders on foreign policy, though he fought them bitterly on {{domestic}} issues. The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by the Taft–Hartley Act, which was enacted over Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of a tax cut bill in 1948. The parties did cooperate on some issues; Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, making the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the Vice President.|$|E

5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth.

He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, Plymouth has {{experienced}} rapid growth and development. As in many South Shore towns, Plymouth became {{more accessible to}} Boston in the early 1970s with improved railroads, highways, and bus routes. Furthermore, the town's inexpensive land costs and low <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> were factors in the town's significant population rise. Plymouth's population grew from 18,606 residents in 1970 to 45,608 residents in 1990, a 145% increase in 20 years. The population has continued to expand in recent years. While Plymouth has already surpassed several Massachusetts cities in population, the town is still officially regarded as a town, as {{it has not been}} re-chartered as a city and continues to be governed by a board of selectmen rather than a mayor. Plymouth has emerged as a major economic and tourist center of the South Shore.|$|E
