5|$|If the ionic {{compound}} is soluble in a solvent, it can {{be obtained}} as a solid compound by evaporating the solvent from this electrolyte solution. As the solvent is evaporated, the ions do not go into the vapour, but stay in the remaining solution, and when they become sufficiently concentrated, nucleation occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic compound. This process occurs widely in nature, and is the means of formation of the evaporite minerals. Another method of recovering the compound from solution involves saturating a solution at high temperature and then reducing the solubility by reducing the temperature until <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> supersaturated and the solid compound nucleates.|$|E
5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|E

5|$|Lead(II) {{compounds}} {{are characteristic}} of the inorganic chemistry of lead. Even strong oxidizing agents like fluorine and chlorine react with lead to give only PbF2 and PbCl2. Lead(II) ions are usually colorless in solution, and partially hydrolyze to form Pb(OH)+ and finally Pb4(OH)4 (in which the hydroxyl ions act as bridging ligands), but are not reducing agents as tin(II) ions are. Techniques for identifying {{the presence of the}} Pb2+ ion in water generally rely on the precipitation of lead(II) chloride using dilute hydrochloric acid. As the chloride salt is somewhat soluble in water, the precipitation of lead(II) sulfide, by bubbling hydrogen sulfide through <b>the</b> <b>solution,</b> <b>is</b> then attempted.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{dissolve}} slowly in liquid ammonia, forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated M+ and e−, which {{react to form}} hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide (MNH2, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by Humphry Davy in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a catalyst. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, barium, {{as well as the}} divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M+), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), diatomic alkali metal molecules (M2) and alkali metal anions (M−). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{experimental}} determination of pKa values is commonly performed {{by means of}} titrations, in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a strong acid {{to the point where}} the compound is fully protonated. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a glass electrode and a pH meter.

5|$|To extract plutonium, neutron-irradiated uranium is {{dissolved}} in nitric acid, and a reducing agent (FeSO4, or H2O2) {{is added to}} the resulting solution. This addition changes the oxidation state of plutonium from +6 to +4, while uranium remains in the form of uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)2). <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> treated with a reducing agent and neutralized with ammonium carbonate to pH = 8 that results in precipitation of Pu4+ compounds.|$|E
5|$|Between the two buffer regions {{there is}} an end-point, or {{equivalence}} point, at about pH 3. This end-point is not sharp and is typical of a diprotic acid whose buffer regions overlap by a small amount: pKa2 − pKa1 is about three in this example. (If the difference in pK values were about two or less, the end-point would not be noticeable.) The second end-point begins at about pH  6.3 and is sharp. This indicates that all the protons have been removed. When this is so, <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> not buffered and the pH rises steeply on addition of {{a small amount of}} strong base. However, the pH does not continue to rise indefinitely. A new buffer region begins at about pH 11 (pKw − 3), which is where self-ionization of water becomes important.|$|E
5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When multi-objective genetic {{algorithm}} {{is applied to}} real world problems for deriving Pareto optimum solutions, high calculation cost becomes a problem. One of solutions of this problem is using small number of population size. With this solution, however, it often happens that the diversity of <b>the</b> <b>solutions</b> <b>is</b> lost. Then <b>the</b> <b>solutions</b> which have <b>the</b> sufficient precisions cannot be derived. For overcoming this difficulty, <b>the</b> <b>solutions</b> should <b>be</b> re-placed when <b>the</b> <b>solutions</b> <b>are</b> converged on a certain point. To perform this re-placement, inverse analyze to derive the design variables from objects since <b>the</b> <b>solutions</b> <b>are</b> located in <b>the</b> objective space. For this purpose, in this paper, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is applied. Using ANN, <b>the</b> <b>solutions</b> which <b>are</b> concentrated on certain points are re-placed and the diversity of <b>the</b> <b>solutions</b> <b>is</b> maintained. In this paper, the new mechanism using ANN to keep the diversity of <b>the</b> <b>solutions</b> <b>is</b> proposed. <b>The</b> proposed mechanism is introduced into NSGA-II and applied for the test functions. It is discussed that in some functions the proposed mechanism is useful compared to the conventional method.
