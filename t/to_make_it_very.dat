25|$|With {{his victory}} over Petrosian, Korchnoi {{advanced}} to face Karpov in the Candidates' Final, the match {{to determine who}} would challenge reigning World Champion Bobby Fischer in 1975. In {{the run-up to the}} match, Korchnoi was constantly subjected to threats and harassment, and was virtually unable to find any Grandmasters to assist him. Bronstein apparently assisted Korchnoi, for which he was punished. Bronstein, in his last book, Secret Notes, published in 2007, wrote that he advised Korchnoi before the match began, but then had to leave to play an event himself; when he returned, Korchnoi was down by three games. Bronstein then assisted Korchnoi for the final stages. Korchnoi also received some assistance later in the match from two British masters, IM (later GM) Raymond Keene and IM William Hartston. Korchnoi trailed 3–0 late in the match, but won games 19 and 21 <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> close right to the end. Karpov eventually won this battle, played in late 1974 in Moscow, by a 12½–11½ score. By default, Karpov became the twelfth world champion in April 1975, when Fischer refused to defend his title because of disputed match conditions.|$|E
500|$|Asked whether Robbins and Torres might marry in the future, Capshaw replied: [...] "There's {{probably}} a lot more stuff that has to happen before that happens. [...] I don't think they're {{going to get married}} just to get married. As Arizona goes, I think she has incredible discipline and she does, as you said, have a very strict moral compass and marriage would not be something she would jump into without giving it a great amount of thought." [...] Discussing Robbins' relationship with Torres' former lover Sloan, Capshaw divulged: [...] "Whenever there's been a chance to play that I am intimidated by him or being standoffish, I've always chosen <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> playful. It's much more Arizona's style to find it very amusing." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} Irwin's death, {{at least ten}} stingrays were found dead and mutilated on the beaches of Queensland, with their tails cut off, prompting speculation {{as to whether they}} might have been killed by fans of Irwin as an act of revenge, although, according to the chairman of the Queensland fishing information service, anglers regularly cut the tails off of accidentally caught stingrays to avoid being stung. Michael Hornby, a friend of Irwin and executive director of his Wildlife Warrior fund, condemned any revenge killings, saying that [...] "We just want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> clear that we will not accept and not stand for anyone who's taken a form of retribution.

500|$|The episode also {{features}} a reappearance by Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), a recurring character during the first season. The second season DVD includes an alternate ending to this episode, which was released around the airing of the episode as a promotional tool. The alternate ending starts {{the same way as}} the regular ending, with Veronica discovering that Meg is pregnant. But instead of the episode ending there, Meg's mom comes into the room while Veronica hides in the bathroom. When the mom leaves, Meg is dead with a pillow over her face, indicating smothering. However, Veronica takes the pillow off before a nurse comes in. Thomas commented that the alternate ending was never going to be the actual conclusion to the episode. He said: [...] "We never seriously considered having that be the ending. There were various other endings that we did have, but they were so subtly different, it was like, 'When does Veronica enter the room?'" [...] The idea to promote the alternate ending was a joint venture from the UPN promotions department and executive producer Joel Silver. After Thomas learned that others wanted an alternate ending, he decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> different from the episode's actual conclusion. [...] "But once we could have a [...] alternate ending, we thought, 'Let's make it rock.' The beauty of having that alternate ending is that we don't have to play it out in the next episode." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Dr. Orit Kamir, {{the most}} {{effective}} way to avoid sexual harassment in the work place, and also influence the public’s state of mind, is for the employer to adopt a clear policy prohibiting sexual harassment and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> clear to their employees. Many women prefer to make a complaint and to have the matter resolved within the workplace rather than to [...] "air out the dirty laundry" [...] with a public complaint and be seen as a traitor by colleagues, superiors and employers, adds Kamir.|$|E
2500|$|The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) {{examined}} {{an allegation}} {{by a former}} senior police officer that a criminal prosecution of a brothel keeper, Myra Forde (who was convicted in a later case), for supplying underage girls to clients was not pursued by Wiltshire police after she reportedly [...] "threatened to expose" [...] that Heath {{may have been involved}} in offences concerning the abuse of children. There was a question as to whether the force properly investigated the claims of abuse, which had been made in the 1990s. In August 2015 Forde denied having any such knowledge or making any threat. Forde's counsel from that time issued a statement: [...] "My former client wishes me <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> clear that at no stage did she state that Ted Heath was a client and at no stage did she threaten to expose him as a client of hers if the prosecution was continued." [...] The counsel for the prosecution in the case confirmed in a letter to The Times that the case was dropped because three prosecution witnesses had refused to testify, not because of any allegations against Heath. The Times reported in May 2016 that the IPCC had decided the claims of the former senior police officer were without foundation.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 May 1916, it was {{discovered}} that Seydlitz was still not watertight after repairs and would not now be ready until the 29th. The ambush submarines were now on station and experiencing difficulties of their own: visibility near the coast was frequently poor due to fog, and sea conditions were either so calm the slightest ripple, as from the periscope, could give away their position, or so rough as <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> hard to keep the vessel at a steady depth. The British had become aware of unusual submarine activity, and had begun counter patrols that forced the submarines out of position. UB-27 passed Bell Rock on the night of 23 May on its way into the Firth of Forth as planned, but was halted by engine trouble. After repairs it continued to approach, following behind merchant vessels, and reached Largo Bay on 25 May. There the boat became entangled in nets that fouled one of the propellers, forcing it to abandon the operation and return home. U-74 was detected by four armed trawlers on 27 May and sunk [...] south-east of Peterhead. U-75 laid its mines off the Orkney Islands, which, although they played no part in the battle, were responsible later for sinking the cruiser [...] carrying Lord Kitchener (head of the army) on a mission to Russia on 5 June. U-72 was forced to abandon its mission without laying any mines when an oil leak meant it was leaving a visible surface trail astern.|$|E
