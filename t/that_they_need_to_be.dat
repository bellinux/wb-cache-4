25|$|The Chinese legal code has no {{explicit}} {{provision for}} exile, but often dissidents are released {{on the grounds}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated for a medical condition in another country, and {{with the understanding that}} they will be reincarcerated if they return to China. Dissidents who have been released on medical parole include Ngawang Chophel, Ngawang Sangdrol, Phuntsog Nyidron, Takna Jigme Zangpo, Wang Dan, Wei Jingsheng, Gao Zhan and Fang Lizhi.|$|E
25|$|During peak hours, {{stations}} can get {{so crowded}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> closed. Passengers {{may not get}} on the first train {{and the majority of}} passengers do not find a seat on their trains, some trains having more than four passengers every square metre. When asked, passengers report overcrowding as the aspect of the network that they are least satisfied with, and overcrowding has been linked to poor productivity and potential poor heart health. Capacity increases have been overtaken by increased demand, and peak overcrowding has increased by 16 percent since 2004/5.|$|E
25|$|In addition, in {{the recent}} decade a growing {{minority}} from within the Israeli Jewish conscripts have denounced the mandatory enrollment, and refused to serve (see also Refusal {{to serve in the}} Israeli military), many claiming that due to financial insecurities they feel <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spending their time more productively pursuing their chosen studies or career paths. Some individual resentment may also be compounded by the typically low wages paid to conscripts—the current Israeli policies see National Service as a duty rendered to the country and its citizens, and therefore the Israeli army does not pay any wages to conscripts, but instead grants a low monthly allowance to the full-time national service personnel, {{depending on the type of}} their duty.|$|E

25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, {{and the answer is}} known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here {{is an example of a}} fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later, {{hundreds}} of people participated in a protest and march organized by UVA faculty as [...] "part {{of a series of}} responses to the recently published Rolling Stone article". A student quoted in The Daily Progress said that men at a nearby bar were [...] "quick to yell 'insults and slurs' at the protestors as they walked by". A local business owner expressed support of non-violent demonstrations and told The Cavalier Daily that [...] "The only way thing change is if you talk about what's happening." [...] The march ended outside of the Phi Kappa Psi house where protesters challenged a perceived [...] "culture of sexual assault at the University". Community members offered suggestions for immediate steps administration could take to implement preventative measures and address safety concerns regarding sexual assault. One student protestor told The Cavalier Daily: [...] "I really hope the University takes this article and the protest movement as a sign <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more transparent about the way they deal with sexual assault." [...] Four participants who were sitting on the steps to the Phi Kappa Psi house were arrested on trespassing charges for refusing to move when police officers asked them to leave.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2008, {{concerns}} {{were raised by}} some teachers, parents and experts about the Hillsong City Care Shine program for girls being run in New South Wales public schools, community groups and the juvenile justice system. The concerns include that the program is [...] "inappropriate for troubled young women, that the under-qualified facilitators are reinforcing gender stereotypes and that some parents have not been properly informed" [...] and that [...] "the program encourages girls to be subservient by teaching them <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attractive to men". Hillsong claims that parents are supportive and that the program breaks down barriers in a group situation. [...] In a media response on 29 July 2008, Hillsong expressed strong support for their program and explicitly denied charges of using the program for evangelism.|$|E
2500|$|Even after Steve Bannon's {{role was}} diminished by Trump in mid-April 2017, Voris' {{organization}} was still viewed as notable by national media. [...] On May 9, 2017 The Atlantic released {{a video of}} the Church Militant offices and personal which also included pictures of the then recent New York Times and Detroit Free Press articles. Voris told The Atlantic {{that of all the}} debates held in America, the question of which is the right religion has never been debated. He complained about [...] "A tyranny, a dictatorship of relativism. [...] 'If you don't want to have an abortion don't, I'm going to have mine, you don't want to that's fine. If you don't like gay marriage, don't marry someone of the same sex.' Societies can function like that. There is right and wrong, good and evil, truth and lies. ...The world is so mired in misunderstanding today <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pointed to - here's truth." [...] Voris discussed his upbringing and the story of how he returned to Catholicism. He also challenged the label of far-right or hate group. The video ended with him saying [...] "The old Michael Voris was a lustful, prideful, acting on hurt, and sense of victim, and all that business. The new Michael Voris, or the new man, is somebody who is now dedicated to helping other people realize that there is no limit to God. It's impossible to do enough to save souls until you have drawn your last breath." ...|$|E

60|$|Here {{at length}} we have free range, as not in palaces, nor cottages, nor temples, and intrude nowhere. All {{the secrets of}} {{housekeeping}} are exhibited to the eyes of men, above and below, before and behind. This is the necessary way to live, men have confessed, in these days, and shall he skulk and hide? And why should we have any serious disgust at kitchens? Perhaps they are the holiest recess of the house. There is the hearth, after all,--and the settle, and the fagots, and the kettle, and the crickets. We have pleasant reminiscences of these. They are the heart, the left ventricle, the very {{vital part of the}} house. Here the real and sincere life which we meet in the streets was actually fed and sheltered. Here burns the taper that cheers the lonely traveller by night, and from this hearth ascend the smokes that populate the valley to his eyes by day. On the whole, a man may not be so little ashamed of any other part of his house, for here is his sincerity and earnest, at least. It may not be here that the besoms are plied most,--it is not here <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> for dust will not settle on the kitchen floor more than in nature.|$|E
6000|$|But the {{difference}} lies precisely in this&mdash;that the Christ of Mr. Kennedy's play insists on really knowing all the souls that he loves; he declines to conquer {{by a kind}} of supernatural stupidity. He pardons evil, but he will not ignore it. In other words, he is a Christian, and not a Christian Scientist. The distinction doubtless is partly explained by the problems severally selected. Mr. Jerome practically supposes Christ to be trying to save disreputable people; and that, of course, is naturally a simple business. Mr. Kennedy supposes Him to be trying to save the reputable people, which is a much larger affair. The chief characters in The Servant in the House are a popular and strenuous vicar, universally respected, and his fashionable and forcible wife. It would have been no good to tell these people they had some good in them&mdash;for that was what they were telling themselves all day long. They had to be reminded that they had some bad in them&mdash;instinctive idolatries and silent treasons which they always tried to forget. It is in connection with these crimes of wealth and culture that we face the real problem of positive evil. The whole of Mr. Blatchford's controversy about sin was vitiated throughout by one's consciousness that whenever he wrote the word [...] "sinner" [...] he thought of a man in rags. But here, again, we can find truth merely by referring to vulgar literature&mdash;its unfailing fountain. Whoever read a detective story about poor people? The poor have crimes; but the poor have no secrets. And it is because the proud have secrets <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detected before they are forgiven.|$|E
