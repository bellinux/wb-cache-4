5|$|Hastings {{felt that}} their best chances lay in {{interviewing}} Christopher Addison about his contact with Booth; as Addison was a government minister he could be relied on <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> The case of Gruban v Booth opened on 7 May 1917 at the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in front of Mr Justice Coleridge. Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington represented Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift KC and Douglas Hogg. The trial attracted such public interest that {{on the final day}} the barristers found it physically difficult to get through the crowds surrounding the Law Courts.|$|E

5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, Dot is told by {{the police}} that Nick has died of {{respiratory}} failure from a heroin overdose the previous week.

Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from looking in the coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive.|$|E

However, {{on his way to}} school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who {{convince}} him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him.|$|E
5|$|Jared {{initially}} {{tells the}} police nothing {{of what he}} saw. He is torn between the need <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> {{and the desire to}} protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still {{has not been able to}} tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E

5|$|Stan {{tries to}} persuade Randy <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses {{in order to}} avoid embarrassment. As the pair works on the warp drive, an Intergalactic Police ship {{approaches}} Earth; McGeezax cloaks his ship and drags Stan out of sight as a hostage, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers' questions. The officers say that McGeezax stole a large sum of space cash, but no one admits to seeing him, and the officers leave. Randy then provides a diversion for McGeezax while Stan, at Randy's insistence, stabs him to death with a shank. McGeezax's ship is found to contain the stolen space cash, but instead of returning it, Randy persuades everyone to divide it among themselves. Randy, in contact with all world leaders, buys other countries' silence by giving them a share. Four days later, the officers return to South Park. They now know that McGeezax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, but everyone denies finding any space cash.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} all humans are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed on anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely {{as a means to}} an end, leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they treat women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: because there is a perfect duty <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E
