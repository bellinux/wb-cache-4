5|$|An {{analysis}} of the orbits of comets with nearly parabolic orbits identifies five new comets with hyperbolic orbits that approach the nominal orbit of Planet Nine described in Batygin and Brown's initial paper. If these orbits are hyperbolic due to close encounters with Planet Nine the analysis estimates that Planet Nine is currently near aphelion with a right ascension of 83°–90° and a declination of 8°–10°. Scott Sheppard, who is skeptical of <b>this</b> <b>analysis,</b> notes that many different forces influence the orbits of comets.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of DNA sequences suggests that V.surrecta {{belongs to the}} Volvariella pusilla group—a grouping of related Volvariella species that produce small, white fruit bodies.

Almost 90 years earlier, Paul Konrad and André Maublanc recognized the relatedness of these species, and proposed that V.surrecta {{should be considered a}} subspecies of V.hypopithys.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of {{internal transcribed spacer}} DNA sequences shows that C.vinicolor groups in a clade with the closely related C.jamaicensis and C.pseudovinicolor. All of these species feature darkly-amyloid flesh and thick-walled cystidia. Based on <b>this</b> <b>analysis,</b> Miller considered C.jamaicensis to be insufficiently distinct genetically from C.vinicolor to warrant designation as a separate species; however, as of 2012, both MycoBank and Index Fungorum list it as a valid species.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{has demonstrated that}} the Microsporidia, unicellular parasites of animals and protists, are fairly recent and highly derived endobiotic fungi (living within the tissue of another species). One 2006 study concludes that the Microsporidia are a sister group to the true fungi; that is, they are each other's closest evolutionary relative. Hibbett and colleagues suggest that <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> does not clash with their classification of the Fungi, and although the Microsporidia are elevated to phylum status, it is acknowledged that further analysis is required to clarify evolutionary relationships within this group.|$|E
5|$|Quantification of the {{proportion}} of barbarian-born troops in the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has undertaken the most {{detailed analysis of the}} meagre evidence. According to <b>this</b> <b>analysis,</b> {{about a quarter of the}} sample of army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade shows that this proportion did not increase over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies that {{the proportion}} of barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise {{the proportion of}} barbarian officers would have increased over time to reflect that.|$|E

5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the stone}} now focused on fuller {{understanding}} of the texts and their contexts by comparing the three versions with one another. In 1824 Classical scholar Antoine-Jean Letronne promised to prepare a new literal translation of the Greek text for Champollion's use. Champollion in return promised an analysis of all the points at which the three texts seemed to differ. Following Champollion's sudden death in 1832, his draft of <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> could not be found, and Letronne's work stalled. François Salvolini, Champollion's former student and assistant, died in 1838, and <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> and other missing drafts were found among his papers. This discovery incidentally demonstrated that Salvolini's own publication {{on the stone}}, published in 1837, was plagiarism. Letronne was at last able to complete his commentary on the Greek text and his new French translation of it, which appeared in 1841. During the early 1850s, German Egyptologists Heinrich Brugsch and Max Uhlemann produced revised Latin translations based on the demotic and hieroglyphic texts. The first English translation followed in 1858, the work of {{three members of the}} Philomathean Society at the University of Pennsylvania.|$|E
