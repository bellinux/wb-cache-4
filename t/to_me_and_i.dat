5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
5|$|Sai Baba also {{condemned}} distinction {{based on}} religion or caste. It remains unclear {{if he was}} a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba. His teaching combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived, practised both Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions, and took samadhi in Shirdi. One of his well-known epigrams, Allah Malik (God is King) and Sabka Malik Ek (Everyone's Master is One), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known to have said Look <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall look to you.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

500|$|Author Patrick Croskery {{described}} Animals as {{a unique}} blend of the [...] "powerful sounds and suggestive themes" [...] of Dark Side with The Wall portrayal of artistic alienation. He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm. Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: [...] "If you didn't care what happened <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> didn't care for you", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately {{paint a picture of}} dystopia, the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines.|$|E

He was enthusiastic, and sent a letter to commission chairman Charles Moore to that effect, writing [...] "the whole coin looks very interesting <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think is mighty good."

[...] However, {{at no time did}} Smart ever believe himself to be insane; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed, although not as significantly, to the Universal Visiter. In joking about writing for the Universal Visiter, Johnson claimed: [...] "for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write... I hoped his wits would return to him. Mine returned <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wrote in 'the Universal Visitor' no longer." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the run of}} The Mikado, Bond met Lewis Ransome, a young civil {{engineer}} from a wealthy Quaker family. [...] He {{had just returned from}} America, and the two compared travel experiences. Ransome admitted to Bond that, after watching The Mikado, he had mentioned to his sister that he [...] "liked the little one with the big sash best. So next day when she saw a photograph of you in a shop window she went in and bought it. She gave it <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have it now." [...] Thus, despite Bond's aversion to romance, began a long friendship that led, twelve years later, to Bond's second marriage. Ransome, several years younger than Bond, proposed marriage on many occasions {{over the course of the}} relationship, but Bond told him that she would not marry while she continued on the stage. Over the years, the two spent many of Bond's days off (Sundays) relaxing together in the country.|$|E

She gave birth to Tim Guest in 1975. [...] Guest's mother {{fell in love with}} another man when Guest was six months old. She became a feminist, studied Ronald David Laing, and experimented with sex and drugs. [...] Guest's mother became a follower of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh when Guest was a toddler, after listening to a cassette tape of Rajneesh which displayed the cover text [...] "Surrender <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will transform you", and was titled: [...] "Meditation: the art of ecstasy". Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh taught his followers his perspective on chaotic therapy, sexual freedom and mysticism. She brought her son into the movement in 1979. She was given the name of [...] "Ma Prem Vismaya" [...] (Sanskrit: Mother Love Wonder), and dyed all of her clothes orange.|$|E

[...] "Not Afraid" [...] was primarily produced by the Canadian hip hop musician Boi-1da. According to Mike Strange, who recorded [...] "Not Afraid", he wanted to work with Boi-1da after listening to his [...] "Forever", which he had produced for the rapper Drake. Boi-1da sent Strange many tracks, to some of which Eminem wrote lyrics. These tracks were opened in Pro Tools, as Strange proceeded to record Eminem's vocals.

He described his own testimony as [...] "an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country, my family and myself" [...] and explained how he now viewed its consequences: [...] "Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> took it deliberately. I could not believe that this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change that awful sentence."

[...] He lost his temper, saying, [...] "I don't need all this aggravation. I could sit next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been good <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really don't need anything. But I just feel that if He's been that good, I should try to put something back in.

500|$|Sale el Sol is {{considered}} to be Shakira's return to her [...] "roots" [...] and is a [...] "fusion between rock and pop heavily influenced from Latino and Colombian music".

Explaining the romantic [...] "direction" [...] of the album, she said that it was something [...] "which I hadn't tapped into for the past three years, but it suddenly came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't hold it back. So it’s [...] got songs that are very intense, very romantic [...] ". Examples include ballads like [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] ("Before Six O'Clock") and [...] "Lo Que Mas" [...] ("The Most"); in the former Shakira delivers [...] "sad, emotional, and heartfelt vocals," [...] while in the latter she sings over a piano and string-supplemented melody. About the rock and roll [...] "direction" [...] of the album, Shakira said [...] "I started my career as a rock artist and then I kind of crossed over into pop, so it’s been fun to re-encounter that side of my artistic personality".|$|E
500|$|Similarities of The Hunger Games to Koushun Takami's 1999novel Battle Royale {{have been}} noted.

Just continue with what you're doing'." [...] Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff" [...] of Battle Royale but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] Stephen King noted that the reality TV [...] "badlands" [...] were similar to Battle Royale, {{as well as his}} own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk. Eric Eisenberg wrote that The Hunger Games was [...] "not a rip off of Battle Royale, but simply a different usage of a similar idea", pointing out various differences in both story and themes.|$|E
500|$|After {{four years}} in the role, Irving decided to leave Holby City and return to {{performing}} in theatre. He stated: [...] "I've had four great years but I felt {{the time had come to}} leave. The show has gone from strength to strength so now seems a good time to go." [...] Of his decision to leave, Irving explained that, while he enjoyed Meyer's sureness and confidence, he found it difficult to [...] "switch off" [...] the character outside of work, and had been forced to [...] "put the rest of his life on hold" [...] whilst part of the series, deeming it to be an [...] "intense experience." [...] He felt that, had he stayed in the series, Meyer could not have remained enigmatic much longer, and believed: [...] "you have to stop when a character's time is through." [...] Following Irving's departure from Holby City, Benji Wilson of the Radio Times questioned whether he would ever consider returning. Irving responded: [...] "I don't know–my feeling is that Meyer was of his time. He's the kind of character that belongs at the launch of series like Holby and I think that's where he should remain. The memory of Meyer is important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> want it to stay as it is." ...|$|E
