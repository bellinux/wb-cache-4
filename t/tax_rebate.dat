5|$|Opponents of {{the plan}} criticize this <b>tax</b> <b>rebate</b> due to its costs. Economists at the Beacon Hill Institute {{estimated}} the overall rebate cost to be $489 billion (assuming 100% participation). In addition, economist Bruce Bartlett {{has argued that the}} rebate would create a large opportunity for fraud, treats children disparately, and would constitute a welfare payment regardless of need.|$|E
5|$|The {{effective}} {{tax rate}} for any household would be variable due to the fixed monthly <b>tax</b> <b>rebate</b> {{that are used to}} rebate taxes paid on purchases up to the poverty level. The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new goods and services. Critics argue that the sales tax rate defined in the legislation would not be revenue neutral (that is, it would collect less for the government than the current tax system), and thus would increase the budget deficit, unless government spending were equally reduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of wind power capacity in South Australia has been encouraged {{by a number}} of factors. These include the Australian Government's Renewable Energy Target, which require electricity retailers to source a proportion of energy from renewable sources, incentives from the South Australian Government including a supportive regulatory regime and a payroll <b>tax</b> <b>rebate</b> scheme for large scale renewable energy developments. Also the state's proximity to the Roaring forties means there are high quality wind resources for wind farms to exploit. In mid-2009, RenewablesSA was established by the South Australian Government to encourage further investment in renewable energy in the state.|$|E

5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending <b>tax</b> <b>rebate</b> checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, during {{pre-production}} for The Dark Knight, Warner Bros. hired {{husband and}} wife screenwriting duo Michelle and Kieran Mulroney to script a Justice League film featuring a younger Batman in a separate franchise. George Miller was hired to direct the following September, with Armie Hammer cast as Batman a month later and Teresa Palmer as Talia al Ghul. Filming had nearly commenced at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, but was pushed back over the Writer's Guild of America strike, and once more when the Australian Film Commission denied Warner Bros. a 45 percent <b>tax</b> <b>rebate</b> over lack of Australian actors in the film. Production offices were moved to Vancouver Film Studios in Canada for an expected July 2008 start and a planned summer 2009 theatrical release date, but Warner Bros. ultimately canceled Justice League following the success of The Dark Knight. Hammer's option on his contract lapsed and the studio was more willing to proceed with Christopher Nolan to finish his trilogy separately with The Dark Knight Rises.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget of}} the series is {{estimated}} to be £15 million. Filming began in February 2013 and concluded in August 2013, with location shooting largely taken place in Kent and northern France. Filming in Kent was based in Discovery Park in Sandwich and was supported by the Kent Film Office. A former Pfizer facility was used as a number of sets, including the Calais police station and Elise's apartment. The series was filmed throughout five districts: Canterbury, Dover, Shepway, Swale and Thanet. Several prominent locales were featured, including Folkestone Harbour; The Turner Contemporary art gallery; Westwood Cross shopping centre; and the towns of Dover, Folkestone and Margate. Production also made use of the Kent Film Office's legal powers to close certain roads for uninterrupted filming. An estimated £2.5 million of the budget was spent on, among other services, accommodation, locations, parking and catering, providing a boost for the Kent economy. The filming in France was supported by the Nord-Pas de Calais Film Commission and benefited from the <b>Tax</b> <b>Rebate</b> International. Shooting took place over 31 days across Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais and Dunkerque.|$|E

25|$|School {{districts are}} rarely {{precisely}} coextensive with the cities, towns, villages, or hamlets that bear the same name, meaning {{that a person}} living in one hamlet or village might {{send their children to}} a school associated with a different hamlet or village.

25|$|Private schools rely {{mainly on}} tuition fees {{paid to the}} school by {{the parents of the}} students, {{although}} some funding is provided by the government.

30|$|After the tax-sharing reform, central fiscal {{revenue was}} {{transferred}} down to local governments in three forms: <b>tax</b> <b>rebates,</b> general-purpose transfer payments, and special purpose transfer payments. 6 The three {{are designed for}} different goals and correspondingly have different intergovernmental authority-accountability features. First, the form of <b>tax</b> <b>rebates</b> is designed to encourage local tax extraction, and the main goal of <b>tax</b> <b>rebates</b> is to balance resistance to the economic reform, especially from developed regions in eastern China. Thus, <b>tax</b> <b>rebates</b> have an unfair effect. In {{the early years of}} the reform, <b>tax</b> <b>rebates</b> increased to almost 80 % of government expenditures, while it remained at the rate of 50 % before 2000, and the majority went to developed regions. Second, the general-purpose transfer payment was designed to balance expenditure gaps among regions, and it contributed the political effect of achieving social equality and maintaining social stability (Treisman 1999; Wang 2002). The majority of these funds flowed to the western or frontier areas, minority regions, rural areas, and impoverished areas. Third, the form of special transfer payments is unique in its purpose, special distribution mechanism, and practical results. According to economic analyses, special transfer payments are a modification for externality through subsidies to regional marginal revenue and altering relative prices to solve the financial shortage of public goods, especially goods that have strong externality. However, scholars have pointed out that the function of special transfer payments works by political logic (Dixit and Londregan 1998). The profit of special transfer payments belongs to specific regions while the national fiscal system bears the costs; thus, local government may over-apply for special transfer payments. The distributors of special transfer payments make decisions politically rather than economically, so there are a considerable number of inefficient projects (Weingast et al. 1981).|$|R
25|$|As governor, Ventura oversaw {{reforms of}} Minnesota's {{property}} tax {{as well as}} the state's first sales <b>tax</b> <b>rebate.</b> Other initiatives taken under Ventura included construction of the METRO Blue Line light rail in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, and cuts in income taxes. Ventura left office in 2003, deciding not to run for re-election. After leaving office, Ventura became a visiting fellow at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 2004. He has since also hosted a number of television shows and has written several political books. Ventura remains politically active and currently hosts a show on Ora TV and on RT America called Off the Grid. As of September 2017, Jesse is hosting a variety news show on RT called The World According to Jesse.|$|E
25|$|Benton Area School District {{residents}} {{may also}} {{qualify for the}} Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program. It is provided for several groups of school district residents, including: low income residents aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This <b>tax</b> <b>rebate</b> can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. The Property tax/rent rebate program is funded by revenues from the Pennsylvania Lottery. In 2012, these property tax rebates were increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.|$|E
25|$|There is {{dispute about}} the level of {{subsidies}} paid to the fossil fuel industry in Australia. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) argues that according to the definitions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), fossil fuel production and use is subsidised in Australia by means of direct payments, favourable tax treatment, and other actions. It is suggested these measures act as impediments to investment in renewable energy resources. Analysis by the ACF indicates that these provisions add up to a total annual subsidy of A$7.7billion, with the most significant component being the Fuel Tax Credits program that rebates diesel fuel excise to many business users. This analysis is disputed by the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) who argue that the ACF's definition of a subsidy differs from that of the OECD and that the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>rebate</b> schemes are in place to ensure that all producers are treated equally from a tax point of view. However, the IPA acknowledges that regardless of perceived issues with the ACF analysis, some level of fossil fuel subsidy is likely in existence.|$|E

25|$|Outlawed by the French Revolution, {{the slave}} trade re-established itself as Nantes' major source of income in {{the first decades of}} the 19th century. It was the last French port to conduct the illegal Atlantic trade, {{continuing}} it until about 1827. The 19th-century slave trade may have been as extensive as that of the previous century, with about 400,000 slaves deported to the colonies. Businessmen took advantage of local vegetable production and Breton fishing to develop a canning industry during the 1820s, but canning was eclipsed by sugar imported from Réunion in the 1840s and 1850s. Nantes tradesmen received a <b>tax</b> <b>rebate</b> on Réunion sugar, which was lucrative until disease devastated the cane plantations in 1863. By the mid-19th century, Le Havre and Marseilles were the two main French ports; the former traded with America and the latter with Asia. They had embraced the Industrial Revolution, thanks to Parisian investments; Nantes lagged behind, struggling to find profitable activities. Nostalgic for the pre-revolutionary golden age, the local elite had been suspicious of political and technological progress during the first half of the 19th century. In 1851, after much debate and opposition, Nantes was connected to Paris by the Tours–Saint-Nazaire railway.|$|E
500|$|Terminator Salvation had a $200 million budget.

[...] The filmmakers had originally intended to begin filming on March 15 in Budapest or Australia, but a 25 percent <b>tax</b> <b>rebate</b> and absence of an interest rate cap and floor made the filmmakers seek the cheaper New Mexico, because of their elevated budget. To avoid delays caused by a possible 2008 Screen Actors Guild strike in July, all exterior scenes were completed by then, so production could restart easily.

500|$|Under the FairTax, family {{households}} of lawful U.S. residents [...] {{would be}} eligible to receive a [...] "Family Consumption Allowance" [...] (FCA) based on family size (regardless of income) that {{is equal to the}} estimated total FairTax paid on poverty level spending according to the poverty guidelines published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The FCA is a <b>tax</b> <b>rebate</b> (known as a [...] "prebate" [...] as it would be an advance) paid in twelve monthly installments, adjusted for inflation. The rebate is meant to eliminate the taxation of household necessities and make the plan progressive. Households would register once a year with their sales tax administering authority, providing the names and social security numbers of each household member.

500|$|A household's {{effective}} {{tax rate}} on consumption would vary with the annual expenditures on taxable items and the fixed monthly <b>tax</b> <b>rebate.</b> The rebate would have the greatest effect at low spending levels, where they could lower a household's effective rate to zero or below. The lowest {{effective tax rate}} under the FairTax could be negative due to the rebate for households with annual spending amounts below poverty level spending for a specified household size. At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact, and a household's effective tax rate would approach 23% of total spending. A person spending at the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 0%, whereas someone spending at four times the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 17.2%. Buying or otherwise receiving items and services not subject to federal taxation (such as a used home or car) can contribute towards a lower effective tax rate.

Later that year, Cameron announced that the sequels would be filmed in New Zealand, with performance capture to take place in 2014. An agreement with the New Zealand government required at least one world premiere to be held in Wellington and at least NZ$500 million (approximately US$410 million at December 2013 exchange rates) to be spent on production activity in New Zealand, including live-action filming and visual effects. The New Zealand government announced it would raise its baseline <b>tax</b> <b>rebate</b> for filmmaking from 15% to 20%, with 25% available to international productions in some cases and 40% for New Zealand productions (as defined by section 18 of the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978).|$|E
