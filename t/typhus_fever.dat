5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, {{hoping it would}} aid his recovery, but it did not. Doctors disagreed on {{the cause of his}} illness, with diagnoses ranging from <b>typhus</b> <b>fever</b> to stomach ailments. He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared for the journey, he collapsed in pain and had to be helped back inside. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband's death that she went blind from her incessant crying. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery.|$|E

She returned to Sunderland and took up employment at the Sunderland Infirmary, House of Recovery for the Cure of Contagious Fever, Dispensary and Humane Society.

25|$|During the interwar period, Lwów {{held the}} rank of the Second Polish Republic's third most populous city (following Warsaw and Łódź), and it became {{the seat of the}} Lwów Voivodeship. Following Warsaw, Lwów was the second most {{important}} cultural and academic centre of interwar Poland. For example, in 1920 professor Rudolf Weigl of the Lwów University developed a vaccine against <b>typhus</b> <b>fever.</b> Furthermore, the geographic location of Lwów gave it an important role in stimulating international trade and fostering the city's and Poland's economic development. A major trade fair called Targi Wschodnie was established in 1921. In the academic year 1937–1938, there were 9,100 students attending five institutions of higher education, including the Lwów University as well as the Polytechnic.|$|E

2500|$|Although Kellogg praised hydropathy for {{its many}} uses, he did {{acknowledge}} its limits. [...] "In nearly all cases, sunlight, pure air, rest, exercise, proper food, and other hygienic agencies are quite {{as important as}} water. Electricity, too, is a remedy which should not be ignored; and skillful surgery is absolutely indispensable in not {{a small number of}} cases." [...] With this belief, he went on to criticize many medical figures who misused or overestimated hydropathy in the treating of disease. Among these, he criticized what he referred to as [...] "Cold-Water Doctors" [...] who would recommend the same remedy regardless of the type of ailment or temperament of the patient. These doctors would prescribe ice cold baths in unwarmed rooms even during the harshest winters. In his opinion, his prejudicial approach to illness resulted in converting hydropathy a more heroic type of treatment where many became obsessed with taking baths in ice cold baths. He addresses the negative consequences that resulted from this [...] "infatuation," [...] among them tuberculosis and other diseases. This dangerous habit was only exacerbated by physicians who used hydropathy in excess. Kellogg recounts an instance where a patient with a low <b>typhus</b> <b>fever</b> was treated with thirty-five cold packs while in a feeble state and, not to the surprise of Kellogg, died. Kellogg posits this excessive and dangerous use of hydropathy as a return to the [...] "violent processes" [...] of bloodletting, antimony, mercury and purgatives. Kellogg also criticizes the ignorance in [...] "Hydropathic Quacks" [...] as well as in Preissnitz, the founder of modern hydropathy, himself. Kellogg states that the [...] "Quacks" [...] as well as Preissnitz are ignorant for overestimating the hydropathy as a [...] "cure-all" [...] remedy without understanding the true nature of disease.|$|E

60|$|This {{was a great}} occasion. But, our Vestry shines habitually. In asserting its own pre-eminence, for instance, it is very strong. On {{the least}} provocation, or on none, it will be {{clamorous}} to know whether {{it is to be}} 'dictated to,' or 'trampled on,' or 'ridden over rough-shod.' Its great watchword is Self-government. That is to say, supposing our Vestry to favour any little harmless disorder like <b>Typhus</b> <b>Fever,</b> and supposing the Government of the country to be, by any accident, in such ridiculous hands, as that any of its authorities should consider it a duty to object to <b>Typhus</b> <b>Fever</b> - obviously an unconstitutional objection - then, our Vestry cuts in with a terrible manifesto about Self-government, and claims its independent right to have as much <b>Typhus</b> <b>Fever</b> as pleases itself. Some absurd and dangerous persons have represented, on the other hand, that though our Vestry may be able to 'beat the bounds' of its own parish, it {{may not be able to}} beat the bounds of its own diseases; which (say they) spread over the whole land, in an ever expanding circle of waste, and misery, and death, and widowhood, and orphanage, and desolation.

60|$|Now let us {{suppose that}} {{in the early nineteenth century}} {{somebody}} had come forward with a theory that <b>typhus</b> <b>fever</b> always begins in the top joint of the little finger; and that if this joint be amputated immediately after birth, <b>typhus</b> <b>fever</b> will disappear. Had such a suggestion been adopted, the theory would have been triumphantly confirmed; for as a matter of fact, <b>typhus</b> <b>fever</b> has disappeared. On the other hand cancer and madness have increased (statistically) to an appalling extent. The opponents of the little finger theory would therefore be pretty sure to allege that the amputations were spreading cancer and lunacy. The vaccination controversy is full of such contentions. So is the controversy as to the docking of horses' tails and the cropping of dogs' ears. So is the less widely known controversy as to circumcision and the declaring certain kinds of flesh unclean by the Jews. To advertize any remedy or operation, you have only to pick out all the most reassuring advances made by civilization, and boldly present the two in the relation of cause and effect: the public will swallow the fallacy without a wry face. It has no idea of the need for what is called a control experiment. In Shakespear's time and for long after it, mummy was a favorite medicament. You took a pinch of the dust of a dead Egyptian in a pint of the hottest water you could bear to drink; and it did you a great deal of good. This, you thought, proved what a sovereign healer mummy was. But if you had tried the control experiment of taking the hot water without the mummy, you might have found the effect exactly the same, and that any hot drink would have done as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{immunological}} {{response of}} Man to <b>typhus</b> <b>fevers,</b> caused by obligate intracellular parasitic bacteria {{of the genus}} Rickettsia, includes both antibody and cellmediated components (CMI) 1 (1 - 3). The immune effector mechanisms that control intracellular rickettsial replication are unknown, but studies in animals indicate that they are mediated through immune T lymphocytes 2 (4). The relationship between Rickettsia prowazekii-infected cells to monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes in the classical typhus lesions (5) suggests the participation of CMI mechanisms other than phagocytosis and destruction by activated macrophages. Thus, the basic lesion, a vasculitis of small blood vessels, consists of focal areas of rickettsial infection of endothelial cells accompanied by perivascular accumulations of monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Some intravascular mononuclear cells, {{in contact with the}} luminal surface of endothelial cells, presumably pass across the infected endothelial cells to perivascular sites, which might activate specific T lymphocytes (6). Rickettsiae appear to be limited largely to the endothelial cells, despite their catholic in vitro host cell range (7) ...|$|R
