5|$|The {{first two}} stories were both seen in Medieval- and Renaissance {{theology}} as prefiguring the Crucifixion of Jesus. In {{the story of}} the Brazen Serpent, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> become dissatisfied and grumble at God. As punishment they receive a plague of venonous snakes. God offers the people relief by instructing Moses to make a snake of brass and set it up on a pole, the sight of which gives miraculous healing. Michelangelo chooses a crowded composition, depicting a dramatic mass of suffering men, women, and writhing snakes, separated from redeemed worshipers by the snake before an epiphanic light.|$|E

Interspersed in the narrative are the specific teachings (religious obligations and civil laws) given explicitly (i.e. Ten Commandments) or implicitly embedded in the narrative (as in Exodus 12 and 13 laws of the celebration of Passover).|$|E

He brought evidence to bear from Ptolemy and works by Diodorus, supporting the earlier history of the Israelites.

25|$|In {{the text}} of the psalm, {{specifically}} verses 2 through 5, the speaker makes the assumption that individuals who plot against the nation of Israel must inherently be enemies of God.

Their first father sinned, and their intercessors transgressed, and so God abandoned the sanctuary and the Israelites to condemnation.|$|E
25|$|Most Islamic {{tradition}} conveys Jesus and {{his teaching}} conformed to the prophetic model: a human, as with previous prophets, sent by God {{to a certain}} people at a certain time, to present both a judgement upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge {{to turn to the}} one true God.

25|$|But it was {{particularly}} with the view of fitting the soul for communion with God, or {{for the purpose of}} keeping the body sufficiently pure to allow it to come into contact with sacred objects, that many strove to avoid things that either cause intoxication or Levitical impurity, the drinking of wine (Lev. x. 9; Num. vi. 3; Amos ii. 12; Judges xiii. 14), or sexual intercourse, which was forbidden to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> in preparation for the Sinai Revelation (Ex. xix. 15), and to Moses during the life of communion with God (Deut. ix. 9, 18; I Sam. xxi. 5; Shab. 87a).|$|E

When he is eighty years old, Moses is tending a herd of sheep in solitude on Mount Sinai when he sees a desert shrub that is burning but is not consumed. The God of Israel calls to Moses from the fire and reveals his name, Yahweh (from the Hebrew root word 'HWH' meaning to exist), and tells Moses that he is being sent to Pharaoh to bring <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> out of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|The Qur’an {{does not}} convey the {{specific}} teachings of Jesus. What has {{developed over the}} years was authored by later followers of Islam.

In the case of Jesus, Muslims believe that his mission was to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> and that his status as a prophet was confirmed by numerous miracles. The Qur’an's description of specific events at the end of Jesus’ life have continued to be controversial between Christians and Muslims, while the classical commentaries have been interpreted differently to accommodate new information.|$|E
25|$|The {{worship of}} Yahweh alone {{began at the}} {{earliest}} with Elijah in the 9th century BCE, but more likely with the prophet Hosea in the 8th; even then it remained the concern of a small party before gaining ascendancy in the exilic and early post-exilic period. The early supporters of this faction are widely regarded as being monolatrists rather than true monotheists; {{they did not believe}} that Yahweh was the only god in existence, but instead believed that he was the only god <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> should worship. Finally, in the national crisis of the exile, the followers of Yahweh went a step further and outright denied that the other deities aside from Yahweh even existed, thus marking the transition from monolatrism to true monotheism.|$|E

5000|$|Such {{knowledge}} of the apocalypse had both heavenly and earthly implications, and assumed {{a great deal of}} importance to <b>the</b> oppressed <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> at <b>the</b> time, who needed explanations for why God would let them go through so much hardship; thus, the knowledge was “good.” [...] Because of the bizarre features of the visions contained in such apocalyptic literature, interpreting angels assume the roles of teachers rather than just messengers; instead of just conveying information, they must explain it.|$|R
