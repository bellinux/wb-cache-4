After analyzing {{the components of the}} <b>total</b> passenger <b>travel</b> time, a model is presented with the aim of minimizing <b>total</b> passenger <b>travel</b> time. An S-pattern function is proposed to represent the cumulative demand function for each pair of origin and destination in an urban single-line metro.

The advantages of designing a timetable that optimizes the <b>total</b> passenger <b>travel</b> time adapted to dynamic passenger demand are depicted through extensive computational experiments on several cases derived from a real urban single-line metro.

Several options were researched, and Professor Twining recommended the route following the Norwalk River. This route would come through Norwalk and South Norwalk, and terminate {{on the shores of}} the Long Island Sound at Belden's Point. It was longer than other options, but the <b>total</b> <b>travel</b> time to New York City was shorter, because less travel over water was needed.|$|E
25|$|Services {{are often}} {{arranged}} {{to operate at}} regular intervals throughout the day {{or part of the}} day (known as clock-face scheduling). Often, more frequent services or even extra routes are operated during the morning and evening rush hours. Coordination between services at interchange points is important to reduce the <b>total</b> <b>travel</b> time for passengers. This can be done by coordinating shuttle services with main routes, or by creating a fixed time (for instance twice per hour) when all bus and rail routes meet at a station and exchange passengers. There is often a potential conflict between this objective and optimising the utilisation of vehicles and drivers.|$|E

Today the Lander cutoff road(s) are roughly followed by a series of county and Forest Service roads.|$|E

In this paper, multi objective VRPTW is considered in which the <b>total</b> distance <b>travelled,</b> <b>total</b> number of vehicles used and route balance are minimized. Genetic algorithm with fitness aggregation approach and specialized operators like selection based on aggregate fitness value, best cost route crossover called Fitness Aggregated Genetic Algorithm (FAGA) is introduced for solving the multi objective problem. The algorithm was tested on large number of Solomon's benchmarks for bi-objective model that is minimization of <b>total</b> distance <b>travelled</b> and <b>total</b> number of vehicles used. The results produced by FAGA are highly competitive to best known results reported in the literature.

2500|$|An {{electric}} field is applied across the gel, causing the negatively charged proteins or nucleic acids to migrate across the gel {{away from the}} negative electrode (which is the cathode being {{that this is an}} electrolytic rather than galvanic cell) and towards the positive electrode (the anode). Depending on their size, each biomolecule moves differently through the gel matrix: small molecules more easily fit through the pores in the gel, while larger ones have more difficulty. The gel is run usually for a few hours, though this depends on the voltage applied across the gel; migration occurs more quickly at higher voltages, but these results are typically less accurate than at those at lower voltages. [...] After the set amount of time, the biomolecules have migrated different distances based on their size. Smaller biomolecules travel farther down the gel, while larger ones remain closer to the point of origin. Biomolecules may therefore be separated roughly according to size, which depends mainly on molecular weight under denaturing conditions, but also depends on higher-order conformation under native conditions. The gel mobility is defined as the rate of migration traveled with a voltage gradient of 1V/cm and has units of cm2/sec/V. For analytical purposes, the relative mobility of biomolecules, Rf, the ratio of the distance the molecule traveled on the gel to the <b>total</b> <b>travel</b> distance of a tracking dye is plotted versus the molecular weight of the molecule (or sometimes the log of MW, or rather the Mr, molecular radius).
