5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>room.</b> She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} of the two-story 306ft long {{building}} contained a clothing factory, dry cleaning plant, furniture plant, brush factory, and an office, where prisoners of the federal penitentiary could work for money. They earned a small wage for their labour which was put into an account, known as a Prisoner's Trust Fund, which would be given to them upon leaving Alcatraz. They made items such as gloves, furniture mats, and army uniforms. <b>The</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>room</b> occupied the entire upper floor, the largest in San Francisco at the time. Each window has 9 panes and there are 17 bays on each floor on either side.|$|E

25|$|Another {{highlight}} of UC Davis is its student-run freeform radio station, KDVS. The station began operations on February 1, 1964 from <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>room</b> of the all-male dormitory Beckett Hall. The station soon {{gained a reputation}} by airing interviews with Angela Davis and a live call-in show with then California Governor Ronald Reagan in 1969. The station can now be heard on 90.3 FM and online at its website.|$|E
25|$|Since its closure, {{reports of}} unexplained clanging sounds, screams, and crying {{have often been}} {{reported}} in the prison blocks. Unexplained footsteps and moaning have been reported in both A and B blocks. C-Block is reputedly haunted by the spirit of former inmate Abie Maldowitz (nicknamed Butcher) who was murdered in <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>room.</b> On September 5, 1984, a ranger spent the night alone on the island and was awakened by a heavy door swinging in C-Block, but found no cause for it; the door swinging continued on other nights.|$|E

25|$|Alcatraz Citadel, {{also known}} as Fort Alcatraz, was the {{original}} military defense and prison on Alcatraz Island. The citadel was built in 1859 as a U.S. Army military defense, and began function as a war camp in 1861 and long-term military prison in 1868. During the American Civil War, the citadel and its batteries provided an important line of defense. The island continued to develop in the 1870s and 1880s, and in 1893, the first hospital on Alcatraz opened. A new upper prison was built in 1904, but after the citadel ceased function as a military defense in 1907 and the original citadel collapsed the following year, a $250,000 concrete military prison was erected between 1910 and 1912. In 1933–1934, the building was modernized and became the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. It incarcerated some of America's most dangerous criminals between 1934 and 1963. During its time as a Penitentiary, 8 people were murdered at the prison by inmates; a guard was murdered in <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>room</b> in the late 1930s, two died during the ill-fated 1946 escape attempt, and five inmates were killed in random attacks. Five prisoners committed suicide, {{and at least a}} dozen died in total trying to escape.|$|E
500|$|After being uprooted {{from their}} homes and communities, the incarcerees found {{themselves}} having to endure primitive, sub-standard conditions, and lack of privacy. They had to wait in one line after another for meals, at latrines, and at <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>room.</b> [...] Each camp was intended to be self-sufficient, and Manzanar was no exception. Cooperatives operated various services, such as the camp newspaper, beauty and barber shops, shoe repair, and more. In addition, incarcerees raised chickens, hogs, and vegetables, and cultivated the existing orchards for fruit. Incarcerees made their own soy sauce and tofu.|$|E

50|$|The attic, where <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>rooms</b> were located, {{was a clear}} room under a Catalan vault roof {{supported}} by 270 parabolic vaults of different heights and spaced by about 80 cm. The roof resembles both the ribs of a huge animal and a palm, giving the roof-deck a very unconventional shape similar to a landscape of hills and valleys. The shape and location of the courtyards makes the arches higher when the space is narrowed and lower when the space expands.|$|R

2500|$|While {{preparing}} {{their third}} prosecution in 2003, Orange County investigators learned that Alcala's DNA, sampled {{under a new}} state law (over his objections), matched semen left at the rape-murder scenes of two women in Los Angeles. [...] Additional evidence, including another cold case DNA match in 2004, led to Alcala's indictment for the murders of four additional women: Jill Barcomb, 18, a New York runaway found [...] "rolled up like a ball" [...] in a Los Angeles ravine in 1977, and originally {{thought to have been}} a victim of the Hillside Strangler; Georgia Wixted, 27, bludgeoned in her Malibu apartment in 1977; Charlotte Lamb, 31, raped, strangled, and left in <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>room</b> of an El Segundo apartment complex in 1978; and Jill Parenteau, 21, killed in her Burbank apartment in 1979. [...] All of the bodies were found [...] "posed...in carefully chosen positions". [...] Another pair of earrings found in Alcala's Seattle storage locker matched Lamb's DNA.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Sightings {{investigated}} the prison {{and claimed that}} they have evidence of ghostly activity caught on film at Alcatraz. A CBS news team was also reputed to have experienced strange activity in the prison hospital and in <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>room.</b> Psychic Daena Smoller and psychologist Larry Montz investigated the prison and found nothing in D-Block or the cellhouse but equipped with a magnetometer, they picked up a reading in the New Industries Building {{in the area where}} inmates had been employed in sewing. Smoller says that she picked up on the intense sound of buzzing of sewing machines and energy of the workplace and suddenly felt an intense pain in her neck. Nothing happened for several minutes until the magnetometer reportedly [...] "jumped". Montz said that unless there was an electromagnetic device in the building which would cause it to have taken place, then there was [...] "definitely paranormal activity taking place". Apparently unknown to the investigators, the incident had occurred in the area that Henri Young had murdered Rufus McCain, stabbing him in the neck.|$|E
2500|$|Hahn was the {{youngest}} son of Heinrich Hahn (1845–1922), a prosperous glazier and entrepreneur ("Glasbau Hahn"), and Charlotte Hahn, née Giese (1845–1905). According to his long-time scientific collaborator Nikolaus Riehl, the family had [...] "a Jewish antecedent", {{a fact that the}} chemist never brought publicly too much, and which thus didn't hinder his academic career during the Nazi era. On the other hand, journalist Bernt Engelmann, while corroborating the Jewish roots on the maternal side, says that it was an open secret which has been [...] "hushed up because German science could not afford the loss of this scientist of the highest international repute." [...] Together with his brothers Karl, Heiner and Julius, Otto was raised in a sheltered environment. At the age of 15, he began to take a special interest in chemistry, and carried out simple experiments in <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>room</b> of the family home. His father wanted Otto to study architecture, as he had built or acquired several residential and business properties, but Otto persuaded him that his ambition was to become an industrial chemist.|$|E
50|$|Originally all bathers were {{supplied}} with a towel, soap and (for swimmers) a costume, {{collected from the}} baths attendant's kiosk.

Henry expresses both disbelief and disinterest ("whatever") and leaves.|$|R
2500|$|Police {{questioned}} the Degnan family's neighbors, but few had seen anything unusual. Someone later telephoned police anonymously, suggesting that police {{look in the}} sewers near the Degnan home. Police did, and discovered the young girl's head in a storm-drain sewer that was in an alley {{a block from the}} Degnan residence. In the same alley, they discovered the girl's right leg in a catch basin, her torso in another storm drain and her left leg in a drain in another alley, each location progressively further from her home. Her arms were found a month later in a sewer {{on the other side of}} the Howard elevated train line more than three blocks from the Degnan residence. All the drains were capped with circular cast-iron manhole covers, yet no one had heard them being lifted or replaced. Searches of an apartment building near where her head was found uncovered a basement laundry room with four tubs that contained evidence indicating she had been dismembered there. The killer had mopped the floor, but blood was found in the drains of all four tubs. The press called it the [...] "Murder Room" [...] although the autopsy showed that she had been alive when taken from her home, murdered at a second location that was never identified, and then taken to <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

50|$|Another typical {{location}} is {{adjacent to the}} garage and <b>the</b> <b>laundry</b> <b>room</b> serves as a mudroom for the entrance from the garage.
