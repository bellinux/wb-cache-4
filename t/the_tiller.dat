5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. <b>The</b> <b>tiller</b> was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|E
5|$|Maharashtraian Brahmins were {{absentee}} landlords {{and lived}} off the surplus without tilling the land themselves per ritual restrictions. They were {{often seen as}} the exploiter of <b>the</b> <b>tiller.</b> This situation started to change when the newly independent India enshrined in its constitution, agrarian or land reform. Between 1949–1959, the state governments started enacting legislation {{in accordance with the}} constitution implementing this agrarian reform or Kula Kayada in Marathi. The legislation led to the abolition of various absentee tenures like inams and jagirs. This implementation of land reform had mixed results in different States. On official inquiry, it was revealed that not all absentee tenures were abolished in the State of Maharashtra as of 1985. Other social and political issues include anti-Brahminism and the treatment of Dalits.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the impact of simulated rat damage on grain yield in irrigated lowland rice in An Giang province, in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Rat damage was simulated by making a 45 ° cut {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> rice <b>tillers</b> about 3 - 5 cm above the soil surface. 0 % (control), 5 %, 10 %, 25 % and 50 % of <b>the</b> <b>tillers</b> were removed at <b>the</b> <b>tillering</b> (25 days after sowing, DAS), panicle initiation (43 DAS), flowering (72 DAS) and ripening (87 DAS) stages. The total number of mature tillers, immature tillers and percent filled grains, the weight of 1000 grains and grain yields were recorded. The rice crop completely compensated by increased tillering and yield for tillers damaged up to 50 % at <b>the</b> <b>tillering</b> stage. However, <b>the</b> damage and yield loss were highly variable. The ability of the rice crop to compensate at later stages progressively reduced. The implications for managing rat damage to rice crops are (1) rodent control activities should be applied before 10 % of tillers are damaged at <b>the</b> <b>tillering</b> stage, and (2) a well balanced nitrogen supply during <b>the</b> <b>tillering</b> stage could potentially assist the rice plants to better compensate for rat damage. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of <b>the</b> <b>tiller.</b> He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of later-initiated tillers of semidwarf rice {{cultivar}}s become either less- or un-productive at maturity. Rice cultivar Lalat was grown in pot (2001 - 02, Sambalpur University) and field (2004, Regional Research and Technology Transfer Station, Chiplima). The phenological and morphological development, assimilate contents and grain yield of the panicle of different categories of tillers were assessed {{in order to find}} out the bias against development of <b>the</b> less productive <b>tillers.</b> <b>The</b> order of dominance of <b>the</b> <b>tillers</b> decreased acropetally in both the conditions. In contrast to the field, <b>the</b> plant <b>tillered</b> profusely in pots. The duration of vegetative and reproductive periods of <b>the</b> late-initiated <b>tillers</b> were short as events like tiller emergence, booting and anthesis were delayed in them, but maturity date was more synchronized. Among tillers, panicle grains yields and assimilate concentration decreased with durations of vegetative and reproductive growth. The concentration of soluble sugars was highest at anthesis and differed among <b>the</b> classes of <b>tillers</b> with lower concentration in <b>the</b> late-initiated <b>tiller</b> compared with <b>the</b> early-initiated <b>tillers.</b> <b>The</b> concentration of soluble sugars at anthesis correlated positively with grain yield. Absence of late-tillers in the field-grown plants increased dominance of early-tillers and prompted higher partitioning of assimilates to panicle at crucial stages like booting and anthesis for benefit of grain yield. In contrast, late-emerged <b>tillers</b> of <b>the</b> potted plants having biomass less than 2. 5 g possessed poor sink organogenesis and failed to use assimilates partitioned in their favour to achieve reasonable grain filling...|$|R

40|$|The {{understanding}} of relationship between <b>the</b> numbers of <b>tillers</b> categories allows <b>the</b> identification of compensatory mechanisms that ensure plants adaptation to grazing. Thus, {{this work was}} conducted to evaluate the associations between densities of various tillers categories in same Brachiaria decumbens pasture under continuous stocking with cattle. <b>The</b> <b>tillers</b> were measured with different growth sources, developmental stages, and defoliation and sizes levels in sites of same pasture with plants of 10, 20, 30 and 40 cm. Pearson linear correlation between <b>the</b> different <b>tillers</b> categories were estimated. <b>The</b> vegetative <b>tillers</b> number (VTN) correlated positively with percentage of tillers with up to 20 cm. The response pattern opposite occurred with reproductive (RTN) and dead (DTN) <b>tillers</b> numbers. <b>The</b> correlations of number of leafless tillers were positive with <b>the</b> percentage of <b>tillers</b> with less than 20 cm and negative with <b>the</b> percentage of <b>tillers</b> with more than 20 cm. The VTN correlated positively with numbers of tillers with and without defoliation, and negatively with the RNT and DNT. The number of aerial tiller {{was positively correlated with}} <b>the</b> number of <b>tillers</b> without apical meristem.

For setting classic tracks, the groomer trails special pans, which mould the tracks. Attachments for snowmobiles perform the same functions at a smaller scale and include a roller to compact the snow over a wide swath and a drag to level the snow behind the roller.|$|E
25|$|The Contessa 32 was {{designed}} by David Sadler in 1970, in response to demand for a larger version of his popular Contessa 26 which had been launched by the Jeremy Rogers boatyard five years earlier. The first two hulls were moulded by Jeremy Rogers in the same year. The yacht was exhibited at the London Boat Show in 1971, and was an immediate success, winning 'Boat of the Show' and securing numerous orders. Demand rapidly outstripped production, and until new facilities were built the waiting list ran to two years. In the next decade, the Rogers yard built 500 Contessa 32s, and when production stopped in 1983 over 700 had been built, and had been sold around the world. Between 1973 and 1990, an additional 87 were built under licence by J.J. Taylor of Canada after a hull and deck were shipped out {{and a set of}} moulds produced. These 'Canadian Contessas' have various production differences; <b>the</b> <b>tiller</b> was replaced with a wheel, the rig was made 3 feet taller, more GRP mouldings rather than wood were used in the interior, and a coremat cored deck replaced the solid deck. At least two other Contessa 32s were built by MacBar Marine in Poole in 1986, and about 15 more were built between 1988 and 1995 by Mike Slack. In 1996, after rebuilding his bankrupt business from scratch, Jeremy Rogers was able to buy the moulds back, and after their restoration was able to resume production of the Contessa 32 on a bespoke hand-crafted basis. The first of these 'new Contessas', Wild Call, was built in the same year. By 2010 another 20 had been built, of which the Rogers family boat, Calypso, was exhibited at the Southampton Boat Show that year.|$|E

500|$|In {{the decades}} that followed, {{fact and fiction}} became intertwined. As early as June 1883, the Los Angeles Times retold the Mary Celeste story with invented detail: [...] "Every sail was set, <b>the</b> <b>tiller</b> was lashed fast, not a rope was out of place... The fire was burning in the galley. The dinner was {{standing}} untasted and scarcely cold... the log [...] written up to the hour of her discovery." [...] Twenty years later, in the November 1906 Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, Mary Celeste was recorded as drifting off the Cape Verde Islands, some [...] south of the actual location. Among many inaccuracies, the first mate was [...] "a man named Briggs," [...] and there were live chickens on board.|$|E
500|$|The {{first few}} nights {{involved}} camping on nearby ice floes with the constant risk of them breaking up, {{but the last}} four nights were in the boats, with Worsley spending most of it at <b>the</b> <b>tiller</b> and going without sleep for 90 hours straight. His experience with open boats {{came to the fore}} in his sound handling of the Dudley Docker, while his navigation was exemplary, guiding the fleet of lifeboats unerringly to Elephant Island once they found favourable wind conditions. [...] On the final night at sea, with Elephant Island having been sighted earlier in the day, heavy seas separated his boat from the other two lifeboats. His boat taking on water and caught in a rip, Worsley steered the Dudley Docker all through the night. Relieved early in the morning, he promptly fell asleep and could only be awoken by kicks to the head. It was three years later that he eventually found out the method that was used by his companions to shake him from his deep sleep. [...] The Dudley Docker made shore on 15 April, landing on the same shingle beach of Elephant Island as the other lifeboats. It was the expedition's first landfall in almost 18 months.|$|E
