25|$|The {{theory of}} punctuated {{equilibrium}} developed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge is often mistakenly {{drawn into the}} discussion of transitional fossils. This theory pertains only to well-documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period. <b>These</b> <b>transitions,</b> usually traceable in the same geological outcrop, often show small jumps in morphology between periods of morphological stability. To explain these jumps, Gould and Eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution. For example, the change from a creature {{the size of a}} mouse, to one the size of an elephant, could be accomplished over 60,000 years, with a rate of change too small to be noticed over any human lifetime. 60,000 years is too small a gap to be identified or identifiable in the fossil record.|$|E
25|$|Obligate {{parthenogenesis}} is {{the process}} in which organisms exclusively reproduce through asexual means. Many species {{have been shown to}} transition to obligate parthenogenesis over evolutionary time. Among these species, one of the most well documented transitions to obligate parthenogenesis was found in almost all metazoan taxa, albeit through highly diverse mechanisms. <b>These</b> <b>transitions</b> often occur as a result of inbreeding or mutation within large populations. There are a number of documented species, specifically salamanders and geckos, that rely on obligate parthenogenesis as their major method of reproduction. As such, there are over 80 species of unisex reptiles (mostly lizards but including a single snake species), amphibians and fishes in nature for which males are no longer a part of the reproductive process. A female will produce an ovum with a full set (two sets of genes) provided solely by the mother. Thus, a male is not needed to provide sperm to fertilize the egg. This form of asexual reproduction is thought in some cases to be a serious threat to biodiversity for the subsequent lack of gene variation and potentially decreased fitness of the offspring.|$|E

500|$|The new {{technology}} also allowed the developers to create both {{indoor and outdoor}} environments; {{one of the biggest}} complaints of Descent II was {{the fact that it was}} considered too [...] "tunnely". To this end, the developers created a {{new technology}} which featured an indoor portal rendering engine [...] "hooked to a flight-sim-like terrain" [...] engine, collectively called the Fusion Engine. The portal engine permitted designers to create small rooms with complex geometry. These rooms would later be linked together via shared dividing polygons called portals to create a portalized world for the player to fly through. In contrast, the terrain engine, which was initially planned for another game and whose function is to create more polygonal detail as players get closer to the ground and decrease polygons when they are farther away, gave designers the ability to create expansive outdoor terrains. Transitions between both engines were achieved using an external room (with its normal vectors inverted) that could be placed anywhere on the terrain map. With this technique, developers could create hybrid levels where the player could transit from indoor to outdoor areas in real-time and without loading screens. Leighton commented that whenever one of <b>these</b> <b>transitions</b> occurs, [...] "the game code [...] collision detection, rendering, and so on, to use the terrain engine".|$|E

However, Night Dive had yet to comment on the situation regarding who owned the rights to the game. At this point, the rights to the series was unclear, as the property may have been owned solely or in part by 20th Century Fox (which owned Fox Interactive {{at the time of the}} game's release), Activision (which acquired and merged with Vivendi Games, which in turn was the parent to Sierra Entertainment, the publisher of No One Lives Forever 2, and had acquired Fox Interactive in 2003), and Warner Bros. (which acquired Monolith Productions). Warner Bros. did file opposition to Night Dive's trademark, leading Night Dive to try to seek a license arrangement. However, Warner Bros. represented were concerned that if either Fox or Activision had a part of the owernship, that they would also need their approval. Night Dive attempted to work with Fox and Activision to search their archives, but as <b>these</b> <b>transitions</b> pre-dated computerized records, neither company wanted to do so. Night Dive's efforts were further stalled when they were told by Warner Bros. that they had no interest in partnering or licensing the IP, leading Night Dive to abandon their efforts to acquire the rights.|$|E

40|$|Blazars are classically {{divided into}} the BL Lac (BLL) and Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) subclasses, {{corresponding}} to radiatively inefficient and efficient accretion regimes, respectively, {{largely based on}} the equivalent width (EW) of their optical broad emission lines (BEL). However, EW-based classification criteria are not physically motivated, and a few blazars have previously ‘transitioned’ from one subclass to the other. We present the first systematic search for <b>these</b> <b>transition</b> blazars {{in a sample of}} 602 unique pairs of repeat spectra of 354 blazars in SDSS, finding six clear cases. <b>These</b> <b>transition</b> blazars have bolometric Eddington ratios of ∼ 0. 3 and low-frequency synchrotron peaks, and are thus FSRQ-like. We show that the strong EW variability (up to an unprecedented factor of> 60) is due to swamping of the BELs from variability in jet continuum emission, which is stronger in amplitude and shorter in timescale than typical blazars. Although <b>these</b> <b>transition</b> blazars appear to switch between FSRQ and BLL according to the phenomenologically-based EW scheme, we show that they are most likely rare cases of FSRQs with radiatively efficient accretion flows and especially strongly-beamed jets. These results have implications for the decrease of the apparent BLL population at high-redshifts, and may add credence to claims of a negative BLL redshift evolution.

2500|$|MBD4 (methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 4) is a glycosylase {{employed}} in an initial step of base excision repair. [...] MBD4 protein binds preferentially to fully methylated CpG sites {{and to the}} altered DNA bases at those sites.

[...] If the improper uracils or thymines in these base pairs are not removed before DNA replication, they will cause transition mutations. [...] MBD4 [...] specifically catalyzes the removal of T and U paired with guanine (G) within CpG sites.
