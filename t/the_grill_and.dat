25|$|Letterkenny {{began as}} a market town {{at the start of}} the 17th century, during the Plantation of Ulster. A castle once stood near where the Cathedral of St. Eunan and St. Columba, Donegal's only Roman Catholic cathedral, stands today. Letterkenny Castle, built in 1625, was located south of Mt Southwell on Castle Street. Donegal's premier third-level institution, the Letterkenny Institute of Technology (LYIT), is located in the town, as are Saint Eunan's College, Highland Radio, and a Hindu temple. Letterkenny was also the {{original}} home of Oatfield Sweet Factory, the confectionery manufacturer, the factory was closed and the building was knocked down in 2014. The town is renowned for its night-life, with enterprises such as Club Voodoo, <b>The</b> <b>Grill,</b> <b>and</b> The Pulse regularly attracting international names. The Aura Complex, near O'Donnell Park, includes an Olympic-standard swimming pool, the Danny McDaid Athletic Track and an arena capable of hosting top-level events.|$|E

25|$|The R33 Skyline (Spec 2) {{continued}} the concepts {{introduced in the}} R32. Driver and Passenger airbags became standard in 1996. As a result, pre-1996 models are barred from being imported into various countries for consumer road use as they {{do not meet the}} frontal impact standards. (However, in the U.S., there are Federal Laws regarding safety and emissions that require certain documents to be obtained, certain criteria to be met and adhered to, or 25 years to pass, before the sale of this vehicle becomes legal.) For the RB25DET engine the ignition system was also changed, with the ignition module no longer located on the cam covers and was instead replaced by smart ignition coils (Ignitor built into coil) and ECU. The RB25DET's turbo was also given a nylon compressor wheel to improve response. Throughout the time the R33 was produced there were quite a number of different styled lights and bodykits fitted, the actual body/chassis underwent no changes. Among the cosmetic changes in the spec 2 were, the headlights which tapered down more towards <b>the</b> <b>grill</b> <b>and</b> were fitted with improved reflectors, the grill (which was longer on the Spec 1), the bonnet which had a re-shaped leading edge to fit the new lights and front bumper changing shape in the smallest amount to match the lower edge of the new headlights. Later models of the Spec 2 also had the option of having an Active-LSD fitted.|$|E
500|$|After all {{the editing}} {{imposed by the}} studio, Crimewave still became a box-office flop. Campbell {{reasoned}} that [...] "cross-genre" [...] films [...] "send marketing people scurrying under a desk". According to him, the film was hard to market because it featured elements of horror films, comedies, and dramas. To make matters even more confusing, in France and Italy, the film's title was changed to Death on <b>the</b> <b>Grill</b> <b>and</b> The Two Craziest Killers in the World respectively. In the United States, the film was only released in Kansas and Alaska, to make the film eligible for HBO broadcasting. Upon release, the film [...] "went down in box-office flames", with Campbell commenting [...] "it wasn't released. It escaped!"

[...] Both Daniel and Imogen thought they would be found quickly, but when someone shut <b>the</b> <b>grill</b> <b>and</b> water was pumped into the well, they realised that they might die down there. However, they were eventually rescued and Phillipps joked that he was relieved that he still had a job. He added that he enjoyed working on the storyline with Kaplan. When Daniel and Amber ended their relationship for a second time, an Inside Soap columnist noted that Daniel was [...] "understandably" [...] upset by the break up. In an effort to cheer Daniel up, Imogen suggested a day out at a local nature reserve. Daniel thanked Imogen with a kiss, after realising his feelings for her. However, Imogen did not react well as she was unsure if Daniel actually liked her, or she was just his [...] "rebound girl".|$|E

6000|$|I {{have always}} {{asserted}} {{the right and}} expediency of cross-examining attorneys in court {{with a view to}} testing their credibility. An attorney's relation to the trial is closer and more important than that of a witness. He has more to say and more opportunities to deceive the jury, not only by naked lying, but by both suppressio veri and suggestio falsi. Why is it not important to ascertain his credibility; and if an inquiry into his private life and public reputation will assist, as himself avers, why should he not be put upon <b>the</b> <b>grill</b> <b>and</b> compelled to sweat out the desired incrimination? I should think it might give good results, for example, to compel him to answer a few questions touching, not his private life, but his professional. Somewhat like this: ...|$|E
