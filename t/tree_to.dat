5|$|At the 1921 {{rally at}} the site, {{following}} a campaign by poet-politician Ventura Gassol, Pi Jove was inaugurated as {{the successor to}} the then-dead main tree. Speaking at the event, Gassol invited the landowner, who was present, to donate the <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> the Commonwealth of Catalonia (a semi-recognised autonomous government), but he declined, saying that practical effort {{is more important than}} symbols.|$|E

5|$|Flights are {{generally}} of short duration, rapid, low-leveled, and wavelike. The wings during flight are flapped rapidly, and are frequently used during foraging. They are also capable of flying vertically {{from the base}} of a <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> the top in a single wing assisted bound.|$|E
5|$|Honeyeaters {{are clearly}} the most {{important}} pollination vector, as inflorescences from which honeyeaters are excluded generally do not set any fruit. Moreover, honeyeaters have been observed moving from <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> tree with significant loads of B.sessilis pollen on their foreheads, beaks and throats, having acquired it by brushing against pollen presenters while foraging for nectar; experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently deposited on stigmas during later foraging.|$|E
50|$|In the Rhone Valley and on {{the plain}} of la Crau, the {{regularity}} and force of the mistral causes the <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> grow leaning to the south. Once the forest has been razed by fire, the strong wind {{makes it difficult for}} new <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> grow. The farmers of the Rhone Valley have long planted rows of cypress <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> shelter their crops from the dry force of the mistral. The mistral can also have beneficial effects—the moving air can save crops from the spring frost, which can last until the end of April.|$|R

5|$|In 1918, Halifax sent a Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> the City of Boston in {{thanks and}} remembrance {{for the help}} that the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee {{provided}} immediately after the disaster. That gift was revived in 1971 by the Lunenburg County Christmas Tree Producers Association, which began an annual donation of a large <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> promote Christmas tree exports as well as acknowledge Boston's support after the explosion. The gift was later {{taken over by the}} Nova Scotia Government to continue the goodwill gesture as well as to promote trade and tourism. The tree is Boston's official Christmas tree and is lit on Boston Common throughout the holiday season. In deference to its symbolic importance for both cities, the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources has specific guidelines for selecting the tree.|$|E
5|$|In North India, women worship Shashthi on Ashoka Shashthi, {{the sixth}} lunar {{day of the}} month of Chaitra. In this region, women will drink water from six flower-buds of the Ashoka <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> secure the {{well-being}} of their children. Women observe Khas Shashthi {{in the month of}} Pausha by fasting to ensure the longevity of their children.|$|E

5|$|One {{section of}} the M11 {{extension}} was due to tunnel under George Green in Wanstead. Residents had believed that this would save their green, and a 250-year-old sweet chestnut tree that grew upon it, but {{because this was a}} cut and cover tunnel, this required the <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> be cut down.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are {{threatened}} by deforestation and the wildlife trade, which includes the exotic pet trade, traditional medicine, and bushmeat. Other threats includes road construction, selective logging, and slash and burn agriculture. Habitat fragmentation obstructs biological dispersal for these species that rely on vines and lianas to move from <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> tree. Consequently, slow lorises are found dead on power lines or are victims of roadkill in areas where roads cut between forest patches.|$|E

50|$|Diversification rates can be {{estimated}} using the information available in phylogenetic <b>trees.</b> <b>To</b> calculate diversification rates, such phylogenetic <b>trees</b> have <b>to</b> include branch lengths. Various methods are available to estimate speciation and extinction rates from phylogenetic trees using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistical approaches. One can also use phylogenetic <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> test for changing rates of speciation and/or extinction, both through time and across clades, and to associate rates of evolution with potential explanatory factors.|$|R

5|$|The {{center of}} {{diversity}} of the genus Malus is in eastern present-day Turkey. The apple tree was perhaps the earliest <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> be cultivated, and its fruits have been improved through selection over thousands of years. Alexander the Great is credited with finding dwarfed apples in Kazakhstan in 328 BCE. Winter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in Asia and Europe for millennia.|$|E
5|$|The {{main purpose}} of the trunk is to raise the leaves above the ground, {{enabling}} the <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> reach the light and survive: the tree can overtop other plants and shade them out. It also performs the task of transporting water and nutrients from the roots to the aerial parts of the tree and to distribute the food produced by the leaves to all other parts including the roots.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{much older}} than 10,000 years would be {{practically}} impossible in Sweden, because until around 11,000 years ago the area was {{in the grip of}} a world-wide ice age.

5|$|A 1-forest, {{sometimes}} called a maximal pseudoforest, is a pseudoforest to which no more edges {{can be added}} without causing some component of the graph to contain multiple cycles. If a pseudoforest contains a tree {{as one of its}} components, it cannot be a 1-forest, for one can add either an edge connecting two vertices within that tree, forming a single cycle, or an edge connecting that <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> some other component. Thus, the 1-forests are exactly the pseudoforests in which every component is a 1-tree.|$|E
