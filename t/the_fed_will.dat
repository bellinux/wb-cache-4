40|$|The {{innermost}} detector of the CMS Experiment {{consists of}} 66 million silicon pixels. The hit data {{has to be}} read out and must be digitized, synchronized, formatted and transferred over the S-Link to the CMS DAQ. The amount of data can only be handled because the readout chip (ROC) delivers zero-suppressed data above an adjustable threshold for every pixel. <b>The</b> Pixel <b>FED</b> 9 U VME module receives an analog optical signal, which is subsequently digitized and processed. The position of the pixel on a module is transmitted with five symbols coded in six pulse height steps each. The data of 36 inputs build a final event data block. The data block from each detector module with either 16 or 24 ROCs differs in length and arrival time. Depending on the data length and trigger rate, {{there can be a}} skew of several events between any two inputs. That is possible because the ROC has a multievent time stamp memory and the readout bandwith is limited.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{summarize}} {{results of the}} performance of CMS TOB silicon detector modules mounted on the first assembled double-sided rod at CERN. Results are given in terms of noise, noise occupancies, signal to noise ratios and signal efficiencies. The noise figures from the rod optical setup are compared to the single module setup with electrical read out. Both test setups show a small or negligible common mode noise picked up by the modules. Similar noise results are obtained in both setups after full calibration gain values are applied. We measure total noise values of ~ 1600 electrons in peak mode and ~ 2600 electrons in deconvolution mode. Signal to noise ratios of the order of 15 (25) for deconvolution (peak) operation modes are found. The noise occupancies on the modules have important implications for the zero suppression algorithms which <b>the</b> CMS Tracker <b>FEDs</b> <b>will</b> use to reduce t he data volume flowing to the DAQ.

40|$|In the past, {{the federal}} {{government}} has introduced moral hazard in the banking system through deposit insurance. Banks underpriced risk because of the federal guarantee that backed deposits. After banking crises in the 1980 s and 1990 s, deposit insurance was put on a sound basis and that source of moral hazard was mitigated. In its place, monetary policy has become a source of moral hazard. In acting to counter the economic effects of declining asset prices, the Federal Reserve has come to be viewed as underwriting risky investments. Policy pronouncements by senior Fed officials have reinforced that perception. These actions and pronouncements are mutually reinforcing and destructive to the operation of financial markets.

40|$|To make {{financial}} conditions {{more supportive of}} economic growth, the Federal Reserve has purchased large amounts of longer-term securities in recent years. <b>The</b> <b>Fed’s</b> resulting securities portfolio has generated substantial income but may incur financial losses when market interest rates rise.

40|$|Inflation {{targeting}} {{has become}} an increasingly popular strategy for setting monetary policy during the last decade. While no countries had formal inflation targets before 1990, currently 22 countries use inflation targeting. One notable exception is the United States, where the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate to pursue both price stability and full employment. Some economists advocate inflation targeting for the United States, partly because they fear that otherwise <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> <b>will</b> try to push unemployment below its "natural rate" - its lowest sustainable level - and trigger accelerating inflation. However, the natural rate theory {{has proven to be}} a poor guide for policy making over the last 10 years. Unemployment in 2000 fell 2 percentage points below estimates of the natural rate without spurring inflation. Since inflation targeting derives its justification largely from the theory of the natural rate, it is questionable whether the United States should switch to an inflation-targeting regime. These doubts are reinforced by the manifest success of monetary policy under the dual mandate. ...|$|E
