5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium oxides {{are known}} for the metal {{oxidation}} states +2, +4 and +5. The most stable is white pentoxide Pa2O5, which can be produced by igniting protactinium(V) hydroxide in air at a temperature of 500°C. Its crystal structure is cubic, and the chemical composition is often non-stoichiometric, described as PaO2.25. Another phase of this oxide with orthorhombic symmetry has also been reported. The black dioxide PaO2 is obtained from the pentoxide by reducing it at 1550°C with hydrogen. It is not readily soluble in either dilute or concentrated nitric, hydrochloric or sulfuric acids, but easily dissolves in hydrofluoric acid. The dioxide can be converted back to pentoxide by heating in oxygen-containing atmosphere to 1100°C. The monoxide PaO has only been observed as a <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> on protactinium metal, but not in an isolated bulk form.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{returning}} from Somalia to Switzerland in late September 1992, Hepburn began suffering from abdominal pain. While initial medical tests in Switzerland had inconclusive results, a laparoscopy {{performed at the}} Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in early November revealed a rare form of abdominal cancer belonging {{to a group of}} cancers known as pseudomyxoma peritonei. Having grown slowly over several years, the cancer had metastasised as a <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> over her small intestine. After surgery, Hepburn began chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Oil spills at sea are {{generally}} much more damaging {{than those on}} land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin oil slick which can cover beaches with a <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> of oil. These can kill seabirds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms they coat. Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly bulldozed around the spill site before most of the oil escapes, and land animals can avoid the oil more easily.|$|E
25|$|After use Dutch ovens are {{typically}} cleaned like other cast-iron cookware: with {{boiling water and}} a brush, and no soap. After the oven has been dried, it {{should be given a}} <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> of cooking oil to prevent rusting. Whether that should be a vegetable fat or an animal fat (such as lard) is hotly contested. Saturated fats are more stable than polyunsaturated fats, which tend to go rancid more quickly. If the oven is used regularly, this poses no issue. Mustard oil provides the highest temperature resistance, which would be conducive to cooking.|$|E

25|$|The {{rectification}} {{action is}} due to a <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> of aluminum hydroxide on the aluminum electrode, formed by first applying a strong current to the cell to build up the coating. The rectification process is temperature-sensitive, and for best efficiency should not operate above 86°F (30°C). There is also a breakdown voltage where the coating is penetrated and the cell is short-circuited. Electrochemical methods are often more fragile than mechanical methods, and can be sensitive to usage variations, which can drastically change or completely disrupt the rectification processes.|$|E
25|$|Electrotyping {{is related}} to electroplating, which {{permanently}} adds a thin metallic overlayer to a metallic object instead of creating a freestanding metal part. Electrotyping and electroforming both produce metal parts, but differ in technical details. Electroforming involves {{the production of a}} metallic part around a metallic mandrel, although the term is sometimes used more broadly to encompass all electrodeposition processes. As noted above, electrotyping forms the part using a non-conducting mold or form whose surface has been made conducting by applying a <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> of graphite or metal powder.|$|E
25|$|In summary, Spirit found {{evidence}} of slight weathering on the plains of Gusev, but no evidence that a lake was there. However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates that only form {{in the presence of}} water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component that was identified as magnetite with some titanium.

25|$|Prior {{to final}} assembly, the {{manufacturers}} usually apply a <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> of clear or colored acrylic lacquer or silver plate over the brass. The lacquer or plating serves {{to protect the}} brass from oxidation and maintains its shiny appearance. Several different types and colors of surface finish have been used over the years. It is also possible to plate the instrument with nickel or gold, {{and a number of}} gold-plated saxophones have been produced. Plating saxophones with gold is an expensive process because gold does not adhere directly to brass. As a result, the brass is first plated with silver, then gold. Some saxophonists, sellers, and repair technicians argue that the type of lacquer or plating or absence thereof may enhance an instrument's tone quality. The possible effects of different finishes on tone are difficult to isolate from the other variables that affect an instrument's tone colors. In any case, what constitutes a pleasing tone is a matter of personal preference.|$|E
500|$|The gills are {{typically}} narrow and crowded together, with a broadly adnate to nearly decurrent {{attachment to the}} stem and convex edges. They are a pallid brown when young, becoming tawny at maturity. Some short gills, called lamellulae, do not extend entirely from the cap edge to the stem, and are intercalated among the longer gills. The stem ranges from [...] long, [...] thick at the apex, and stays equal in width throughout or is slightly enlarged downward. Initially solid, it becomes hollow {{from the bottom up}} as it matures. The membranous ring is located on the upper half of the stem near the cap, but may be sloughed off and missing in older specimens. Its color is initially whitish or light brown, but usually appears a darker rusty-brown in mature specimens that have dropped spores on it. Above the level of the ring, the stem surface has a very fine whitish powder and is paler than the cap; below the ring it is brown down to the reddish-brown to bistre base. The lower portion of the stem has a <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> of pallid [...] which eventually disappear and do not leave any scales. The spore print is rusty-brown.|$|E
500|$|Northeast Plaza Structure 2 has a {{rectangular}} base.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{fabricating}} soft tissue implants using a mold. The cavity surface of an initially untextured mold. made of an organic material such as epoxy. {{is given a}} <b>thin</b> film <b>coating</b> of material that has pinholes and is resistant to atomic particle bombardment. The mold cavity surface is then subjected to atomic particle bombardment, such as when placed in an isotropic atomic oxygen environment. Microscopic depressions in the mold cavity surface are created at the pinhole sites on the <b>thin</b> film <b>coating.</b> The <b>thin</b> film <b>coating</b> is removed and the mold is then used to cast the soft tissue implant. The <b>thin</b> film <b>coating</b> having pinholes may be created by chilling the mold below the dew point such that water vapor condenses upon it; distributing particles, that can partially dissolve and become attached to the mold cavity surface, onto the mold cavity surface; removing the layer of condensate, such as by evaporation; applying the <b>thin</b> film <b>coating</b> over the entire mold surface; and, finally removing the particles, such as by dissolving or brushing it off. Pinholes are created in the <b>thin</b> film <b>coating</b> at the sites previously occupied by the particles...|$|R

2500|$|Soft lead bullets are {{generally}} used in handguns with velocities of 1000ft/s (300m/s) or lower, while harder cast bullets may be used, with careful powder selection, in rifles with velocities of 2000ft/s (600m/s) or slightly more. [...] The limit {{is the point}} at which the powder gas temperature and pressure starts to melt the base of the bullet, and leave a <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> of molten and re-solidified lead in the bore of the guna process called leading the bore. Cast lead bullets may also be fired in full power magnum handgun rounds like the 44 Magnum with the addition of a gas check, which is a thin aluminum, zinc or copper washer or cup that is crimped over a tiny heel on the base of appropriate cast bullets. This provides protection for the base of the bullet, and allows velocities of over 1500ft/s (450m/s) in handguns, with little or no leading of the bore.|$|E
2500|$|Damage-prediction {{software}} {{was used to}} evaluate possible tile and RCC damage. The tool for predicting tile damage was known as [...] "Crater", described by several NASA representatives in press briefings as not actually a software program but rather a statistical spreadsheet of observed past flight events and effects. The [...] "Crater" [...] tool predicted severe penetration of multiple tiles by the impact if it struck the TPS tile area, but NASA engineers downplayed this. It had been shown that the model overstated damage from small projectiles, and engineers believed that the model would also overstate damage from larger Spray-On Foam Insulation (SOFI) impacts. The program used to predict RCC damage was based on small ice impacts the size of cigarette butts, not larger SOFI impacts, as the ice impacts were the only recognized threats to RCC panels up to that point. Under one of 15 predicted SOFI impact paths, the software predicted an ice impact would completely penetrate the RCC panel. Engineers downplayed this, too, believing that impacts of the less dense SOFI material would result in less damage than ice impacts. In an e-mail exchange, NASA managers questioned whether the density of the SOFI could be used as justification for reducing predicted damage. Despite engineering concerns about the energy imparted by the SOFI material, NASA managers ultimately accepted the rationale to reduce predicted damage of the RCC panels from possible complete penetration to slight damage to the panel's <b>thin</b> <b>coating.</b>|$|E
