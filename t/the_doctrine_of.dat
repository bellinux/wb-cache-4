5|$|Commentators noted, however, {{that the}} Court's ruling was narrow in scope, {{and did not}} set a broad legal {{precedent}} {{with respect to the}} applicability of <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> patent exhaustion to self-replicating technologies.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Church, {{there is}} a {{complete}} review and assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former churches. Before the New Church can be received, <b>the</b> <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older churches must be exposed in the open and rejected. This is because {{the faith of the}} New Church is so opposite to <b>the</b> <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older Christian churches that they cannot coexist. An assessment of other beliefs also helps to clarify the position of the New Church, and explains why a revelation was needed to correct the theological direction of the Christian churches.|$|R

5000|$|Non-Chalcedonianism is a {{religious}} <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> those Christian churches that do not accept the Confession of Chalcedon as defined at the ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451. <b>The</b> <b>doctrine</b> contrasts with Chalcedonian Christianity, which accepts <b>the</b> <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first seven Ecumenical Councils.
