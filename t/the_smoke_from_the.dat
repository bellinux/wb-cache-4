5|$|Who started {{shooting}} first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. <b>The</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> black powder {{used in the}} weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space. Those loyal to {{one side or the}} other told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The DNC {{objected to}} the loss of the {{mainmast}} as he believed that it was needed to support a boat-handling derrick, but was overruled by the Admiralty, which preferred to position the tripod foremast behind the forward funnel with the tripod legs facing forward to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable. The short height of the funnel also bedevilled the bridge with smoke until it was raised in 1912, although this exacerbated the problem for the spotting top. The decision to space the wing turrets more closely together also made the smoke problem worse; because it reduced the space available to the aft boiler room which meant that the forward funnel had to accommodate the exhausts of a dozen boilers compared to the aft funnel's six, further increasing <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> forward funnel.|$|E

25|$|In Aztec mythology, the Fourth Sun {{disappeared}} {{in a great}} flood. A {{man and a woman}} survived inside a log and were washed up upon a beach, where they promptly built a fire and roasted some fish. <b>The</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fire upset the stars Citlallatonac and Citlalicue, angering the great god Tezcatlipoca. In his fury, he severed their heads and stitched them onto their rears, creating the first dogs.|$|E
25|$|A {{second account}} {{states that the}} French cavalry {{attacked}} first. Eugène sent Pully and Sahuc charging at the Austrian guns in a pincer attack. Under cover of <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two artilleries blasting away at each other, the French divisions struck Reisner's gun line from both flanks. While some horsemen began cutting down the gunners, the others galloped among the Austrian cavalry which was formed up behind the guns.|$|E
25|$|The A-10 engines were {{initially}} susceptible to flameout when subjected to gases {{generated in the}} firing of the gun. When the GAU-8 is being fired, <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gun can make the engines stop, and this did occur during initial flight testing. Gun exhaust is essentially oxygen-free, and is certainly capable of causing flameouts of gas turbines. The A-10 engines now have a self-sustaining combustion section. When the gun is fired the igniters come on to reduce {{the possibility of a}} flameout.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, {{a letter}} {{published}} in the Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch by William F.

25|$|After the English Malt Tax of 1725, most of Scotland's {{distillation}} {{was either}} shut down or forced underground. Scotch whisky was hidden under altars, in coffins, {{and in any}} available space to avoid the governmental excisemen or revenuers. Scottish distillers, operating out of homemade stills, took to distilling whisky at night when the darkness hid <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stills. For this reason, the drink became known as moonshine. At one point, {{it was estimated that}} over half of Scotland's whisky output was illegal.|$|E
25|$|After <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{explosion}} {{cleared away}} {{it was discovered}} that the tough old bridge was still intact. One side of the arch was gone, but the span was still standing. By this time, the French artillery had succeeded in dismounting one of Mayne's cannons and silencing the rest. Victor ordered one of Lapisse's brigades to rush the bridge. When the French soldiers managed to brave the defensive fire and gain a foothold on the north bank, Mayne ordered a retreat to the Salvaterra Pass.|$|E
25|$|The smelter in Trail, British Columbia is {{operated}} by the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company (COMINCO) and has processed lead and zinc since 1896. Smoke from the smelter caused damage to forests and crops in the surrounding area and also across the Canada–US border in Washington. <b>The</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> smelter distressed residents, resulting in complaints to COMINCO and demands for compensation. The dispute between the smelter operators and affected landowners could not be resolved, resulting in the case being sent to an arbitration tribunal. Negotiation and resulting litigation and arbitration was settled in 1941.|$|E

25|$|Waiting and watching, {{the team}} hoped {{to catch the}} killer, who they assumed would enter the suite to suffocate Kamen. When nobody but Barbara’s brother arrived, they decided to call off the stake-out. As they went to awaken Kamen, however, they were horrified to find her dead. An autopsy of both the {{miniature}} Barbara as well as Officer Kamen later revealed {{that the cause of}} death was carbon monoxide poisoning. Examining the suite and the miniature, Grissom and his team found a mechanism in Barbara’s chimney, timed in advance to drop a can of powdered charcoal onto the fire and seal off the chimney flue. <b>The</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lit fire and charcoal would then produce enough carbon monoxide to poison and suffocate anyone in the room. The murder proved that Ernie Dell was not in fact the real Miniature Killer, but had taken the blame (and the bullet) for someone else.|$|E
25|$|Ranger had {{a narrow}} hull {{due to its}} size and one inch of armor on the hangar deck. Due to space limits, the carrier was {{equipped}} with geared turbines. The design was modified to include an island, increasing the ship's displacement to 14,500 tons. <b>The</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ship's six boilers was vented up six small stacks, with three {{on each side of}} the aft hangar. The stacks were hinged and were rotated to a position parallel with the hangar deck during flight operations. Ranger also incorporated a gallery deck between the flight deck and hangar deck. The hangar deck was semi-open and had large roll-up metal curtain doors which could be closed in bad weather. The carrier had three elevators. One was located on the centerline and two offset to the starboard centerline. It was originally planned to install two catapults on the hangar deck to allow the launching of observation aircraft but this plan was dropped. The carrier was able to carry 76 aircraft at the time.|$|E

[...] The wind changed direction and the fire blew back on Penda's men, who had to abandon the attack.

500|$|At 09:00, Bristols lookouts spotted <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Austro-Hungarian cruisers to {{the south}} of her position. The Allied ships turned to engage the Austro-Hungarian ships; the British ships had both a superiority in numbers and in firepower; Dartmouth was armed with eight [...] guns and Bristol had two 6inch and ten , {{compared}} to the nine [...] guns on each of the Austro-Hungarian ships. Unfortunately for the Allies, their numerical superiority was quickly lost, as their destroyers were either occupied with mechanical problems, or protecting those destroyers suffering from breakdowns. The support forces of both sides—the Sankt Georg group for the Austro-Hungarians, and the Marsala group for the Allies—were quickly dispatched to the battle.|$|E
500|$|The Milwaukee Sentinel {{called the}} LP [...] "probably the most {{valuable}} contribution to rock since the Beatles Revolver", praising it for being completely dissimilar from anything the Beatles had done. The magazine Cheetah gave the album a rave review, observing that [...] "the mood is rather childlike (not childish)—the kind of innocence that shows on the album cover, with its Rousseau-like animals and forest, and <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cabin chimney spelling out the title.... The expression that emerges from this music is very strange: it's a very personal mood." [...] Journalist Richard Goldstein remembers his review for The New York Times: [...] "I was struck by its fragile melodies {{and their relationship to}} sacred music; those familiar ride-the-curl voices, now 'hushed with wonder,' reminded me of the Fauré Requiem, but they were utterly American." ...|$|E

500|$|The British {{first took}} notice when they spotted <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> burning hay. Vice-Admiral Graves on his flagship, HMS Preston saw {{smoke from the}} burning hay at about 2 pm, and {{signaled}} for the guard marines to land on Noddle's island, which they did, engaging Stark's scattered forces. Graves also ordered the schooner Diana, {{under the command of}} his nephew Lieutenant Thomas Graves, to sail up Chelsea Creek to support the operation and cut off the colonists' escape. Eventually, a combined force of roughly 400 marines was landed, formed ranks and began to systematically drive Stark's men back to the east. The colonists fled without fighting until they reached Crooked Creek. There they dropped into marshy ditches and fired on their pursuers from strong defensive positions. A pitched battle followed, in which the colonists [...] "Squated down in a Ditch on the mash" [...] and engaged in [...] "a hot fiar until the Regulars retreated".|$|E
