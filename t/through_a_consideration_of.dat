40|$|In {{the wake}} of the Great Recession, there is greater public {{expectation}} to see corporations express proper contrition for their errors. While corporate leaders and myriad stakeholders acknowledge that corporations ought to be more responsive to public expectations of ethical corporate behavior, the modern corporate social responsibility (CSR) movement is simply unequipped to incentivize this behavior. This unresponsiveness {{can be seen in the}} area of dispute resolution between corporations and individuals. While the argument may seem counter-intuitive on first impression, the use of corporate apologies is both good business and good ethics. While there is minimal overlap in the dispute resolution and New Governance literatures, both fields rely on reciprocal assumptions about how to encourage collaborative ends. Namely, both envision a flexible, problem-solving dynamic, in dispute resolution, <b>through</b> <b>a</b> careful <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> skills, and in New Governance, <b>through</b> <b>a</b> careful <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> institutional design.

50|$|Asymptotic {{analysis}} {{is a key}} tool for exploring the ordinary and partial differential equations which arise in the mathematical modelling of real-world phenomena. An illustrative example is the derivation of the boundary layer equations from the full Navier-Stokes equations governing fluid flow. In many cases, the asymptotic expansion is in power of a small parameter, : in the boundary layer case, this is the nondimensional ratio of the boundary layer thickness to a typical lengthscale of the problem. Indeed, applications of asymptotic analysis in mathematical modelling often centre around a nondimensional parameter which has been shown, or assumed, to be small <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> the scales of the problem at hand.|$|E

Fillmore's political career encompassed the tortuous course toward the two-party system that we know today. The Whigs were not cohesive enough to survive the slavery imbroglio, while parties like the Anti-Masonics and Know-Nothings were too extremist. When, as President, Fillmore sided with proslavery elements in ordering enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law, he all but guaranteed that he would be the last Whig President. The first modern two-party system of Whigs and Democrats had succeeded only in dividing the nation in two by the 1850s, and seven years later, the election of the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, would guarantee civil war.|$|E

They are also notable for their informal spaces, a particular feature being {{the inclusion of}} generous verandah piazzas. The plans respond to the social needs of the clients in an honest and functional way. The houses were often provided with generous, considered service spaces including back halls and wash houses. The health and comfort of the occupants were major considerations. Ventilation devices included wide window and door openings, ventilated gables and ridges, and ventilation fleches. Piazzas were generous, allowing comfortably furnished, semi-outdoor living. Operable shading and enclosure of the piazza was sometimes achieved by adding timber vertical louvres above the verandah handrail, creating a room habitable in most weather. Interiors included fine decorative timber joinery and panelling. Fireplace surrounds and built-in cupboards were also a feature.|$|E

This paper addresses the purpose of citizenship education and its role in creating political subjectivities for citizens. We argue that policies and programmes often attempt to heal social divisions by fostering a common linkage between citizens and nation, but in ways that may be ineffective, and in some cases, deeply problematic. This argument is developed <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> {{the ways in}} which different agents involved in citizenship education use their own experiences to develop and interpret citizenship education programmes.
