25|$|The {{modes of}} action by which {{antimicrobial}} peptides kill microbes are varied, and may differ for different bacterial species. Some antimicrobial peptides kill both bacteria and fungi, e.g., psoriasin kills E. coli and several filamentous fungi. The cytoplasmic membrane {{is a frequent}} target, but peptides may also interfere with DNA and protein synthesis, protein folding, and cell wall synthesis. The initial contact between the peptide and the <b>target</b> <b>organism</b> is electrostatic, as most bacterial surfaces are anionic, or hydrophobic, {{such as in the}} antimicrobial peptide Piscidin. Their amino acid composition, amphipathicity, cationic charge and size allow them to attach to and insert into membrane bilayers to form pores by ‘barrel-stave’, ‘carpet’ or ‘toroidal-pore’ mechanisms. Alternately, they may penetrate into the cell to bind intracellular molecules which are crucial to cell living. Intracellular binding models includes inhibition of cell wall synthesis, alteration of the cytoplasmic membrane, activation of autolysin, inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibition of certain enzymes. However, in many cases, the exact mechanism of killing is not known. One emerging technique for the study of such mechanisms is dual polarisation interferometry. In contrast to many conventional antibiotics these peptides appear to be bactericidal instead of bacteriostatic. In general the antimicrobial activity of these peptides is determined by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits bacterial growth.|$|E

Biopesticides include microbial pesticides and biochemical pesticides. Plant-derived pesticides, or [...] "botanicals", have been developing quickly. These include the pyrethroids, rotenoids, nicotinoids, and a fourth group that includes strychnine and scilliroside.|$|E
2500|$|Plasma level {{monitoring}} of vancomycin is necessary {{due to the}} drug's biexponential distribution, intermediate hydrophilicity, and potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially in populations with poor renal function and/or increased propensity to bacterial infection. Vancomycin activity {{is considered to be}} time-dependent; that is, antimicrobial activity depends on the duration that the serum drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [...] of the <b>target</b> <b>organism.</b> Thus, peak serum levels have not been shown to correlate with efficacy or toxicity; indeed, concentration monitoring is unnecessary in most cases. Circumstances in which therapeutic drug monitoring [...] is warranted include: patients receiving concomitant aminoglycoside therapy, patients with (potentially) altered pharmacokinetic parameters, patients on haemodialysis, patients administered high-dose or prolonged treatment, and patients with impaired renal function. In such cases, trough concentrations are measured.|$|E

30|$|As the {{information}} elements slightly differ in structure and detail between EU Directive 2001 / 18 /EC and the EFSA guidance document [3], we combined them into ten assessment categories: molecular characterisation, expression, agronomics, composition, dissemination and related processes, <b>target</b> <b>organisms,</b> non-target organisms, biogeochemical cycles, change in {{land use and}} cultivation technique, and risk management including monitoring [14]. Among the ten categories studied, three selected ones are presented in this article: (1) assessment of the agronomic characteristics of the GMP, (2) assessment of effects on and mediated by <b>target</b> <b>organisms</b> [TOs] and (3) assessment of interactions of the GMP with NTOs.|$|R
30|$|In the ERA of PPP and of GMOs, it {{is a clear}} policy goal {{to avoid}} the {{development}} of resistance in <b>target</b> <b>organisms.</b> Experience from the ERA of GMOs with insect resistance shows that even low risks for <b>target</b> <b>organisms</b> to develop resistance are not accepted and risk mitigation measures are readily proposed, such as Insect-Resistance Management plans for insect-resistant maize [77]. Although the spatial and temporal scope of the resistance development is generally not specified for insect-resistant GMOs, it can be assumed that management measures aim to avoid resistance within the EU territory, and that this requirement is, in principal, temporally not limited.|$|R

5000|$|The lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) is {{the lowest}} {{concentration}} or amount of a substance found by experiment or observation that causes an adverse alteration of morphology, function, capacity, growth, development, or lifespan of a <b>target</b> <b>organism</b> distinguished from normal organisms {{of the same species}} under defined conditions of exposure.

50|$|Each cnidocyte {{contains}} an organelle called a cnida or cnidocyst (e.g. nematocyst, ptychocyst or spirocyst), which comprises a bulb-shaped capsule containing a coiled hollow tubule structure attached to it. The immature cnidocyte {{is referred to}} as a cnidoblast. The externally oriented side of the cell also has a hair-like trigger called a cnidocil. Cnidocil is a mechano- and chemo-receptor. When the trigger is activated, the tubule shaft of the cnidocyst is ejected and, {{in the case of the}} penetrant nematocyst, the forcefully ejected tubule penetrates the <b>target</b> <b>organism.</b> This discharge takes no more than a few microseconds, and is able to reach accelerations of about 40,000 g. Recent research suggests the process occurs in as little as 700 nanoseconds, thus reaching an acceleration of up to 5,410,000 g. After penetration, the toxic content of the nematocyst is injected into the <b>target</b> <b>organism,</b> allowing the sessile cnidarian to devour it.|$|E
30|$|The use of Bt maize {{may result}} in {{resistance}} development in the target pest or the occurrence of secondary pests. Both may lead {{to changes in the}} cultivation, management and harvesting techniques of crop plants [6]. Changes of pest control practices may indirectly affect the environment. Resistance development in <b>target</b> <b>organisms</b> has been identified as a risk in the ERA of Bt maize and led to the adoption of Insect Resistance Management (IRM) plans as a risk mitigation measure to delay the resistance evolution in lepidopteran <b>target</b> <b>organisms</b> when cultivating Bt maize [118, 119]. Avoidance of resistance development is, therefore, not only an important goal of European environmental policies, but also an implicit protection goal in the ERA of GMOs.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the trade}} of marine ornamentals has been {{expanding}} and {{it is estimated that}} 1. 5 – 2. 0 million people worldwide keep marine aquaria and the value of annual marine ornamental trade is estimated to range between US$ 200 – 330 million. Almost the entire trade is contributed by collections from coral reef habitats which raises doubts regarding its sustainability. The damaging techniques such as use of sodium cyanide are non selective methods used to capture fish and they adversely affect the health of the fish and kill the non <b>target</b> <b>organisms.</b> The over harvesting of <b>target</b> <b>organisms</b> is another aspect of concern.

5000|$|For example, {{in order}} to obtain small {{invertebrates}} measuring 50 to 1500 μm, a net mesh size between 25 and 50 μm diameter should be selected, which is sufficient to effectively filter only the <b>target</b> <b>organism.</b> [...] However, in a eutrophic water condition, a plankton net with a mesh larger than 100 μm should be chosen to avoid clogging the net.|$|E
50|$|Few (if any) {{studies on}} {{phytoplankton}} toxins {{have attempted to}} rigorously meet all of these criteria.All methods of detecting phycotoxins involve extraction of the candidate toxin from a phytoplankton culture; therefore, it's important {{to determine whether the}} toxin is secreted into the media or stored in the phytoplankton cell. It's also important to know whether the <b>target</b> <b>organism</b> must be present to induce toxin synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Malathion is an {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibitor, {{a diverse}} family of chemicals that includes sarin and carbaryl. Upon uptake into the <b>target</b> <b>organism,</b> it binds irreversibly to several, random serine residues on the cholinesterase enzyme, with a peroxide as the leaving group. The resultant phosphoester group is strongly {{bound to the}} cholinesterase, and irreversibly deactivates the enzyme which leads to rapid build-up of acetylcholine at the synapse.|$|E
40|$|ObjectivePolymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) play {{a central}} role in the {{elimination}} of most extracellular pathogens, and an impairment of their functions predisposes an individual towards local and systemic bacterial and fungal infections. Here we describe a rapid and easy-to-perform cytofluorometric assay for investigation of PMN activity using Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus as <b>target</b> <b>organisms.</b> MethodsPhagocytes were stained with anti-CD 13 -RPE antibody and microorganisms were stained with calcein-AM. Oxidative burst production was measured by oxidation of dihydroethidmm. The percentage of killed <b>target</b> <b>organisms</b> after ingestion was determined by staining with ethidium-homodimer- 1 after lysis of human cells. The dyes and procedures used in this method were chosen after comparison of different stains and cell preparation techniques described in previous assays. ResultsConcerning phagocytosis, the percentages of active phagocytes and of ingested microorganisms were determined. Furthermore, the method allowed measurement of the resulting percentage of PMNs producing respiratory burst, and of the percentage of killed microorganisms. We minimized artifactual changes, which might have been the reason for the difficulties and conflicting results of other cytofluorometric methods. ConclusionsThe described method provides a new whole blood cytofluorometric assay, which combines rapid and simple handling with high reproducibility of results obtained by investigation of PMN activity using Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus as <b>target</b> <b>organisms...</b>|$|R

50|$|Before {{the gene}} is {{inserted}} into the <b>target</b> <b>organism</b> it must be combined with other genetic elements. These include a promoter and terminator region, which initiate and end transcription. A selectable marker gene is added, which in most cases confers antibiotic resistance, so researchers can easily determine which cells have been successfully transformed. The gene can also be modified at this stage for better expression or effectiveness. These manipulations are carried out using recombinant DNA techniques, such as restriction digests, ligations and molecular cloning.|$|E

40|$|Fruiting body lectins are {{ubiquitous}} in higher fungi and characterized by being synthesized in the cytoplasm and up-regulated during sexual development. The function of these lectins is unclear. A lack of phenotype in sexual development upon inactivation {{of the respective}} genes argues against a function in this process. We tested a series of characterized fruiting body lectins from different fungi for toxicity towards the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the mosquito Aedes aegypti and the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii. Most of the fungal lectins {{were found to be}} toxic towards {{at least one of the}} three <b>target</b> <b>organisms.</b> By altering either the fungal lectin or the glycans of the <b>target</b> <b>organisms,</b> or by including soluble carbohydrate ligands as competitors, we demonstrate that the observed toxicity is dependent on the interaction between the fungal lectins and specific glycans in the <b>target</b> <b>organisms.</b> The toxicity was found to be dose-dependent such that low levels of lectin were no longer toxic but still led to food avoidance by C.  elegans. Finally, we show, in an ecologically more relevant scenario, that challenging the vegetative mycelium of Coprinopsis cinerea with the fungal-feeding nematode Aphelenchus avenae induces the expression of the nematotoxic fruiting body lectins CGL 1 and CGL 2. Based on these findings, we propose that filamentous fungi possess an inducible resistance against predators and parasites mediated by lectins that are specific for glycans of these antagonists...|$|R

40|$|Biodiverse environments {{provide a}} variety of {{resources}} that can be exploited by consumers. While many studies revealed {{a positive correlation between}} biodiversity and consumer biomass and richness, only few studies have investigated how resource diversity affects single consumers. To better understand whether a single consumer species benefits from diverse resources, we tested how the protective function of a defensive plant resource (i. e. resin exploited by social bees) varied among different sources and <b>target</b> <b>organisms</b> (predators, parasites and pathogens). To assess synergistic effects, resins from different plant genera were tested separately and in combination. We found that resin diversity is beneficial for bees, with its functional properties depending on the <b>target</b> <b>organisms,</b> type and composition of resin. Different resins showed different effects, and mixtures were more effective than some of the single resins (functional complementarity). We conclude that resins of different plant species <b>target</b> different <b>organisms</b> and act synergistically where combined. Bees that rely on resin for protection benefit more when they have access to diverse resin sources. Loss of biodiversity may in turn destabilize consumer populations due to restricted access to {{a variety of}} resources. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
