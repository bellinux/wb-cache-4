5|$|After {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Salmon River area of Idaho, a group of immigrants persuaded an Illinois-born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through <b>the</b> <b>cutoff.</b> A large wagon train left in July 1862 and met up with more wagons at Craters of the Moon Lava Field. Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, the unusually large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named <b>the</b> <b>cutoff</b> for their guide. Improvements to <b>the</b> <b>cutoff</b> such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River made it into a popular alternative route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E

5|$|Pioneers {{traveling}} in wagon trains on the Oregon Trail in the 1850s and 1860s followed an alternative route {{in the area}} that used old Indian trails that skirted the lava flows.

Retailers also received catalog deals that discounted U2's albums in stores by US$3 {{for a period of}} time. A Grammy Awards spokesperson initially said the album would not be eligible for consideration at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards because {{it would not have been}} available for purchase prior to the 30 September eligibility deadline.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{complete}} {{construction of a}} Quantum Field Theory for the Massive Thirring model by following a functional integral approach. This is done by introducing an ultraviolet and an infrared cutoff and by proving that, if the "bare" parameters are suitably chosen, the Schwinger functions have a well defined limit satisfying the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, when <b>the</b> <b>cutoffs</b> are removed. Our results, which are restricted to weak coupling, are uniform {{in the value of}} the mass. The control of the effective coupling (which is the main ingredient of the proof) is achieved by using the Ward Identities of the massless model, in the approximated form they take in the presence of <b>the</b> <b>cutoffs.</b> As a byproduct, we show that, when <b>the</b> <b>cutoffs</b> are removed, <b>the</b> Ward Identities have anomalies which are not linear in the bare coupling. Moreover, we find for the interacting propagator of the massless theory a closed equation which is different from that usually stated in the physical literature...|$|R
5|$|John Calhoun Johnson of Placerville {{surveyed}} {{and cleared}} a shorter, lower (and thus less snow-covered) trail east from that town in 1852, completing the {{work by the}} summer. Rather than following the ridge to the Sierra's crest as the Mormons had, Johnson headed eastward to the South Fork American River, crossing to its north side near the present Pacific Ranger Station in order to follow Peavine Ridge around a rocky stretch of the river. Returning to the river between Kyburz and Strawberry, he then continued alongside it to the crest at Johnson Pass, where a steep slope descended to Lake Tahoe. Within Nevada, his route generally followed the lake to Glenbrook, where it turned inland and crossed the Carson Range over Spooner Summit into the Carson Valley near Carson City. This trail, known as Johnson's Cut-off, generally followed the present US 50, with notable deviations only just east of Placerville (via Carson Road), over Peavine Ridge (roughly following Peavine Ridge Road, some trails, and Wrights Lake Road), just east of Strawberry (via Slippery Ford Road), over {{the crest of the}} Sierra (via Johnson Pass Road and Meyers Road), south of Lake Tahoe (via Pioneer Trail), east of Lake Tahoe (via Genoa Peak Road), and from Spooner Summit into the Carson Valley (via Kings Canyon Road). By 1854, Bartlett's Bridge had been built at the trail's westernmost crossing of the American River, allowing wagons to follow the cutoff; it was soon washed away by a freshet on March 7, 1855, and replaced by Brockliss Bridge, several miles to the east. Due to an improvement of the road through Carson Canyon on the old Carson Route, most travelers ended up turning southeast from Johnson Pass over Luther Pass (present SR 89) to join the older route northeast of Carson Pass rather than following <b>the</b> <b>cutoff</b> along Lake Tahoe.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason is}} that there is a cutoff used to define H, and <b>the</b> <b>cutoff</b> defines the {{shortest}} wavelength. Fluctuations of H at wavelengths near <b>the</b> <b>cutoff</b> can affect the longer-wavelength fluctuations. If the system is scaled along with <b>the</b> <b>cutoff,</b> the parameters will scale by dimensional analysis, but then comparing parameters doesn't compare behavior because the rescaled system has more modes. If the system is rescaled in such a way that the short wavelength cutoff remains fixed, the long-wavelength fluctuations are modified.|$|E

40|$|The neutron {{fraction}} in {{the very}} high energy cosmic rays near <b>the</b> Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) <b>cutoff</b> energy is analyzed by {{taking into account the}} time dilation effect of the neutron decays and also the pion photoproduction behaviors above <b>the</b> GZK <b>cutoff.</b> We predict a non-trivial neutron fraction above <b>the</b> GZK <b>cutoff</b> and a negligibly small neutron fraction below. However, there should be a large antiproton fraction in the high energy cosmic rays below <b>the</b> GZK <b>cutoff</b> in several existing models for the observed cosmic-ray events above and near <b>the</b> GZK <b>cutoff.</b> Such a large antiproton fraction can manifest itself by the muon charge ratio μ^+/μ^- in the collisions of the primary nucleon cosmic rays with the atmosphere, if there is no neutron contribution.

50|$|In the end, it {{may have}} been SP's {{competition}} with the Texas & Pacific Railroad between Texarkana and El Paso that finally doomed <b>the</b> Mexia-Nelleva <b>Cutoff.</b> <b>The</b> T&P could carry transcontinental traffic directly across Texas and interchange it with the SP in El Paso. This service competed favorably with SP's much longer route across Texas that required a connection with the Sunset Route at Houston. To improve the situation, SP opened <b>the</b> Dalsa <b>Cutoff</b> in 1914 between Hearne and Flatonia, shortening the route across Texas by 140 miles (226 km). Through freights that might previously have been routed via <b>the</b> Mexia-Nelleva <b>Cutoff</b> and <b>the</b> Sunset Route connecting at Houston could now bypass Houston, Texas altogether. With stiff competition from the T&BV for the Gulf coast traffic, a diversion of transcontinental freight traffic to <b>the</b> Dalsa <b>Cutoff,</b> and virtually no local traffic, <b>the</b> Mexia-Nelleva <b>Cutoff</b> was doomed; it was finally abandoned in 1933.|$|R
