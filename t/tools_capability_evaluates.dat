40|$|The {{research}} <b>evaluates</b> the <b>capability</b> {{of software}} based tools that extract data stored on an Apple iPhone. A literature review is performed covering material on: mobile devices, iPhone, hard disks, networking connectivity, usage environments, data integrity, evidence volatility, data extraction methods and operating systems. Literature shows that iPhone data extraction is complex due to {{hardware and software}} limitations. Understanding the <b>capability</b> of the <b>tool</b> used to retrieve data is important in ensuring a sound investigation. Based on literature a research methodology is defined. A descriptive approach is selected. The research process is split into three phases: test iPhone <b>capability,</b> <b>evaluate</b> extraction <b>tools</b> and compare extraction tools. At each phase data is collected, processed and analysed. At the first stage a “catalog” of known data stored on the iPhone is collected. At the second phase an audit “journal” of procedure and “extraction log” of extracted data is collected. At the last phase a sample set of weighted scenarios are used to analyse <b>tool</b> <b>capability.</b> Research findings indicate 12, 963 files were extracted from an iPhone and classified in the catalog. Operating system limitations restrict user access to the iPhone file system. A method of opening access, known as jailbreaking, {{can be used to}} bypass such restrictions. Of the files in the catalog the highest result obtained by an extraction tool is 797 from Oxygen Forensics Suite 2010 and the lowest result is 178 from Device Seizure. Scenario analysis indicates Oxygen Forensics Suite 2010 works better in case scenarios whereas non-forensic tools have more limitations. Discussion of findings indicates that SQLite and Property List files are common sources of data storage on the iPhone. Analysis into the iPhone operating system shows that Apple has put multiple controls to limit access to the stored data. There is potential for further research in expanding research into extraction <b>tool</b> <b>capability...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of financially and environmentally conscious manufacturing {{has resulted in}} a need for efficient process planning in today's manufacturing system. Process planning based on nominal machine tool specifications, limits predictive capabilities with regard to the final part quality. More efficient process plans can be achieved once an accurate machine <b>tool</b> <b>capability</b> profile has been defined. Machine <b>tool</b> <b>capability</b> profiles deliver up-To-date resource attributes such as availability, health and applicability into the process-planning stage. A manufacturing resource's health degrades continuously throughout its life cycle due to environmental factors, part wear, operator competence, etc. Identifying and compensating for these factors during process planning may alleviate material wastage and machining estimate production time and cost via decision-making mechanisms. In this paper, the STEP-NC Standard is used to represent a model of machining resources, including worktable, spindle and tool status during a machine tool's operational lifespan. A prototype of machine <b>tool</b> <b>capability</b> profile enabled process planning system is then presented and tested to highlight the advantages of this approach...|$|R
