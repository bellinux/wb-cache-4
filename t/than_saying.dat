5|$|During the {{election}} campaign, the Liberal leader was then-Prime Minister Paul Martin. After {{the election}} results were announced, Martin announced his intention to resign, but did not indicate when, other <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> he would not lead the party into the next election. On February 1, 2006, the Liberal Party Caucus chose Bill Graham as parliamentary leader, meaning he served as Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons until the election of Stéphane Dion as Liberal leader at the Liberal Party leadership convention, held December 2–3, 2006.|$|E
5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
25|$|Any Jew can {{recite the}} blessing {{provided}} {{he or she}} is old enough to understand the significance of the mitzvah. After the blessing, the mezuzah is attached. Many people also touch a finger to the mezuzah as a way of showing respect to God in a simpler fashion <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> the prayer whenever they pass through the door.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not just}} that he had superb comic timing: one could see {{absolutely}} why the family trusted their fates to him. No other British actor had come so close to that dependable, reliable quality of the great Hollywood stars – you would trust him through thick and thin. And he was more humorous <b>than,</b> <b>say,</b> Gary Cooper, more down-to-earth <b>than,</b> <b>say,</b> Cary Grant.|$|R
25|$|Coprolalia {{encompasses}} {{words and}} phrases that are culturally taboo or generally unsuitable for acceptable social use, when used out of context. The term is not used to describe contextual swearing. It is usually expressed out of social or emotional context, and may be spoken in a louder tone or different cadence or pitch than normal conversation. It can be a single word, or complex phrases. A person with coprolalia may repeat the word mentally rather <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> it out loud; these subvocalizations can be very distressing.|$|E
500|$|Inside Venom's {{tour bus}} (the first time Slayer {{had been in}} one) the band members got drunk with Venom, while {{listening}} to Hell Awaits. Araya entered the bus [...] "hammered out of his mind," [...] according to Lombardo, saying [...] "I gotta take a piss! Where's the bathroom in this thing?" [...] Venom singer Conrad [...] "Cronos" [...] Lant responded, saying [...] "Right here—right here in my mouth!" [...] Araya took it almost literally and urinated on his hair. Cronos got up and punched him in the face, the two blamed each other all night, and Araya continued the tour with a black eye. Araya will not discuss the incident other <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> that he was drunk {{and it was a}} very disrespectful thing to do.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} was {{described}} by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", where Carey remembers both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. [...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish I could talk to you for a while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E

500|$|Nathaniel Shaler {{left his}} humanist studies and joined Agassiz's lab at Harvard University, having already read Agassiz's {{introductory}} essay on classification. His autobiography details his initial interactions with Agassiz. With regard {{to his first}} assignment, Shaler recorded that Agassiz brought him a small fish to study with the stipulation that Shaler not discuss it with anyone or read anything on the topic until Agassiz had given him permission. When Shaler asked Agassiz for more explicit instructions, Agassiz replied {{that he could not}} be more explicit <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "ind out what you can without damaging the specimen". After the first hours, Shaler thought he had [...] "compassed that fish," [...] but despite Agassiz always being [...] "within call" [...] he was not asked to present his conclusions. During the course of the following week, Shaler recorded the details of [...] "how the scales went in series, their shape, the form and placement of the teeth, etc." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for TV Squad, writer Richard Keller gave the episode a mixed to {{positive}} review, calling the installment [...] "pretty unique", {{but that it}} also had its flaws. He enjoyed {{the fact that the}} episode revealed the relationship between Shawn and Henry, that it [...] "reflects the relationship many of us have with our own fathers". He also enjoyed the [...] "fleshing out" [...] of Gus's character, that [...] "we now see Gus as quite the brainiac" [...] and [...] "rather <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> nothing but 'No, Shawn'... Gus actually contributes quite a bit to this episode". However, Keller also criticized parts of the episode, saying that he disliked the [...] "whole fake psychic concept". Keller also criticized Timothy Omundson's character Carlton Lassiter, saying [...] "he just doesn't fit into the whole show", and [...] "Omundson's makes Lassiter look like a cartoon character". In a comment for TV Guide, the show was called [...] "a diamond in the rough", and writer Matt Roush called star James Roday [...] "a delight". The episode was included in Yahoo! TV's list of the nerdiest episodes of Psych. Reviewer Tucker Cummings said that [...] "the wordplay in this episode great" [...] and that [...] "it gives you a great insight into how Gus and Shawn's friendship has functioned (or dysfunctioned) over the years". In addition, she said that the episode's murder-mystery plot [...] "is actually really engrossing" [...] when compared to later episodes of the show.|$|E

2500|$|Strabo, {{living in}} the late 1st century BC and early 1st century AD, says that he tries {{to strike a balance}} between reading Homer as an {{entertainer}} and as a historical source. He is Euhemerist to the extent that he believes that any hypothesis at all, no matter how outrageous, is more plausible <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "I don't know"; in this regard he accepts Polybius' arguments completely. Strabo offers the most detailed surviving set of identifications: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Jin dynasty {{was divided}} into an [...] "eastern" [...] and a [...] "western" [...] phase. Really, though, this may be less helpful of a {{description}} <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> {{that in terms of}} general geography the most apparent geographic difference between the first part and {{the second part of the}} Jin dynasty was the loss to the empire of the northern parts above the Huai River. However, historians often focus on the location of the capital on an east–west axis.|$|E
2500|$|An ideal I of a Noetherian ring A {{is called}} unmixed if the codimension (or height) of I {{is equal to}} the codimension of every {{associated}} prime P of A/I. (This is stronger <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> that A/I is equidimensional.) The unmixedness theorem is said to hold for the ring A if every ideal I generated by a number of elements equal to its codimension is unmixed. [...] A Noetherian ring is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if the unmixedness theorem holds for it.|$|E

2500|$|Since Woodbourne was {{designated}} as a historic district in 1999, homeowners and realtors have begun advertising homes there as belonging to the [...] "Woodbourne area" [...] rather <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> {{that they are in}} [...] "Forest Hills". [...] Nevertheless, Woodbourne was designed and advertised with the proximity of the train station in mind, {{was an integral part of}} the Roman Catholic parish of St. Andrew the Apostle, and was thought of as part of Forest Hills by its residents throughout the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|In {{interviews}} {{after leaving}} The Mercury News, Webb described the 1997 controversy as media manipulation. [...] "The government {{side of the}} story is coming through the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Washington Post", he stated. [...] "They use the giant corporate press rather <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> anything directly. If you work through friendly reporters on major newspapers, it comes off as The New York Times saying it and not a mouthpiece of the CIA."

2500|$|As such, the {{experimental}} {{subjects of the}} Festinger and Carlsmith study (Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance, 1959) inferred their mental attitudes from their own behaviour. When the subject-participants were asked: [...] "Did you find the task interesting?", the participants decided that they must have found the task interesting, {{because that is what}} they told the questioner. Their replies suggested that the participants who were paid twenty dollars had an external incentive to adopt that positive attitude, and likely perceived the twenty dollars as the reason for saying the task was interesting, rather <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> the task actually was interesting.|$|E

2500|$|Maintaining its {{position}} firmly within the Israeli peace camp, the party pledged to [...] "reignite a process with our Palestinian neighbors {{based on a}} regional platform, and foster our unique and special relationship with Washington" [...] but did not specify in greater detail the concessions that would be made by a Zionist Union government other <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> that the Jordan Valley must be Israel's eastern security border. The party also pledged [...] "to rescue Israel from its international isolation [...] restor relations with the US and Europe, and unit the world in its war against terrorism and aggression".|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} Petruchio's objectification of Katherina, Tita French Baumlin {{focuses on}} his puns on her name. By {{referring to her}} as a [...] "cake" [...] and a [...] "cat" [...] (2.1.185–195), he objectifies her in a more subtle manner <b>than</b> <b>saying</b> she belongs to him. A further aspect of Petruchio's taming rhetoric is the repeated comparison of Katherina to animals. In particular, he is prone to comparing her to a hawk (2.1.8 and 4.1.177–183), often employing an overarching hunting metaphor; [...] "My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,/And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged" [...] (4.1.177–178). Katherina, however, appropriates this method herself, leading to a trading of insults rife with animal imagery in Act 2, Scene 1 (ll.207–232), where she compares Petruchio to a turtle and a crab.|$|E
2500|$|During production, Lucas and Taylor—whom Kurtz called [...] "old-school" [...] and [...] "crotchety"—had {{disputes}} over filming. With {{a background in}} independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most {{of the elements of}} the film himself. His lighting suggestions were rejected by Taylor, who felt that Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions, sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself. Taylor refused to use the soft-focus lenses and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look. Kurtz stated that [...] "In a couple of scenes [...] rather <b>than</b> <b>saying,</b> 'It looks a bit over lit, can you fix that?', [...] say, 'turn off this light, and turn off that light.' And Gil would say, 'No, I won't do that, I've lit it the way I think it should be—tell me what's the effect that you want, and I'll make a judgment {{about what to do with}} my lights.|$|E
