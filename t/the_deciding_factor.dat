In {{the summer of}} 1957 he was offered a new contract, but instead retired from the {{professional}} game aged 37, citing loss of pace due to age as <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factor.</b> His final appearance for the club came on 22 April 1957 against Everton. In total he made 293 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 9 goals.|$|E

5|$|From 1994 to 2006, Kahn {{was part}} of the German {{national}} team, in which he played as a starter after the retirement of Andreas Köpke; he was an unused member of the squad that won the 1996 UEFA European Championship. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the team reached the final. While Germany was several times derided for their poor performance, Kahn's prowess proved to be <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factor</b> in several games until the final, where Germany lost 0–2 to Brazil and Kahn made a mistake on Brazil's first goal. Nevertheless, he was named the tournament's best player and received the Golden Ball award.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{occurred}} in stages: an initial exchange of artillery fire, a minor charge by Confederate Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead, and three successive waves of Confederate infantry charges triggered by unclear orders from Lee and {{the actions of}} Maj. Gens. Magruder and D. H. Hill, respectively. In each phase, {{the effectiveness of the}} Federal artillery was <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factor,</b> repulsing attack after attack, resulting in a tactical Union victory. After the battle, McClellan and his forces withdrew from Malvern Hill to Harrison's Landing, where he remained until August 16. His plan to capture Richmond had been thwarted.|$|E
5|$|Brashear was {{not given}} an {{extension}} during the season, and {{prior to the start}} of the free agency he indicated that he would like to return to Washington, citing the prospect of winning a Stanley Cup. Brashear noted that at his age and place in his career, taking care of his family was his top priority and that money would be <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factor</b> in his destination. The Capitals, however, opted not re-sign him. After initial talks with the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)'s Vityaz Chekhov, he eventually agreed to a two-year, $2.8 million contract with the New York Rangers. At an event for season-ticket holders, Brashear was booed due to the altercation with the Rangers in the previous post-season. He set a personal milestone during the 2009–10 season by playing in his 1,000th NHL game on November 12 against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E
5|$|During the 1932–33 season Gardiner {{began to}} develop a tonsil {{infection}} that drained his strength. While he initially kept the infection private, Gardiner made his condition public on December 23, 1932. Even though he was ill, Gardiner played the next night in Toronto. Though his fifty-five saves were <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factor</b> in the Black Hawks win and his performance was so good that both league President Frank Calder and Maple Leafs star forward Charlie Conacher praised him, he was so sick he would collapse on the dressing room floor in between periods with a fever of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; after the game Gardiner was rushed to a local hospital. This was the first notable symptom of Gardiner's health issues.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the site}} lies around 10 metres elevation. This was one of <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factors</b> for its location, as UK {{explosives}} factories were built near to sea level {{to take account of}} their favourable microclimates.

50|$|Many observers, such as 1977 America's Cup winning skipper Ted Turner, {{believed}} that Gretel II was a faster boat than Intrepid {{but that the}} tactical cunning of Bill Ficker and Steve Van Dyke {{and the performance of}} the American crew were <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factors</b> in <b>the</b> Americans' victory.|$|R
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factors</b> for Project Arrow in {{choosing}} the West Virginia site was its adjacency to New River Gorge National River.

5|$|In February 2007, Durant {{received}} {{an invitation to}} the United States national team training camp. Despite a strong performance, he was cut from the team when its roster was trimmed to its twelve-player limit. Coach Mike Krzyzewski cited the experience of the remaining players as <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factor</b> in making the cut. Durant was finally selected to the national team at the 2010 FIBA World Championship and became their leader as other All-Stars were unavailable, a role he downplayed. At the tournament, he led Team USA to its first FIBA World Championship since 1994, earning MVP honors in the process. His final averages for the competition were 22.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.4 steals per game in nine games.|$|E
5|$|Although such a {{long-range}} {{attack on a}} state far from {{the centre of the}} Empire may seem extraordinary (the last time the Empire had attempted anything on this scale was the failed invasion of Sicily over one hundred and twenty years earlier), it can be explained in terms of Manuel's foreign policy, which was to use the Latins to ensure the survival of the Empire. This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that {{in the context of the}} wider struggle between the crusader states and the Islamic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factor.</b> It had become clear that the ailing Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt held the key to the fate of the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's {{opponent}} {{in the general election}} was Republican Congressman James E. Watson, and the campaign focused on temperance and prohibition. Just as it began, the Republican-controlled state government passed a local-option law that allowed counties to ban the sale of liquor. The law became the central point of debate between the parties and their gubernatorial candidates. The Democrats proposed that the local-option law be changed so that the decision to ban liquor sales could be made at the city and township level. This drew support from anti-prohibitionists, who saw it as an opportunity to roll back prohibition in some areas, and as the only alternative available to the total prohibition which the Republican Party advocated. The Democratic position also helped to retain prohibitionists' support by allowing prohibition to remain enacted in communities where a majority supported it. The Republican Party {{was in the midst of}} a period of instability, splitting along progressive and conservative lines. Their internal problems proved to be <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factor</b> in the election, giving Marshall a narrow victory: he received 48.1 percent of the vote to Watson's 48 percent. He was the first Democratic governor in two decades. Democrats also came to power in the Indiana House of Representatives by a small margin, though Republicans retained control of the Indiana Senate.|$|E

5|$|Otters do not {{dramatically}} reduce prey {{populations in}} the wild, generally speaking. When a copious supply of food dwindles or other prey becomes available, otters either transfer to a new location or convert their dietary choices to the most adequate prey. When left unchecked, though, otter depredations can be quite significant under certain circumstances (e.g. in hatcheries or other fish culture facilities). Likewise, the potential predatory impact of otters may be considerable whenever fish are physically confined (most commonly in smaller ponds offering sparse cover or other escape options). Resolution of such conflicts will usually require removal and/or relocation of nuisance otters. Even in larger bodies of water, they may take disproportional advantage of any seasonal concentrations of fish when and where only very limited areas of suitable spawning, low-flow, or over-wintering habitat may exist. Even such fast-swimming species as trout become lethargic in extremely cold water, with a commensurate increase in their vulnerability to predation. As such, careful consideration of any threatened, endangered, or fish species of special interest is warranted prior to reintroduction of otters to a watershed. Although other prey species are of temporary significance to the river otter, <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factor</b> whether the river otter can establish itself as a permanent resident of one location is the year-round availability of fish.|$|E

50|$|Secondly, {{studies by}} NACA {{revealed}} that the Powerplus was less efficient than the Roots, i.e., more power was required to drive it. This was most pronounced at low-pressure differences.

However it was {{not likely to be}} preferred where efficiency or reduced fuel consumption were <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tea was {{introduced}} in Hawaii in 1887 and was commercially grown until 1892. While {{it is not clear}} why the tea was eventually discontinued, historians believe higher wages compared to other prime tea growing areas in Asia and Africa were among <b>the</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>factors.</b> Lower production costs of tea's main rival, coffee, also helped prevent it from establishing a foothold.|$|R
25|$|The Nazis defined Jewishness as partly genetic, but did {{not always}} use formal genetic tests or physiognomic (facial) {{features}} to determine one's status (although the Nazis {{talked a lot about}} physiognomy as a racial characteristic).

However, in recent decades, historians have begun to rethink the victory's contribution to the formation of the alliance. These historians see the alliance as an inevitable result of individual governmental interests.|$|E
