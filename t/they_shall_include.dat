The number of published volumes of American reports soared from eighteen in 1810 to over 8,000 by 1910. By 1879 one of the delegates to the California constitutional convention was already complaining: [...] "Now, when we require them to state the reasons for a decision, we do not mean they shall write a hundred pages of detail. We do not mean that <b>they</b> <b>shall</b> <b>include</b> the small cases, and impose on the country all this fine judicial literature, for the Lord knows we have got enough of that already." ...|$|E
