Logs for most of the project were shipped via railroad {{from as far away as}} Oregon and Washington state, unloaded in Stratford, Illinois and dragged to <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> by teams of horses. The CCC project also completed sixteen one-room log cabins and three four-bedroom cabins. The work crews also built picnic shelters, trail shelters, and foot bridges. Only the logs for the cabins came from another source. They were purchased from a salvage company that had purchased utility poles from a defunct utility company at the price of 30 cents a piece.|$|E

The first task was the excavation of the track alignment through Monktonhall and the clearing of the site for Shawfair station. Construction of the line's first bridge, Rye Haugh Bridge at Millerhall, were underway on 6 August 2013 as part of works to deviate the line out of Edinburgh from Newcraighall before it returns to the original alignment.

5|$|The Army was {{nonetheless}} overruled by Hitler, {{who had a}} long-standing preference for huge, grandiose constructions. He preferred fixed installations {{along the lines of}} the virtually impregnable U-boat pens that had been built to protect Germany's U-boat fleet. In March 1943, he ordered the construction of a massive bunker (now known as the Blockhaus d'Éperlecques) in the Forest of Éperlecques near Watten, north of Saint-Omer. The bunker was soon spotted by Allied reconnaissance, and on 27 August 1943, a raid by 187 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers wrecked <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> before it could be completed.

5|$|The Chacoans used clay or clay-sand {{and water}} to make mud mortar.

Clay and clay-sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits, then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the mix to <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> in baskets. Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and early fall rainy season, when it was more readily available. Water was also collected from small reservoirs in the slick rock and deep wells in the bed of Chaco Wash.|$|E
5|$|The {{demolition}} of the arcades of Freedom Square began in October 2010. Excavation {{works for the}} foundations of the Parliament House began soon after demolition was complete. In early 2011, the original plan was modified with the relocation of a staircase, the extension of one of the blocks, and changes {{in the design of the}} louvers on the facade. Construction started later that year, and the steel frame of the structure was complete by early 2012. At this point, it began to be covered in limestone which had been quarried in Gozo, and cut into specific shapes in Italy, before being sent back to Malta. Between 120 and 150 workers were on <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> every day, and it cost more than €90 million to build.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that labour {{productivity}} level has continuously been low at <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> One of <b>the</b> appropriate approaches for improving the labour productivity is by implementing the industrialised building system. However, this approach is fewer implemented globally in <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> because <b>the</b> previous researchers concentrated more on the IBS hardware rather than IBS software. Earlier productivity measuring techniques based on statistical theory, expert system and neural networks models {{are said to be}} unsatisfactory because they are incapable of considering the combined effects of the various factors and cost in measuring labour productivity at work sites. Therefore, this research has focused on developing an alternative labour productivity measurement technique to be better able to overcome the shortcomings in the others called SIMBOOST. A series of experiments via simulation model have been performed, which depicted detailed information on the labour productivity in <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> Evidently, <b>the</b> comprehensive information namely labour productivity of monetary units, labour productivity ratio and loss of labour productivity in terms of percentage and monetary unit of the installation of Industrialised Building System (IBS) components in <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> have been fully generated via this approach...|$|R

5|$|In 1876 Ferdinand de Rothschild {{began work}} on Waddesdon Manor, a short {{distance}} south of the Tramway's station at Waddesdon (later renamed Waddesdon Road). The top of Lodge Hill, a landmark, was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into the hill {{to provide access to}} <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site.</b> Transport of materials was by horse, but the contractors had to get enormous stone blocks up the hill. Rothschild's contractors built a line, known as the Winchendon Branch, which turned off the Tramway between Waddesdon and Westcott stations and ran south to the foot of Lodge Hill. From there a cable tram ran on narrow gauge rails up the hill to a gully close to the building site. Materials were hauled along the cable tramway in tubs by a steam-powered winch. The Winchendon Branch was hastily and cheaply built; after one of the Tramway's locomotives derailed there on 5 July 1876 Jones refused to allow his engines on it, and from then on materials were hauled along the branch by horses.|$|E
