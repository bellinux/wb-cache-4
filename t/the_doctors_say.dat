500|$|At {{the time}} that Pausch gave the lecture, he was a {{pancreatic}} cancer patient. In an interview, Pausch stated that he had felt bloated, and learned {{that he had a}} cancerous tumor when doctors performed a CT Scan to check for gallstones. He then underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy surgery (or the [...] "Whipple procedure") to try to stop the growth of the cancerous tumor in his body, which later proved to be unsuccessful. The doctors removed his gall bladder, parts of his small intestine, a third of his pancreas, and parts of his stomach, and proceeded to begin an experimental radiation treatment that could possibly increase his chances of survival for another 5 years to 45 percent. Pausch began the radiation treatments in November 2006 and stopped in May 2007, and felt that he was in good health after finishing. In July and August, tests conducted at Johns Hopkins University showed that Pausch was free of cancer. However, in late August of that year, Pausch informed readers of his website that his cancer had returned, saying: [...] "A recent CT scan showed that there are 10 tumors in my liver, and my spleen is also peppered with small tumors. <b>The</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>say</b> that {{it is one of the}} most aggressive recurrences they have ever seen." [...] The doctors estimated Pausch had three to six months of good health left to live.|$|E
2500|$|Vandenbroucke {{had turned}} down the Giro d'Italia, {{claiming}} problems with his knee, on which he had an operation the previous winter. His psychiatrist, Jef Brouwers, said [...] "... the problems with his knee have affected him badly. He could no longer ride as he wanted after the operation. Nor could <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>say</b> what the problem was. These last few days, he has been terrible. The people that I called in Italy could no longer help him. He had thought it through and, so {{far as he was}} concerned, everything was lost. The situation of his knee has worn him down completely [...] and his private life wasn't good either, with ups and downs." ...|$|E
