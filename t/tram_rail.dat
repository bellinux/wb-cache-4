The first, and only, English Electric trolley bus in service at the time for the Shirley route, opened on 1 April 1931, had to be temporarily withdrawn after a month for upgrades to its bodywork, during which time no. 213 was able to provide relief cover. It was also used for experiments on the Cashmere Hills tram route to test performance on steep terrain. On the morning of 24 May 1931 and the afternoon of 1 June 1931 no. 213 was run along the Cashmere tramline to Dyers Pass Road with one pole on the overhead tram wire and towing a contact line attached to a skate on the <b>tram</b> <b>rail.</b> Though the Board was satisfied with the results, it ultimately decided against conversion of the Cashmere tram route to trolley bus operation.|$|E

50|$|Stocksund station {{used to be}} a junction, {{connecting}} the railway to a short standard gauge tram line through Stocksund, the so-called Långängsbanan terminating at Långängen, and there were also tracks to the Stocksund harbour, which was just nearby the railway station.

5000|$|Preliminary {{operations}} {{started on}} 10 June 2001, initially with six borrowed Saarbahn tramcars, on the Warburg-to-Kassel Hauptbahnhof rail route. Thus, the previous regional railway timetable was now being {{served by the}} new vehicles. RegioTram operation with 30-minute headways was realized. RegioCitadis type vehicles manufactured by Alstom in Salzgitter were delivered in July 2004, and took over the operation on this line on 8 May 2005; the borrowed Saarbahn tramcars were then returned. This route is now served by RegioTram Line 3 (RT3). Starting on 29 January 2006, the first RegioTram operations began on the Kassel <b>tram</b> <b>rail</b> network itself. The hybrid RegioTram vehicles joined the tram tracks in the downtown core of Kassel on the Lossetalbahn to Hessisch Lichtenau during peak hours, the terminus of the tram line. The diesel-electric vehicles used a direct route over the Waldkappel rail line between Ober- and Nieder-Kaufungen which is not electrified. This meant, {{in contrast to the}} trams which served all stops, a reduction in journey time. In August 2007, the switch to the continuous use of conventional tramcar vehicles on this line was made. The former tram-train runs over the non-electrified railway through Waldkappel were replaced by tram [...] "express" [...] trips that do not operate at all stops along the route.|$|E
30|$|The three {{evaluation}} {{methods for}} treating longitudinal irregularity recordings, all of them examined for the same section of <b>tram</b> <b>rail,</b> show contrasting results: the most rigorous method, which leads to gain the Acoustic Roughness Spectrum to compare with some reference levels provided by standards, is not very useful since the tram rails have always significantly accentuated longitudinal irregularities. Acoustic roughness spectrum calculated for a <b>tram</b> <b>rail</b> is always over the standard limit spectrum. Therefore, new limits should be established ad hoc for the tram rails, which are subject to operating conditions that are much more critical than the railway rails ones.|$|E

40|$|Accessibility of {{transport}} infrastructure and public space for visually impaired and partially sighted people depends on ensuring the safe movement. Tactile elements provide such safety for visually impaired people. In Poland, {{there is a}} lack of standards regulating the use of tactile elements in transport. This results in a variety of markings warning against the same type of danger, what leads to the new transport barriers. The article shows the action effects, which were not preceded by the preparation of standards (<b>tram,</b> <b>rail)</b> and reveals a sequence of proper approach for the Warsaw Underground. The procedure of proper operations is indicated. It arises through an analysis of trials and mistakes committed in Poland. Such procedure should be used by those countries, which have not yet applied tactile elements for visually impaired people and whish to apply them in transport infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|Engineering {{methods for}} {{modelling}} {{the generation of}} railway rolling noise are well established. However, these necessarily involve some simplifying assumptions to calculate the sound powers radiated by the wheel and the track. For the rail, this involves using an average vibration together with a radiation efficiency determined for a two-dimensional (2 D) problem. In this paper, the sound radiation from a rail is calculated using a method based {{on a combination of}} waveguide finite elements and wavenumber boundary elements. This new method allows a number of the simplifying assumptions in the established methods to be avoided. It takes advantage of the 2 D geometry of a rail to provide an efficient numerical approach but nevertheless takes into account the three-dimensional nature of the vibration and sound field and the infinite extent of the rail. The approach is used to study a conventional ‘open’ rail as well as an embedded <b>tram</b> <b>rail</b> of the type used for street running. In the former case it is shown that the conventional approach gives correct results and the complexity of the new method is mostly not necessary. However, for the embedded rail it is found {{that it is important to}} take into account the radiation from several wave types in the rail and embedding material. The damping effect of the embedding material on the rail vibration is directly taken into account and, for the example shown, causes the embedded rail to radiate less sound than the open rail above about 600 Hz. The free surface of the embedding material amplifies the sound radiation at some frequencies, while at other frequencies it moves out of phase with the rail and reduces the radiation efficiency. At low frequencies the radiation from the embedded rail resembles a line monopole source which produces greater power than the ‘open’ rail which forms a line dipol...|$|E
