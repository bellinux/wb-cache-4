5|$|In the Hindu religion, {{there has}} been partial success in terms of gender {{equality}} reform laws and family law. While {{this is a major}} advancement relative to other religions in India, it is still not a complete triumph in terms of feminism and relieving oppression. Gandhi came up with the term stree shakti (women power) for the concept of womanhood. In the Hindu religion, Gods are not exclusively male. Hinduism sheds a positive light on femininity; females are considered to complement and complete <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> It {{is important to note that}} both the deity of knowledge and the deity of wealth are female.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E

40|$|Democracy is {{a system}} of {{government}} that abhors gender segregation in politics. Also, {{it has been observed}} that contribution to development in any society is not gender discriminatory. Utilizing secondary data, the paper shows that although female of ages 20 and above constitute 50. 10 percent of the nation’s population; their appointment into positions of authority is infinitesimal compared to <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterpart</b> of the same age. It reveals further that the dominance of male in the nation’s politics, and the low involvement of women in the election participation and their appointment into positions of authority have created the politics of “near-exclusion” of women in favour of <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterpart</b> in the past. It therefore recommends among others the integration of women into the political process in terms of their actual involvement in public policy formulation and implementation as basis for sustainable democracy and development in Nigeri...|$|R

5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{military}} was rapidly demobilised after the Japanese surrender. At {{the end of}} the war the military had a strength of nearly 600,000personnel, of whom 224,000 were serving in the Pacific and 20,000 in Britain and other places. Demobilisation planning had begun at the end of 1942 with the final scheme being approved by the Government in March 1945. General demobilisation started on 1 October 1945 and was completed in February 1947. The process generally ran smoothly, though there were protests over delays at Morotai and Bougainville. Personnel were provided with training while they waited to be demobilised and the government provided post-demobilisation assistance with employment, loans, education and other benefits. Service women were given similar assistance to <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts,</b> but were placed under pressure to return to 'traditional' family roles.|$|E

50|$|The top league {{was named}} the Super League and {{contained}} eight male and eight female teams.

25|$|Women tend to {{earn less}} than men in almost all industries, {{including}} government and academia. Women {{are less likely to}} be hired in highest-paid positions. The data showing the differences in salaries, ranks, and overall success between the genders is often claimed to be a result of women's lack of professional experience. The rate of women's professional achievement is increasing. In 1996, the salaries for women in professional fields increased from 85% to 95% relative to men with similar skills and jobs. Young women between the age of 27 and 33 earned 98%, nearly as much as their male peers. In the total workforce of the United States, women earn 74% as much as <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts</b> (in the 1970s they made 59% as much as <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Female {{sex tourism}} is sex tourism by women who travel {{intending}} {{to engage in}} sexual activities with a sex worker.

Women - especially wealthy, single, older white women - plan their holidays to have romance and sex with a companion {{who knows how to}} make them feel special and give them attention.

30|$|Also, {{significant}} differences on {{awareness of the}} changes relating to temperature were observed across respondents’ gender (χ 2  =  8.380, df =  2, P =  0.015), with males being more aware of declining temperature than females while the females were more aware of rising temperature than <b>their</b> <b>males</b> <b>counterparts.</b> In addition, {{significant differences}} on awareness of the changes relating to temperatures were also observed across the households’ main livelihood (χ 2  =  12.631, df =  10, P =  0.002) with crop farmers being more aware of temperature changes compared to the respondents pursuing other livelihood types.|$|R
25|$|Women {{were also}} {{distinct}} {{because of the}} titles by which they were addressed in the army, although these tended to be no different from <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> They wore the same rank insignia as <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Many members of the ATS were respected by the units they were attached to despite their different insignia. The only major difference between an ATS member and a male member of the Regular Army was discipline: a woman {{was not allowed to}} be court marshalled unless she herself chose to be. The women in the service were also under the authority of the women officers of the ATS, instead of the male officers they served directly under. This meant any disciplinary action was entirely {{in the hands of the}} ATS, removing male influence from the process.|$|E
25|$|Montagu's Turkish {{letters were}} {{frequently}} cited by imperial women travellers, {{more than a}} century after her journey.

25|$|Women become {{intoxicated}} {{more quickly}} than men, and experience a higher blood alcohol level.

30|$|However, the {{existing}} literature shows that despite women’s {{significant contribution to the}} agricultural sector, as women in others parts of the developing world, women in Ethiopia historically had no or limited access to and control over important agricultural resources such as land, livestock, farm implements, capital, knowledge and information (Lemlem et al. 2011; Sachs 1996; Zenebe 2005; Sintayehu 2003; Fong and Bhushan 1996). Teshome (2015) also noted that due to economic, legal, social and cultural factors women’s right to access and control over land are weaker compared to <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterpart.</b>|$|R
30|$|Other {{demographic}} {{differences may}} also be related to completion behaviour.

50|$|Poppy Cultivation and the Opium Trade {{have been}} said {{to have had a}} more {{significant}} impact on the civilians in Afghanistan than the impact of wheat farming and livestock trading. As farmers in Afghanistan were once heavily reliant on wheat farming to make sufficient income, the development of poppy cultivation has given many of these farmers a boost in capital, even though the Opium Trade may be a more dangerous product to distribute. In addition, as the demand for Opium has elevated, women have more opportunity to work in the same setting as <b>their</b> <b>male</b> <b>counterpart.</b>|$|R
