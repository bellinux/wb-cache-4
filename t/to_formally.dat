The conclusions of the 1946 commission were again reaffirmed and upheld by the Dutch judicial system.|$|E

In this situation, Hol chose <b>to</b> <b>formally</b> leave the radical organizations, resigning {{as a member of}} the board of Kristiania Arbeidersamfund and Kristiania Folkevæbningssamlag. He thereby retained his job. However, in early 1884 he was fired by the municipality.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We propose an {{expressive}} language <b>to</b> specify <b>formally</b> behavioral properties of programs involving floating-point computations. We present a deductive verification technique, which allows <b>to</b> prove <b>formally</b> {{that a given}} program meets its specifications, using either SMT-class automatic theorem provers or general interactive proof assistants. Experiments using the Frama-C platform for static analysis of C code are presented. ...|$|R

5|$|Adenanthos obovatus hybridises with A.detmoldii {{to produce}} A.× pamela. Known only from road verges in the Scott River region, {{it was first}} {{discovered}} in 1979, {{and it is now}} known from more than twenty individual plants. The discovery of it in such large numbers, together with its recognised horticultural potential, prompted Nelson <b>to</b> <b>formally</b> describe and name it in 1986. Morphologically it is intermediate between its parents; that is, taller than A.obovatus, with longer leaves and light red flowers. It is fertile, raising the possibility of the establishment of a hybrid swarm.|$|E
5|$|After Flores' {{murder on}} 30 May 2010—five {{years to the}} day after Holloway's disappearance—Van der Sloot fled to Chile, where he was arrested and extradited back to Peru for {{questioning}} regarding the murder. On 7 June 2010, he confessed to bludgeoning Ramírez. He later tried <b>to</b> <b>formally</b> retract his confession, claiming that he had been intimidated by the National Police of Peru and framed by the FBI. A Peruvian judge ruled on 25 June 2010 that the confession was valid and on 13 January 2012, Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment for Flores' murder.|$|E

5|$|After {{having been}} {{temporarily}} incapacitated by several severe health problems, President Dwight D. Eisenhower attempted to clarify procedures through a signed agreement with Vice President Richard Nixon, drafted by Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr.. However, this agreement {{did not have}} legal authority. Eisenhower {{suffered a heart attack}} in September 1955 and intestinal problems requiring emergency surgery in July 1956. Each time until Eisenhower was able to resume his duties, Nixon presided over Cabinet meetings and, along with Eisenhower aides, kept the executive branch functioning and assured the public that the situation was under control. However, Nixon never made any effort <b>to</b> <b>formally</b> assume the status of Acting President or President.|$|E
5|$|As the American Revolutionary War {{began in}} the East, Kentucky's {{settlers}} became involved in a dispute about the region's sovereignty. Richard Henderson, a judge and land speculator from North Carolina, had purchased much of Kentucky from the Cherokee in an illegal treaty. Henderson intended to create a proprietary colony known as Transylvania, but many Kentucky settlers did not recognize Transylvania's authority over them. In June 1776, these settlers selected Clark and John Gabriel Jones to deliver a petition to the Virginia General Assembly, asking Virginia <b>to</b> <b>formally</b> extend its boundaries to include Kentucky.|$|E

She has stated her intention <b>to</b> <b>formally</b> convert to Buddhism when the political conditions enable her to become Prime Minister of India. Her act of performing the last rites (traditionally done by a male heir) was an expression of their views against gender discrimination. When she was Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, she publicly called Bhikkhus to prayer.|$|E

5|$|Bypassing Vigo on {{his flight}} southwards, Villeneuve {{put into the}} Southern Spanish fleet base of Cadiz on 20 August. By abandoning his efforts to reach the English Channel, Villeneuve was in effect abandoning the entire {{invasion}} strategy and, when news of Villeneuve's retreat reached him, Napoleon decided <b>to</b> <b>formally</b> abandon the campaign, marching the army at Boulogne south to the Austrian border. Without instructions from his superior, and with no idea where the main French fleet was, Allemand spent much of August off the Spanish coast before deciding {{to turn to the}} third aspect of his orders, the disruption of British trade.|$|E

In 2013, Georgetown hosted the east regional finals round of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{international}} {{rail travel}} was liberalised by new European Union directives, designed {{to break up}} monopolies {{in order to encourage}} competition for services between countries. This sparked interest among other companies in providing services in competition to Eurostar and new services to destinations beyond Paris and Brussels. The only rail carrier <b>to</b> <b>formally</b> propose and secure permission for such a service up to now is Deutsche Bahn, which intends to run services between London and Germany and the Netherlands. The sale of High Speed One by the British Government having effectively nationalised LCR in June 2009 is also likely to stimulate competition on the line.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the execution of King Louis XVI, revolutionary France was attacked by Prussian and Holy Roman forces from the Austrian Netherlands. Though the French defeated the Austrian army in the Battle of Jemappes in 1792 and briefly occupied the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège, they were pushed out by an Austrian counterattack in the Battle of Neerwinden the following year. In June 1794, French revolutionary troops expelled Holy Roman forces from the region for the last time after the Battle of Fleurus. The French government voted <b>to</b> <b>formally</b> annex the territory in October 1795 and it was split into nine provincial départements within France.|$|E
