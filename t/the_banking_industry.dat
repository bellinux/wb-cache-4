5|$|While details {{regarding}} Richard Cantillon's {{life are}} scarce, {{it is thought}} that he was born sometime during the 1680s in County Kerry, Ireland. He was son to land-owner Richard Cantillon of Ballyheigue. Sometime {{in the middle of the}} first decade of the 18th century Cantillon moved to France, where he attained French citizenship. By 1711, Cantillon found himself in the employment of British Paymaster General James Brydges, in Spain, where he organised payments to British prisoners of war during the War of Spanish Succession. Cantillon remained in Spain until 1714, cultivating a number of business and political connections, before returning to Paris. Cantillon then became involved in <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> <b>industry</b> working for a cousin, who at that time was lead-correspondent of the Parisian branch of a family bank. Two years later, thanks in large part to financial backing by James Brydges, Cantillon bought his cousin out and attained ownership of the bank. Given the financial and political connections Cantillon was able to attain both through his family and through James Brydges, Cantillon proved a fairly successful banker, specialising in money transfers between Paris and London.|$|E

40|$|This plan extends {{definition}} of institutional herding proposed by Sias (2004) {{to examine whether}} the dynamic herding behaviors exist among <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>industry</b> in Taiwan {{with regard to the}} industrial firms’ loan, what the cause of their herding in granting a loan is and whether their herding of providing a loan significantly increases in the bullish period comparative to in the bearish period and this phenomenon mainly results from pursuit of the same type of bank loan. By testing the cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>industry</b> towards loan demand of the industrial firms in any two adjacent semiannual periods and decomposing the cross-sectional dependence into their own cascades and others cascades (i. e. capital loan herding), I examine whether the cascades of <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>industry</b> in Taiwan towards the industrial firms’ loans mainly results from their herding behaviors. Concurrently, by using the cross-sectional correlation that <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> increases <b>the</b> weight rate of their loan portfolio for adjacent inter-semiannual periods, this plan plans to analyze whether loan herding among <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> is <b>the</b> result of the habit loan. Next, I would like to examine whether the loan made by a <b>bank</b> to <b>the</b> industrial firm are more likely to herd in the industry with larger or smaller average capitalization; thus, “investigative herding” or “information cascades” are the main reasons of loan herding among <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>industry</b> in Taiwan towards the industrial firms. Moreover, this plan examines whether there is a more significant herding phenomenon of the enterprise loan in the bullish period comparative to in the bearish period in the stock market among <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>industry</b> in Taiwan. In addition, this plan examines whether the enterprise capital loan made by all types of bank in Taiwan are more likely to follow similar types of bank rather than different types of <b>bank</b> on <b>the</b> one hand, the result of which may be consistent with the view proposed by Sias (2004) that institutional herding is driven by reputation herding. On the other hand, the author also examines whether <b>the</b> small-size <b>banks</b> will also significantly follow <b>the</b> large-size <b>banks</b> in <b>the</b> enterprise capital loan and whether public banks will also significantly lead private <b>banks,</b> <b>the</b> result of which may be consistent with the argument of Del Guercio (1996) and Bennett, Sias and Starks (2003) that institutional herding is driven by characteristic herding.

40|$|In Iraq, {{like other}} countries, <b>the</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industry</b> plays an {{important}} role in developing the country’s economic system. <b>The</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industry</b> of Iraq is regulated by <b>the</b> Islamic <b>Banking</b> Law, 2015. However, Iraq’s Islamic Banking Law of 2015 consists of an incomplete set of rules and regulations. The law does not contain certain fundamental elements such as the licensing requirements. In addition the law does not determine the highest Sharia body in case of Islamic <b>banking</b> problems. Thus, <b>the</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industry</b> in Iraq is also regulated by <b>the</b> <b>Banking</b> Law 2004 and <b>the</b> Central <b>Bank</b> Law 2004 but they do not make specific reference to Islamic <b>banking.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industry</b> in Iraq faces challenges which are both legal and Sharia in character. In this context, the lack of a comprehensive Islamic banking legal framework and unclear relationship between the CBI and Islamic <b>banks</b> are <b>the</b> two main legal problems. Accordingly, <b>the</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industry</b> of Iraq is regulated by conventional laws and this may result ultimately in legal problems for <b>the</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> system. <b>The</b> Sharia challenge faced by <b>the</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industry</b> in Iraq is the lack of a proper Sharia framework. In effect, the Sharia supervision of <b>the</b> Iraqi Islamic <b>banking</b> system is not as robust as it should be. Thus, a central Sharia board does not exist and the individual Sharia supervisory boards of Islamic banks are not sufficiently strong because there is a shortage of qualified Sharia scholars to act as members of the Sharia supervisory boards of Islamic <b>banks.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> shortage of qualified Islamic banking experts is another important problem for <b>the</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> system of Iraq. The lack of Sharia scholars for the Sharia supervisory boards of Islamic <b>banks</b> and <b>the</b> lack of qualified staff to run <b>the</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industry</b> are <b>the</b> main human resource challenges faced by <b>the</b> Iraqi Islamic <b>banking</b> system. Thus, this thesis attempts to find solutions for these problems affecting <b>the</b> Iraqi Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industry.</b> In this regard, the thesis considers <b>the</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> systems of both Malaysia and Bahrain. Both of these countries are developed and successful and each has a proper regulatory framework for its Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industry.</b> In Malaysia, <b>the</b> Islamic Financial Services Act 3013 (IFSA) is a special law for the regulation of the Islamic financial sector including Islamic banks. Similarly in Bahrain, Volume 2 -Islamic Bank is a set of regulations which govern Islamic banks. In addition, both countries have a proper Sharia regulatory and supervisory system because they have a sufficient number of Sharia scholars to supervise their Islamic banking business. Furthermore, many qualified Islamic banking experts can be found in Malaysia and Bahrain as those countries house universities and centres that offer Islamic banking degrees or courses. By drawing inspiration from the Malaysian and Bahraini Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industries,</b> Iraq can develop and improve its own Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industry.</b> This can be done by amending <b>the</b> Islamic <b>Banking</b> Law, 2015 and establishing a central Sharia board, similar to Malaysia’s Sharia Advisory Council. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Banking</b> Law 2004 and <b>the</b> Iraqi Central <b>Bank</b> Law 2004 should be amended so as to cater more to <b>the</b> Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industry.</b> It is <b>the</b> responsibility of <b>the</b> Central <b>Bank</b> of Iraq to resolve all problems that are faced by Islamic <b>banks</b> in <b>the</b> country. By drawing judiciously on the Bahraini and Malaysian experiences, CBI regulators will be able to reform <b>the</b> Iraqi Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>industry</b> and find solutions for both legal and Sharia challenge...|$|R
