5|$|At a temple, which Meera visits as {{her daily}} ritual, Zeenat makes her first contact. Zeenat is <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> tell Meera {{the truth about}} the situation, and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come. Over a few weeks, they become good friends and spend most of the time together. Their {{friendship}} brings out the missing part in each of their personalities. In the process, Zeenat realizes helplessness; this is totally new to her forthright way of thinking. Meera, on the other hand, gets a glimpse of freedom; this brings her out of the shell of the traditions in her haveli and gives her a new perspective on her life.|$|E
5|$|Raya, a young Ukrainian woman, and {{her friend}} Luba are sold to a Bosnian sex-trafficking ring by a relative. Raya escapes with Irka, another girl forced into prostitution, and they are sent to a women's shelter for victims of human trafficking. While {{investigating}} their case, Kathryn uncovers a large-scale sexual slavery ring utilized by international personnel (including Americans). She persuades Raya and Irka to testify against their traffickers in court, guaranteeing their safety; however, an indifferent UN official drops Irka at the border between Bosnia and Serbia when she cannot produce a passport. A corrupt peacekeeper tips off the traffickers, and Raya is recaptured and tortured. Although rescued from the woods by Kathryn, Irka is <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> proceed with the trial.|$|E

Her eyes seemed to have become quite dry, hard and small {{in a lot of}} horrible wrinkles. I was <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> of her <b>to</b> shudder, <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> of her <b>to</b> put my fingers to my ears. I didn't know what I {{expected}} her to call me next, but when she told me I was no better than a beggar--that {{there would be no more}} masters, no more servants, no more horses for me--I said to myself: Is that all? I should have laughed if I hadn't been <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> of her <b>to</b> make the least little sound." ...|$|R

5|$|Then the Roman army {{began its}} march north, {{following}} the coastal road. 300 horse under John the Armenian were detached as an advance guard some 3 miles (4.5km) {{in front of}} the main army, while the 600 Huns covered the army's left flank. Belisarius himself with his bucellarii led up the rear, to guard against any attack from Gelimer, who was known to be in the vicinity. The fleet followed the army, sailing along the coast. The first town they encountered was Syllectum, which was captured by a detachment under Boriades by a ruse. In an attempt to sow division among the Vandals, Belisarius gave a letter written by Justinian and addressed to the Vandal nobles to a captured Vandal messenger, in which the emperor claimed to be campaigning on behalf of the legitimate king Hilderic against the usurper Gelimer. As the messenger was <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> deliver the letter, this ploy came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Jason starts {{work with}} an NGO in Thailand, having left his wife and {{children}} in Canada and abandoned a lucrative job at his father-in-law's legal firm. He communicates with his wife Ali over Skype. Jason's first task is to find witnesses to or survivors from a human-trafficking incident and then to shut down the brothels into which they have been trafficked; his boss Marta sends him into the brothels as she cannot enter herself. His specific focus is an Asia-wide brothel ring's trafficking of girls into Bangkok for prostitution as part of the child sex tourism industry. An abandoned storage truck has been discovered containing the bodies of dead sex workers. Attempting to build a legal case against the brothel ring, Jason pays to see prostitutes in the hope that one of them witnessed the incident. The first prostitute he sees is Number 18, whose attempts to seduce him make him uneasy. Thinking Number 18 could be a key witness, he tries to persuade her to testify. The other prostitutes Jason encounters are <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> give evidence. Number 18 answers some of Jason's questions about where she is from, where she has worked, and how long she has been working, but only on the condition that Jason pay 100 baht for each response. She reveals that she has been prostituted in Thailand and Malaysia.|$|E
25|$|Since {{many banks}} had also {{invested}} their clients' savings {{in the stock}} market, these banks were forced to close {{when the stock market}} crashed. After the stock market crash and the bank closures, people were <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> lose more money. Because of the fears of further economic challenge, individuals from all classes stopped purchasing and consuming. Thousands of individual investors who believed they could get rich by investing on margin lost everything they had. The stock market crash severely impacted American economy.|$|E

Kyubey offers Madoka and Sayaka the chance to have any one wish granted in exchange for becoming a magical girl and fighting witches, whilst Homura Akemi, another magical girl who recently transferred into Madoka's class, is strongly against Madoka becoming one. Before Madoka can make a decision, however, Mami is killed by a witch, leaving Madoka <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> become a magical girl.|$|E
25|$|After {{being sentenced}} to {{between two and}} three years' jail each, the group appealed {{the case in the}} Jayapura High Court, {{resulting}} in their freedom as the court overturned the jail sentence. When they arrived at the airport, however, they found their plane surrounded by Indonesian security, who had confiscated it on behalf of the prosecutors who lodged an appeal to overturn the High Court ruling. The plane, they said, was required for evidence. And as the court ruling stipulated they must leave in their own plane, the Merauke Five were trapped at Mopah Airport — <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> leave in case they would be charged again for other charges.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{takes place}} in July 1966, {{featuring}} much discussion among the characters about the then-unsolved Richard Speck murders in Chicago.

However, Guerrero's peers in Peralvillo were <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> of him <b>to</b> act in response to the killing. Paradoxically, he was said to be a Catholic [...] and a devotee of the Lady of Guadalupe, a faith that Guerrero proclaimed proudly to others.|$|R

Yes, yes: that's {{all very}} well, Mr Apjohn [He {{is about to}} {{interrupt}} again: but she won't have it] no: it's no use: I've suddenly begun to think of you as Mr Apjohn; and it's ridiculous to go on calling you Henry. I thought you were only a boy, a child, a dreamer. I thought you would be <b>too</b> much <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> do anything. And {{now you want to}} beat Teddy and to break up my home and disgrace me and make a horrible scandal in the papers. It's cruel, unmanly, cowardly.|$|R
5000|$|Trump's thoughts: Trump called La Toya Jackson's {{decision}} not to bring back Omarosa the most shocking boardroom mistake {{he had ever seen}} in all thirteen seasons of doing the show, and surmised that La Toya was simply <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> of Omarosa <b>to</b> want to confront her in the boardroom, though La Toya herself stated her belief that Trump had [...] "bought into" [...] Omarosa's pleas for sympathy {{and that there was no}} way he would have fired her.|$|R
500|$|Perkinson {{reveals that}} he {{previously}} met Pierre Michel {{on a train}} and that Michel had told him of the plan to murder Cassetti, but he was <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> do it. Since the others had not seen Michel in person, Perkinson volunteered to impersonate Michel and stab Cassetti on his behalf {{so that he could}} get revenge for Teresa's death. He then reveals that a now 13-year-old Daisy Armstrong, whom he had been raising as his own daughter, is alive and has been hidden in the baggage compartment of the train during the journey. Daisy then comes out to meet the people who thought she was dead. Poirot, Dr. Constantine, and Marceau decide to tell the police officials the first solution – that an unknown assassin came aboard the train, killed Rachett, and left. The passengers are overjoyed that Daisy is alive and Poirot concludes that it is [...] "a most satisfying ending." ...|$|E
500|$|Skleros {{then quickly}} {{assembled}} {{a force of}} ten to twelve thousand men {{and set out to}} meet the Rus'. The two armies met near Arcadiopolis (modern Lüleburgaz in Turkish Thrace), some 80 km west of Constantinople. The two primary accounts on the Byzantine side differ on the preliminaries of the battle: Leo the Deacon reports that Skleros sent a scouting detachment ahead under the patrikios John Alakaseus, and then gave battle after only a day, but the later chronicle of Skylitzes reports that for a few days, Skleros with his men remained within the walls of Arcadiopolis as the Rus' encamped nearby, and refused to come out and meet them in battle despite their repeated challenges for him to do so. According to Skylitzes, the Rus' quickly became convinced that the imperial army was <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> face them; consequently they roamed about the countryside plundering, neglected their camp defences and spent their nights in heedless revelry.|$|E
500|$|Alice {{developed}} {{a friendship with}} the theologian David Friedrich Strauss. He was a controversial figure at the time; in 1835, he published The Life of Jesus, which argued that the Bible could not be literally interpreted as God's word, a view akin to heresy in orthodox circles. Alice's view was similar to Strauss's, and she believed that contemporary Victorian society was presenting God {{in a way that}} would be [...] "unrecognisable to early Christians". Strauss also offered Alice an intellectual companionship that her husband was not equipped to provide, and he was regularly invited to the New Palace to read to Alice privately. The friendship flourished; Strauss was introduced to Alice's sister Victoria and her brother-in-law Frederick, and he was invited by them to Berlin. In 1870, Strauss wanted to dedicate his new work Lectures on Voltaire to Alice, but he was <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> ask her; she spared him the need by asking him to dedicate them to her. However, Alice's relationship with Strauss angered Empress Augusta, who labelled Alice a [...] "complete atheist" [...] after hearing about his promotion.|$|E

Argyll was said to have drawn his pistols to fire, but the powder had become damp in the river, and Argyll was struck over the head by one of his captors, a weaver. Heavily {{disguised}} in a countryman's bonnet and the full beard he had grown in exile, it was reported (probably apocryphally) that Argyll was only recognised when he cried [...] "Alas, unfortunate Argyll!"

500|$|Both Surfer Rosa and Steve Albini's {{production}} of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa {{as the basis for}} Neverminds songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1993 that he [...] "heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because I was <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> play them for anybody." [...] Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as [...] "the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame." [...] Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa [...] "blew my mind," [...] and that she [...] "immediately went to track down Steve Albini." [...] Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.|$|E
500|$|Pam {{says that}} her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) always makes her great Christmas gifts so {{she wants to make}} him one too. She creates a {{hand-drawn}} comic book about Jim who gets attacked by a radioactive bear and takes its powers. She asks for others' opinions before giving it to Jim, but most of them give her harsh critiques. Jim gives Pam a beautiful bracelet and he is equally amazed at the comic book she gives him. Meanwhile, Jim agrees to a snowball fight with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). When he is first challenged outside, however, he finds the doors chained. Dwight then emerges from a snowman, throwing multiple snowballs at Jim and leaving him with a bloody nose. Throughout the day, Dwight torments Jim with increasingly elaborate snowball ambushes. Jim tries to surrender, but Dwight refuses. At the end of the day, Jim is <b>too</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> go outside. He and Pam find multiple snowmen, and Jim attacks them all hoping to find Dwight. Dwight, however, is {{on the roof of the}} building, watching Jim with a satisfied look on his face. He claims that the most powerful snowball in a snowball fight is fear, and smilingly wishes the camera [...] "Merry Christmas".|$|E
