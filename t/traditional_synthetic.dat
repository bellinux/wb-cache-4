50|$|In chemistry, metal vapor {{synthesis}} (MVS) is {{a method}} for preparing metal complexes by combining freshly produced metal atoms or small particles with ligands. In contrast to the high reactivity of such freshly produced metal atoms, bulk metals typically are unreactive toward neutral ligands. The method {{has been used to}} prepare compounds that cannot be prepared by <b>traditional</b> <b>synthetic</b> methods, e.g. Ti(η6-toluene)2. The technique relies on a reactor that evaporates the metal, allowing the vapor to impinge on a cold reactor wall that is coated with the organic ligand. The metal evaporates upon being heated resistively or irradiated with an electron beam. The apparatus operates under high vacuums. In a common implementation, the metal vapor and the organic ligand are co-condensed at liquid nitrogen temperatures.|$|E

50|$|Over time, {{questions}} have been raised concerning the long-term impact of the massive application of these highly efficacious, broad-spectrum anthelmintic compounds on the environment. Due to the bioavilability of some of these drugs, high percentages of these substances are being excreted unchanged after oral or systemic administration (Farkas et al., 2003; Plumb, 2008). Decomposing animal excrements/waste is spread all over our land for increased crop productivity, hereby also spreading the anthelmintic drugs and their residues. To this day however, we remain oblivious to what the possible long-term ecological effects of these drugs and their residues are on pasture fauna and flora (Spratt, 1997). This concern, among others, is stimulating the need for alternative, more biological measures of parasite control. In biological farming, the use of <b>traditional</b> <b>synthetic</b> drugs is not allowed and therefore, organic farmers prefer a phytopharmaceutical approach for the control of parasitic infections on their farm (van Krimpen et al., 2010). Although many plants are suggested to have some nematocidal effects (Chitwood, 2002), recent studies by van Krimpen et al., (2010) could not show any significant reduction on the worm load of infected pigs after treatment with a herb mixture (Thymus vulgaris, Melissa officinalis and Echinacea purpurea), Papaya fruits, Bolbo leaf or complete Artemesia plants in comparison with untreated controls. Nevertheless, continued efforts could be made to standardize the plant extracts with good anthelmintic activity and formulate best alternative herbal preparations to replace or complement the synthetic drugs, which are currently in use. In addition to phytopharmaceutical research, the possibility of using nematophageous fungi for the biological control of A. suum is currently being investigated. According to the study of Ferreira et al., (2011) mycelia of Pochonia chlamydosporia, which were added to the food of pigs, showed ovicidal activity against A. suum eggs after passage through the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

Additionally, factors that influence tracking errors are estimated. The results suggest that tracking errors are influenced by expense ratio, number of securities in the benchmark and type of replication for all estimation methods.

40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be {{engineered}} {{to perform a}} multitude of different chemical reactions that are not programmed in its original genetic code. It has a large potential to function as whole-cell biocatalyst for one-pot multistep synthesis of various organic molecules, and it may thus serve as a powerful alternative or complement to <b>traditional</b> organic <b>synthetic</b> routes for new chemical entities (NCEs). However, although the selectivity in many cases is high, the catalytic activity is often low which results in low space-time-yields.
