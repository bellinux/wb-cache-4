5|$|Eleanor and her {{daughter}} Anna became estranged after she took over some of her mother's social duties at the White House. The relationship was further strained because Eleanor desperately wanted {{to go with her}} husband to Yalta in February 1945 (two months before FDR's death), but he took Anna instead. A few years later, the two were able to reconcile and cooperate on numerous projects. Anna <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> her mother when she was terminally ill in 1962.|$|E

She once had to sell the children's pinafores and their jewels to support her family and {{to pay for their}} voyage back to Manila. The other money was also used to help boost the revolutionary funds. Their support for the revolution made them an impoverished family; however, they gained it back when Don Felipe returned to his profession.|$|E

5|$|In April 1960, Roosevelt was {{diagnosed}} with aplastic anemia soon after being struck by a car in New York City. In 1962, she was given steroids, which activated a dormant case of tuberculosis in her bone marrow, and she died of resulting cardiac failure at her Manhattan home at 55 East 74th Street on the Upper East Side on November 7, 1962, {{at the age of}} 78.

5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing {{that in the}} early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria. In the late 1510s Raphael, at that time {{painting}} the Vatican loggias, often had lunch together with his aides in a rear room of that eatery. The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions {{on the walls of the}} room. When the palace was built, the osteria remained in place, and the owners always <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the walls of that room throughout the years.|$|E
5|$|Penelo {{is usually}} {{trying to keep}} Vaan out of trouble, {{but she could not}} stop Vaan from intruding into the palace grounds.

This encounter forced her into a series of events, when she was kidnapped by Bangaa headhunter Ba'gamnan and held as hostage in exchange for Balthier. When she managed to escape, she met with Larsa Solidor, one of the sons of Archadian Emperor Gramis, who <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> her and convinced her he wished to make peace with Dalmasca. When she is finally reunited with Vaan, she made him promise not to leave her side, and ever since traveled with Vaan, furthering their relationship as sky pirate and partner.|$|E

2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> {{the things in}} the cosmos or that he does not, and, if he does <b>take</b> <b>care,</b> that it is either of all things or of some. Now if he <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything, {{there would be no}} {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything. On the other hand, if he <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> only some things, why does he <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is able to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not able to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the things in the cosmos.|$|R

5|$|Since Ramanujan's {{father was}} at work most of the day, his mother <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the boy as a child. He had a close {{relationship}} with her. From her, he learned about tradition and puranas. He learned to sing religious songs, to attend pujas at the temple, and to maintain particular eating habits – all of which are part of Brahmin culture. At the Kangayan Primary School, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in the district. That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.|$|E

They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E

5|$|To {{allow the}} lord to {{concentrate}} on his duties regarding administration, he had a household of servants {{to take care of}} chores such as providing food. The household was run by a chamberlain, while a treasurer <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the estate's written records. Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although on a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious. An important role of the household servants was the preparation of food; the castle kitchens would have been a busy place when the castle was occupied, called on to provide large meals. Without the presence of a lord's household, usually because he was staying elsewhere, a castle would have been a quiet place with few residents, focused on maintaining the castle.|$|E
