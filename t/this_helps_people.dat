5000|$|Liberation {{psychology}} {{departs from}} traditional psychological prioritization {{of the individual}} and the attribution of an individual’s distress to pathology within the individual. Liberation psychology challenges us to understand the person within their sociopolitical, cultural, and historical context. Therefore, distress is understood not solely in intrapsychic terms but {{in the context of an}} oppressive environment that psychologises and individualises distress.In a psychotherapeutic context, this removes the onus of psychological distress solely from the individual and their immediate circumstances, and reframes the origin of distress as the environment and social structure to which persons are subjugated. Furthermore, <b>this</b> <b>helps</b> <b>people</b> to understand their relationship to the power structure, and the ways in which they participate in it.

5000|$|E-portfolios {{also help}} to foster an {{independent}} and autonomous way of thinking, according to Strivens. [...] This is {{in large part because}} people must focus on their collective work, think about how it will be portrayed, and what the work says about them as an individual. The individual is then in charge of their learning and the choice of where to demonstrate their proficiency. People are also forced to reflect on what they have learned and how they plan to build and improve in the future. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> <b>people</b> to become better critical thinkers and helps them to develop their writing and multimedia skills. Today, many students are using multimedia such as Facebook, Twitter, and texting—all informal settings. The electronic portfolio, on the other hand, is a more formal setting where students must apply both their knowledge of how the web works and the message they want to convey. In this sense, students' use and comfort with the web at times can be a hindrance if they are not taught to use electronic portfolios in the correct fashion, suggests Lane. Many universities and schools are currently working to make sure that students are gaining practice and experience with electronic portfolios so that they are able to use them {{to the best of their}} ability. For example, in places like Michigan students can earn the MCOATT (Michigan Certificate of Outstanding Achievement in Teaching Technology) for submitting an electronic portfolio which demonstrates evidence of technology being used in the classroom.

Pepero's father had left the village earlier {{in search of the}} mythical El Dorado, a city that is said to be built {{completely}} out of gold which no one has ever found. Pepero's father's aim is to put his family and village out of poverty. However, the father is away {{for a very long time}} and no one heard anything about him since he left. The story starts with Pepero seeing the reflection of a golden eagle in a river when he was filling some pots with water. Pepero considers that a sign that his father is alive and that he should look for him. His mind is made up when he meets two weary travelers, an old man named Titicaca and an amnesiac girl named Kayna, who apparently had heard of the mythical El Dorado. Pepero's mind is made up and he decides to set off on the quest for El Dorado with Titicaca and Kayna agreeing to come along with him. On the way, he picks up more friends like Aztec, a teenager who has to look after his siblings while his mother is sick and who sometimes resorts to stealing to support his family and agrees to tag along in promise of the lost treasures, and Chuchu, who is a small boy performing in a circus and who has to look after his sister. In one episode, Pepero succeeds in taming a wild white horse and the horse repays him by coming to Pepero's rescue whenever the latter whistles. Pepero also wears a unique necklace in the shape of a white horn which is the same as the one worn by his father. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> <b>people</b> identify him as the son of Carlos. This fact is uncovered when Pepero meets a guy who claims that he is Carlos and who is wearing the same necklace.

40|$|Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which {{converts}} {{the ambient}} mechanical energy to electricity by friction, {{is one of}} the most promising methods for powering up portable devices. Despite of the successful development so far, there still remain some issues to be improved. Here, we focus on the generation and maintenance of high output-power under harsh environments, and the noise cancellation of the device to keep a stable operation for a long period of time. The TENG, fabricated using a 3 D printer, is a fully-packaged, cylinder-shaped device with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) bumpy balls inside and linearly patterned Al film on the inner surface. The new design and optimization remarkably increases the output power up to 45  mW, operable under harsh environments such as water, providing enough DC power for charging a battery of smart watch. The noise occurring during the operation is canceled to the noise level (~ 50  dB) of a normal conversation, by approximately 20  dB, with no degradation of the output power by using highly compressible, conductive Ag nanowires-embedded polyurethane sponge instead of Al. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> <b>people</b> around the device feel comfortable during the operation.

40|$|Abstract — With the {{increasing}} use of high-speed internet technologies during the past few years, the concept of cloud computing has become more popular and has evolved as a key computing platform for sharing resources that include infrastructure, software, applications, and business process. It provides a new way of building applications on on-demand infrastructure. In cloud computing, users work with webbased, rather than local, storage and software. Using cloud computing we can move operating system to web which aims at providing the user with the most easy and the efficient way of using an operating system, which is stored in a server and accessing it from anywhere with a browser and minimum system requirement and internet connection, <b>this</b> <b>helps</b> <b>people</b> work, logout, and login from a different place on a different computer without carrying their own PC. On demand OS applications are accessible via a browser and look and act like desktop programs. Organizations can more easily control corporate data and reduce malware infections. Also, cloud computing makes collaboration easier and can reduce platform-incompatibility problems. Currently available on demand OS include eyeOS, icloud, Cloudo. Of course, the Web OS won’t replace the traditional operating system any time soon. But as users become more comfortable working over the Web, the Web OS could become more popular...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe "Soins et Santé" (Care & Health) {{association}} is non-profit medical structure. Its {{mission is to}} maintain and {{improve the quality of}} life for patients at home. The structure is divided into three services: a care centre providing home care or institutional care, a department of nursing at home for the elderly which provides care for people over 60 years dependent and / or chronically ill, and a therapeutic day care center for old people with cognitive disabilities living at home. <b>This</b> <b>helps</b> <b>people</b> to maintain social links, by stimulating therapeutic activities adapted to slow down the effects of the disease and also relieve the family by providing periods of respite. The therapeutic day care offers many activities such as memory, gymnastics, gardening, and multi-sensory stimulation workshops to help patients find their way into space and maintain their independence. Within the medical and social structures, directors have the duty to organize the safety of patients they serve. If damage is caused to a patient and results from carelessness or negligence of staff or access to unsuitable premises, the responsibility of the head of institution is directly engaged. To assure this surveillance, some structures make use of wireless systems. Demented patients carry with them a device (jewelry, bracelet, pendant [...] .) that causes an alarm on detection of the patient in a non-authorized zone. However, every act of assistance that may be offered even to a cognitive impaired person has to be done with the full consent of the person. Therefore "Soins et Santé" association has chosen to implement technical solutions enabling the secure monitoring of patients through indirect control of the employees. A disposal for patient safety has been established for simultaneously securing sensitive premises (offices, treatment rooms and utensils and care products storage places) and the timetable attendance of the employees. The goal is to allow safe and non-controlled natural ambulation of the patients, respecting their integrity, and thus defending the values of respect for the human person. The use of proximity card readers now combines convenience and traceability. The project was custom made in collaboration with Legrand, the worldwide electrical building infrastructure manufacturer. With the new system, monitoring of staff and establishment of forms of activity is continuous and automatic, thus freeing the staff of a heavy workload with benefit for the patients...|$|E
40|$|Publisher東京論文This paper {{examines}} how concepts of scholarship, especially scholarship {{of teaching and}} learning (SoTL) and scholarship of engagement (SoE), have developed among academic theorists based on Ernest L. Boyer's Scholarship Reconsidered (1990). To break out of the monotonous old debate of teaching versus research, Boyer attempted to redefine the meaning of scholarship. He proposed four types of scholarship -discovery, integration, application, and teaching— and insisted that they be equally respected. Since Boyer's proposition, many scholars have actively debated what scholarship is, and new concepts of scholarship, such as SoTL and SoE, have been developed. Recently, American scholarship has had two important tendencies: one is disaggregated, specific, and concrete; the other is aggregated, holistic, and abstract. Advocates of the former regard the new types of scholarship, such as SoTL and SoE, as extensions of one of Boyer's original four types. Hence, these advocates believe SoTL to be an extension of scholarship of teaching and SoE to be an extension of scholarship of application. These arguments provide concrete representations of scholarship, something that Boyer did not provide, and <b>this</b> <b>helps</b> <b>people</b> recognize the significance {{of teaching and learning}} or service and outreach. SoTL and SoE programs are useful in helping convince people that the work of teaching and learning should be evaluated. Because the call for accountability is strong today and certain specialized appointees typically focus their energies on only one of the traditionally integrated faculty functions, administrators and scholars are likely to welcome new types of scholarship. This specific and concrete concept has succeeded in appropriately evaluating work that Boyer had earmarked for evaluation. However, this concept of scholarship contains a weakness that disregards Boyer's principles. If one sees SoTL and SoE as merely developmental ideas of the scholarship of teaching and the scholarship of application, and as programs or activities concerning them, the possibility of conflict among research, teaching, and service arises anew. Hence, another conceptual type of scholarship has emerged: the comprehensive type, which advocates regard as a construction of Boyer's four forms of scholarship or a principle for constructing them. In this way, scholars regard SoTL as scholarship that emphasizes teaching and learning and SoE as a form that emphasizes service. This new, comprehensive type of scholarship yields a critical perspective on specific types. Boyer offers the four types of scholarship as a common ground concept that all academic professions must share, and comprehensive scholarship advocates the importance of the types of thinking inherent in those four original types. Advocates of comprehensive scholarship attempt to reconstruct Boyer's four types flexibly, so that American academic professions can foster diversity and share common ground...|$|E
