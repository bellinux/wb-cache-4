5|$|Ariel is {{the fourth}} largest of the Uranian moons, and may have the third {{greatest}} mass. The moon's density is 1.66g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend <b>to</b> <b>sputter</b> water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
5|$|Oberon is {{the second}} largest and most massive of the Uranian moons after Titania, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Oberon's density of 1.63g/cm³, which {{is higher than the}} typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Oberon's trailing hemisphere than on the leading hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on other Uranian moons, where the leading hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to impact gardening (the creation of soil via impacts) of the surface, which is stronger on the leading hemisphere. Meteorite impacts tend <b>to</b> <b>sputter</b> (knock out) ice from the surface, leaving dark non-ice material behind. The dark material itself may have formed as a result of radiation processing of methane clathrates or radiation darkening of other organic compounds.|$|E
5|$|Titania is {{the largest}} and most massive Uranian moon, and the eighth most massive moon in the Solar System. Its density of 1.71 g/cm³, which is much higher than the typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and dense non-ice components; the latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations made in 2001–2005, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are slightly stronger on Titania's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on Oberon, where the trailing hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the magnetosphere of Uranus, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation).

30|$|Lateral {{surface of}} the crater {{consists}} of two parts: its ABCD section is a plane formed due <b>to</b> <b>sputtering</b> of the heterostructure material by the primary ion beam with fixed geometry, while bent lateral surface ADGHCBFE (see Figs.  8 а and 10)—due <b>to</b> <b>sputtering</b> of heterostructure material by the backscattered ions of the primary beam. Inclination angle of the bent lateral surface to {{the plane of the}} crater bottom is not the same in various sites but in any site, it does not exceed 1 °. This secant surface due to its geometrical enlargement is more convenient for study of the closed located thin layers of the heterostructures.|$|R

25|$|In December 1793, the French {{drove the}} {{soldiers}} of Habsburg Austria and Prussia from French soil in the Second Battle of Wissembourg and took positions beyond the eastern frontier. That spring the Army of the Moselle sent heavy reinforcements to northeast France, leaving the Rhine front lightly defended by troops under Jean René Moreaux. Taking advantage of French weakness, the main Prussian assault was aimed at Ambert who could only try to save as many of his troops as possible. Also on 23 May an Austro-Prussian army attacked the Army of the Rhine under Claude Ignace François Michaud but was repulsed at the Battle of Schifferstadt. After losing Kaiserslautern, the two French armies withdrew to positions closer to the frontier. Having expended almost the only initiative they displayed in 1794, the Prussians allowed their offensive <b>to</b> <b>sputter</b> to a halt.|$|E
25|$|OsO4 is {{a widely}} used {{staining}} agent used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide contrast to the image. As a lipid stain, it is also useful in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>sputter</b> coating. It embeds a heavy metal directly into cell membranes, creating a high electron scattering rate {{without the need for}} coating the membrane with a layer of metal, which can obscure details of the cell membrane. In the staining of the plasma membrane, osmium(VIII) oxide binds phospholipid head regions, thus creating contrast with the neighbouring protoplasm (cytoplasm). Additionally, osmium(VIII) oxide is also used for fixing biological samples in conjunction with HgCl2. Its rapid killing abilities are used to quickly kill live specimens such as protozoa. OsO4 stabilizes many proteins by transforming them into gels without destroying structural features. Tissue proteins that are stabilized by OsO4 are not coagulated by alcohols during dehydration. Osmium(VIII) oxide is also used as a stain for lipids in optical microscopy. OsO4 also stains the human cornea (see safety considerations).|$|E
40|$|The plasma-facing (first) mirrors in ITER will {{be subject}} <b>to</b> <b>sputtering</b> and/or {{contamination}} with 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆erates that {{will depend on the}} precise mirror locations. The resulting influence of both these factors 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆ecan reduce the mirror reflectance (R) and worsen the transmitted image quality (IQ). This implies that 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆emonitoring the mirror quality in situ is an actual desire, and the present work is an attempt towards 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆ea solution. The method we propose is able to elucidate the reason for degradation of the mirror 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆ereflectance: sputtering by charge exchange atoms or deposition of contaminated layers. In case of 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆edeposition of contaminants, the mirror can be cleaned in situ, but a rough mirror (due <b>to</b> <b>sputtering)</b> 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆ecannot be used anymore and has to be replaced. To demonstrate the feasibility of the IQ method, 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eit was applied to mirror specimens coated with carbon film in laboratory conditions and to mirrors 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆ecoated with contaminants during exposure in fusion devices (TRIAM- 1 M and Tore Supra), as well as 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eto mirrors of different materials exposed <b>to</b> <b>sputtering</b> by plasma ions in the DSM- 2 plasma stand (in 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eIPP NSC KIPT) ...|$|R

25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} to San Diego {{for a series}} with the division-leading Padres. In the opener, Andre Ethier's two-run pinch hit single gave the Dodgers a 2–0 victory. The Dodgers offense continued <b>to</b> <b>sputter</b> the next day as they fell 6–1 to the Padres. In an effort to bolster the sagging offensive production, the Dodgers on July 28 acquired outfielder Scott Podsednik from the Kansas City Royals for two minor leaguers. However, the new addition went 0 for 3 in his debut and the Padres won a pitching duel 3–2 on a walk-off hit by Scott Hairston {{in the bottom of}} the ninth. The loss dropped the Dodgers seven games behind the Padres in the NL West. The Dodgers {{traveled to}} San Francisco for a series against the Giants. Despite a three-run rally in the ninth inning, the Dodgers lost the opener 6–5. In the second game, Chad Billingsley was again superb, pitching 6 scoreless innings, extending his scoreless innings streak to 21. However, the Dodger offense was again anemic and Jonathan Broxton suffered his fourth blown save of the season, allowing a two-run homer to Pat Burrell as the Dodgers lost 2–1.|$|E
25|$|The team {{returned}} home on May 13 {{to take on}} the Arizona Diamondbacks. Clayton Kershaw struck out 11 and the bullpen survived a shaky ninth inning to hold on for a 4–3 win. The next day, Chad Billingsley allowed only hit and one unearned run in eight innings but the Dodgers still lost 1–0 as the offense was completely shut down. The Dodgers offense continued <b>to</b> <b>sputter</b> on May 15, as Ian Kennedy held them to one run in six innings and the Dodgers lost 4–1. The Milwaukee Brewers came to town for a brief two game series and took the opener from the Dodgers 2–1 as Carlos Gómez robbed Uribe of a home run and Shaun Marcum stifled the Dodgers offense. The Dodgers finally won a game on May 18 as Kuroda and two relievers shut down the Brewers and Matt Kemp's two-run homer in the first provided just enough offense for a 3–0 victory. The San Francisco Giants came to town on May 19 and beat the Dodgers on a three-run home run by Cody Ross in the ninth inning for an 8–5 win. The Dodgers disappointing homestand came to a close when they failed to cash in a basesloaded situation {{in the bottom of the}} ninth and fell 3–1 to the Giants. Nate Schierholtz robbed Jamey Carroll of a potential game-winning hit to clinch the game.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reviews of}} the episode were mixed. After the episode aired, Silber was {{disappointed}} in its resolution, writing, [...] "This episode adeptly combines surrealism {{and a sense of}} impending climax—only <b>to</b> <b>sputter</b> out in disappointment when nothing much gets resolved at the end." [...] He dismissed [...] "Mulder's one-week recovery from his horrifying ordeal" [...] as [...] "facile and unconvincing". He did write that Mulder's dream provided [...] "credible insight into the recesses of his troubled personality". The X-Files researcher and independent reviewer Sarah Stegall awarded the episode a three out of five score after the episode aired. She argued that, in the episode, Mulder [...] "is not a martyr but a victim" [...] which makes him [...] "pitiable, not heroic". Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, gave the episode a positive review, noting that the [...] "Duchovny-penned final scene is exquisite in showcasing the beauty and power of Mulder and Scully's evolving relationship." [...] He deemed Mulder's dream sequences [...] "inspired television" [...] and felt that the episode left itself open to interpretation. In the October 2000 issue of Cinefantastique, writer Paula Vitaris gave the episode a mixed review, awarding it two stars out of four. She criticized the recycling of the [...] "one partner lies comatose while the other runs around trying to find a cure" [...] storyline, but she was more positive towards Mulder's reverie, calling it visually [...] "beautiful".|$|E

2500|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} second half of the season where they left off, {{extending}} their winning streak to five with a 6-4 road victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. Clayton Kershaw struck out eight in seven innings, allowing four unearned runs in the seventh thanks to a Juan Uribe error and a Xavier Nady home run. Juan Rivera welcomed himself to his new teammates by hitting a home run on the first pitch he saw as a Dodger. The streak ended the next day as Hiroki Kuroda's bad luck continued. He allowed a three-run homer to Brandon Allen, and that was all the Diamondbacks needed as they held on for a 3-2 win, despite Matt Kemp's 24th homer of the season. Ted Lilly struck out nine batters in 6 2/3 innings on July 17, but he also gave up two home runs, including one to Diamondbacks pitcher Daniel Hudson. Hudson, meanwhile pitched a complete game, and the only run the Dodgers scored in the 4-1 defeat was on a wild pitch. In the game, Lilly became the first Dodger pitcher since Jeff Weaver in 2005 to allow both 20 homers and 20 steals in a season. The Dodgers next traveled to San Francisco to play the first place Giants. Ryan Vogelsong shut down the Dodgers anemic offense, 5-0, to drop them a season worst 13 1/2 games behind the Giants. It was the Dodgers 10th shutout loss of the season. Hong-Chih Kuo allowed a two-run double to Brandon Belt in the seventh inning to lead the Giants to a 5-3 victory over the Dodgers on July 19. With the offense continuing <b>to</b> <b>sputter,</b> ranking next to last in runs scored in the league, the team fired hitting coach Jeff Pentland on July 20. [...] Assistant hitting coach Dave Hansen was promoted to interim hitting coach for the rest of the season. Clayton Kershaw again snapped the Dodgers losing streak, pitching eight shutout innings while striking out 12 to out duel Giants ace Tim Lincecum on July 20. Dioner Navarro's solo homer into McCovey Cove in the seventh was all the Dodger could muster but it was enough in the 1-0 win.|$|E

[...] Matt Kemp said to reporters after the game, [...] "I think we're all disappointed in ourselves at this moment, but we need to just not make excuses, keep playing the game and turn this thing around." [...] Another terrific pitching performance by Clayton Kershaw snapped the losing streak. He pitched eight shutout innings, while striking out nine in the 6-0 victory. Kershaw became the first Dodger pitcher with nine or more strikeouts in four consecutive starts since Hideo Nomo in 1996 Chad Billingsley matched Kershaw with eight shutout innings on July 8, Rafael Furcal came up with his first RBI since May 29 {{in the bottom of the}} eighth and rookie closer Javy Guerra escaped a bases loaded situation in the ninth as the Dodgers won their second straight shutout, 1-0, against the San Diego Padres. The next day was another pitching duel. Aaron Harang [...] and Rubby De La Rosa both pitched great games, De La Rosa only allowed one hit in his six innings of work and Harang was working on a no-hitter when he was taken out of the game after six. The Dodgers did not record a hit in the game until Juan Uribe doubled with two outs in the bottom of the ninth off Luke Gregerson. Dioner Navarro then singled him home for the winning run in the Dodgers second straight 1-0 victory over the Padres and their third straight shut out win. Andre Ethier hit two home runs on July 10, to lead the Dodgers to a 4-1 victory, their first series sweep of the season and first four-game winning streak of the season.
