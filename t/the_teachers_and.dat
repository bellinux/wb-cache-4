5|$|The {{student council}} {{is a group}} of {{students}} which provides a liaison between <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> students. Meanwhile, the Disciplinary Committee consists of students who are essentially rule enforcers. The third less notable committee is the Extracurricular Activities Federation who ensures that school clubs don't come into conflict with each other. The three committees are closely related and work together to preserve the peace on campus.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} five, Thrud is sent to Crom the Destroyer Orthodox Pagan Infants School, {{where he}} towers above <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> his fellow students. When one of the {{children}} shoots him with a pea shooter, Thrud's reaction is to kill and maim twenty-seven pupils and three teachers, leading to his expulsion from the school. Choosing to return to the wilderness rather than his adoptive parents, Thrud lives alone until, one day, he stumbles across a hidden burial chamber. Finding a small helmet and a large axe, Thrud arms himself. Finding gold and gems, he decides to return to civilisation with his newfound wealth, quickly establishing himself a reputation as a violent warrior.|$|E

30|$|Around {{the same}} time as the microgenetic study, we {{conducted}} a case study of a <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> his students using an early version of Fuzzy Chronicles (Van Eaton et al. 2013). The study explored how <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> students interacted with the representations in a version of Fuzzy Chronicles that included a timeline structure for placing navigation commands. The goal was to understand how the representations affected <b>the</b> <b>teacher's</b> <b>and</b> students' epistemologies of force. We had hoped that <b>the</b> <b>teacher's</b> <b>and</b> students' understanding of force and motion would become more nuanced and that they would connect their intuitive understanding of physics with formal, canonical understanding of Newton's laws. The study highlighted improvements in <b>the</b> <b>teacher's</b> <b>and</b> students' ability to make phenomenological predictions about what would happen next given a configuration of impulses and their ability to manipulate the representations in the game to successfully complete levels, but it also highlighted how <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> students ascribed subjective properties to the representations of forces in the game to reconcile phenomena and relationships in the game with their own intuitive understanding of Newton's laws.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the code switching employed by <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students in English classroom at Palapa English Course in Sumenep Madura. Furthermore, the study is intended to know the codes switched by <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students in English classroom instruction, kinds of code switching used by <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students, <b>and</b> why do <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students used code switching in teaching learning process. In this study the descriptive qualitative research design was used. The subjects {{of this study were}} <b>the</b> English <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> advanced level students at Palapa English Course in Sumenep, Madura. The writer analyzed the natural discourse between <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students in English classroom. There were two instruments in taking the data. They were non participant observation and unstructured interview. There were three results found by the writer. First, both <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students switched code from English to Indonesia or vice versa. Besides, they switched code in the form of words, phrases and sentences. Second, the kinds of code switching used by <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students were: (1) based on the topic changing (situational code switching and metaphorical code switching), (2) based on scope of setting (intrasentential code switching, intersentential code switching, and tag question), (3) based on permanent code switching (permanent code switching and temporary code switching), and (4) based on language used (internal code switching and external code switching). The last result was the reason of the usage of code switching. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> used code switching to clarify the difficult concepts or terms to make the students understand some information or knowledge easily during the classroom instruction; to avoid boring situation; and to maintain conducive communication. Meanwhile, the students used code switching because they lacked ability in using certain English terms to answer and ask questions in the class...|$|R

Several defects in OLPC XO-1 hardware have emerged in the field, and laptop repair is often neglected by students or their families (who are responsible for maintenance) due to the relatively high cost of some components (such as displays).|$|E
25|$|To {{meet the}} {{increasing}} demand of professional engineers for the national development, the National Economic Council of the Government of Pakistan decided to establish The Engineering College, Chittagong on August 28, 1962. The Engineering College, Chittagong, started functioning on December 28, 1968 by admitting 120 students in its first academic session under the faculty of Engineering, University of Chittagong. On 1 July 1986, through a Government Ordinance (No. XXI, 1986) the college was converted into an autonomous institution called Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT), Chittagong. There were three other similar BITs in Khulna, Rajshahi and Dhaka. The President of Bangladesh was the visitor of these institutes. A Board of Governors headed by a Chairman appointed by the President was the policy making and administrative authority which had its head office at Tejgaon, Dhaka. Though the BIT, Chittagong {{was said to be}} an autonomous institution there were various complexity in the administration, control, budget, admission, development and other processes of the institution.
