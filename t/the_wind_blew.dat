Hutchins's first children's work, Rosie's Walk, was named a 1968 ALA Notable Book, and her book <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>Blew</b> received the 1974 Kate Greenaway Medal. She lives in London and has written twenty-five books and five novels.|$|E
5|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{radioactive}} lanthanum were dispersed by the explosions; 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961. In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there. The experiments were generally performed when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> to the north, but occasionally the wind would change {{direction in the}} early morning. In 1949 and 1950 the nuclear fallout from the tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5-10mR/h and the road had to be closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau was {{enthusiastic}} and sent his cycling editor, Victor Breyer, {{to find a}} route. Breyer travelled to Amiens in a Panhard driven by his colleague, Paul Meyan. The following morning Breyer— later deputy organiser of the Tour de France and a leading official of the Union Cycliste Internationale - continued by bike. <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blew,</b> the rain fell and the temperature dropped. Breyer reached Roubaix filthy and exhausted {{after a day of}} riding on cobbles (setts). He swore he would send a telegram to Minart urging him to drop the idea, saying it was dangerous to send a race the way he had just ridden. But that evening a meal and drinks with the team from Roubaix changed his mind.|$|E

5|$|The watchmen {{were quick}} to sound the alarm, but given the fire department's {{relatively}} primitive equipment, {{the fact that the}} streets of Vester Kvarter were too narrow for the fire pumps, the strange dispositions of those fighting the fire, and a series of unlucky events, the fight was nearly hopeless. <b>The</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> from the southwest that evening, carrying the fire along Lille Sankt Clemens Stræde, Store Sankt Clemens Stræde, Vombadstuestræde, Antiquitetsstræde and Hellig-Kors Stræde. By 9:00 p.m the main street of Vestergade was burning on both sides. From here the fire spread along Store Lars Bjørns Stræde, Lille Lars Bjørns Stræde and Studiestræde.|$|E
5|$|Although Gambier had no {{intention}} of risking his fleet in the narrow waters of Basque Roads, he had permitted three more transports to be fitted out as fireships, and at 17:30 these were led into the anchorage by Stopford in Caesar, accompanied by Theseus and several launches quipped to fire Congreve rockets. At 19:40 however Caesar grounded on a shoal and remained stuck there until 22:30, close to Valiant, which had also grounded at low tide. At this point six surviving French ships; Océan, four of the line and the frigate Indienne, remained aground close to the mouth of the Charente, while the remainder of the fleet had escaped upriver to secure anchorages. During the night <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> from the land, rendering a fireship attack impractical, and so the British contented themselves with setting Ville de Varsouvie and Aquilon on fire, both ships determined by John Bligh on Valiant, over Cochrane's objections, to have been damaged beyond repair. During this operation, one of the new fireships was wrecked on a shoal. The weather was so bad that night that the planned attack with the remaining fireships was abandoned as unfeasible.|$|E
5|$|Aware {{that the}} Parliamentarians under Fairfax {{were on their}} way, Hopton {{increased}} {{the attacks on the}} town on 6 May. Further attacks the following day focused {{on the east side of}} the town, first bombarding it with cannon shot, and then storming the earthen redoubt that Blake had established. After some early success in which they captured one of the earthen forts, the attackers were forced back by a combination of musket shot, stones and boiling water. The next day, after yet more attacks made little impact, Hopton staged a battle on the south side of the town between two parties of his own army in an attempt to make Blake believe the Parliamentarian army had arrived. Hopton hoped that Blake would send out some of his own men to support the relieving force, but the feint failed. That evening, at around 7 pm, the Royalist force, which consisted of around 4,200 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, launched an all-out assault against the town. In heavy fighting, the attackers captured two of the earthen forts on the eastern side of town, and broke through the defences. Once inside Blake's outer perimeter, the besieging army discovered that there were Parliamentarian musketeers within every house, which prevented them advancing any further, though they did set fire to buildings, hoping to force the defenders to retreat. The tactic failed when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> the flames back towards the Royalists, halting their attack.|$|E

25|$|The Fulufjället massif {{is mostly}} {{sandstone}}. The sandstone was formed 900 million years ago, when {{this part of}} the Baltic tectonic plate was located near the equator. The climatic conditions there were thus desertic and <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> huge quantities of sand from the dunes into the ocean. These sediments were compacted {{at the bottom of the}} ocean and formed rock, specifically sandstone, in horizontal strata. This structure has been conserved, since it was little affected by the Caledonian orogeny.|$|E

25|$|Two more ships {{entered the}} sound — San Juan de Ragusa (650 tons, 285 men), the other unidentified. San Juan de Ragusa was in {{distress}} and sank — perhaps on striking Dunbinna reef. San Juan de Bautista attempted {{to take advantage}} of an ebb tide and sail south out of the sound, but ended up tacking about on the flood tide to avoid the numerous reefs, before sailing through the north-west passage. After a difficult night, the crew were dismayed to find themselves {{at the mouth of the}} sound once more. But <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> from the south-east, and San Juan de Bautista finally escaped on 25 September and made it home to Spain through a terrible storm.|$|E
25|$|After the 1–3 start, the Bears had an eight-game winning streak, {{which started}} with two home games against Minnesota 28–3 and the Ravens 10–6. On a Week 10 home game, the visiting 49ers {{attempted}} a 52-yard field goal as time expired {{in the first}} half and <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> it to Nathan Vasher who was in the end zone. He returned that missed field goal 108 yards for a touchdown, the longest touchdown play in NFL history then, only to be repeated by Chicago's own Devin Hester almost exactly one year later. The eight-game winning streak came to an end on the road in a cold and snowy fight against the Pittsburgh Steelers (21–9).|$|E
25|$|As a midshipman, Tryon {{was not an}} {{official}} member of the crew, but a supernumerary, available as spare crew for posting to other ships. He narrowly avoided a posting to Imaum, a hulk lying in Port Royal harbour which needed crew, {{which would have been}} a very unpromising start to his career. Although officially posted to that ship, he prevailed upon Lieutenant Cochran (son of Lord Dundonald) to arrange that he would remain on loan to Wellesley. Tryon started to make sketches of the places he visited, which while not very good at the start, improved steadily. In November the ship reached Halifax, where George noted, 'the other day another of our men was murdered here'. Although Wellesley was a sailing ship, it was accompanied by a paddle-wheel steamer: when the wind failed the steamer would tow the sail ship, when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> well the steamer would be towed to save coal.|$|E

25|$|In {{the region}} of Syrmia, people {{believed}} that dragons lived on high mountains and flew {{high in the sky}} shedding many sparks. Beneath them, in dense and terrible clouds, flew gigantic winged serpentine demons called aždaja, which spewed hail on fields. A special man, called an oblačar, would fight against them and their associates. This name is derived from the noun oblak ("cloud"). The oblačar would rush directly beneath the dark clouds, as soon as he noticed that they were gathering above the fields of his village. There he would run to and fro, following the movement of the aždaja, at the same time waving his arms, or holding a stick raised {{in the direction of the}} cloud. He would not stop until he was completely exhausted and drenched. Sometimes he succeeded in preventing hail fall, and other times not, as was the case with an oblačar from Mirkovci. When <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> the clouds away from Mirkovci without a damage to its crops, this man would return from the fields and boast to the villagers of his persistence in warding off the hail bringers despite their ferocity. And when hail fell on the crops, he would humbly state that he did his best, but the adversaries flung themselves upon him with tenfold fierceness. The villagers believed and felt sorry for their oblačar, all drenched and bruised by hail. In autumn, he drove his cart from house to house in Mirkovci, receiving wheat from farmers for his struggle.|$|E

500|$|Having {{mastered}} {{his trade}} repairing chimneys, Dibnah {{became aware of}} the demand for a cost-effective method of demolishing them. He offered to remove them without using explosives, by cutting an ingress {{at the base of the}} chimney—supporting the brickwork with wooden props—and then burning away the props so that the chimney fell, hopefully in the intended direction. Although this was a tried and tested method, it was not without its opponents. On one occasion he was contracted by the local council to fell two chimneys. The contract obliged him to dismantle each by hand, but he decided to fell them by cutting away the base. The first chimney collapsed as planned, but the council terminated his contract and refused to pay. Dibnah contacted the borough engineer and offered to fell the second chimney for no charge, to prove the effectiveness of his technique. He even offered to let the engineer light the fire, but <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>blew</b> so hard that the chimney did not draw the flames and once the props had been burnt through, it remained standing. Dibnah resorted to using a hydraulic jack to apply extra pressure to the intact side of the base and the chimney eventually fell. He later told the engineer that [...] "it was all about fine balancing and counteracting high wind forces." [...] He almost lost his life in 1997, when a concrete chimney he had been asked to fell on Canvey Island began to collapse before the felling team had finished preparing the base. As the team ran from the chimney, Dibnah tripped and fell and was greeted by the sight of 2,500 tonnes of concrete leaning toward him, but fortunately the chimney righted itself and then fell in the opposite direction. He felled his last chimney in Royton, in May 2004.|$|E
