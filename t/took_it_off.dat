Although {{he did not}} speak {{to her at the}} time, he later saw Julia again in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Alf, who was dressed in a bowler hat and holding a cigarette holder, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. The 14-year-old Julia said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old replied that Julia looked [...] "lovely", and sat down next to her. Julia asked him to take off his hat, so he promptly <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and threw it straight into the lake.|$|E
500|$|... "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] {{is among}} Dylan's most celebrated compositions. In his sleeve notes for The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991, John Bauldie writes {{that it was}} Pete Seeger who first {{identified}} the melody of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] as Dylan's adaptation of the old Negro spiritual [...] "No More Auction Block". According to Alan Lomax's The Folk Songs of North America, the song originated in Canada and was sung by former slaves who fled there after Britain abolished slavery in 1833. In 1978, Dylan acknowledged the source when he told journalist Marc Rowland: [...] "'Blowin' in the Wind' {{has always been a}} spiritual. I <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> a song called 'No More Auction Block'—that's a spiritual and 'Blowin' in the Wind' follows the same feeling." [...] Dylan's performance of [...] "No More Auction Block" [...] was recorded at the Gaslight Cafe in October 1962, and appeared on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991.|$|E

500|$|Since {{completing}} {{the purchase of}} the club, Ashley has announced that he planned to sell the club on three different occasions. The first occurred after fan protests over the resignation of Kevin Keegan on 14 September 2008, when Ashley stated, [...] "I have listened to you. You want me out. That is what I am now trying to do." [...] However, he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the market on 28 December 2008 after being unable to find a buyer. On 31 May 2009, it was reported that Ashley was attempting to sell the club again. On 8 June 2009, Ashley confirmed that the club was up for sale at an asking price of £100million. By the end of August 2009, the club was back off the market. On 16 October 2017, Newcastle United announced that owner Mike Ashley had once again put the club up for sale, reporting that he hoped that a deal could be concluded by Christmas 2017.|$|E
500|$|In the US and Canada, {{the cover}} {{did not have}} any logo, but in the European nations, they were sold with Madonna's name and album title on the cover. Heiden {{explained}} in an interview with Aperture magazine that they thought it would be [...] "cool" [...] to use a shrink wrap on the US covers, so that when one <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> there would only be the photo of Madonna. For the European nations, Warner felt that the name was needed on the cover, as {{they did not want to}} take chance with Madonna's popularity there. The back sleeve and the booklet inside featured the song titles in Heiden's own handwriting. About cropping the image for the cassette and the vinyl versions, Heiden said: [...] "I think the image became more interesting cropped into a square—and at that time we always started with the album cover configuration. It was like she was floating—her clothing was not visible. She took on the appearance of a marble statue—Goddess like. In the vertical cropping you see her leather jacket and the wall, and it becomes more typical, editorial, earthly." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a year at}} Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi {{was finally}} {{enrolled}} in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué. After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14, Messi became {{an integral part of}} the [...] "Baby Dream Team", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E
500|$|Underbelly began airing in New Zealand on TV3 on Sunday at 9:30pm, but {{the network}} put the [...] series on hiatus after three episodes {{because it was}} [...] "not {{performing}} as expected in the time slot". Due to a public outcry, TV3 reversed their decision 48hours later, saying it was [...] "bowing to the pressure of angry fans". TV3 reinstated the series in its old timeslot, but rescheduled it to 11:15pm on Tuesday evenings just weeks later. TV3 senior publicist Nicole Wood said the show had failed to win new viewers in the Sunday slot, {{and even though they}} were [...] "inundated with fans" [...] when they <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> air, it [...] "still didn't rate" [...] on its second showing. The series was brought back to primetime in July 2009, after the sequel series performed well in New Zealand. Beginning with episode 1, the series is currently playing every Thursday at 9:30pm. In April 2008, the Nine Network signed an international distribution deal with Fox International Channels and Portman Film & Television. The series will be broadcast in Scandinavia, Canada, France, the UK, Italy (Rai 4), Balkans, Korea, Pan-Asia, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Turkey and Germany. Gyngell said, [...] "to say we are pleased is an understatement– we are delighted that the series will gain international audiences and global recognition". Scottish commercial broadcaster STV have signed up to broadcast the series. Series 3 is now broadcasting after the good reception of the first two series.|$|E
500|$|... "Circus" [...] was {{performed}} on December 2, 2008 at American morning talk show Good Morning America, along with [...] "Womanizer". She wore a midriff-baring shirt, leather pants, a ringmaster jacket and a top hat. [...] "Circus" [...] was a major part on The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), as the opening number of the show. The costumes of the performance were selected to show a metamorphosis. The show began with a video introduction featuring Perez Hilton as Queen Elizabeth I, welcoming the audience to the circus. In {{the middle of the}} video, the cylinder screen surrounding the stage started to rise, while Spears appeared on the video and shot Hilton with a crossbow, causing him to fall backwards onto the floor. As the video ended, Spears started to descend from the ceiling on a suspended platform, wearing a cheetah headdress, a ringmaster jacket, black shorts, high-heeled boots and carrying a whip. The headdress represented an animal. When she reached the stage, she <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> to represent both a ringmaster and a lion tamer and [...] "Circus" [...] started. It featured acrobats taking the stage and spinning on giant rings in the air. The performance ended with Spears taking off her ringleader jacket to reveal a Swarovski-crystal corset, representing a slave. She then ran {{into the center of the}} main stage, surrounded by jets of smoke, to enter a golden cage and perform [...] "Piece of Me". People writer Chuck Arnold wrote that Spears, [...] "descending from above in a red ringmaster-meets-dominatrix outfit" [...] to sing the song, [...] "showed that her body was tight, even if her dancing always wasn't." [...] James Montgomery of MTV considered both [...] "Circus" [...] and [...] "Radar" [...] performances [...] "great". Spears included the song on her current residency show in Las Vegas, [...] For the performance, Spears appears from the back of the stage, in the center of a fiery ring, resembling a circus showgirl.|$|E
