Eno selected them on the basis that he thought they were incompatible with each other musically. He stated that he [...] "got them together merely because I wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> when you combine different identities like that and allow them to compete... is organized with the knowledge that there might be accidents, accidents which will be more interesting than what I had intended".|$|E

She commented, [...] "My music is for the time when people want to turn out the lights, listen and escape into another world ... to dream places ... to little magical places in which the listener can participate and become involved." [...] Regarding a potential audience, Hubbard said, [...] "My music is for intelligent listeners, who don't mind if I change chords, and are willing <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> next." [...] Explaining why written text did not accompany the songs, Hubbard said, [...] "I wrote lots of poetry.

Scott Alisoglu of Blabbermouth.net summarized his review claiming the album is [...] "one tough son of a bitch that may still have you humming melodies long after you've ejected the disc."

Delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio (Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where {{four of the six}} team members were wearing hats). Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy, as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: [...] "What if Johnny Knoxville had powers? What would he do with it?". Harper considered Delsin [...] "full of reckless abandon", the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens.</b> Fox considered Delsin [...] "flawed in a way I think a lot of us can relate to", trying {{to live up to his}} successful brother Reggie. He called the game's story a [...] "hero's journey".|$|E
500|$|Den of Geek {{viewed the}} episode positively, observing that in {{contrast}} to the previous installment, [...] "Ability" [...] "progresses the main plot arc in a substantial way... I’m now really interested <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> next, whereas last week I wasn’t that bothered." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler was a little more critical and rated the episode 7.8/10. He noted that though the ending with Walter [...] "was as good as you could ask for" [...] and enjoyed David Robert Jones as a villain, the episode had a [...] "number of rough patches," [...] as the middle was [...] "paced slowly" [...] and lacking in suspense, Peter's [...] "handiness was again reduced to ...'that guy with connections'", and the audience was [...] "once again subjected to the torture that is Sanford Harris". After describing the Olivia-Peter scene near the end as [...] "tense and cleverly written," [...] Isler concluded his review by noting references to The X-Files and hoping Jones would appear again soon.|$|E

The killer {{apparently}} also has some psychic ability - the postmark is dated before Bruckman joined the murder investigation. Bruckman describes Mulder's death as the killer sees it: getting his throat slit by the killer after stepping in a pie in a kitchen. However Bruckman tells Mulder he's not able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> afterwards.

500|$|The episode also {{marks the}} return of American actress Megan Dodds, who first {{appeared}} {{in a handful of}} scenes in the first episode of the first series. The producers enjoyed the actress' company, and wanted her to return where the character would appear more often and developed throughout the second series. Jenny Agutter returns as Tessa Philips; it allows the audience <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to her since her sacking in the first series finale. The episode introduces new regular character Ruth Evershed, played by Nicola Walker. The producers needed another [...] "interesting, strong" [...] member of the team following Tessa's departure. The character also came from GCHQ in the series; the producers were aware that the organisation employs 70,000 people, and the producers did not want to ignore this aspect of British intelligence gathering. Describing Walker's casting, producer Jane Featherstone recalled [...] "Nicola is extraordinary in it. I think she's completely brilliant. And she's developed that and I think once Nicola became that role that writers had just loved writing for that part, and she's really made it her own." [...] The character was created by Brenton. Her introduction depicted her as clumsy, mirroring the writer.|$|E
500|$|... "Lose Yourself" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most television critics. James Poniewozik of Time has mixed {{reactions to the}} episode. He was critical of the plot arc between Grey and Chase, [...] harshly criticizing Grey's acting and expressing that [...] " [...] didn't think that Adrian Grenier had completely sold Vince’s downward spiral." [...] He continued: [...] "There’s something half-jokey about his manner that makes me think he’s about to break up laughing, as in a blooper reel." [...] In contrast, Poniewozik felt that [...] "for {{the first time in}} a while, I’m really interested <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> on Entourage next." [...] Dan Philips of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. Philips praised [...] "Lose Yourself", opining that it was an [...] "excellent, extremely entertaining climax to this season's two main plot lines." [...] He added, [...] "Even though the episode never got around to providing any resolution, the overall journey was engaging enough to make its cliffhanger feel less like a cheap trick to get us to tune in for season eight." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Josh Wagler of MTV, who praised Grenier's performance, opining that it was his best performance to date. The A.V. Club writer Kyle Ryan gave the episode a 'B-' grade. Ryan wrote, [...] "The last episode teed up tonight’s many confrontations [...] For a show that has specialized in spinning its wheels, these were surprisingly high stakes." [...] He was critical with the development of Vincent Chase, as well as his storyline with Sasha Grey, commenting that [...] "Vincent and his coterie just aren’t that interesting." ...|$|E

Metcalfe believed that it was easy for Mercedes to lie; [...] "hence why she does it so much and so well!" [...] Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry if she needed to, [...] "especially if it will benefit her". Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to hate her character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, [...] "I hope I've done a good job and people still feel sorry for her". She said that [...] "the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of tweets saying, 'I feel so sorry for Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee is being a bitch'". Metcalfe said that she was surprised by the fans' strong reaction. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick also said that Mercedes [...] "gets away with blue murder [...] and yet there's so much love for that character". Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Mercedes would get her comeuppance for framing Mitzeee, saying: [...] "there most definitely will be a comeuppance.

2500|$|Originally {{published}} as The Secret Ascension by Tor Books in 1987 (but subsequently reprinted with the author's preferred title), {{this work is}} an homage to writer Philip K. Dick, a pastiche of his style, and includes an alternate reality version of Dick as a character. [...] The novel {{is set in a}} world in which Richard Milrose Nixon, in his fourth term as president, holds fascistic control over America, and the science fiction works of Philip K. Dick remain unpublished, distributed underground as samizdat, while his realist fiction titles are the ones that are celebrated as masterpieces. Author and reviewer Orson Scott Card writes that [...] "the climax is not just an inward epiphany for a character… he world changes in wonderful strange ways, and the audience can read the book passionately, with sweating fingers, eager <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> next, yet reluctant to leave the present moment. Imagine: A writer who is already one of the best, taking risks and finding ways to be better." [...] Card does take Bishop to task for the author's characterization of Richard Nixon, calling it a [...] "caricature" [...] and a [...] "stock character of a madman." [...] Locus reviewer Tom Whitmore calls the book [...] "a masterful pastiche" [...] and [...] "…the closest thing to a classic Dick sf novel anyone has ever done." [...] Gerald Jonas in the New York Times writes [...] "Mr. Bishop is a solid, serious writer whose reach (in his previous work) has always seemed to me to exceed his grasp. Here, he catches some of Dick's fire, especially in the early chapters… Then a lot happens very quickly (as in some of Dick's own novels), and the satire, which should hold things together, turns predictable. But…the ending (starring Philip K. Dick) approaches sublimity." [...] The novel was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1989.|$|E
