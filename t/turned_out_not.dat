Szabó’s initial response to {{the article was}} that informing had been an act of bravery intended {{to save the life of}} former classmate Pál Gábor. When this claim <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>not</b> to be true, Szabó admitted that his true motive had been to prevent his own expulsion from the Academy.|$|E
5|$|By December 1943 the {{division}} {{had returned to}} England and begun training for operations in North-West Europe {{under the supervision of}} I Airborne Corps. Although the 1st Airborne Division was not scheduled {{to take part in the}} Normandy landings, a contingency plan, Operation Wasteage, was drawn up whereby {{the division}} would be parachuted in to support any of the five invasion beaches if serious delays were experienced. This plan <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>not</b> to be required.|$|E
5|$|The Einsatzgruppen had {{its origins}} in the ad hoc Einsatzkommando formed by Heydrich {{following}} the Anschluss in Austria in March 1938. Two units of Einsatzgruppen were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>not</b> to be necessary because of the Munich Agreement, the Einsatzgruppen were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens. The Einsatzgruppen also followed Wehrmacht troops and killed potential partisans. Similar groups were used in 1939 for the occupation of Czechoslovakia.|$|E

5|$|The Einsatzgruppen {{were formed}} under the {{direction}} of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich and operated by the Schutzstaffel (SS) before and during World War II. The Einsatzgruppen had its origins in the ad hoc Einsatzkommando formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the Anschluss in Austria in March 1938. Originally part of the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police; SiPo), two units of Einsatzgruppen were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>not</b> to be necessary due to the Munich Agreement, the Einsatzgruppen were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They also secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens. From September 1939, the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Main Security Office; RSHA) had overall command of the Einsatzgruppen.|$|E

25|$|There then arose the {{question}} of where the opera would eventually be presented. Verdi had turned down an offer from Naples, but became concerned about the availability of his preferred Azucena, Rita Gabussi-De Bassini.

25|$|Ancestry.com, {{a company}} {{providing}} DTC DNA tests for genealogy purposes, has reportedly allowed the warrantless search of their database by police investigating a murder.

25|$|On March 7, 2006, a live DVD, Live at the Palladium was released.

25|$|Those to whom {{goods were}} {{delivered}} were often equally dissatisfied. Instructions were sometimes in Spanish or Chinese, {{making it difficult}} to use the product. Some products were shipped with plugs and internal wiring meant for the U.S. market, making them unusable in Britain (in a few cases, the company did provide a power converter, the FTC conceded). Even products usable in Britain <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>not</b> to have been manufactured for sale there, or in the European Union (EU) generally, meaning they were not covered by manufacturers' warranties.|$|E
25|$|In 1744 {{there was}} a riot in Puebla over a minor {{religious}} point. The viceroy, in order to dignify {{his visit to the}} bishop, had ordered the bells rung. The population interpreted this {{as a sign of the}} canonization of a previous bishop, Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, which many people had been campaigning for. When that <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>not</b> to be the case, they rioted. The viceroy ordered the troops of the garrison to suppress the riot, and there were injuries. The viceroy was criticized for this decision.|$|E
25|$|Genealogists {{have also}} disputed Haley's {{research}} and conclusions in Roots. The Gambian griot <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>not</b> to {{be a real}} griot, and the story of Kunta Kinte {{appears to have been a}} case of circular reporting, in which Haley's own words were repeated back to him. None of the written records in Virginia and North Carolina line up with the Roots story until after the Civil War. Some elements of Haley's family story can be found in the written records, but the most likely genealogy would be different from the one described in Roots.|$|E

25|$|Murray {{resisted}} the second demand: {{that if he}} could not meet schedule, he must hire a second, senior editor to work in parallel to him, outside his supervision, on words from elsewhere in the alphabet. Murray did not want to share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience. That <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>not</b> to be so, and Philip Gell of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant Henry Bradley (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the British Museum in London beginning in 1888. In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.|$|E
25|$|Only {{five of the}} ten ships, the Junior N. Van Noy, Madison Jordan Manchester, Glenn Gerald Griswold, Thomas F. Farrel and Robert M. Emery made it to Europe in {{time for}} {{significant}} work. The remaining ships were not operational until 1945. Some of the modifications <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>not</b> to be as useful as anticipated. The distinctive forty ton capacity bow horn in particular was seldom used. Navy salvage units had been operational earlier for heavy lift and the most valuable function of the ships may have been to centralize support, heavy maintenance and facilities for Army Engineers conducting repairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{hoped that}} private shipyards {{would be able}} to build the ships on a fixed-cost basis. This <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>not</b> to be the case; the shipbuilding industry was less enthusiastic than anticipated. Moreover, none of the shipyards being considered for the work had the facilities to build the fast ferries. BC Ferries {{had no choice but to}} do the work itself on a cost-plus basis. It would have to act as project manager and assume the risk of the fast ferries. Catamaran Ferries International (CFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of BC Ferries, was incorporated in March 1996 to carry out the work and construction started later that year.|$|E

25|$|On late Thursday night, {{the police}} {{investigated}} Houser's car, a blue 1995 Lincoln Continental, and found two suspicious objects with wires inside. Fearing that the items {{might be an}} explosive, the police halted the investigation. On the morning of July 24, they called the bomb squad, who blew up its windows and trunk. Similarly, investigators found three objects in the theater that they feared could be explosives and had them examined with a robot. An apartment complex behind the theater was evacuated as a precaution. The objects in the theater and in the car all <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>not</b> to be dangerous. A search of the car later turned up more disguises.|$|E

A letter was received from Jamaica suggesting that Livingston should go in Cole's place, this being agreed to. Further a letter was received from Mr. Aucher Warner offering his services as captain {{in accordance with the}} West Indies Cricket Committee in London. This offer was accepted and Bowring the original captain was to tour as an ordinary member. The team given also excludes P.I. Cox who did eventually take part in the tour.|$|E
25|$|As {{more and}} more of the {{seafloor}} was mapped during the 1950s, the magnetic variations <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>not</b> to be random or isolated occurrences, but instead revealed recognizable patterns. When these magnetic patterns were mapped over a wide region, the ocean floor showed a zebra-like pattern: one stripe with normal polarity and the adjoining stripe with reversed polarity. The overall pattern, defined by these alternating bands of normally and reversely polarized rock, became known as magnetic striping, and was published by Ron G. Mason and co-workers in 1961, who did not find, though, an explanation for these data in terms of sea floor spreading, like Vine, Matthews and Morley a few years later.|$|E
