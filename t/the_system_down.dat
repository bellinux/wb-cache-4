Once it reached mid-ocean, an increasingly northerly steering flow dropped <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>down</b> into the subtropics {{to the east of}} Bermuda, and it maintained decent organization. By 2100UTC on July 24, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Two. In the first advisory on the depression, it was noted that the previous tropical depression was erroneously classified as Tropical Depression Two.|$|E
5|$|The Enforcers and Inspectors start hunting Makishima, who aims {{to destroy}} the society created by the Sibyl System. To do this he causes riots {{in the city to}} draw the police away from the Health and Welfare Ministry's Nona Tower facility, where Sibyl is located. Akane and Kogami stop Makishima's forces while Enforcer Shūsei Kagari follows one of Makishima's allies to the tower where Bureau Chief Joshu Kasei kills Makishima's ally and Kagari to keep the true form of Sibyl a secret. Kasei tells Makishima that Sibyl is a hivemind of {{similarly}} asymptomatic individuals and wishes him to join the system but Makishima escapes. Realizing the truth behind Makishima's escape, Kogami leaves the group to kill him. Akane is later directly contacted by the Sibyl system, which orders her to capture Makishima alive. She agrees to do this on the condition that they withdraw the execution order for Kogami. Learning that Makishima plans to commit bioterrorism to weaken Japan's economy and bring <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>down,</b> the Criminal Investigation Division searches for both Makishima and Kogami. There, Makishima tries killing Ginoza but Masaoka sacrifices his life to save him. Despite Akane's efforts, Kogami kills Makishima and the former's erstwhile comrades never see him again.|$|E

25|$|On January 7, all Russian {{gas flow}} through Ukraine was halted, {{completely}} cutting off supplies to Southeastern Europe, {{much of which}} is completely reliant on Russian gas, and partially {{to other parts of}} Europe. Miller stated that Gazprom had stopped all gas deliveries to Ukraine because Ukraine had closed <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>down,</b> but Naftogaz said it closed down the system because Gazprom had stopped delivering gas. According to an official statement by Gazprom, Ukraine was sabotaging the transit of gas to European countries and had practically declared a gas blockade of Europe. Prime Minister Putin accused Ukraine of blackmail, referring back to the letter Naftogaz sent to Gazprom on December 30 which threatened to confiscate European bound gas if no contract was in place. Ukraine denied the charges and blamed Russia for stopping gas deliveries to Europe. According to the Ukrainian presidential envoy for international energy security, Bohdan Sokolovsky, Ukraine had no technical capability to stop the pumping of Russian gas into its territory. He claimed that all pumping stations through which gas is supplied to Ukraine are located in Russia.|$|E
500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>down</b> and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool.

2500|$|After {{assuming}} {{office in}} 1946, Morrison appointed Adair Watters [...] {{superintendent of the}} New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) {{in an effort to}} eliminate corruption. But tensions developed when Watters moved to suppress gambling, prostitution, and other vice too zealously for Morrison's liking. Watters resigned in February 1949 because of Morrison's political interference with NOPD activities. Throughout most of the 1950s, scandals continued to be revealed concerning the involvement of the NOPD in graft and vice. [...] In 1952, the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans was established as an independent monitor of the NOPD and the Morrison administration's approach to vice. State Police Colonel Francis Grevemberg, later a two-time gubernatorial candidate, led a series of high-profile raids on New Orleans gambling establishments that embarrassed Morrison and the NOPD for its inactivity. Eventually, retired FBI Agent Aaron M. Kohn was sent from Chicago to investigate NOPD involvement in vice. Kohn later recalled:"After about a year, I began to realize something about <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>down</b> here. In Chicago, people were generally {{on one side of the}} fence or the other—honest or crooked. But in Louisiana, there just isn't any fence." [...] He soon complained that Morrison was obstructing his efforts. In 1955, Morrison forced the mayor to ask for Schuering's resignation.|$|E

2500|$|The Iranian {{government}} released {{footage of}} a captured RQ-170 on 8 December. The captured drone {{appeared to be}} largely intact, except for minor damage on its left wing. Dan Goure, {{an analyst at the}} Lexington Institute, stated the largely intact airframe ruled out the possibility of an engine or navigational malfunction: [...] "Either this was a cyber/electronic warfare attack system that brought <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>down</b> or it was a glitch in the command-and-control system". On 8 December, a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Washington Post that the U.S. cannot be certain the drone shown was real because the U.S. does not have access to it, but also stated that [...] "We have no indication that it was brought down by hostile fire." [...] A second senior U.S. military official said that a major question is how the drone could have remained [...] "virtually intact," [...] given the high altitude from which it is thought to have crashed. After examining the video on 8 Dec, US officials confirmed that the drone was genuine, even though some civilians had initially expressed doubt. Bill Sweetman, an author with an interest in military planes, speculated that the Iranians did not shoot down the plane (citing the lack of burn marks, holes, or outward damage) or hack into the system, postulating that a system failure downed the plane, and that the plane could be intact from what is known as a [...] "flat spin" [...] or [...] "falling leaf departure".|$|E
