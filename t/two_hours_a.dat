Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating.

They spend an average of <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day walking and 50minutes eating.|$|E

5|$|Having {{adopted the}} name of Aleister over Edward, in October 1895 Crowley began a three-year course at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was entered for the Moral Science Tripos {{studying}} philosophy. With approval from his personal tutor, he changed to English literature, which was not then {{part of the curriculum}} offered. Crowley spent much of his time at university engaged in his pastimes, becoming president of the chess club and practising the game for <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day; he briefly considered a professional career as a chess player. Crowley also embraced his love of literature and poetry, particularly the works of Richard Francis Burton and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Many of his own poems appeared in student publications such as The Granta, Cambridge Magazine, and Cantab. He continued his mountaineering, going on holiday to the Alps to climb every year from 1894 to 1898, often with his friend Oscar Eckenstein, and in 1897 he made the first ascent of the Mönch without a guide. These feats led to his recognition in the Alpine mountaineering community.|$|E

5|$|The {{members of}} his staff were anxious for the {{president}} to appear to be recovering quickly, and the morning after his operation he saw visitors and signed a piece of legislation. Reagan left the hospital on the 13th day. Initially, he worked <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day in the White House's residential quarters, with meetings held there instead of the Oval Office. Reagan did not lead a Cabinet meeting until day 26, did not leave Washington until day 49, and did not hold a press conference until day 79. Ruge, the Physician to the President, thought recovery was not complete until October. Reagan's plans for the month after the shooting were canceled, including a visit to the Mission Control Center at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in April 1981 during STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle. Vice President Bush instead called the orbiting astronauts during their mission. Reagan would visit Mission Control during STS-2 that November.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} years, Boganda {{was adopted by}} Catholic missionaries. As a boy he {{attended}} the school opened at Mbaiki (the administrative centre for the Lobaye prefecture) by the post's founder, Lieutenant Mayer. From December 1921 to December 1922, he spent <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day with Monsignor Jean-Réné Calloch learning how to read, while spending {{the rest of his}} time performing manual labour. On 24 December, he was received into the church under the name Barthélemy, in honour of one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ who was believed to have worked as Christian missionary in Africa. Father Gabriel Herrau sent Boganda to the Catholic School of Betou and then to the school of the Saint Paul Mission at Bangui, where he completed his primary studies under Mgr Calloch, whom he would consider his spiritual father. The missionaries there, encouraged by his intellectual promise and pious demeanour, helped him continue secondary studies at small seminaries in Brazzaville and Kisantu (under Belgian Jesuits) before he moved on to the great seminary at Yaoundé. On 17 March 1938, fulfilling an ambition he had had since age twelve, he was ordained and became the first Roman Catholic priest native to Oubangui-Chari, as the colony was then called. He ministered at Bangui, Grimari and Bangassou, and in 1939, his bishop denied his request to join the French Army. He was needed at home, as many Frenchmen involved with the church had been recalled to the metropole to fight in World War II, during which he served in a number of missions.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, Ceaușescu {{ordered the}} export {{of much of the}} country's {{agricultural}} and industrial production in order to repay its debts. The resulting domestic shortages made the everyday life of Romanians a fight for survival as food rationing was introduced and heating, gas and electricity blackouts became the rule. During the 1980s, there was a steady decrease in the Romanian population's standard of living, especially in the availability and quality of food and general goods in shops. During this time, all regional radio stations were closed, and television was limited to a single channel broadcasting for only <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day.|$|E

The network, which was named Black Entertainment Television, launched on January 25, 1980. Initially broadcasting for <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> week as a block of programming on Nickelodeon (it would not be until 1983 that BET became a full-fledged channel), the network's lineup consisted of music videos and reruns of popular black sitcoms.|$|E

This is an open-access article {{distributed}} {{under the}} terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Aim: To determine in older hospitalized patients the prevalence of neck of femur (NOF) fractures occurring within <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of <b>a</b> meal and the factors associated with these fractures. Methods: A prospective study was undertaken within the orthopedic unit of a 320 bed general hospital. Consecutive first admissions of patients aged 70 years and over with fragility NOF fractures between March and November 2011 were included. Patients or their careers were interviewed using a standardised questionnaire. Results: 120 patients were recruited. The median age was 84. 0 years. Falls within <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of <b>a</b> meal occurred in 20. 8 % of patients. Independent factors associated with falls occurring within <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of <b>a</b> meal were symptoms of hypotension prior to a fall (OR 5. 2, CI 1. 342 - 20. 129; P= 0. 017) and being in residential care (OR 3. 0, CI 1. 009 - 8. 687; P= 0. 048). Conclusion: Patients who sustained a NOF fracture within <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of <b>a</b> meal were more likely to be from residential care and experience symptoms associated with hypotension before the fall compared with patients who experienced <b>a</b> fall after <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of <b>a</b> meal; identification of the reasons for hypotension and potential management strategies require further investigation...|$|R
