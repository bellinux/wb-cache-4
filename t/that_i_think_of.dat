500|$|Halo 4 audio {{director}} Sotaro Tojima {{began looking}} for the game's composer in 2010. [...] "I had {{a vision for the}} overall Halo 4 music production <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as 'Digital and Organic'," [...] he wrote—"something very much inspired by the game script." [...] This vision led him to explore electronica and dance music to find his chosen sound. Tojima decided on Davidge after a year's search. 343 Industries officially named Davidge as Halo 4s main composer on April 11, 2012; by that point the name of Halo 4s composer had been kept a secret for fifteen months.|$|E

Many of the other production staff were selected from people Whedon had worked with in the past, {{with the exception of the}} director of photography David Boyd, who was the [...] "big find" [...] and who was [...] "full of joy and energy".|$|E
500|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Johnson {{was raised}} as the {{youngest}} of three siblings. Johnson began fighting {{at the age of}} 10, after his father's fatal heart attack. The incident made Johnson want to exert his anger physically. Johnson later said, [...] "I lost something, a huge part of me....Fighting was my way of not dealing with my dad's passing. Now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, of course, it was the wrong thing to do, especially putting all that burden on my mom having to deal with it." [...] Athletic, Johnson was a three-sport varsity athlete at Marquette High School in Chesterfield, Missouri. Johnson later received a full scholarship to play football at Central Methodist University, but transferred after one year to Meramec Community College where {{he was one of the}} top NJCAA wrestlers in the country.|$|E
