5|$|Montague John Druitt (15 August 1857– early December 1888) {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> in the Jack the Ripper murders {{that took}} place in London between August and November 1888.|$|E
5|$|In early May 2012, five alleged {{members of}} the Abergil {{organization}} who were suspected of conspiring {{to commit a crime}} and possessing deadly weapons were arrested in Jerusalem, after police had found a weapons cache inside a storage room in an apartment building in Jerusalem where one of the suspects' parents live. According to <b>the</b> <b>suspects,</b> they followed the advice of Itzhak Abergil to hide weapons in public buildings in order to deflect suspicion from the organization. At the suspects’ homes police discovered signs of violence, including ceramic bulletproof vests with bullet holes in them. The police suspects that the organization was planning a major attack. According to <b>the</b> <b>suspects,</b> they were planning to take revenge on a Jerusalem resident, who owed the organization money.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II issued summonses {{to appear}} for {{all six of}} <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> in the two cases. As with the {{decision}} to authorise the investigation by the Prosecutor, Judge Hans-Peter Kaul dissented and opposed the issuance of summonses.|$|E
50|$|If {{anyone is}} found aiding <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> in any way, such as helping <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> in hiding, or {{providing}} false {{information to the}} police about <b>the</b> <b>suspect,</b> may face legal consequences themselves, even being charged for the same crime as <b>the</b> <b>suspect.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>suspect</b> {{can either}} be of type [...] "criminal" [...] or of type [...] "civilian". The sheriff has only one type. <b>The</b> <b>suspect</b> knows its own type and the Sheriff's type, but the Sheriff does not know <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> type. Thus, there is {{incomplete}} information (because <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> has private information), making it a Bayesian game. There is a probability p that <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> is a criminal, and a probability 1-p that <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> is a civilian; both players are aware of this probability (common prior assumption, which allows us to convert this into a complete game with imperfect information).|$|R
5000|$|Put another way, Article 61 {{outlines}} conditions where consent by <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> is not required, whereas paragraph 8(b) {{suggests that}} consent {{is required in}} the event that the device is unapproved (and known by <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> to be unapproved), and should <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> therefore refuse on this basis, then <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> would not [...] "commit the offence of obstructing a police officer".|$|R
5|$|On September 3, 2005, {{the four}} {{detained}} suspects were released {{by a judge}} despite the attempts of the prosecution {{to keep them in}} custody. <b>The</b> <b>suspects</b> were released on the condition that they remain available to police. On September 14, all restrictions on them were removed by the Combined Appeals Court of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba.|$|E
5|$|Rubber {{bullets and}} stun grenades were used on 9 May to {{disperse}} a violent protest by 300 to 400 people demanding {{the release of}} <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> arrested the previous day. Members of the South African National Defence Force were called in to bring the situation under control. 44 People were arrested for public violence during the protest.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} {{sparked a}} major public discussion on station safety and security, mainly because the station was unstaffed when <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> mugged Ali on the platform. The only security present was CCTV cameras, and the ticket barriers were left open allowing <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> to enter the station freely. Many high-profile politicians spoke {{on the issue of}} station safety and called on rail companies to provide security or staff the station until the last train had left the station. The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone assailed Silverlink, the train company who managed the station, for not providing all-night staffing or security. The new provider of every franchise across the rail network will have to provide staff at all times the station is open.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, {{there were}} {{significant}} differences in responses of participants who saw the white man portrayed as <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> rather than <b>the</b> black man: Participants said <b>the</b> white <b>suspect</b> “probably hurt <b>the</b> victims”. However, when the black man was presented as <b>the</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>the</b> participants said <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> “is probably violent” (Gorham, 2006). Gorham found that participants were more likely to describe the (negative) incident with adjectives, the most abstract description, if <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> was presented as black and therefore outgroup, while using more concrete terms to describe <b>the</b> white (ingroup) <b>suspect.</b>|$|R

Shortly after, Jianfeng, upon receiving a tip-off, found <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> being locked up in his own car's boot. <b>The</b> <b>suspect</b> admits that he had imprisoned and killed six women, but when questioned about why he ended up in his car's boot, <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> claims that he was held captive by a mysterious man who subjected him to the same torture that he had inflicted on his female victims, and forced him to confess to <b>the</b> murders. Jianfeng <b>suspects</b> that someone is secretly sentencing <b>the</b> <b>suspect.</b> Who can it be? ...|$|R
5|$|Holloway's family, however, {{took the}} {{opposite}} approach and criticized the lessening of coverage of her disappearance {{due to a}} shift in news priority when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 23, 2005. The saturation coverage of Holloway's disappearance was finally eclipsed by the hurricane. Beth Twitty and Dave Holloway alleged that Aruba {{took advantage of the}} extensive coverage of Hurricane Katrina to release <b>the</b> <b>suspects,</b> however the deadline for judicial review of Van der Sloot's detention was set long before Katrina.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai police {{department}} originally identified 37 suspects—including two army officers—for their alleged {{involvement in the}} plot. All but two of <b>the</b> <b>suspects,</b> {{many of whom are}} identified only through aliases, are Pakistani. Two more suspects arrested in the United States in October 2009 for other attacks were also found to have been involved in planning the Mumbai attacks. One of these men, Pakistani American David Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani), was found to have made several trips to India before the attacks and gathered video and GPS information on behalf of the plotters.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, {{a passing}} {{motorist}} spotted the fugitives by Interstate 80 and called police. The men fled when authorities {{arrived at the}} scene shortly after, but Bostic was tackled by a state trooper shortly after 6 p.m., while Ellis managed to escape. At 8 a.m. the next morning, Ellis was cornered near I-80 by two police dogs. Both men were extradited to New York from Pennsylvania on July 12. Police brought Timoshenko's handcuffs and used them to apprehend Ellis during his arrest. Police did not release {{the name of the}} driver who assisted <b>the</b> <b>suspects.</b>|$|E

5|$|On October 5, 2008, Amir Sanker and Eitan Gerella, two {{suspected}} {{associates of}} the Abergil crime family, were acquitted of {{a charge of}} grievous bodily harm by a Tel Aviv District Court, instead being convicted of lesser crimes, due to police negligence in collecting evidence. The charge sheet had claimed that <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> had planned to kill Nissim Alperon, brother of crime boss Yaakov Alperon in retaliation for an attack on Itzhak Abergil said {{to be carried out}} by the Alperons five months earlier. On November 2008, Yaakov Alperon was killed in a car blast in Tel Aviv.|$|E
5|$|Sivanandam interrogates Usha, {{who tells}} him {{how she and}} Rajan fell in love. Sivanandam tricks Usha into using a leaky {{fountain}} pen in order to collect her fingerprints. That evening, he and Naidu meet all of <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspectsincluding Ushamust pretend he is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. All <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> shoot him except Usha, who bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth: Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price. Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated. He became a spy selling India's military secrets to Japan. Usha learnt about this and tried unsuccessfully to reform him. She could not stop him and attempted to shoot him. She changed her mind but pulled the trigger accidentally, killing him. After revealing the truth, Usha commits suicide.|$|E

Since this incident Wilders has been under constant security protection because of frequent threats to his life. In September 2007, a Dutch woman was sentenced to a one-year prison term for sending more than 100 threatening emails to Wilders.
