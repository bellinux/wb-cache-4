5|$|Articulographs able <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> {{in three}} {{dimensions}} use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration and ability <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs {{are able to make}} measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does not move off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E

40|$|Consideration {{of world}} {{inequality}} should cause reexamination {{of the key}} concepts underlying the welfare approach <b>to</b> <b>measuring</b> income inequality and its relation <b>to</b> <b>measuring</b> poverty. This reexamination leads to exploration of a new measure that allows poverty and inequality {{to be considered in}} the same framework, incorporates different approaches <b>to</b> <b>measuring</b> inequality, and allows varied expressions of the cost of inequality. Applied to the world distribution of income for 1820 – 1992, the new measure provides different perspectives on the evolution of global inequality...|$|R
