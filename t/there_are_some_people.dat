25|$|The average {{human body}} with a relaxed lungful of air is close to neutral buoyancy. If the air is exhaled, most people will sink in fresh water, and with full lungs, most will float in seawater. The amount of weight {{required}} to provide neutral buoyancy to the naked diver is usually trivial, though <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who require several kilograms of weight to become neutral in seawater due to low average density and large size. This is usually the case with people with {{a large proportion of}} body fat. As the diver is nearly neutral, most ballasting is needed to compensate for the buoyancy of the diver's equipment.|$|E

Opposition and human rights groups later said that the election was tainted by repression, murder, and lack of credible competition. Kagame responded by saying [...] "I see no problems, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who choose to see problems where there are not." [...] The election was largely peaceful, although there was a further grenade attack in Kigali hours after the election commission announced Kagame's victory, injuring about 20 people. Media reports indicated the attack may have been politically motivated and connected to earlier attacks in the same area.|$|E
500|$|The album artwork for Mediocre {{meant to}} emulate the theme of mediocrity. Sariñana elaborated, [...] "The cover is a take {{on the idea that}} women in the ‘40s and ‘50s had to be ‘perfect.’ Perfect hair, perfect clothes, sitting quietly and making perfect meals and {{embroidering}} perfectly. And, ironically, they were all perfect in the same, uninteresting way so that ended up making them all mediocre. That was the idea." [...] Sariñana stressed that she did not intend to produce mediocre content for the album: [...] "It’s {{not to say that the}} material is mediocre, but rather that it’s a message of irony, and I think the public gets that, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> out there who like to poke fun at the title." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2010 Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} a planned spin-off television series, 2013, {{which would have}} been a sequel to the film. 2012 executive producer Mark Gordon told the magazine, [...] "ABC will have an opening in their disaster-related programming after Lost ends, so people would be interested in this topic on a weekly basis. There's hope for the world despite the magnitude of the 2012 disaster as seen in the film.

500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes to show that you never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{to a total}} of 944 theatres, with an extra 66 being added later. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who feel that I ought to be grateful for that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'.

I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, Sanders {{voted in}} favor of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. Sanders said he voted for the bill [...] "because it {{included}} the Violence Against Women Act and the ban on certain assault weapons". He was nevertheless extremely critical of the other parts of the bill. Though he acknowledged that [...] "clearly, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> in our society who are horribly violent, who are deeply sick and sociopathic, and clearly these people must be put behind bars in order to protect society from them", he maintained in his intervention before the House that the government's ill-thought policies played a large part in [...] "dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence". In this same intervention, he argued that the repressive policies introduced by the bill were not addressing the causes of violence, stating that [...] "we can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails".|$|E
2500|$|A November 2010 {{survey by}} the Pew Research Center found that 58% of the U.S. public favored {{allowing}} gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, while less than half as many (27%) were opposed. According to a November 2010 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, 72% of adult Americans favored permitting people who are openly gay or lesbian {{to serve in the}} military, while 23% opposed it. [...] "The main difference between the CNN poll and the Pew poll is in the number of respondents who told pollsters that they didn't have an opinion on this topic – 16 percent in the Pew poll compared to only five percent in the CNN survey", said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. [...] "The two polls report virtually the same number who say they oppose gays serving openly in the military, which suggests that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who favor that change in policy but for some reason were reluctant to admit that to the Pew interviewers. That happens occasionally on topics where moral issues and equal-treatment issues intersect." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Water Babies, a {{fairy tale}} for a land baby by Charles Kingsley (serialised in Macmillan's Magazine 1862–63, {{published}} in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's On the Origin of Species, having [...] "long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species", and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin's theory, with the main scientific participants appearing, including Richard Owen and Huxley. In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Edward Linley Sambourne (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: Dear Grandpater– Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did {{you put it in}} a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day?– Your loving Julian. Huxley wrote back: My dear Julian– I could never make sure about that Water Baby... My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did– <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things.When you grow up I dare say you {{will be one of the}} great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing.|$|E

2500|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> {{associated}} with the Puerto Rico National Guard {{who believe that the}} lineage of the 296th Infantry Regiment should be extended much further back than 1765. Indeed, some claim that there is an unbroken connection between the 296th Infantry and the militias established on the island by Don Juan Ponce de León in 1510. If the Center of Military History had accepted this claim, then it would have created a bit of a paradox: that the oldest unit in the United States Army would be one derived from a former colony of Spain, a country that was one of England’s, and subsequently America's, chief rivals for control of the New World, rather than one derived from the English militia in one of the original thirteen colonies. The event that caused the Center for Military History to reject such an interpretation was the comprehensive reorganization of the island’s militia implemented by Field Marshal Alejandro O'Reilly in 1765. Alejandro O'Reilly was born in Ireland, but spent much of his life as a mercenary in the Spanish army. After being sent to Puerto Rico by the Spanish King to prepare a comprehensive report on the defenses of San Juan, O'Reilly produced a [...] "General Program of Military Reform", which included plans for both improving the island's fortifications and for revamping the local militias. For his efforts he became known as the [...] "father of the Puerto Rico militia". This comprehensive reorganization of the island's militia was judged to constitute a definitive disconnection between the militia units that existed before the reorganization and those that were organized afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Death is {{inevitable}} and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact {{in order to live}} passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, [...] "I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a roof tile happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend." [...] This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. [...] We shall not decide which life fights the good fight most easily, but we all agree that every human being ought to fight the good fight, from which no one is shut out, and yet this is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way. Who, now, is going to decide which life was easier, whether it was the [...] life of those who continually lived with a certain reserve because the thought of death was present to them or the life of those who so abandoned themselves to life that they almost forgot the existence of death? ...|$|E
