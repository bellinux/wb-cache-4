25|$|Stoiber {{has been}} said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> of Germany's {{decision}} to adopt the euro. When the European Commission recommended that Greece be allowed to join the eurozone in 1998, he demanded that the country be barred from adopting the common currency for several years instead. He is a staunch opponent of Turkey's integration into the European Union, claiming that its non-Christian culture would dilute the Union.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{women were}} often {{extremely}} reluctant {{to bring up}} charges of rape: public admission of having been raped was severely damaging to one's social standing, courts tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> of the charges, conviction rates were low, and, {{in the event that}} the accusation could not be proved, the victim could then be accused of committing adultery with the rapist (traditionally a serious offense that could have been punished by mutilation or even death). Certain classes of women, such as prostitutes, were banned from raising accusations of rape altogether.|$|E
500|$|The {{authority}} that Bush had {{as chairman of}} the RDB was much different from the power and influence he enjoyed as director of OSRD and would have enjoyed in the agency he had hoped would be independent of the Executive branch and Congress. He was never happy with the position and resigned {{as chairman of the}} RDB after a year, but remained on the oversight committee. He continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> about rockets and missiles, writing in his 1949 book, Modern Arms and Free Men, that intercontinental ballistic missiles would not be technically feasible [...] "for a long time to come... if ever".|$|E
5000|$|In {{later years}} of the 20th century, {{academic}} analysis tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> increasingly <b>skeptical</b> of the historicity of the early Israelite military campaigns as described in Joshua. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> sure, scholarship remained somewhat divided with some more deferential to the Biblical account.|$|R
50|$|An {{unknown number}} of {{concealed}} impact sites have been discovered. Some have produced uranium, gold or diamonds. Prior <b>to</b> 1991, geologists <b>were</b> <b>skeptical</b> that worthwhile quantities {{of oil and gas}} could be found at such a site.|$|R
50|$|Carroll {{has always}} {{maintained}} {{the opinion that}} people have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>skeptical</b> of religion than they are now. He said in multiple interviews that religion {{is an area that}} skeptics don't target enough, and that pure faith is winning the race against critical thinking.|$|R
500|$|On the Battle of Thermopylae itself, two {{principal}} sources, Herodotus' and Simonides' accounts, survive. In fact, Herodotus' {{account of the}} battle, in Book VII of his Histories, is such an important source that Paul Cartledge wrote: [...] "we either write a history of Thermopylae with , or not at all". Also surviving is an epitome of the account of Ctesias, by the eighth-century Byzantine Photias, though this is [...] "almost worse than useless", missing key events in the battle such as the betrayal of Ephialtes, and the account of Diodorus Siculus in his Universal History. Diodorus' account {{seems to have been}} based on that of Ephorus and contains one significant deviation from Herodotus' account: a supposed night attack against the Persian camp, of which modern scholars have tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical.</b>|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Guardian, Brian Moylan {{described}} Going Clear as [...] "entertaining and dismaying viewing" [...] {{in which}} [...] "the story of Scientology, {{with all its}} strange players, emerges as comedy, rather than horror," [...] but criticised its reliance on {{a small group of}} defectors and the lack of any involvement by the church. He felt that this made the film [...] "a bit one-sided" [...] and that it was [...] "easy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> about some of the more outlandish claims made by former members." [...] Sasha Bronner of the Huffington Post called the film a [...] "shocking and eye-opening" [...] work that would leave those who did not know much about Scientology [...] "spellbound." [...] The BBC's Owen Gleiberman praised it as [...] "the most exciting – and disturbing – work of cinematic non-fiction in a long time" [...] and awarded Going Clear five stars, describing it as having [...] "the scary intensity of a thriller." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} The Films of Luc Besson, Susan Hayward {{considered}} The Fifth Element to be a classic {{story of a}} man [...] "making his break from the tribe, proving his manhood, over-throwing the malevolent forces and killing the chief, finally to reap the rewards of security and marriage". Korben's journey, however, is under threat not only from the Mangalores and Zorg, but also from Leeloo, who relents and helps him only at the last minute, accepting his declaration of love. The love story within The Fifth Element was considered {{to be one of the}} main narratives in the film, and it faces the same deadline as the main storyline. Hayward also considered the issue of environmental damage, in so far as waste and pollution are visible throughout the film. Whereas science fiction films often show a world wherein some new technology or threat either surpasses or fails humanity, The Films of Luc Besson included The Fifth Element amongst the minority of science fiction films that [...] "hold up a mirror" [...] and show humankind as responsible. The film was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> of capitalist consumerism, in so far as the gadgets in Zorg's office make an unhealthy obsession of his lust for technology. The tension between technology and man is treated as a problem requiring a final resolution.|$|E
50|$|Marketing {{material}} {{directed at}} students must overcome several problems: {{they have little}} money; they are a transient population who will soon graduate, cease <b>to</b> <b>be</b> students, and possibly move away; and they tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>skeptical</b> audience critical towards marketing messages and fake attempts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cool.|$|R

5000|$|Roberts {{has urged}} those who {{formulate}} {{public policy and}} the economists who advise them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>skeptical</b> {{of the findings of}} [...] empirical studies, and he views ultra-specific claims by politicians that their promoted policies will produce a certain number of [...] jobs or a certain amount of [...] growth as inherently unreliable.|$|R
2500|$|And {{there are}} a number of reasons <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> of human testimony, also based on experience. If a) testimonies {{conflict}} one another, b) {{there are a}} small number of witnesses, c) the speaker has no integrity, d) the speaker is overly hesitant or bold, or e) the speaker is known to have motives for lying, then the epistemologist has reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> of the speaker's claims.

2500|$|Paglia's {{view that}} rape is sexually {{motivated}} has {{been endorsed by}} evolutionary psychologists Randy Thornhill and Craig T.

50|$|In ancient Greek philosophy, probabilism {{referred}} to the doctrine which gives assistance in ordinary matters <b>to</b> one who <b>is</b> <b>skeptical</b> in respect {{of the possibility of}} real knowledge: it supposes that though knowledge is impossible, a man may rely on strong beliefs in practical affairs. This view was held by the skeptics of the New Academy (see skepticism and Carneades.).|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to the disaster, Mexico city mayor Manuel Camacho Solis ordered the sale and use of fireworks in the city <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made illegal; previously, vendors selling fireworks <b>were</b> required <b>to</b> have a permit, while their use was unregulated. [...] Local reaction <b>to</b> the ban <b>was</b> <b>skeptical,</b> as residents said that illegal fireworks vendors frequently bribed local officials, who then ignored complaints about the situation.|$|R
2500|$|Increasingly, Americans are {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> about whether new health care technologies are better. The tipping point probably {{came with the}} withdrawal of rofecoxib from the US market. Today, the list of drugs and technologies for which new might not be better (and may be even worse) has expanded rapidly: postmenopausal hormone therapy, bare-metal stents, megadose antioxidants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for adolescents, Swan-Ganz catheters, gabapentin for bipolar disorder, erythropoietin for anemia, and {{the list goes on}} ...|$|E
2500|$|UNICEF has {{a policy}} preferring orphanages {{only be used}} as {{temporary}} accommodation for children {{when there is no}} alternative. UNICEF has historically opposed the creation of large-scale, permanent orphanages for children, preferring instead to find children places in their (extended) families and communities, wherever possible. [...] This has led UNICEF <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> of international adoption efforts as a solution to child care problems in developing countries; UNICEF has preferred to see children cared for in their birth countries rather than be adopted by foreign parents.|$|E
2500|$|Fontcuberta {{describes}} himself as [...] "self-taught in photography" [...] and considers himself [...] "a conceptual artist using photography." [...] He states that the propaganda and dictatorship of Spain under Franco in his first 20 years led him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> about authority, which is reflected in his art. His background in communications and advertising led him to contemplate the relationship between photography and truth, and Fontcuberta believes that humor {{is an important component}} of his work. His art has been described as [...] "postmodern." ...|$|E

50|$|By June {{the system}} was working well, {{although}} Bainbridge-Bell proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so <b>skeptical</b> of success that Watt eventually returned him to the RRS and replaced him with Nick Carter. The Tizard Committee visited the site on 15 June to examine they team's progress. Watt secretly arranged for a Vickers Valentia to fly nearby, and years later insisted that he saw the echoes on the display, {{but no one else}} recalls this.|$|R
50|$|When Decker {{mentions}} her suspicions <b>to</b> Ott, Ott <b>is</b> <b>skeptical</b> and dismissive; {{the coroner}} ruled Bobby Clinch's death an accident (the {{result of a}} crash while joyriding) and besides, a murder over fishing <b>is</b> too outlandish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> believed. However, when Ott interviews Bobby's widow, he also discovers clues that Bobby wasn't fishing. Tracking down the junked remains of his boat, Ott discovers signs of sabotage. Unfortunately, at that moment he is tracked down and murdered.|$|R

Jack and Kate Murry {{describe}} themselves as the [...] "squares" [...] of the Murry clan. This changes somewhat when, as teenagers, they are transported to the time immediately preceding the Deluge in Many Waters. In the remaining volumes of the Time Quintet, they are the realists of the family, and tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> about Meg and Charles Wallace's accounts and theories about what is happening. In later life, {{as seen in the}} O'Keefe series of books, particularly A House Like a Lotus, Sandy is an [...] "anti-corporate" [...] lawyer, and Dennys is a neurosurgeon.|$|E
2500|$|I've {{always been}} an atheist; I've {{always been an}} empiricist really. I've never {{believed}} in ghosts or psychics {{or anything like that}} 'cause it's quite simple—you don't have to know much to go, [...] "Really?" [...] Or, to just apply Occam's Razor, to go, [...] "Is it more likely that souls do circus tricks, or more likely that they're talking to dead people? And if the latter, by what process? What do you mean talking to dead people? Aren't their voice boxes rotten? So without a voice box, how do they talk, and by what means?" [...] It doesn't take much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> about that. But really understanding, as I'm still learning, why science is powerful, is a new step towards being boring at dinner parties.|$|E
2500|$|One of Cherniss's most lasting {{influences}} {{has been}} in the debates over the evidence in Aristotle for esoteric interpretations of Plato. Cherniss attacked this evidence directly in his Riddle and broadly aimed to discredit Aristotle's interpretations of Plato in his 1945 book. In the Fifties, however, the so-called , initiated by the German scholars Hans Krämer and Konrad Gaiser, resurrected esoteric interpretations of Plato. The Tübingen School was famously denounced by Gregory Vlastos in a 1963 review that repeatedly cited Cherniss’s earlier work. English-speaking scholars thereafter tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> about esoteric interpretations of Plato. Adherents of the Tübingen School are common in Germany and Italy but in 2012 Nikulin remarked '... the majority of the scholars in the Anglo-American world remain unconvinced that the Tübingen interpretation offered a glimpse into the historical Plato.' ...|$|E

Wedderburn says the disciples indisputably believed Christ was truly raised. Conzelmann dismisses an alleged contradiction between [...] and [...] Hengel believes Acts was written early by Luke as a partial eyewitness, praising Luke’s knowledge of Palestine, and of Jewish customs in Acts 1:12.

2500|$|Over {{the coming}} months, Petrelis led {{a small group}} of activists around the country, {{following}} the candidates to key primary states and successfully inserting the project's issues into the national debate. The project distributed condoms at campaign venues and offices, produced a thirty-second television ad, accusing the candidates of ignoring AIDS, that sparked controversy when WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire, refused to air it because the station objected to the images of same-sex couples kissing, challenged presidential hopeful Ross Perot's promise that his administration would not appoint homosexuals to cabinet posts, and encouraged lesbian and gay voters <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> about then-candidate Bill Clinton. The pressure on Clinton resulted in sixteen AIDS-specific policy promises from the campaign. Ann Northrop, a New York City activist and journalist, later said of Petrelis' efforts, [...] "Michael did a great job putting our issues on the agenda during the campaign." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, as Jaffe himself {{notes in}} his paper, [...] "no one has shown that source theory or another S-matrix based {{approach}} can provide a complete description of QED to all orders." [...] Furthermore, Milonni has shown the necessity of the vacuum field for the formal consistency of QED. In QCD, color confinement has led physicists to abandon the source theory or S-matrix based approach for the strong interactions. The Higgs mechanism, Hawking Radiation and the Unruh effect are also theorized {{to be dependent on}} zero-point vacuum fluctuations, the field contribution being an inseparable parts of these theories. Jaffe continues [...] "Even if one could argue away zero-point contributions to the quantum vacuum energy, the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking remains: condensates [...] that carry energy appear at many energy scales in the Standard Model. So there is good reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>skeptical</b> of attempts to avoid the standard formulation of quantum field theory and the zero-point energies it brings with it." [...] It is difficult to judge the physical reality of infinite zero-point energies that are inherent in field theories, but modern physics does not know any better way to construct gauge-invariant, renormalizable theories than with zero-point energy and they {{would seem to be a}} necessity for any attempt at a unified theory.|$|E
