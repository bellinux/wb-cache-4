40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} obtain a {{comprehensive}} form of mathematical models describing nonlinear phenomena such as HIV infection process and AIDS disease progression, it is efficient to introduce a general class of time-dependent evolution equations {{in such a way}} that the associated nonlinear operator is decomposed into the sum of a differential operator and a perturbation which is nonlinear in general and also satisfies no global continuity condition. An attempt is then made to combine the implicit approach (usually adapted for convective diffusion operators) and explicit approach (more suited to treat continuous-type operators representing various physiological interactions), resulting in a semi-implicit product formula. Decomposing the operators in this way and considering their individual properties, it is seen that approximation–solvability of the original model is verified under suitable conditions. Once appropriate terms are formulated to describe <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> antiretroviral <b>therapy,</b> the time-dependence of the reaction terms appears, and such product formula is useful for generating approximate numerical solutions to the governing equations. With this knowledge, a continuous model for HIV disease progression is formulated and physiological interpretations are provided. The abstract theory is then applied to show existence of unique solutions to the continuous model describing the behavior of the HIV virus in the human body and its reaction to <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> antiretroviral <b>therapy.</b> The product formula suggests appropriate discrete models describing the dynamics of host pathogen interactions with HIV 1 and is applied to perform numerical simulations based on the model of the HIV infection process and disease progression.

40|$|International audienceInherited retinal degenerations are {{blinding}} diseases {{characterized by}} the loss of photoreceptors. Their extreme genetic heterogeneity complicates <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> gene <b>therapy.</b> This has motivated broader strategies for transplantation of healthy retinal pigmented epithelium to protect photoreceptors independently of the gene causing the disease. The limited clinical benefit for visual function reported up to now is mainly due to dedifferentiation of the transplanted cells that undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We have studied this mechanism in vitro and revealed the role of the homeogene OTX 2 in preventing dedifferentiation through the regulation of target genes. We have overexpressed OTX 2 in retinal pigmented epithelial cells before their transplantation in the eye of a model of retinitis pigmentosa carrying a mutation in Mertk, a gene specifically expressed by retinal pigmented epithelial cells. OTX 2 increases significantly the protection of photoreceptors as seen by histological and functional analyses. We observed that the beneficial effect of OTX 2 is non-cell autonomous, and it is at least partly mediated by unidentified trophic factors. Transplantation of OTX 2 -genetically modified cells may by medically effective for other retinal diseases involving the retinal pigmented epithelium in age-related macular degeneration...|$|R

Thus {{as an integral part of}} the genome, they are under influence of important genome based epigenetics regulations, such as DNA methylation, histone methylation and acetylation. Promoter DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation leads to establishment and maintenance of latent state of the HIV- 1 virus and formation of the latent reservoir in the CD 4 + memory T-cells. This process leads to severe problems during HIV- 1 infection <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> antiretroviral <b>therapy</b> (HAART), as the HIV- 1 latent reservoir remains unaffected. Moreover DNA hypermethylation in the promoter of syncytin- 1 directs its transcriptional silencing, which is important in tissue specific regulation of this fusogenic protein. In physiological conditions syncytin- 1 expression is observed only in placental cells, where the DNA methylation of promoter is decreased. Higher expression level of syncytin- 1 was also observed in several other tissues, such as testes, where it is tightly coupled with germ-cells tumors and syncytin- 1 promoter hypomethylation.

Based on an emerging understanding of the anatomy of the ductal system as well as novel techniques to leverage the access accorded by the intraductal approach, researchers are actively exploring how ductal lavage, ductoscopy, and intraductal infusion of therapeutic agents may enhance breast cancer treatment. Both cytologic and molecular diagnostics continue to improve, and work is ongoing to identify the most effective diagnostic biomarkers for DCIS and cancer, although optimal targeting of the diseased duct remains an important consideration.

40|$|PURPOSE: To monitor retinal {{function}} after multiple laser <b>treatments</b> <b>by</b> photodynamic <b>therapy</b> (PDT) {{with the}} multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Five eyes of five subjects with AMD were investigated {{before the first}} and 1 month after each of three PDT treatments. Function was assessed using the cone- and rod-mediated mfERG, high-contrast distance visual acuity, central visual fields and contrast sensitivity. For each subject the local first-order mfERG results before treatment were used as a template and fitted against the local post-treatment results (Matlab, Mathworks). RESULTS: We found transient reduction of the cone- and rod-mediated amplitudes {{between the first and}} second treatments but stable or improved mfERG function in four of five eyes for the cone-mediated mfERG and in all eyes for the rod-mediated mfERG after three treatments. Visual acuities and contrast sensitivities remained stable between treatments in four and two eyes respectively, whereas visual fields showed substantially higher mean defects in two subjects after all treatments. CONCLUSION: As found in previous studies of the cone-mediated mfERG after one PDT treatment, objective function was stabilized after multiple treatments in this case report. Similarly, although poor at baseline, rod-mediated function was not further compromised. Transiently reduced amplitudes after 1 month possibly reflected choroidal hypoperfusion.

Despite efforts to improve <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> {{combination}} <b>therapies</b> (neurosurgery, radio- and chemotherapy), high-grade glioma patients still have a grim prognosis, indicating an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The molecular processes of gliomagenesis are being unraveled, and novel targeted therapeutic strategies to defy high-grade gliomas are emerging. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), in particular the TGF-β 2 isoform, has been identified as a key factor in the progression of malignant gliomas. TGF-β 2, originally described as "glioblastoma-derived T-cell suppressor factor", is associated with the immuno-suppressed status of patients with glioblastoma, and is therefore responsible for loss of tumor immune surveillance. Elevated TGF-β 2 levels in tumors and in the plasma of patients have been associated with advanced disease stage and poor prognosis. Consequently, a targeted strategy to modulate TGF-β 2 signaling is highly promising. The antisense oligonucleotide trabedersen (AP 12009) that specifically blocks TGF-β 2 mRNA will be the main focus of this review. In three phase I/II studies and a randomized, active-controlled dose-finding phase IIb study, trabedersen treatment of high-grade glioma patients with recurrent or refractory tumor disease led to long-lasting tumor responses and so far promising survival data.

Suitable identification methods, based on image warping and model updating from MRI scans (for the internal leg tissues), are developed for retrieving these material properties.
