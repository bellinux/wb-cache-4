Even the television announcers commented on how obvious it was that the fix was in.|$|E
5|$|Mulder finds Scully {{underground}} in Antarctica, {{in a large}} facility containing many {{humans in}} ice-like enclosures. He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges from beneath the ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>is</b> not currently capable of investigating this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} season, Parrish, {{who appears to}} have been fired from <b>the</b> <b>FBI,</b> <b>is</b> working a desk job as an analyst at the CIA while living with Shelby and {{continuing}} her relationship with Ryan, who later becomes her fiancé. Flashbacks reveal that she is working undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit. She is tasked with uncovering a rogue faction of the CIA called the AIC.

Ryan later joins the other recruits at the site, much to Alex's surprise. Some time after her recruitment, Alex has a meeting with Matthew Keyes and Miranda Shaw. It is revealed that she was recruited by the CIA as part of a covert mission to establish any potential threats within the agency. Ryan is also recruited by the agency for the same mission. Owen Hall (Blair Underwood) is confirmed to be the primary CIA instructor for the training site at TheFarm. In addition, Lydia Hall (Tracy Ifeachor) is later revealed to be another trainer on-site.

25|$|The Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) compile {{data from}} over 17,000 law {{enforcement}} agencies across the country.

The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense {{in the case of}} connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape. Since about 93% of the data submitted to <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>is</b> in this format, the UCR stands out as the publication of choice as most states require {{law enforcement agencies}} to submit this data.|$|E
