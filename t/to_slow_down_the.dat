5|$|On Lake Champlain, Benedict Arnold {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of 12 Navy vessels <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> British fleet that was invading New York from Canada. The British fleet did destroy Arnold's fleet, but the U.S. fleet managed <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> British after a two-day battle, known as the Battle of Valcour Island, and managed to slow the progression of the British Army. By mid-1776, a number of ships, ranging {{up to and including}} the thirteen frigates approved by Congress, were under construction, but their effectiveness was limited; they were completely outmatched by the mighty Royal Navy, and nearly all were captured or sunk by 1781.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> French were thus able to escape into the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E

The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in the confirmation of fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced by Clinton and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, but simply needs <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E
5|$|Later {{the same}} month, on October 25, the allies {{made a quick}} push to destroy the bridge going over the Vistula, from Warsaw to Praga, in order <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Swedish troop movements. However, the attack was repulsed {{by a handful of}} men. A month later, on November 28, Sweden and Poland made peace in the Treaty of Warsaw through the Warsaw Confederation which {{increased}} Sweden's position even further. Charles could now march, after having waited more than a year since Augustus was dethroned, against the Russian army under Ogilvy which had already by this time reached Grodno.|$|E
5|$|On Lake Champlain, Benedict Arnold {{supervised}} {{the construction of}} 12 vessels to protect access into Hudson River's uppermost navigable reaches from advancing British forces. A British fleet destroyed Arnold's in the Battle of Valcour Island, but the fleet's presence on the lake managed <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> British progression enough until winter came before they were able capture Fort Ticonderoga.

5|$|Some of this retreat has {{resulted}} in efforts <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> loss of glaciers in the Alps. To retard melting of the glaciers used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the Stubai and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered with plastic.

While covering glaciers with plastic sheeting may prove advantageous to ski resorts on a small scale, this practice is not expected to be economically practical on a much larger scale.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{army had}} been {{advancing}} on the Argentinian capital of Buenos Aires by land, while the Brazilian Army commanded by Caxias planned a supporting attack by sea. On 29 January at the Battle of Alvarez Field the Allied vanguard defeated {{a force of}} 4,000 Argentines led by two colonels which General Ángel Pacheco had sent <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> advance. Pacheco retreated. Two days later, troops under his personal command were defeated at the Battle of Marques Bridge by two allied divisions. On 1 February 1852, the Allied troops encamped approximately nine kilometers from Buenos Aires. The next day a brief skirmish between the vanguards of both armies ended with a retreat by the Argentines.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, William Wilberforce {{showed little}} {{interest}} in women, {{but when he was}} in his late thirties his friend Thomas Babington recommended twenty-year-old Barbara Ann Spooner (1777–1847) as a potential bride. Wilberforce met her two days later on 15 April 1797, and was immediately smitten; following an eight-day whirlwind romance, he proposed. Despite the urgings of friends <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down,</b> <b>the</b> couple married at the Church of St Swithin in Bath, Somerset, on 30 May 1797. They were devoted to each other, and Barbara was very attentive and supportive to Wilberforce in his increasing ill health, though she showed {{little interest in}} his political activities. They had six children in fewer than ten years: William (b. 1798), Barbara (b. 1799), Elizabeth (b. 1801), Robert Isaac Wilberforce (b. 1802), Samuel Wilberforce (b. 1805) and Henry William Wilberforce (b. 1807). Wilberforce was an indulgent and adoring father who revelled in his time at home and at play with his children.|$|E

5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the marbled {{electric}} ray may remain motionless for several days at a time. It is more active at night and spends {{much of the day}} buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the marbled {{electric ray}} has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state for at least five hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E
5|$|During its {{period of}} migration, Neptune {{is thought to}} have {{captured}} a large KBO, Triton, which is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit (it orbits opposite to Neptune's rotation). This suggests that, unlike the large moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, which are thought to have coalesced from rotating discs of material around their young parent planets, Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy: it requires some mechanism <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> object enough to be caught by the larger object's gravity. A possible explanation is that Triton was part of a binary when it encountered Neptune. (Many KBOs are members of binaries. See below.) Ejection of the other member of the binary by Neptune could then explain Triton's capture. Triton is only 14% larger than Pluto, and spectral analysis of both worlds shows that their surfaces are largely composed of similar materials, such as methane and carbon monoxide. All this points to the conclusion that Triton was once a KBO that was captured by Neptune during its outward migration.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Eckoldt was {{allocated}} to Group 2 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserübung. The group's {{task was to}} transport the 138th Mountain Infantry Regiment (138. Gebirgsjäger Regiment) to seize Trondheim together with Admiral Hipper. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. Eckoldts port propeller shaft began to overheat shortly after passing {{the mouth of the}} Elbe River and she had <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> ship managed to repair the problem and joined the main body later in the day. The ship escorted Admiral Hipper as they entered Trondheim Fjord and both ships disembarked their troops once they reached Trondheim harbor. All of the German ships proved to be very low on fuel after their journey and fuel oil was transferred to Eckoldt from Theodor Riedel and Heinemann. Admiral Hipper and Eckoldt attempted to leave on the night of 10 April, but the smaller ship proved to be unable to match Admiral Hippers speed in the heavy seas encountered and was forced to turn back. After some fuel was discovered in Trondheim on 12 April, the ship and Heinemann sailed for Germany two days later.|$|E

40|$|Basic {{models for}} solid {{solution}} and precipitation hardening during creep are presented for the {{austenitic stainless steels}} 25 Cr 20 NiNbN (TP 310 HNbN, HR 3 C, DMV 310 N). The solid solution hardening {{is a result of}} the formation of Cottrell clouds of solutes around the dislocations. In addition <b>to</b> <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> creep, the solutes increase the activation energy for creep. The increase in activation energy corresponds to the maximum binding energy between the solutes and the dislocations. The formation of fine niobium nitrides during service enhances the creep strength. It is found that the nitrides have an exponential size distribution. In the modelling the critical event is the time it takes for a dislocation to climb over a particle. The creep models can accurately describe the observed time and temperature dependence of the creep rupture strength. QC 20130905 </p...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} season, Russell {{scored a}} career-high 18.9 {{points per game}}, accompanied by 23.6 rebounds per game. While his rival Chamberlain had a record-breaking season of 50.4 points per game and a 100-point game, the Celtics became {{the first team to}} win 60 games in a season, and Russell was voted as the NBA's Most Valuable Player. In the post-season, the Celtics met the Philadelphia Warriors of Chamberlain, and Russell did his best <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> 50-points-per-game scoring Warriors center. In the pivotal Game 7, Russell managed to hold Chamberlain to only 22 points (28 below his season average) while scoring 19 himself. The game was tied with two seconds left when Sam Jones sank a clutch shot that won the Celtics the series. In the 1962 NBA Finals, the Celtics met the Los Angeles Lakers of star forward Elgin Baylor and star guard Jerry West. The teams split the first six games, and Game 7 was tied one second before the end of regular time when Lakers guard Rod Hundley faked a shot and instead passed out to Frank Selvy, who missed an open eight-foot last-second shot that would have won L.A. the title. Though the game was tied, Russell had the daunting task of defending against Baylor with little frontline help, as the three best Celtics forwards, Loscutoff, Heinsohn and Tom Sanders, had fouled out. In overtime, Baylor fouled out the fourth forward, Frank Ramsey, so Russell was completely robbed of his usual four-men wing rotation. But Russell and little-used fifth forward Gene Guarilia successfully pressured Baylor into missed shots. Russell finished with a clutch performance, scoring 30 points and tying his own NBA Finals record with 40 rebounds in a 110–107 overtime win.|$|E

50|$|The {{plasticity}} of {{the soil}} {{is a measure of}} its ability to deform without shearing and is to some extent a function of water content. Plastic soils tend to stick to screens and other equipment, and agglomerate into large clumps. In addition <b>to</b> <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> feed rate, plastic soils are difficult to treat. Heating plastic soils requires higher temperatures because of the low surface area to volume ratio and increased moisture content. Also, because plastic soils tend to be very fine-grained, organic compounds tend to be tightly sorbed. Thermal treatment of highly plastic soils requires pretreatment, such as shredding or blending with more friable soils or other amendments (e.g. gypsum).|$|R
