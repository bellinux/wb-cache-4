25|$|During sleep, {{a person}} is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a {{sleeping}} person {{to a person who}} is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. When {{a person is}} asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings. Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{gathered at}} Plymouth, England on 14 September 1585 with Sir Francis Drake {{in command of}} twenty one ships with 1,800 soldiers under Christopher Carleill. Sailing from Plymouth he first attacked Vigo in Spain and held the place for two weeks ransoming supplies. Drake however intended {{this to be a}} diversionary raid where it was hoped to trick the Spanish <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were not heading towards the Caribbean, by doing this he had already made sure his presence was felt at Las Palmas in the Canary islands. After taking on water from the undefended La Gomera island, he continued his voyage, heading south towards the former Portuguese Cape Verde Islands. By virtue of the Iberian Union, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 was in abeyance, and the commencement of war with Spain, Portuguese colonies and ships were now a target for the English.|$|E
25|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the underlying neural mechanisms are outside awareness. Hence, though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory of apparent mental causation acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an illusion of control. This can happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualize him making his shots, they {{felt that they had}} contributed to his success. Other experiments designed to create an illusion of psychokinesis have demonstrated that this depends, to some extent, on the subject's prior belief in psychokinesis.|$|E

500|$|In 2015, Shearsmith {{said that}} he and Pemberton had no {{intention}} to write any further silent episodes, as they would not want viewers <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> had run out of ideas, while Pemberton separately said that the pair had no desire to do what would be an inferior version of [...] "A Quiet Night In".

500|$|The {{origin of}} [...] "guinea" [...] in [...] "guinea pig" [...] {{is harder to}} explain. One {{proposed}} {{explanation is that the}} animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea, leading people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> had originated there. [...] "Guinea" [...] was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's exotic appeal. Another hypothesis suggests the [...] "guinea" [...] in the name is a corruption of [...] "Guiana", an area in South America. A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold {{for the price of a}} guinea coin; this hypothesis is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and William Harvey used the term [...] "Ginny-pig" [...] as early as 1653. Others believe [...] "guinea" [...] may be an alteration of the word [...] (rabbit); guinea pigs were referred to as [...] "pig coneys" [...] in Edward Topsell's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds.|$|E

This trait carries over to Part II, in which she begins acting as a liaison between Sunagakure and Konohagakure to help the two villages work together. In her time in Konohagakure, Temari is often seen walking with Shikamaru Nara, causing other characters <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are dating, although both deny this. In battle, Temari wields a giant iron fan that can create powerful gusts of wind capable of leveling the surrounding landscape. As she is skilled at deducing an opponent's strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins, she typically uses her winds to remove parts of the battlefield that might be advantageous to the enemy. During Part I of the series, Temari is able to use the Summoning Jutsu, in which she can summon a powerful scythe-wielding weasel called [...] In the series epilogue, Temari is revealed to have moved to the Hidden Leaf and married Shikamaru, with whom she has a son, Shikadai.

500|$|In 2002, Spielberg told {{film critic}} Joe Leydon that [...] "People pretend <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> know Stanley Kubrick, and {{think they know}} me, when most of them don't know either of us".

The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film– all the stuff in the house– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." [...] "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've {{done a lot of}} movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of A.I., not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.|$|E

2500|$|The {{gray whale}} is {{distributed}} in an eastern North Pacific (North American) population and a critically endangered western North Pacific (Asian) population. North Atlantic populations were extirpated (perhaps by whaling) on the European coast before AD 500 {{and on the}} American coast around the late 17th to early 18th centuries. However, on May 8, 2010, a sighting of a gray whale was confirmed {{off the coast of}} Israel in the Mediterranean Sea, leading some scientists <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> might be repopulating old breeding grounds that have not been used for centuries. [...] In May and June 2013 a gray whale was sighted off the coast of Namibia – the first confirmed in the Southern Hemisphere. The round-trip journey of one gray whale has set a new record for the longest mammal migration, covering a distance of more than 22,000 kilometres across the Pacific Ocean. Her migration has shown new insight into how endangered species are making drastic changes in their life style.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a former}} kingdom, Sussex {{had a strong}} {{identity}} from this period, which was enhanced by its framework of a long coastline, the South Downs and the wooded Weald to its north. [...] Until at least the 18th century, the poor roads of the Weald tended to isolate Sussex, making the county largely self-supporting. [...] Even into Victorian period, devotees of the county liked <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{were living in a}} land older than England. [...] Culturally, Sussex historically looked in a southerly direction to the sea, rather than northwards to London. [...] This can be deduced from a variety of sources, but perhaps the most striking are the earlier estate maps from the 17th and 18th centuries. [...] Almost all of them place south {{at the top of the}} map, opposite to the standard [...] convention of north-up. [...] The presence of the sea and a long coastline has affected Sussex's relationship with London, making London of considerably less significance to Sussex than it is to Kent or Surrey.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 July, Louth's county {{executive}} committee {{issued a statement}} condemning what it described as [...] "the unsavoury incidents after the match".

Louth accepted this: their official statement referred to the July 2010 R238 traffic collision which occurred on the same day as the final, sympathising with relatives of the eight people killed, and opting to avoid legal action in such a context.
