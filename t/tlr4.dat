25|$|Downregulation of miR-181 family {{contributes}} to aggressive leukemia phenotype through mechanisms {{related to the}} activation pathways of innate immunity mediated by toll-like receptors TLR2, <b>TLR4,</b> TLR7 and TLR8 and interleukin-1β IL1B (humans on chromose 2).|$|E
25|$|Upon its {{initiation}} via {{activation of}} e.g. TLRs by pathogen stimuli miR-155-5p {{functions as a}} post-transcriptional regulator of innate immune signaling pathways. Importantly, miR-155-5p displays a similar responsivenes to pathogen stimuli (e.g. <b>TLR4</b> agonist LPS) as major pro-inflammatory marker mRNAs. Once activated, miR-155-5p suppresses negative regulators of inflammation. These include inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (INPP5D also denoted SHIP1) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), suppression of which promotes cell survival, growth, migration, and anti-pathogen responses. Besides supporting the activation of defense pathways miR-155-5p may also limit {{the strength of the}} resulting NF-κB dependent inflammatory response, suggesting varying functions of miR-155 at different stages of inflammation.|$|E
500|$|A major {{mechanism}} of acne-related skin inflammation is mediated by P. acnes ability to bind and activate {{a class of}} immune system receptors known as toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2 and <b>TLR4.</b> Activation of TLR2 and <b>TLR4</b> by P. acnes leads to increased secretion of [...] IL-1α, IL-8, and TNF-α. Release of these inflammatory signals attracts various immune cells to the hair follicle including neutrophils, macrophages, and Th1 cells. IL-1α stimulates increased skin cell activity and reproduction, which in turn fuels comedo development. Furthermore, sebaceous gland cells produce more antimicrobial peptides, such as HBD1 and HBD2, in response to binding of TLR2 and <b>TLR4.</b>|$|E
50|$|TLRs are {{believed}} to function as dimers. Though most TLRs appear to function as homodimers, TLR2 forms heterodimers with TLR1 or TLR6, each dimer having a different ligand specificity. TLRs may also depend on other co-receptors for full ligand sensitivity, {{such as in the}} case of <b>TLR4's</b> recognition of LPS, which requires MD-2. CD14 and LPS-Binding Protein (LBP) are known to facilitate the presentation of LPS to MD-2.|$|R
2500|$|A 2014 {{study found}} that depriving mice of sleep {{increased}} cancer growth and dampened the immune system's ability to control cancers. [...] The researchers found higher levels of M2 tumor-associated macrophages and <b>TLR4</b> molecules in the sleep deprived mice and proposed this as the mechanism for increased susceptibility of the mice to cancer growth. [...] M2 cells suppress {{the immune system and}} encourage tumour growth. [...] TRL4 molecules are signalling molecules in the activation of the immune system.|$|E
2500|$|The outer {{membrane}} of Leptospira, {{like those}} of most other Gram-negative bacteria, contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS). [...] Differences in the highly immunogenic LPS structure account for the numerous serovars of Leptospira. [...] Consequently, immunity is serovar specific; current leptospiral vaccines, which consist of one or several serovars of Leptospira endemic in the population to be immunized, protect only against the serovars contained in the vaccine preparation. [...] Leptospiral LPS has low endotoxin activity. [...] An unusual feature of leptospiral LPS is that it activates host cells via TLR2 rather than <b>TLR4.</b> [...] The unique structure of the lipid A portion of the LPS molecule may account for this observation. [...] Finally, the LPS O antigen content of L. interrogans differs in an acutely infected versus a chronically infected animal. [...] The role of O antigen changes in the establishment or maintenance of acute or chronic infection, if any, is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|The innate {{immune system}} {{constitutes}} {{the first line of}} defense against invading pathogens and is regarded as the major initiator of inflammatory responses. [...] Its cellular component involves primarily monocyte/macrophages, granulocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs), which are activated upon sensing of conserved pathogen structures (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors ((TLRs)). MIR155HG (i.e. miR-155-5p) expression is greatly enhanced by TLR agonist stimulation of macrophages and dendritic cells. [...] Since microbial lipopolysaccharide (an agonist of <b>TLR4)</b> activates a chain of events that lead to the stimulation of the NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors, it was hypothesized that endotoxin activation of MIR155HG may be mediated by those transcription factors. [...] Indeed, MIR155HG expression was found to be activated in [...] LPS treated murine macrophage cells (i.e. Raw264.7) by an NF-κB-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, [...] H. pylori infection of primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in a NF-κB dependent up-regulation of MIR155HG. In the context of viral infection vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) challenge of murine peritoneal macrophages was reported to result in miR-155-5p over-expression via a retinoic acid-inducible gene I/JNK/NF-κB–dependent pathway. Support for a role of AP-1 in MIR155HG activation comes from studies using stimuli relevant to viral infection such as TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) or interferon beta (IFN-β). [...] Downstream of those stimuli AP-1 seems to play a major role in MIR155HG activation.|$|E
2500|$|Steatohepatitis {{is seen in}} both {{alcoholic}} and non-alcoholic liver disease and {{is the culmination of}} a cascade of events that began with injury. [...] In the case of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, this cascade is initiated by changes in metabolism associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation. In alcoholic hepatitis, chronic excess alcohol use is the culprit. [...] Though the inciting event may differ, the progression of events is similar and begins with accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA) and their breakdown products [...] in the liver cells in a process called steatosis. This initially reversible process overwhelms the hepatocyte's ability to maintain lipid homeostasis leading to a toxic effect [...] as fat molecules accumulate and are broken down in the setting of an oxidative stress response. [...] Overtime, this abnormal lipid deposition triggers the immune system via toll-like receptor 4 (<b>TLR4)</b> resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF that cause liver cell injury and death. [...] These events mark the transition to steatohepatitis and in the setting of chronic injury, fibrosis eventually develops setting up events that lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Microscopically, changes that can be seen include steatosis with large and swollen hepatocytes (ballooning), evidence of cellular injury and cell death (apoptosis, necrosis), evidence of inflammation in particular in zone 3 of the liver, variable degrees of fibrosis and Mallory bodies.|$|E
50|$|<b>TLR4</b> {{originated}} when TLR2 and <b>TLR4</b> diverged about 500 {{million years}} ago {{near the beginning of}} vertebrate evolution. Sequence alignments of human and great ape <b>TLR4</b> exons have demonstrated that not much evolution has occurred in human <b>TLR4</b> since our divergence from our last common ancestor with chimpanzees; human and chimp <b>TLR4</b> exons only differ by three substitutions while humans and baboons are 93.5% similar in the extracellular domain. Notably, humans possess a greater number of early stop codons in <b>TLR4</b> than great apes; in a study of 158 humans worldwide, 0.6% had a nonsense mutation. This suggests that there are weaker evolutionary pressures on the human <b>TLR4</b> than on our primate relatives. The distribution of human <b>TLR4</b> polymorphisms matches the out-of-Africa migration, and {{it is likely that the}} polymorphisms were generated in Africa before migration to other continents.|$|E
50|$|<b>TLR4</b> antagonists {{theoretically}} {{reverse the}} increase in pain and inflammation caused by most <b>TLR4</b> agonists, which include many opiate and opioid drugs.|$|E
50|$|Though caspase-11 {{was thought}} to be {{activated}} only by <b>TLR4,</b> these experiments showed that it was in fact activated by TRIF signaling, mediated by both <b>TLR4</b> and TLR3 stimulation. Caspase-11 can therefore mediate host LPS sensing {{even in the absence of}} <b>TLR4,</b> provided an alternative TRIF-dependent signal (e.g., by TLR3) is provided.|$|E
50|$|<b>TLR4</b> {{expression}} can {{be detected}} on many tumor cells and cell lines. <b>TLR4</b> is capable of activating MAPK and NF-κB pathways, implicating possible direct role of cell-autonomous <b>TLR4</b> signaling in regulation of carcinogenesis, in particular, through increased proliferation of tumor cells, apoptosis inhibition and metastasis. <b>TLR4</b> signaling may also contribute to resistance to paclitaxel chemotherapy in ovary cancer and siRNA therapy in prostate cancer. 63% of breast cancer patients were reported to express <b>TLR4</b> on tumor cells {{and the level of}} expression inversely correlated with the survival. Additionally, low MyD88 expression correlated with decreased metastasis to the lung and decreased CCL2 and CCL5 expression. <b>TLR4</b> expression levels were the highest among TLRs in human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and <b>TLR4</b> knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation and decreased IL-6 and IL-8 levels. On the other hand, <b>TLR4</b> signaling in immune and inflammatory cells of tumor microenvironment may lead to production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, etc.), immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β, etc.) and angiogenic mediators (VEGF, EGF, TGF-β, etc.). These activities may result in further polarization of tumor-associated macrophages, conversion of fibroblasts into tumor-promoting cancer-associated fibroblasts, conversion of dendritic cells into tumor-associated DCs and activation of pro-tumorigenic functions of immature myeloid cells - Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC). TLR signaling has been linked to accumulation and function of MDSC at the site of tumor and it also allows mesenchymal stromal cells to counter NK cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. In HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells LPS increased <b>TLR4</b> levels, cell proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy, and these phenomena could be reversed by <b>TLR4</b> gene knockdown. Similarly, LPS stimulation of human liver cancer cell line H7402 resulted in <b>TLR4</b> upregulation, NF-κB activation, TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 production and increased proliferation that could be reversed by signal transducerand STAT3 inhibition.Besides the well known successful usage of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) in the therapy of bladder cancer there are reports on the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer and cervical cancer with lyophilized streptococcal preparation OK-432 and utilization of TLR4/TLR2 ligands - derivatives of muramyl dipeptide.|$|E
50|$|Morphine causes {{inflammation}} by binding to {{the protein}} lymphocyte antigen 96, which, in turn, causes the protein to bind to Toll-like receptor 4 (<b>TLR4).</b> The morphine-induced <b>TLR4</b> activation attenuates pain suppression by opioids and enhances {{the development of}} opioid tolerance and addiction, drug abuse, and other negative side effects such as respiratory depression and hyperalgesia. Drug candidates that target <b>TLR4</b> may improve opioid-based pain management therapies.|$|E
50|$|Intracellular {{trafficking}} of <b>TLR4</b> {{is dependent}} on the GTPase Rab-11a, and knock down of Rab-11a results in hampered <b>TLR4</b> recruitment to E. coli-containing phagosomes and subsequent reduced signal transduction through the MyD88-independent pathway.|$|E
50|$|LPS is a known {{activator}} of innate immune responses. Extracellular LPS binds {{specifically to}} the cell surface receptor <b>TLR4.</b> LPS binding to <b>TLR4</b> subsequently causes initiation of the MyD88 and TRIF signaling pathways, leading to expression of pro-inflammatory molecules and cytokines. These inflammatory mediators cause host toxic shock and sepsis {{as a result of}} an overactive immune response to LPS. Until recently, <b>TLR4</b> was considered the sole receptor for LPS.|$|E
50|$|High {{levels of}} <b>TLR4</b> {{molecules}} and M2 tumor-associated macrophages {{are associated with}} increased susceptibility to cancer growth in mice deprived of sleep. Mice genetically modified {{so that they could}} not produce <b>TLR4</b> molecules showed normal cancer growth.|$|E
5000|$|Toll-like {{receptor}} 4 {{has been}} shown to be important for the long-term side-effects of opioid analgesic drugs. Various μ-opioid receptor ligands have been tested and found to also possess action as agonists or antagonists of <b>TLR4,</b> with opioid agonists such as morphine being <b>TLR4</b> agonists, while opioid antagonists such as naloxone were found to be <b>TLR4</b> antagonists. Activation of <b>TLR4</b> leads to downstream release of inflammatory modulators including TNF-α and Interleukin-1, and constant low-level release of these modulators is thought to reduce the efficacy of opioid drug treatment with time, and be involved in both the development of tolerance to opioid analgesic drugs, and in the emergence of side-effects such as hyperalgesia and allodynia that can become a problem following extended use of opioid drugs. Drugs that block the action of TNF-α or IL-1β have been shown to increase the analgesic effects of opioids and reduce the development of tolerance and other side-effects, and this has also been demonstrated with drugs that block <b>TLR4</b> itself. Interestingly the response of <b>TLR4</b> to opioid drugs has been found to be enantiomer-independent, so the [...] "unnatural" [...] enantiomers of opioid drugs such as morphine and naloxone, which lack affinity for opioid receptors, still produce the same activity at <b>TLR4</b> as their [...] "normal" [...] enantiomers. This means that the unnatural enantiomers of opioid antagonists, such as (+)-naloxone, can be used to block the <b>TLR4</b> activity of opioid analgesic drugs, while leaving the μ-opioid receptor mediated analgesic activity unaffected.) This may also be the mechanism behind the beneficial effect of ultra-low dose naltrexone on opioid analgesia.|$|E
50|$|Although hyaluronan binds to {{receptor}} CD44, {{there is}} evidence hyaluronan degradation products transduce their inflammatory signal through toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), <b>TLR4,</b> or both TLR2 and <b>TLR4</b> in macrophages and dendritic cells. TLR and hyaluronan {{play a role in}} innate immunity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{key roles}} of {{toll-like}} receptors (TLRs) as mediators of the detection and responses of immune cells to invading pathogens are well known. However, Dr. Mattson recently discovered that neurons also express {{a subset of}} TLRs and that their activation promotes neuronal degeneration in experimental models of stroke and AD [...] He has also provided evidence that toll-like receptors play roles in regulating the processes of neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth, suggesting roles in neuronal plasticity. [...] TLR2 and <b>TLR4</b> levels are increased in cerebral cortical neurons in response to ischemia/reperfusion injury, {{and the amount of}} brain damage and neurological deficits caused by a stroke are significantly less in mice deficient in TLR2 or -4 compared with WT control mice. Mattson found that <b>TLR4</b> expression increases in neurons when exposed to Abeta or the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Neuronal apoptosis triggered by Abeta and HNE is mediated by jun N-terminal kinase (JNK); neurons from <b>TLR4</b> mutant mice exhibit reduced JNK and caspase-3 activation and were protected against apoptosis induced by Abeta and HNE. Levels of <b>TLR4</b> are decreased in inferior parietal cortex tissue specimens from end-stage AD patients compared to aged-matched control subjects, possibly as the result of loss of neurons expressing <b>TLR4.</b> These findings suggest that <b>TLR4</b> signaling increases the vulnerability of neurons to Abeta and oxidative stress in AD, and identify <b>TLR4</b> as a potential therapeutic target for stroke and AD.|$|E
50|$|Upon LPS recognition, {{conformational}} {{changes in}} the <b>TLR4</b> receptors result in recruitment of intracellular TIR-domains containing adaptor molecules. These adaptors {{are associated with the}} <b>TLR4</b> cluster via homophilic interactions between the TIR domains. There are four adaptor proteins involved in two major intracellular signaling pathways.|$|E
50|$|<b>TLR4</b> {{signaling}} {{responds to}} signals by forming a complex using an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR) and an intracellular toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. LPS stimulation induces {{a series of}} interactions with several accessory proteins which form the <b>TLR4</b> complex on the cell surface. LPS recognition is initiated by an LPS binding to an LBP protein. This LPS-LBP complex transfers the LPS to CD14. CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein that binds the LPS-LBP complex and facilitates the transfer of LPS to MD-2 protein, which {{is associated with the}} extracellular domain of <b>TLR4.</b> LPS binding promotes the dimerization of TLR4/MD-2. The conformational changes of the <b>TLR4</b> induce the recruitment of intracellular adaptor proteins containing the TIR domain which is necessary to activate the downstream signaling pathway.|$|E
50|$|However, in 2013 it {{was shown}} that <b>TLR4</b> {{knockout}} mice treated with the TLR3 ligand poly I:C still die of toxic shock induced by LPS treatment. Conversely, it was also found that poly I:C treated <b>TLR4</b> and caspase-11 double knockout mice do not develop toxic shock in response to LPS. These results suggest that <b>TLR4</b> is not the sole LPS receptor but that caspase-11 also responds {{to the presence of}} LPS. Caspase-11 was subsequently shown to be a cytosolic protein that responds solely to intracellular, cytosolic LPS.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, Charles Janeway and Ruslan Medzhitov {{showed that}} a {{toll-like}} receptor now known as <b>TLR4</b> could, when artificially ligated using antibodies, induce the activation of certain genes necessary for initiating an adaptive immune response. TLR 4 function as an LPS sensing receptor was discovered by Bruce A. Beutler and colleagues. These workers used positional cloning to prove that mice that could not respond to LPS had mutations that abolished the function of <b>TLR4.</b> This identified <b>TLR4</b> {{as one of the}} key components of the receptor for LPS.|$|E
50|$|Classically, <b>TLR4</b> {{is said to}} be the {{receptor}} for LPS, however TLR 4 {{has also}} been shown to be activated by other kinds of lipids. Plasmodium falciparum, a parasite known to cause the most common and serious form of malaria that is seen primarily in Africa, produces glycosylphosphatidylinositol, which can activate <b>TLR4.</b> Two SNPs in <b>TLR4</b> are co-expressed with high penetrance in African populations (i.e. TLR-4-Asp299Gly and TLR-4-Thr399Ile). These Polymorphisms are associated with an increase in TLR4-Mediated IL-10 production—an immunomodulator—and a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines. The TLR-4-Asp299Gly point mutation is strongly correlated with an increased infection rate with Plasmodium falciparum. It appears that the mutation prevents <b>TLR4</b> from acting as vigorously against, at least some plasmodial infections. The malaria infection rate and associated morbidity are higher in TLR-4-Asp299Gly group, but mortality appears to be decreased. This may indicate that at least part of the pathogenesis of malaria takes advantage of cytokine production. By reducing the cytokine production via the <b>TLR4</b> mutation, the infection rate may increase, but the number of deaths due to the infection seem to decrease.|$|E

50|$|When LPS is {{released}} upon bacterial cell lysis, the lipid A component is first bound by serum LPS-Binding Protein (LBP) and {{then transferred to}} CD14 (either free CD14 in the serum or bound to the cell surface of macrophages or monocytes).

Monomeric LPS is then transferred to MD-2 pre-complexed with <b>TLR4</b> on macrophages and monocytes. This leads to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, which may lead ultimately to septic shock depending {{on the strength of}} response. Vascular endothelial cells also express <b>TLR4</b> and MD-2 and so respond to LPS directly, as well as via cytokines and nitric oxide.
