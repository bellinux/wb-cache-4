5|$|Droits de l'Homme was irreparably damaged, {{and many}} of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>on</b> board were {{soldiers}} with no training for {{what to do in}} the event of a shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water and desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>on</b> the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>on</b> this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship by the force of the sea.|$|E
5|$|That night, near Waegwan, North Korean {{anti-tank}} fire hit and knocked out two tanks of the 70th Tank Battalion.

African Americans suffered 202 dead and 233 injured, which accounted for 15% of all African-American naval casualties during World War II. Naval personnel worked quickly to contain the fires and to prevent other explosions. Injuries were treated, those seriously injured were hospitalized, and uninjured servicemen were evacuated to nearby stations.|$|E

5|$|Battered, Battleship Division Nine steamed {{into the}} {{anchorage}} of the Grand Fleet {{later that day}} to the tremendous cheering of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>on</b> the assembled British warships.

5|$|In 2010 the Royal British Legion Oldpark/Cavehill {{branch in}} Belfast raised {{money from the}} sale of badges to erect a {{memorial}} to <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> <b>On</b> 28 May 2010, a memorial stone was placed {{at the site of the}} killings on Squire's Hill by the families and former regimental colleagues of the three soldiers.

5|$|Minton {{took his}} {{oath of office}} on May 29, but the court was in recess at the time. He took his seat when it {{returned}} to session on October 7. The court had the highest court load of all the appellate courts in the nation at that time, averaging 40 cases per judge annually. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>on</b> the court were close friends, and Minton developed a particularly close friendship with Judge J.

5|$|On {{the north}} side of London, the rebels {{approached}} Smithfield and Clerkenwell Priory, the headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller which was headed by Hales. The priory was destroyed, along with the nearby manor. Heading west along Fleet Street, the rebels attacked the Temple, a complex of legal buildings and offices owned by the Hospitallers. The contents, books and paperwork were brought out and burned in the street, and the buildings systematically demolished. Meanwhile, John Fordham, the Keeper of the Privy Seal and one of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>on</b> the rebels' execution list, narrowly escaped when the crowds ransacked his accommodation but failed to notice he was still in the building.|$|E

Ledlie's men entered the huge crater instead of going around it, becoming trapped, and were subjected to heavy fire from Confederates around the rim, resulting in high casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} the three {{companies}} of 4-503 were chosen to set out and relieve <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>on</b> Hill 875.

5|$|Until the 20th century, naval weapons {{had a short}} range, so {{camouflage}} was unimportant for ships, and for <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>on</b> board them. Paint schemes {{were selected}} on the basis of ease of maintenance or aesthetics, typically buff upperworks (with polished brass fittings) and white or black hulls. Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, as demonstrated by the Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid shade of gray overall, in the hope that ships would fade into the mist.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} al-Birwa's {{inhabitants}} {{participated in the}} 1936–1939 Arab revolt against British rule and mass Jewish immigration in Palestine. A commander of the revolt for the Nazareth-Tiberias region, Sheikh Yihya Hawash, was from al-Birwa. He was arrested by the British and sentenced to life imprisonment. The British also executed eight residents of al-Birwa {{who had participated in}} the revolt. Other rebel commanders and participants in the revolt from al-Birwa included Asad Atallah, Mahmoud al-Joudi, Saleh Mahmoud Me'ari-Abu Sa'ud, Abd al-Hamid Daher Me'ari, Muhammad al-Hajj Ali, Yusef Taha, Fadil Eid, Yousif Mai and Abbas al-Shattawi. A number of women from al-Birwa participated in the revolt by transporting arms, water and food to rebels positioned among the hills in the vicinity. Elderly refugees from al-Birwa interviewed in 2003–2004 recalled that during the revolt, local rebels set off a mine that hit a British military jeep on a road adjacent to al-Birwa in August 1937, prompting the British to launch punitive measures against the village. In particular, the British authorities gathered men from al-Birwa and forced them to cut cactus plants near Acre and then placed <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>on</b> top of the cactuses.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it was not}} {{immediately}} obvious to <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>on</b> Bellone, the new arrival was Plampin's Powerful, which had arrived in Indian waters on 13 June 1806. Finding no trace of Willaumez, who had elected {{to remain in the}} Atlantic, Plampin briefly anchored at Madras and subsequently cruised off Ceylon. There, following intelligence sent by Pellew, he captured the 20-gun French privateer Henriette near Trincomalee after an 11-hour chase. From information possibly supplied by prisoners removed from Henriette or possibly from a merchant ship sailing from Colombo, Plampin learned of Perroud's operations and had arranged to meet Rattlesnake off the Little Basses Reef. In the hope of luring the privateer into a confrontation, he disguised his large warship to look like an East Indiaman. Perroud rapidly saw through the disguise, and also noticed that while the wind remained strong off the coast, Powerful was further out to sea and appeared becalmed. Realising that his only option was to sail between Powerful and the shore, Perroud turned eastwards, but the wind gradually strengthened for Powerful and by 17:00 the ship of the line was within range of Bellone with her bow chasers.|$|E

5|$|By April 1918, 35 {{infantry}} and two pioneer battalions were being prepared {{to move to}} Palestine. Those battalions with identification numbers from 150 upwards were formed by removing complete companies from experienced regiments then serving in Mesopotamia and forming new battalions. The 2/151st Indian Infantry was one such battalion formed from one company each from the 56th Punjabi Rifles and the 51st, 52nd and 53rd Sikhs. One regiment, the 101st Grenadiers, formed a second battalion by dividing itself into two with two experienced and two new companies in each battalion. The parent battalions also supplied first line transport and experienced officers with war time service. The 3/151st Indian Infantry had the commanding officer, two other British and four Indian officers included in the 198 men transferred from the 38th Dogras. The sepoys transferred were also very experienced. In September 1918 the 2/151st Indian Infantry had to provide an honour guard for Allenby; among <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>on</b> parade were some who had served on five different fronts since 1914, and on eight pre-war campaigns.|$|E
5|$|By February {{the next}} year, {{construction}} had resumed. On 8 April 25men {{working on the}} bridge went on strike. This was of concern due to time dependent concreting being undertaken at that time. As the construction was considered unemployment relief, the constructing authority began to look for men who would do the work in their places. By 13 April, further details had emerged; the number of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>on</b> strike was actually 32, {{and it had been}} caused by the alleged wrongful dismissal of three men who had left for their lunch break early. The strike continued until at least 21 April. Work had resumed by early May, and the bridge was reported as being a little over half completed at that time.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of Mexican {{casualties}} {{range from}} one to three soldiers killed and from three to seven wounded. Approximately 20soldiers escaped. They warned the garrisons at Copano and Refugio of the advancing Texians; those garrisons abandoned their posts and joined the soldiers at Fort Lipantitlán. Milam escorted the remaining Mexican soldiers to Gonzales, where the newly formed Texian Army was located. The Texian Army commander, Stephen F. Austin, later released all of <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> <b>on</b> the condition that they leave Texas and vow to stop fighting Texas residents.
