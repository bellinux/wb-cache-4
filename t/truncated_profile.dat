Scenario 1 (whole profile inversion) in which the whole profile is inverted and analyzed. Scenario 2 (extracted (<b>truncated)</b> <b>profile</b> inversion) in which only the distorted prominent anomaly (marked by arrows in Fig. 6, middle panel) out of the whole profile is inverted. Scenario 2, in this particular case, is probably more realistic (in terms of inverting its data by a single thin-sheet model) as its gravity response can resemble a single thin-sheet model. Scenario 1 is not so realistic (in terms of inverting its data by a single thin-sheet model) as its gravity response subject to inversion has three anomalous signatures that cannot be attributed to or represented by a single thin-sheet model. However, the inversion of scenario 1 has been carried out here solely for the sake of investigative purpose, better understanding and for the full illustration of the developed inversion scheme.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{some questions}} which have arisen {{from the use}} of the Sérsic r 1 /n law in modelling the luminosity profiles of early type galaxies. The first issue deals with the trend between the half-light radius and the structural parameter n. We show that the correlation between these two parameters is not only real, but is a natural consequence from the previous relations found to exist between the modelindependent parameters: total luminosity, effective radius and effective surface brightness. We also define a new galaxy concentration index which is largely independent of the image exposure depth, and monotonically related with n. The second question concerns the curious coincidence between the form of the Fundamental Plane and the coupling between e and re when modelling a light profile. We explain, through a mathematical analysis of the Sérsic law, why the quantity re 0. 7 e appears almost constant for an individual galaxy, regardless of the value of n (over a large range) adopted in the fit to the light profile. Consequently, Fundamental Planes of the form re 0. 7 e ∝σx 0 (for any x, and where σ 0 is the central galaxy velocity dispersion) are insensitive to galaxy structure. Finally, we address the problematic issue of the use of model-dependent galaxy light profile parameters versus model-independent quantities for the half-light radii, mean surface brightness and total galaxy magnitude. The former implicitly assume that the light profile model can be extrapolated to infinity, while the latter quantities, in general, are derived from a signal-to-noise <b>truncated</b> <b>profile.</b> We quantify (mathematically) how these parameters change as one reduces the outer radius of an r 1 /n profile, and reveal how these can vary substantially when n≥ 4...|$|E

40|$|Reducing vehicle weight, {{to improve}} fuel {{efficiency}} and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, {{continues to be}} a key objective in the automotive industry. As a result lightweight materials, such as aluminium alloys, are used increasingly for automotive body structures. Currently, self-piercing riveting (SPR) is a major technology used by manufacturers to join aluminium body structures. However, greater demands on the technology present themselves as ever higher strength alloys are required to be joined. The paper reported here focuses on the quality and performance of joints involving AA 6008 T 61, recently introduced for potential applications in automotive body structures. In order to explore the process boundaries, AA 6008 T 61 was supplied with different yield strength values which were obtained through different heat treatment procedures applied by the material supplier. As it is likely that mixed alloy combinations will be required to be joined, body structural aluminium alloy sheet AA 5754 with different thicknesses was also be used through this project. The results suggested that SPR is capable of joining AA 6008 T 61 as the top and middle layer with proper rivet/die combination. However, when AA 6008 T 61 was used as the bottom layer, improper selection of die profile could lead to severe cracking. A new type of die with a <b>truncated</b> <b>profile</b> was proved to be able to relieve/improve the cracking situation. The severity of cracking on AA 6008 T 61 was dependent on the thickness of the top layer and the strength of the AA 6008 T 61 itself. The results show that thinner top material thickness and/or stronger bottom material strength would produce more and larger cracks on the joint button. With the increasing of top material thickness, joint static strengths will increase, and the influence of bottom material strength on joint strength was not significant...|$|E

O crescimento da traíra no lago Yalca foi determinado através de análises lepidológicas, validadas a partir do incremento marginal.

40|$|Tropical peatlands of Southeast Asia are {{generally}} ombrogenous, dome-shaped landforms on interfluves that exist under constantly high temperatures. Their carbon balance is consequently highly sensitive {{to changes in}} moisture supply and severe moisture deficits may lead to catastrophic shifts in the carbon pools of these peatlands. During the Late Holocene, non-linear-threshold responses seem to have occurred in inland peatlands of southern Borneo where numerous <b>truncated</b> peat <b>profiles</b> were found. These <b>truncated</b> <b>profiles</b> show high carbon accumulation rates of ~ 60 g m- 2 yr- 1 for the Early to Mid Holocene and near surface ages of between 7000 and 4000 yr BP. We propose that lowered sea-levels and reduced June to November precipitation after 4000 yr BP lowered the potential water table mound of interfluvial peat domes, making them extremely sensitive to droughts. An abrupt increase in frequency and intensity of El Niño events after 2000 yr BP ultimately switched the peat domes into carbon dioxide releasing ecosystems that have progressively lost surface peat ever since. We examined this highly responsive behavior from both a paleoecological and a modelling perspective. To improve the near surface age estimates new AMS- 14 C dates were added {{to two of the}} profiles. The influence of lowered sea-levels and precipitation recharge on the elevation of the water-table mounds of the interfluvial peat domes was simulated with the Dupuit equation for groundwater table topography. The influence of changes in moisture supply and lowered base-level on annual peat growth was explored with the Holocene Peat Model (HPM). The HPM model results show that, with an imposed gradual drying that increased decomposition rates, the contemporary peat depth is less than at 4000 yr BP (annual net C release) and apparent accumulation rates dropped from ~ 0. 5 mm yr- 1 to ~ 0. 1 mm yr- 1. Assuming peat loss started 2000 yr BP, annual carbon release from degrading peat domes is between ~ 60 to ~ 110 g C m- 2 yr- 1 and is similar to results from ongoing eddy-covariance CO 2 flux measurements in one of the degrading peat domes. A GIS representation of peat degradation in southern Borneo allowed us to upscale regional carbon losses for the past 2000 years. These losses range from ca. 0. 25 to 0. 5 Tg C yr- 1.

Using BLAST survey data for submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), we find that magnification affects the steep, high flux par t of the counts by about 60 %. The effect becomes much stronger if the intrinsic distribution is signi ficantly steeper than observed. We also consider {{the effect of this}} high-redshift galaxy population on contaminating the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal of massive clusters using the halo model approach. We find that for the majority of clusters expected to be detected with ongoing SZ surveys, there is significant contamination from the Poisson noise due to background SMGs. This contr ibution can be comparable to the SZ increment for typical clusters and can also contaminate the SZ decrement of low mass clusters. Thus SZ observations, especially for the increment part of the SZ spectrum, need to include careful modeling of this irreducible contamination for mass estimation. Lensing further enhances the contamination, especially close to the cores of massive clusters and for very disturbed clusters with large magnification cross-section.

Old stars (≳ 11 Gyr) follow a round distribution well fitted by <b>truncated</b> density <b>profiles.</b> These stars rotate around the projected optical major axis of the galaxy with line-of-sight velocities v_los(r_h) = 16 ± 3 km s^- 1 and a velocity gradient of 2. 06 ± 0. 21 km s^- 1 arcmin^- 1. Intermediate-age stars (≲ 9 Gyr) concentrate in {{the centre of the}} galaxy and form an elongated structure extending along the projected optical major axis. This structure appears to rotate with a velocity gradient of 2. 24 ± 0. 22 km s^- 1 arcmin^- 1, and around the optical minor axis. The centres of rotation and kinetic position angles (PA_ kin) of both populations differ. For intermediate-age stars we obtained PA_ kin = 18 ^∘± 2 ^∘ and for the old ones PA_ kin = 63 ^∘± 3 ^∘ in good agreement with photometric PA measured from isopleths fitted to the photometry. We conclude that the two stellar populations may not be fully relaxed and thus be the result of a merger occurred at redshift z∼ 1. 75. Comment: 17 pages, 17 figures, 6 tables.

40|$|The popular halo model {{predicts that}} the power {{spectrum}} of the galaxy fluctuations is simply {{the sum of the}} large scale linear halo-halo power spectrum and the weighted power spectrum of the halo profile. Previous studies have derived halo parameters from the observed galaxy correlation function. Here we test the halo model directly for self-consistency with a minimal set of theoretical assumptions by utilising the 2 dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2 dFGRS). We derive empirically the halo occupation and galaxy radial distributions in the haloes of the 2 dF Percolation-Inferred Galaxy Group (2 PIGG) catalogue. The mean halo occupation number is found to be well-fitted by a power-law, ~ M^b, at high masses, with b = 1. 05, 0. 88, 0. 99 for red, blue and all galaxies respectively (with 1 -sigma errors of 15 - 19 %). We find that the <b>truncated</b> NFW <b>profile</b> provides a good fit to the galaxy radial distributions, with concentration parameters c= 3. 9, 1. 3, 2. 4 for red, blue and all galaxies respectively (with 1 -sigma errors of 8 - 15 %). Adding the observed linear power spectrum to these results, we compare these empirical predictions of the halo model with the observed correlation functions for these same 2 dF galaxy populations. We conclude that subject to some fine tuning it is an acceptable model for the two-point correlations. Our analysis also explains why the correlation function slope of the red galaxies is steeper than that of the blue galaxies. It is mainly due to the number of red and blue galaxies per halo, rather than the radial distribution within the haloes of the two galaxy species. Comment: 15 pages, 15 figures.

40|$|The far future {{provides}} an excellent laboratory for studying cosmological structures. The eventual dominance of the cosmological constant causes the universe to enter a phase of exponential deSitter expansion during which dark matter halos are allowed to relax without interruptions from mass accretion. Using of suite of N-body simulations evolved to scale factor a = 100 in an LCDM universe, this thesis presents the equilibrium distribution and structure of halos and investigates the importance of mergers in setting the internal halo structure. Using conservation of energy, {{it is possible to}} accurately predict the total amount of mass that will ultimately accrete onto a halo. Once this mass is accreted, the halo quickly reaches a state of dynamical equilibrium. Halos in this equilibrium have a greatly simplified radial phase space profile characterized by a single zero-velocity surface that unambiguously defines the halo edge. The radial density profile for such halos is well fit by an NFW profile inside r 200, but is steeper at larger radii and better fit by a <b>truncated</b> Hernquist <b>profile.</b> In order to study the importance of hierarchical merging in setting the equilibrium structure, I also present results form LWDM-like simulations with initial power spectra that suppress the early formation of small halos. Using these simulations, I present a modified fit to the mass accretion form of Wechsler et al. (2002) that better characterizes halo growth at all epochs. At the end of the simulations, we recover density profiles and phase space structures that are virtually unchanged between the CDM and WDM cosmologies. The only difference in the global halo properties, a systematic concentration shift, can be characterized in terms of the halo formation epoch. We conclude that mass accretion is not the driving process for setting the equilibrium halo structure...|$|R

Nos vales, nas encostas ?ngremes e nas colinas com {{altitude}} entre 20 e 140 m predominam rochas sedimentares e vulc?nicas, e nos plat?s e colinas com altitude entre 200 a 320 m e 140 a 200 ocorrem ?s bauxitas, as crostas ferruginosas e as ferro-alumino-silicosas respectivamente. As bauxitas s?o maci?as e pisol?ticas, as crostas ferruginosas s?o maci?as, vermiformes, pisol?ticas e brech?ides, e as ferro-alumino-silicosas s?o em sua maioria brech?ides e vermiformes, com f?cies pisol?tica subordinada. A bauxita maci?a foi formada a partir de rochas vulc?nicas do Grupo Col?der, enquanto as bauxitas pisol?ticas, as crostas ferruginosas e ferro-alumino-silicosas a partir dos siltitos e arenitos do Grupo Alto Tapaj?s. Tal descrimina??o de origem foi o produto da integra??o de dados de campo e geoqu?mica (raz?es Eu/Eu*, Ce/Ce* e [TiO 2 (%) /Nb (ppm) ]* 1000 vs ETRL). Foram reconhecidos tr?s grupos de associa??es geoqu?micas: 1. dividido no subgrupo que congrega os arenitos e o subgrupo das rochas vulc?nicas e siltitos, ambos marcados pela associa??o entre Ba e Rb que reflete o maior conte?do de feldspatos, micas, caulinita e illita; 2. agrupa as bauxitas e os solos caracterizados pela associa??o entre Al 2 O 3, PF, TiO 2, Th, Ga, Ta, Hf, Zr, Nb, U, Y, Sr e ETR relacionados ao maior conte?do de gibbsita, anat?sio e zirc?o; 3. re?ne a bauxita pisol?tica, crostas ferruginosas e ferro-alumino-silicosas. Neste terceiro grupo, o Fe 2 O 3 est? associado ao V, Pb, Cu, Ag, Sc e As principalmente pela abund?ncia em hematita+goethita. A preserva??o dessas crostas no relevo altamente dissecado e a pouca espessura do solo no sudeste do Amazonas est?, provavelmente ligada ? proximidade dos grandes rios da regi?o como o Aripuan? e Sucunduri afluentes do rio Madeira que devem ter facilitado a eros?o, bem como a neotect?nica que proporcionou a forma??o de perfis truncados e linhas de pedra. This study discusses textural, mineralogical, and geochemical characteristics {{along with}} the topography of the bauxite, Fe-rich, and siliceous Fe-Al duricrusts and soils in the Apu? region between the Aripuan? and Sucunduri rivers, southeast Amazon. Between 20 and 140 masl, sedimentary and volcanic rocks are the dominant units in valleys, cliffs, and hills whereas in the 140 - 200 and 200 - 320 m contours, siliceous Fe-Al and bauxite, and Fe-rich duricrusts are respectively observed in plateaus and hills. Bauxites are massive and pisolitic; Fe-rich duricrusts are massive, pisolitic, vermiform (worm-like corrosion), and locally brecciated; siliceous Fe-Al duricrusts are predominately brecciated and vermiform with subordinate pisolitic facies. Based on Eu/Eu*, Ce/Ce* and [TiO 2 (%) /Nb(ppm) ]* 1000 vs ETRL data, the parent units of the duricrusts were determined as: the Col?der Group's volcanics for the massive bauxite; the Alto Tapaj?s Group's siltstones and sandstones for the pisolitic bauxite, Fe-rich and siliceous Fe-Al duricrusts. Three main groups were identified based on textural and geochemical associations: 1) Ba and Rb association reflecting high contents of feldspar, micas, kaolinite, and illite - sandstone, siltstone, and volcanic subgroups; 2) Al 2 O 3, PF, TiO 2, Th, Ga, Ta, Hf, Zr, Nb, U, Y, Sr e ETR association in soils reflecting high contents of gibbsite, anatase, and zircon - this is the bauxite group (except for B 1 C type); 3) Fe 2 O 3, V, Pb, Cu, Ag, Sc, and As association marked by high contents of hematite and goethite - this is the pisolitic bauxite (B 1 C), Fe-rich, and siliceous Fe-Al duricrusts group. Preservation of the duricrusts in highly dissected topography along with thin soils typical of southeast Amazon is possibly facilitated by proximity to large rivers, such as the Aripuan? and Sucunduri rivers, tributaries to the Madeira River, which promote erosion, and formation of <b>truncated</b> <b>profiles</b> and stone lines due to neotectonics...|$|R
40|$|General {{analytic}} arguments lead us {{to expect}} that in the modified dynamics (MOND) self-gravitating disks are more stable than their like in Newtonian dynamics. We study this question numerically, using a particle-mesh code based on a multi-grid solver for the (nonlinear) MOND field equation. We start with equilibrium distribution functions for MOND disk models having a smoothly <b>truncated,</b> exponential surface-density <b>profiles</b> and a constant Toomre $Q$ parameter. We find that, indeed, disks of a given ``temperature'' are locally more stable in MOND than in Newtonian dynamics. As regards global instability to bar formation, we find that as the mean acceleration in the disk is lowered, {{the stability of the}} disk is increased as we cross from the Newtonian to the MOND regime. The degree of stability levels off deep in the MOND regime, as expected from scaling laws in MOND. For the disk model we use, this maximum degree of stability is similar to the one imparted to a Newtonian disk by a halo three times as massive at five disk scale lengths.

40|$|Excess {{microwave}} emission {{observed in}} the inner Galaxy (inner ~ 1 kpc) is consistent with synchrotron emission from highly relativistic electron-positron pairs produced by dark matter particle annihilation. More conventional sources for this emission, such as free-free (thermal bremsstrahlung), thermal dust, spinning dust, and the softer Galactic synchrotron traced by low-frequency surveys, have been ruled out. The total power {{observed in the}} range 23 < nu < 61 GHz is between 10 ^{ 36 } and 5 x 10 ^{ 36 } erg/s, depending on the method of extrapolation to the Galactic center, where bright foreground emission obscures the signal. The inferred electron energy distribution is diffusion hardened, and is in qualitative agreement with the energy distribution required to explain the gamma ray excess in the inner Galaxy at 1 - 30 GeV as inverse-Compton scattered starlight. We investigate the possibility that this population of electrons is produced by dark matter annihilation of 100 GeV particles, with cross section = 2 x 10 ^{- 26 } cm^ 3 /s, and an 1 /r dark matter mass <b>profile</b> <b>truncated</b> in the inner Galaxy, and find this scenario {{to be consistent with}} current data.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} have constrained {{the orbit}} {{and structure of}} the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), implying a well-constrained pericentric passage about the Milky Way (MW) ~ 50 Myr ago. In this scenario, the LMC's gaseous disk has recently experienced maximal ram pressure stripping, suggesting the current extent of its HI disk directly probes the medium in which it is moving. From the observed stellar and HI distributions of the system we find evidence of a <b>truncated</b> gas <b>profile</b> along the windward ``leading edge' of the LMC disk, despite a far more extended stellar component. We explore the implications of this ram pressure stripping signature, using both analytic prescriptions and full 3 -dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the LMC. Our simulations subject the system to a headwind whose velocity components correspond directly to the recent orbital history of the LMC. We vary the density of this headwind, using a variety of sampled parameters for a Beta-profile for a theoretical MW circumgalactic medium (CGM), comparing the resulting HI morphology directly to observations of the LMC HI and stellar components. This model can match the radial extent of the LMC's leading (windward) edge only in scenarios where the MW CGM density at pericentric passage is n(R = 48. 2 +/- 5 kpc) = 1. 1 (+. 44 /-. 45) x 1 e- 4 cm^- 3. The implied pericentric density proves insensitive to both the broader CGM structure and temperature profile, thus providing a model-independent constraint on the local gas density. This result imposes an important constraint on the density profile of the MW's CGM, and thus the total baryon content of the MW. From our work, assuming a Beta-profile valid to ~ Rvir, we infer a total diffuse CGM mass M(300 kpc) = 2. 6 +/- 1. 4 x 1 e 10 Msun or approximately 15 % of a 1 e 12 Msun MW's baryonic mass budget.
