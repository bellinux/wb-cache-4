5|$|In 1896, Budge was {{approached}} by a resident of Gebelein {{who claimed to have}} found more mummies. Budge was taken to <b>the</b> <b>bodies,</b> <b>and</b> he immediately recognized them as from the predynastic period and the first complete pre-dynastic bodies identified. He began excavations and a total of six mummified bodies were removed from shallow sand graves at Baḥr Bila Mâ (Waterless River) located at the eastern slopes of the north-most hill at Gebelein.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to explore how cloth, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> movement are able to communicate possible symbolic meaning in Loïe Fuller’s Serpentine Dance film and Moderat’s Rusty Nails music video. The study further attempts to establish the characteristics of fashion film to include cloth, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> movement and provide a methodology that locates fashion film as a sign system using a visual semiotic analysis framework. The films were then compared and contrasted to determine similarities and differences in their use of cloth, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> movement. <b>The</b> findings from the film analysis suggest that cloth, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> movement communicate symbolic meaning in the films based on their associated meanings that are generated {{both inside and outside the}} film context. By focussing on cloth, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> movement as primary communicators (rather than secondary or supporting communicators) in film, new meanings can be interpreted from their interrelationship. The results inform new ways for fashion designers and fashion filmmakers to engage with cloth, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> movement in fashion film...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} disordered eating, sorority social norms regarding <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> thinness, personal values regarding <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> thinness, <b>body</b> dissatisfaction, thin ideal internalization, fat talk, negative affect, and positive affect among sorority and non-sorority women. The aims {{of this study}} are to discern the underlying factor structures of the sorority/group social norms questionnaires and the personal values regarding <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> thinness questionnaire, investigate disordered eating among sorority and non-sorority women over time, and further examine the impact of social norms on sorority women 2 ̆ 7 s <b>body</b> <b>and</b> eating attitudes and behaviors. The results of this research illustrated three main findings. First, sorority women did not differ from non-sorority women on eating pathology. Second, fat talk, personal values regarding <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> thinness, <b>and</b> <b>body</b> mass index predict increased disordered eating over time in the general college population of women. Third, the sorority and group social norms scale, as well as the personal values regarding <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> thinness measure, were all developed and validated in this research. Additionally, the sorority/group social norms questionnaires and the personal values regarding <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> thinness questionnaire were validated...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{representations}} of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> religion in Nordic film.

The analysis begins with an introduction to religion and film studies, religion in Nordic film and the themes and films chosen for this study. After this a short overview of earlier studies dealing with <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> film, <b>and</b> religion is presented, before delving into the issue of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> religion in Nordic film.

5|$|Many wasp lineages, {{including}} those in the families Vespidae, Crabronidae, Sphecidae, and Pompilidae, attack and sting prey items that they use as food for their larvae; while Vespidae usually macerate their prey and feed the resulting bits directly to their brood, most predatory wasps paralyze their prey and lay eggs directly upon <b>the</b> <b>bodies,</b> <b>and</b> the wasp larvae consume them. Apart from collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the body fluids of their prey. Although vespid mandibles are adapted for chewing and {{they appear to be}} feeding on the organism, they are often merely macerating it into submission. The impact of the predation of wasps on economic pests is difficult to establish.|$|E
5|$|The Sunset Lawn Cemetery is {{the largest}} in the county, founded in 1880, {{connected}} to the west edge of the city. The cemetery contains ornate tombstones and crypts, within which are the remains of most of the city's original founders and prominent residents. Sunset Lawn contained the 90-year-old Sunset Mausoleum. The crypt had marble floors, with 75 persons buried inside. The structure was condemned in 2008 and there were plans of removal of <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> reburial within the cemetery, but due to problems finding many of the family members, has not came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It {{is possible that}} Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses {{of some of the}} figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.|$|E

50|$|Zarathustra {{declares}} that the Christian escape from this world also required {{the invention of}} an eternal soul which would be separate from <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> survive <b>the</b> <b>body's</b> death.

5|$|Lyle spots {{an unknown}} person {{running away from}} them in the subway and the team follows. When the group {{approaches}} {{the spot where the}} train lost power, Melnick starts crying out in pain. Visible electrical flashes start destroying the skin on his left arm. Scully tells Doggett to pour water on it, which stops the flashes. Lyle takes the badly injured Melnick to the surface and Doggett continues onward with Bianco. When Melnick returns to the surface, he seems to be getting worse, but Lyle appears healthy. Scully then sees the three bodies being taken away by non-CDC hazmat people. When Scully confronts Karras about this, he says that he is organizing it. Scully tells Karras that she has already organized the CDC to collect <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> accuses Karras of attempting a cover-up. Although Karras tries to deny his involvement, he eventually allows her to send the bodies to the actual CDC.|$|E
5|$|Seneb {{was buried}} in a mastaba - a flat-roofed brick tomb – located in the West Field of the Giza Necropolis near modern Cairo, where a large complex of ancient Egyptian royal tombs and {{mortuary}} structures was built, including the Great Pyramid. It was rediscovered by the German archaeologist Hermann Junker in 1926. The tomb is situated close to that of another dwarf, Perniankhu, a high-ranking royal courtier {{who may have been}} Seneb's father. Its date was long uncertain but is now firmly attributed to the reign of Djedefre (2528–2520 BC). His wife's name also appears in the nearby tomb of an official, Ankh-ib, suggesting that the families of Seneb, Perniankhu and Ankh-ib may have been related. Seneb was apparently buried with his wife, but no trace remains of <b>the</b> <b>bodies,</b> <b>and</b> the tomb was looted long ago, like most of the others at Giza. It {{was one of the first}} known attempts at building a ceiling dome over a square chamber, with the dome resting on jutting bricks at the corners of the room.|$|E
5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} {{at the impact}} the cemetery scheme {{would have on the}} normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} with many Indian religious traditions, Buddhism does not regard <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mind or spirit as being two entirely separate entities - {{there is no}} sense in Buddhism that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is a [...] "vessel" [...] that is guided or inhabited by the mind or spirit. [...] Rather, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> mind combine and interact in a complex way to constitute an individual. Buddhist attitudes towards <b>the</b> <b>body</b> itself are complex, combining the distaste for sensual pleasure that characterizes the general Buddhist view towards desire with a recognition of both the individuals dependence on <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> utility of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> as an aide in the development of insight. Issues of gender, the mortification of <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> as a source of troublesome desire are all addressed within the Buddhist scriptural tradition directly, while Buddhist attitudes towards other, more contemporary issues have continued to develop and change in response to the social and material changes in modern society.|$|R
