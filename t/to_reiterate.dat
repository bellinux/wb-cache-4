40|$|Several recombinants were {{identified}} and purified from a cloned library of human DNA {{by virtue of their}} homology to DNA from a mouse-human hybrid cell line containing a single human chromosome, the X, and their lack of homology to mouse DNA. Three recombinants were characterized in detail, and all were homologous <b>to</b> <b>reiterated</b> DNA from the human X chromosome. These recombinants also were homologous <b>to</b> <b>reiterated</b> sequences on one or more human autosomes and, therefore, were not X chromosome specific. The recombinant DNA fragments homologous <b>to</b> human <b>reiterated</b> X DNA were the same fragments homologous <b>to</b> human <b>reiterated</b> autosomal DNA. Digestion of genomic DNAs with several restriction enzymes revealed that the pattern of fragments homologous to one recombinant, lambda Hb 2, was the same on autosomes as on the X chromosome, suggesting that the molecular organization of these elements on the X is not distinct from their organization on autosomes...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{grow and}} develop by {{adjusting}} their physiology {{to changes in}} their environment. Changes in the abiotic environment occur over years, seasons and days, but also over minutes and even seconds. In this ever-changing environment, plants may adjust their structure and function rapidly to optimize growth and reproduction. Plant responses <b>to</b> <b>reiterated</b> drought (i. e. repeated cycles of drought) differ from those to single incidences of drought; in fact, in nature, plants are usually exposed to repeated cycles of drought that differ in duration and intensity. Nowadays, there is increased interest in better understanding mechanisms of plant response <b>to</b> <b>reiterated</b> drought due, at least in part, {{to the discovery of}} epigenomic changes that trigger drought stress memory in plants. Beyond epigenomic changes, there are, however, other aspects that should be considered in the study of plant responses <b>to</b> <b>reiterated</b> drought: from changes in other omics approaches (transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics), to changes in plant structure; all of which may help us to better understand plant stress memory and its underlying mechanisms. Here, we present an example in which reiterated drought affects the pigment composition of leaves in the ornamental plant Silene dioica and discuss the importance of structural changes (in this case in the photosynthetic apparatus) for the plant response <b>to</b> <b>reiterated</b> drought; they represent a stress imprint that can affect plant response to subsequent stress episodes. Emphasis is placed on the importance of considering structural changes, in addition to physiological adjustments at the omics level, to understand stress memory i...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of active metabolites of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} bound <b>to</b> <b>reiterated</b> or unique regions of murine DNA has been studied by a DNA-DNA renaturation technique. Murine skin cells were exposed to different doses of radioactive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for 24 hr; then the hydrocarbon-labeled DNA was isolated, fragmented, and denatured. Renaturation kinetics and thermal stabilities of DNA-DNA duplexes were studied. At high carcinogen doses, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts seem to be distributed equally among the DNA of all reiteration frequencies. At low carcinogen doses, however, a dose-dependent preferential binding <b>to</b> <b>reiterated</b> DNA sequences occurs. An inverse linear relationship appears to exist between the enrichment of hydrocarbon adducts in reiterated DNA sequences and the logarithm {{of the amount of}} total hydrocarbon bound to DNA...|$|R

25|$|The {{opposition}} accused Karzai {{of attempting}} to extend his power past his term. In February 2009, President Hamid Karzai called on the Independent Election Committee to hold the election according to the country's constitution, thereby forcing the IEC <b>to</b> <b>reiterate</b> the August date, and silencing critics, who feared a leadership vacuum between May and August. Some potential Afghan opponents complained Karzai's move {{was an attempt to}} clear the field of challengers, most of whom would not be ready to campaign for the 2009 election. After the IEC and the international community rejected Karzai's decree, Karzai accepted the date of August 20, 2009. The Supreme Court of Afghanistan announced in March 2009 that Karzai's term would be extended until a new leader had been elected. His opponents called the decision unconstitutional and unacceptable, pointing out that it put Karzai in a position to exploit the office to secure his electoral victory.|$|E
25|$|John Holt {{states that}} Vishnu {{was one of}} the several Hindu gods and goddesses who were {{integrated}} into the Sinhala Buddhist religious culture, such as the 14th and 15th century Lankatilaka and Gadaladeniya Buddhist temples. He states that the medieval Sinhala tradition encouraged Visnu worship (puja) as a part of Theravada Buddhism just like Hindu tradition incorporated the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu, but contemporary Theravada monks are attempting to purge the Vishnu worship practice from Buddhist temples. According to Holt, the veneration of Vishnu in Sri Lanka is evidence of a remarkable ability over many centuries, <b>to</b> <b>reiterate</b> and reinvent culture as other ethnicities have been absorbed into their own. Though the Vishnu cult in Ceylon was formally endorsed by Kandyan kings in the early 1700s, Holt states that Vishnu images and shrines are among conspicuous ruins in the medieval capital Polonnaruwa.|$|E
25|$|<b>To</b> <b>reiterate,</b> Creelman and Turner, {{with equal}} vigor {{and scope of}} investigation, depict very {{different}} regimes; respectively, one progressive and the other oppressive. In spite of their strong commitment to their reporting, both journalists rarely mention the científicos. Regardless, these first-hand accounts reveal two foreigners’ perceptions of how Indian policy {{was carried out in}} the whole of Mexico, even if they were unaware of {{the inner workings of the}} regime. On the one hand, Creelman stresses the necessity of the Porfiriato’s harshness with which Indians continued to be subjugated and socially marginalized, as was suggested by Limantour, Bulnes, and Cosmes. This treatment, to Creelman, was a justified measure so that Mexico could be modernized. Turner, on the other hand, sees no benefit to such dehumanizing treatment when nearly one half of Mexico’s population is not profiting from the economic progress, but rather, they are suffering from it, even more than they had suffered under previous governments. This, for Turner, was the opposite of modernization. Despite their opposing interpretations of Díaz ’s regime, Creelman and Turner ultimately expose any pretense of a fair and just government as perpetrated by the científicos and Díaz through positivist doctrine. It is this last point that serves as the link to Díaz’s own perceptions and actions—or lack thereof—towards Mexico’s Indians.|$|E

Richard Cohen wrote a column in the Washington Post, saying [...] "We've Apologized Enough to Japan", denounced the [...] "hypocrisy" [...] of Japan's recent gestures of compensation and remorse to some of its World War II victims, which he said were offered [...] "grudgingly", while noting that the U.S. had apologized profusely over the accidental collision.|$|E
500|$|The {{actual number}} of recipes {{deviates}} from that claimed by the author. On the one hand, {{there may be more}} than one recipe under a single numbered heading. For example, under number 4 in chapter 1, there are three disparate recipes, one for stewed meat in saffron sauce, one for a thick sauce of sieved vegetables and one for boiled meatballs, as well as a tip to add raisins only to those dishes that are meant to be sweet. Chapter 2 opens with five unnumbered recipes for sauces to be used with fish. On the other hand, some of the numbered headings are not followed by any actual recipe, serving only <b>to</b> <b>reiterate</b> that various dishes may be prepared using the same basic technique. For instance, in chapter 3, the recipe for a puff-pastry apple tart, is followed by eleven numbered headings saying, [...] "pear tart likewise", [...] "woodland strawberry tart likewise", [...] "sour cherry tart likewise", and so on for fig, prune, date, gooseberry, peach, plum, currant and quince tarts.|$|E
500|$|There are two {{separate}} styles of madrigals written for and {{inspired by the}} concerto delle donne. The first is the [...] "luxuriant" [...] style of the 1580s. The second is music {{in the style of}} the seconda pratica, written in the 1590s. Luzzaschi wrote music in both of these styles. The style of the earlier period, as exemplified in the works of Luzzaschi, involves the use of madrigal texts written by poets within the Ferrarese sphere, such as Tasso and G.B. Guarini. These poems tend to be short and witty with single sections. Musically, Luzzaschi's works are highly sectionalized and based on melodic themes, rather than harmonic structures. Luzzaschi lessens the sectionalizing effect of his compositional techniques by weakening cadences. His tendency <b>to</b> <b>reiterate</b> melodies in different voices, including the bass voice, leads to tonal creations which are sometimes bewildering. These aspects make Luzzaschi's music much more polyphonic than Monteverdi's later compositions, and thus more conservative; however, Luzzaschi's use of jarring melodic leaps and harmonic dissonance are individualistic. These dissonances, which contrast sharply with the careful treatment of dissonance during most of the 16th century, is closely connected with the ornamented polyphonic madrigals of the concerto delle donne. In Giovanni Artusi's socratic dialogue, the character defending Monteverdi connects haphazard treatment of dissonance with ornamental singing.|$|E
