40|$|Abstract. Tube bending is {{a complex}} process with multi-factor {{coupling}} effect and multiple defects occurring. The wall thinning, {{as one of the}} important defects in tube bending, determines the bending quality. In this study, taking thin-walled 6061 -T 4 Al-alloy tube with Φ 50. 8 ×t 0. 889 ×R 101. 6 mm (outer diameter D × wall thickness t × bending radius R) as the objective, the significance of processing parameters on the wall thinning degree is studied using the orthogonal test under ABAQUS/Explicit platform. The results show that: 1) the bending radius, the clearance between the <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> the pressure die, the friction between the <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> the pressure die, the clearance between the <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> the pressure die, the clearance between the <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> the mandrel and the friction between the <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> the mandrel affect the wall thinning significantly, while the coefficient of boost velocity, the number of mandrel balls, the friction between the <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> the wiper die, the mandrel extension length and the friction between the <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> the bending die have little effect on the wall thinning degree...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} methods to perform {{sterilization}} via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility.

5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end. The larvae move around inside the <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> this helps maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: PCNL is well-accepted {{method of}} {{management}} of renal stone. In PCNL post operatively usually Nephrostomy <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> JJ stent are used.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} extractive cooling {{from the}} 2 nd stage pulse <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> regenerator in a two-stage 4 K pulse tube cryocooler. Excess cooling can be distributed cooling along the pulse <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> regenerator or intermediate cooling {{at a certain}} location on the pulse <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> regenerator. The 2 nd stage pulse tube provides significantly more capacity of distributed cooling than the regenerator with less effect of cooling performance on both stages. Two intermediate heat exchangers mounted on the 2 nd stage pulse <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> regenerator can provide cooling capacities of 0. 5 W to 3. 5 W at temperatures between 6. 5 K to 26 K without affecting the 2 nd stage performance. Extracting cool-ing from the pulse <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> regenerator decreases the first stage cooling performance...|$|R

5|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{and printed}} circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity; heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties.

5|$|Neon gives a {{distinct}} reddish-orange glow {{when used in}} low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> neon advertising signs. The red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of helium–neon lasers. Neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Since air is the only source, it is considerably more expensive than helium.|$|E
