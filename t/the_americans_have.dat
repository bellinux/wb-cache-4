25|$|Arriving in Britain, the {{location}} of the second meeting, <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> brought the Killing Stone of the Maya, recovered from Mexico; Vulture brings one of the pillars, from the treasury of his family, the Royal House of Saud; and a representative of the British Royal Family, Iolanthe Compton-Jones, brings the pillar kept by her family. The pillars are cloudy diamond bricks with a liquid-filled void in the centre. After being 'cleansed' by the Philosopher's Stone, the pillars become clear and the liquid silver. It is also discovered that the pillars' markings reveal Iolanthe's as the fourth, and Vulture's as the first. The Killing Stone of the Maya is united with the Firestone, and it reveals the dates by which the pillars must be laid - the first on the next day, and the second some seven days later. The Adamson twins have correlated the data from Stonehenge, and found that the first Vertex is underneath Lake Nasser in Egypt, close to Abu Simbel. The team starts out, accompanied by Astro and Iolanthe, leaving the Adamson twins with Tank to continue their calculations and find the other Vertices.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{a high level of}} realism, Letts and Dicks hired a {{technical}} advisor, James Burke, a science correspondent who was well known to television viewers thanks to his work as anchorman on the television coverage of the Apollo moon landings and for presenting science series such as Tomorrow's World and The Burke Special. Burke decided that 2003 would be a realistic date for bases to have been established on the Moon, telling the Radio Times that [...] "Men won't go back to the Moon until the 1990s. Neither the Russians nor <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> any plans at present and no-one else can afford it. [...] As for the base itself – it should look exactly as it would if they built one tomorrow. [...] They'd be small, supporting 30 or 40 men and running on a shoestring.

500|$|The Olympic Games were {{originally}} intended for amateur athletes, so the {{players of the}} National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues {{were not allowed to}} compete. In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988. [...] The NHL decided not to allow all players to participate in 1988, 1992 or 1994, because doing so would force the league to halt play during the Olympics. An agreement was reached in 1995 that allowed NHL players to compete in the Olympics, starting with the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. [...] Since that time, <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> won two silver medals, losing both times to Canada in the gold medal game in North America (2002 in Salt Lake City and 2010 in Vancouver). [...] National teams are co-ordinated by USA Hockey and players are chosen by the team's management staff.|$|E
500|$|The United States has won two gold medals, eight silver {{medals and}} one bronze medal in men's ice hockey; <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> won more silver medals {{than any other}} nation.

[...] Two players—Chris Chelios and Keith Tkachuk—have played on four teams. According to the IOC database, 176 men have won medals; ten players—Bill Cleary, Chris Drury, Herbert Drury, John Garrison, John Mayasich, Dick Meredith, Weldon Olson, Brian Rafalski, Richard Rodenheiser, and Frank Synott—have won two medals. Keith Tkachuk holds the record for most games played, having dressed for 23 games in 1992, 1998, 2002, and 2006. Herbert Drury leads American Olympians in goals, having scored 33 goals in 1920 and 1924 (before assists were counted); Bruce Cunliffe scored 23 points (17 goals and 6 assists) in 1948, and Bill Christian recorded 12 assists in 1960 and 1964.|$|E
