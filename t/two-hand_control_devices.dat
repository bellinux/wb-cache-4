40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{an optical}} sensor system, which is integrated into an industrial push-button. The sensor allows to classify {{the type of}} material that is {{in contact with the}} button when pressed into different material categories {{on the basis of the}} material's so called "spectral signature". An approach for a safety sensor system at circular table saws on the same base has been introduced previously on SIAS- 2007. This contactless working sensor is able to distinguish reliably between skin, textiles, leather and various other kinds of materials. A typical application for this intelligent push-button is the use at possibly dangerous machines, whose operating instructions include either the prohibition or the obligation to wear gloves during the work at the machine. An exemple of machines at which no gloves are allowed are pillar drilling machines, because of the risk of getting caught in the drill chuck and being turned in by the machine. In many cases this causes very serious hand injuries. Depending on the application needs, the sensor system integrated into the push-button can be configured flexibly by software to prevent the operator from accidentally starting a machine with or without gloves, which can decrease the risk of severe accidents significantly. Especially <b>two-hand</b> <b>controls</b> are incentive to manipulation for easier handling. By equipping both push-buttons of a <b>two-hand</b> <b>control</b> with material classification properties, the user is forced to operate the controls with his bare fingers. That limitation disallows the manipulation of a <b>two-hand</b> <b>control</b> by a simple rodding device...|$|R

40|$|To {{economically}} {{enhance the}} performance of active/passive <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> for seismic response reduction of tall buildings, this paper investigates the optimal placement and optimal parameter of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> using the linear quadratic performance index as an objective function. The linear relation between the increment of performance index and the change of the position matrix of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is first established {{based on the assumption}} that the control gain remains unchanged. The optimal placement of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is then determined in terms of the sequence of the calculated performance index increments and the number of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> to be used. With the <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> at their optimal places, the seismic response of the building is finally computed using the suboptimal control gain derived using the minimum error principle, from which the equivalent optimal parameters of passive devices can be also determined. The applicability of the proposed approach and its limitation are carefully examined through numerical examples. The results from the numerical examples show that the suggested approach is quite accurate and effective in determining the optimal placement and optimal parameter of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> if the number of removed <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is limited to a certain range.

40|$|Voltage {{regulation}} {{by means}} of coordinated voltage control {{is one of the}} challenging aspects of distribution system operation. Integration of distributed generation (DG), which can also be operated in voltage control mode, in distribution systems may introduce adverse effects including control interactions, operational conflicts and long term oscillations. The seamless operation of distribution systems embedded with DG for effective voltage control is one of the challenging tasks, mainly because (a) DG may interact with the conventional voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and (b) prioritised operation of different voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> depends on the network topology and real-time characteristics of the system. Coordinated operation involving multiple voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> (i. e., on-load tap changers and voltage regulators in addition to local capacitor banks) and DG units is one of the feasible technical solutions at medium voltage distribution system level. In most of the methods proposed in the literature, the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and DG units are tuned and coordinated online using Volt/VAR optimization strategies in accordance with the time-graded operation. However, there is no mechanism to operationally minimize the interactions between DG units and the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> in real-time between any two consecutive control states. In such case, more generic approach needs to be developed for examining interactions between the DG units and the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices.</b> In this paper, interactions among multiple DG units and the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> are identified using their simultaneous and non-simultaneous responses...|$|R

In China, there is a lack of installation guidelines or standards for traffic <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> in school zones. In addition, little research has been done to examine the effects of traffic <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> on driving behavior. Few guidelines have been established for implementing traffic <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> in school zones in China.

Results showed that traffic <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> such as the Flashing Beacon and School Crossing Ahead Warning Assembly, the Reduce Speed and School Crossing Warning Assembly, and the School Crossing Ahead Pavement Markings were recommended for school zones adjacent to a major multilane roadway, which is characterized by a median strip, high traffic volume, high-speed traffic and the presence of pedestrian crossing signals.
