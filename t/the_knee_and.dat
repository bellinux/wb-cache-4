5|$|In some North Indian images, {{the male}} half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (urdhavlinga or urdhavreta: with an erect phallus), {{or with a}} full or half phallus and one testicle. However, such imagery is never found in South Indian images; the loins are usually covered in a garment (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or {{the skin of a}} tiger or deer), {{typically}} down to <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> held in place by a sarpa-mekhala, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal (padma-pitha). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.|$|E
5|$|When {{the pilgrims}} reach the {{appropriate}} Miqat (depending on where they're coming from), they {{enter into a}} state of holiness – known as Ihram – that consists of wearing two white seamless cloths for the male, with the one wrapped around the waist reaching below <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> the other draped over the left shoulder and tied at the right side; wearing ordinary dress for the female that fulfills the Islamic condition of public dress with hands or face uncovered; taking ablution; declaring the intention (niyah) to perform pilgrimage and to refraining from certain activities such as clipping the nails, shaving any part of the body, having sexual relations; using perfumes, damaging plants, killing animals, covering head (for men) or the face and hands (for women); getting married; or carrying weapons. The ihram is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in front of God: there is no difference between the rich and the poor.|$|E

25|$|On February 16, 2006, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Buchwald {{had had a}} leg amputated below <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> was staying at Washington Home and Hospice. The amputation was reportedly necessary because of poor circulation in the leg.|$|E
25|$|Weight lifting - {{such as the}} {{improperly}} performed deep squat, is also {{dangerous to}} the lower limbs, because the exercise can lead to an overextension, or an outstretch, of our ligaments in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> can cause pain over time.|$|E

2500|$|A partial squat (also {{known as}} standing, half, semi, parallel, intermediate, shallow, {{incomplete}} or monkey squat etc.) is an intermediate stage between standing and full squatting, that is, standing but with <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> hips bent.

25|$|This {{particular}} swimming technique encompasses all {{the muscles}} in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> will increase not only mobility but also {{the strength of the}} surrounding muscles, which include the quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior (shin muscle), abductor hallucis, abductor digiti minimi, and flexor digitorum brevis (foot muscles).|$|E
25|$|During {{an average}} knee arthroscopy, a small fiberoptic camera (the arthroscope) is {{inserted}} into the joint through a small incision, about 4mm (1/8inch) long. More incisions might be performed in order to visually check other parts of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> to insert the miniature instruments {{that are used to}} perform surgical procedures.|$|E
25|$|If the bowler's back foot {{is behind}} {{parallel}} to the bowling crease, the bowler loses momentum and speed when delivering the ball. This is because the bowler's back foot bends at <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> causes momentum to be lost and the bowler then has {{to go back and}} lift their whole body back upright.|$|E

25|$|He was {{an active}} athlete, playing sports such as golf, ice hockey, and handball. It was while playing the last that Untener broke his right leg, only a year before his ordination.

25|$|Fracturing or {{chipping}} of the polyethylene platform {{between the}} femoral and tibial components {{may be of}} concern. These fragments may become lodged in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> create pain or may move {{to other parts of}} the body. Advancements in implant design have greatly reduced these issues but the potential for concern is still present over the lifespan of the knee replacement.|$|E
25|$|On July 17, 1870, Hickok was {{attacked}} by two troopers from the 7th U.S. Cavalry, Jeremiah Lonergan and John Kyle (sometimes spelled Kile), in a saloon. Lonergan pinned Hickok to the ground, and Kyle put his gun to Hickok's ear. When Kyle's weapon misfired, Hickok shot Lonergan, wounding him in <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> shot Kyle twice, killing him. Hickok was not re-elected to office.|$|E

25|$|In November 2009, the West Indies toured {{for three}} Tests. His {{performance}} in the first Test, with match figures of 5/70, earned Hilfenhaus a Man-of-the-Match award as Australia won by an innings. Experiencing knee soreness after the match, Hilfenhaus was unable {{to play in the}} second Test despite hopes the injury was not serious. The injury, {{which turned out to be}} tendonitis in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> prevented him from playing a further part in the series, worsened when Hilfenhaus returned to playing in grade cricket.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{posterior}} thigh muscles. The biceps femoris has two heads: The long head has its origin on the ischial tuberosity {{together with the}} semitendinosus and acts on two joints. The short head originates from the middle third of the linea aspera on the shaft of the femur and the lateral intermuscular septum of thigh, and acts on only one joint. These two heads unite to form the biceps which inserts {{on the head of}} the fibula. The biceps flexes the knee joint and rotates the flexed leg laterally— it is the only lateral rotator of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> thus has to oppose all medial rotator. Additionally, the long head extends the hip joint. The semitendinosus and the semimembranosus share their origin with the long head of the biceps, and both attaches on the medial side of the proximal head of the tibia together with the gracilis and sartorius to form the pes anserinus. The semitendinosus acts on two joints; extension of the hip, flexion of <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> medial rotation of the leg. Distally, the semimembranosus' tendon is divided into three parts referred to as the pes anserinus profondus. Functionally, the semimembranosus is similar to the semitendinosus, and thus produces extension at the hip joint and flexion and medial rotation at the knee.|$|E
25|$|Moderate {{exercise}} is beneficial {{with respect to}} pain and function in those with osteoarthritis of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> hip. These exercises should occur {{at least three times}} per week. While some evidence supports certain physical therapies, evidence for a combined program is limited. There is not enough evidence to determine the effectiveness of massage therapy. The evidence for manual therapy is inconclusive. Functional, gait, and balance training have been recommended to address impairments of position sense, balance, and strength in individuals with lower extremity arthritis as these can contribute to a higher rate of falls in older individuals.|$|E

25|$|The SDFT is {{narrower}} in {{its middle}} third than its top or bottom sections, making it weaker. The {{top and bottom}} of the SDFT has a better supply of blood as well, with the top third supplied by the vessels from <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> the bottom third supplied by the vessels in the fetlock. The middle third has a poor supply of blood, relying on the tiny vessels of the peritendon (the membrane that surrounds the tendons). If this supply is for some reason compromised, the collagen fibers in the area may die, weakening the tendon in that area and making it more likely to tear.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War, Pallis, {{initially}} aided the Salvation Army in {{the region}} along the Sava River in Serbia. In 1916 he enlisted in the British Army and received a commission as an army interpreter in Macedonia. Malaria and a severe inflammation of his right eye cut short his Macedonian service. After a lengthy convalescence in Malta, Pallis applied to and was accepted by the Grenadier Guards. He received basic training, then advanced training as a machine-gunner. In 1918, as a second lieutenant, {{he was sent to}} fight in the trenches of the Western Front. During the battle of Cambrai, in a charge that killed his captain and first lieutenant, Pallis was shot through <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> was forced to retire from combat.|$|E
25|$|In England's first innings, {{the local}} boy was cheered affectionately {{all the way}} to the middle by an avid Oval crowd. Fred Spofforth, however, soon walloped the hero three excruciating blows—one in the ribs, another on <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> one more on the elbow. Read was {{compelled}} to hold up the game on two of these occasions to take time to convalesce, and it was, by all reports, an exceptionally valiant knock. Read finished unbeaten on nineteen, the second best score of the innings, and the masses cheered him all the way back to the pavilion just as they had cheered him from it; indeed, they it patently apparent right through this game that he was an authentic darling of the people.|$|E
