500|$|The {{creative}} director and choreographer was Kim Gavin, with Es Devlin responsible for design and David Arnold as musical director. When Arnold {{was announced in}} his role he said that doing the closing ceremony was an honour and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, while Gavin stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> excited and honoured to be involved.

500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, {{after failing to}} cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that [...] "when I told my son in New York that I {{was going to be on}} The Simpsons, I think that was the first time <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> impressed with what I was doing! The Simpsons is a great show and I'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his beloved Greeks, Hegel saw before him the example of Spinoza and, in his own time, the poetry of Goethe, Schiller, and Hölderlin, who also liked to speak of gods and the divine. So he, too, sometimes spoke of God and, more often, of the divine; and because he occasionally took pleasure in insisting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> closer to this or that Christian tradition {{than some of the}} theologians of his time, he has sometimes been understood to have been a Christian ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1982, Seeger {{performed}} at a benefit concert for Poland's Solidarity resistance movement. His biographer David Dunaway considers {{this the first}} public manifestation of Seeger's decades-long personal dislike of communism in its Soviet form. In the late 1980s Seeger also expressed disapproval of violent revolutions, remarking to an interviewer <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> in favor of incremental change and that [...] "the most lasting revolutions are those that take place {{over a period of}} time."

A bipartisan majority of Senators signed letters demanding that Helms advance his nomination, but Helms refused. After an intensive six-week battle, Weld conceded defeat and withdrew his nomination on September 15, 1997. He commented sarcastically, [...] "I asked President Clinton to withdraw my name from the Senate so I can go back to New England, where no one has to approach the government on bended knee to ask it to do its duty." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the seventh}} day of the inquiry, it was {{announced}} that Croydon Airport was to be extended, with [...] of the neighbouring Beddington Aerodrome being absorbed into the current airfield, Plough Lane being diverted to allow this. An Act of Parliament would be needed before the expansion could take place, for which a bill was in preparation. Finance had been allocated to allow the expansion. Evidence was heard that Croydon was then considered to be the most suitable location for an airport to serve London. Further evidence was heard about the Napier Lion engine, with Mr Beyfus again calling into question the maintenance regime at Imperial Airways, calling the engine [...] "a veritable Cassandra", issuing warnings for seven days that had gone unheeded except by Hinchcliffe. Beyfus denied that his line of questioning was to obstruct the inquiry in its investigation, but stated that as the Air Ministry oversaw civil aviation, it was not entirely amicus curiae in the matter. Counsel for Imperial Airways stated that Beyfus representing a victim of the accident was a front, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> there to represent the interests of certain persons present at the inquiry who had declined to give evidence themselves. He submitted that the accident was caused by weather conditions, and not by any problem with the engine. The inquiry was then adjourned until the next day.|$|E
