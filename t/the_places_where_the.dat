5|$|Remains of Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis {{were found}} during {{fieldwork}} in northwestern Madagascar {{that started in}} 2001. The species was described in a 2010 paper by Pierre Mein and colleagues, together with another extinct rodent, Nesomys narindaensis. The specific name, mahajambaensis, refers to Mahajamba Bay, which is close to <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> species has been found. It {{is placed in the}} genus Brachytarsomys, together with two larger living species, B.albicauda and B.villosa. Brachytarsomys is classified in the exclusively Madagascan subfamily Nesomyinae of the family Nesomyidae, which includes various African rodents.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the peasant war the city authorities tried {{to suppress the}} memory of this nearly successful revolt. Resistance symbols like the flags or the weapons used by the peasants, in particular their typical clubs with nails on the hitting end (called (Bauern-) Knüttel), were outlawed, confiscated, and destroyed. Documents such as the Bundesbriefe of Huttwil were stashed away in the vaults of the city archives. Any public remembrances or pilgrimages to <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> leaders had been executed were forbidden and carried the death penalty, as did the singing of the peasants' war songs. Bern was particularly active in trying to censor {{the memories of the}} event and also tried to suppress images of the peasant leaders. Historic texts written during the Ancien Régime of Switzerland generally follow the official diction and mention the peasant war, if they do so at all, only briefly and in negative terms. Works with differing viewpoints were often prohibited. The censorship was not entirely successful; in private, the rural population kept the memories of 1653 alive, and various accounts of the events were printed in Germany.|$|E

When the Supreme Court moved from the Old Supreme Court Building and City Hall Building at 1 and 3 Saint Andrew's Road respectively to the present Supreme Court Building at 1 Supreme Court Lane, the Chief Justice formally appointed the new building as a place where the Court of Appeal sits by way of a notification dated 20 June 2005.|$|E
25|$|The Torah lists <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Israelites rested. A few of {{the names}} {{at the start of}} the itinerary, {{including}} Ra'amses, Pithom and Succoth, are reasonably well identified with archaeological sites on the eastern edge of the Nile Delta, as is Kadesh-Barnea, where the Israelites spend 38 years after turning back from Canaan; other than these, very little is certain. The crossing of the Red Sea has been variously placed at the Pelusic branch of the Nile, anywhere along the network of Bitter Lakes and smaller canals that formed a barrier toward eastward escape, the Gulf of Suez (south-southeast of Succoth), and the Gulf of Aqaba (south of Ezion-Geber), or even on a lagoon on the Mediterranean coast. The Biblical Mount Sinai is identified in Christian tradition with Jebel Musa in the south of the Sinai Peninsula, but this association dates only from the 3rd century CE and no evidence of the Exodus has been found there.|$|E

25|$|The Yongle Emperor {{lived in}} Nanjing from 1402 to shortly after {{ordering}} the third voyage in 1409, {{when he left}} to supervise {{the building of a}} new capital at Beijing. He was in Nanjing during the departure of the fleet for the first and third voyages, and during the return of the fleet from the first three voyages. According to Dreyer (2007), the emperor's interest in the voyages was the highest during this time, but he became more occupied with his offensive military campaigns against the Mongols after establishing the capital at Beijing. The south and the seas were given less and less attention from emperors and officials alike after the transfer of the capital from Nanjing to Beijing. Dreyer (2007) states that the voyages would have had better prospects if the Hongxi Emperor had succeeded in reverting the relocation of the capital from Nanjing to Beijing, because the court would have been near the Longjiang shipyards where most of the ships were built and <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> voyages commenced.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox martyr Saint Trifon {{is often}} {{depicted}} {{with a white}} merlin on his hand. Particularly the name of Moscow's Sokolniki Park refers to the rapid spread of falconry-related slobodas in Tsarist Russia. As indicated by English diplomat Jerome Horsey, Boris Godunov {{used to be a}} hawker. Meanwhile, the use of hunting birds was already popular among Russian nobility in the times of the Golden Horde. There were several hundred such birds in possession of Ivan IV, and even the road tax was collected in pigeons for falcons. However, the first famous hawker was Alexis I, who created the falconry statute book (Урядник сокольничья пути). The white, red or speckled merlins were also in common usage in those days. The merlin cocks were called cheligi (челиги). <b>The</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> birds were caught were called pomchishcha (помчища) and the catchers - pomytchiki (помытчики). Before the reign of Feodor I each pomytchik community annually delivered three living falcons to the prince's falcon loft. In the time of Feodor I it became necessary to obtain two red merlins, three speckled and thirty-five grey.|$|E

For purposes of application of second item above for determination of the domicile of the respondent in a contractual dispute involving individuals, the following will be taken into consideration: The habitual residence: On a subsidiary basis, the central place of business; and In the absence of any such considerations, the place where found, meaning the actual residence. When dealing with a legal entity, the determination of the domicile will be based on where the administrative headquarters have been set up. The claim plaintiff can, as an alternative, file in any of <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> legal entity has branches, establishments, agencies or any other type of representation. Legal entities headquartered in any member state that have concluded contracts with any other member state can be sued in the courts of this latter state should there be any dispute as to the construction and implementation of the obligations regulated by contract. In the event there is a codefendant, a suit on contractual matters can be adjudicated with the courts of jurisdiction in the territory of the domicile of any of the parties to the litigation.

25|$|Eight EEF {{aircraft}} {{conducted an}} air raid on Jerusalem, on 26 June, bombing the Ottoman Fourth Army headquarters on the Mount of Olives. As the aircraft were flying home, first {{the engine of}} a B. E. aircraft seized, followed by another southeast of Beersheba. After successfully picking up the airmen from the first aircraft, which was destroyed, the attempted rescue of the second led to two aircraft being wrecked and three survivors walking across No Man's Land {{to the safety of}} a light horse outpost line. Two aircraft overflying the survivors on their walk ran out of petrol and oil near Khalasa. The pilots left their intact aircraft, hoping to return to salvage them. Three Australian Flying Corps officers walked in to Goz Mabruk post from southwest of Esani at 15:00 on 26 June after their forced landings, and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was ordered to retrieve the two aircraft. The aircraft were located near Naga el Aseisi, southwest of Bir el Asani, and a regiment of the 5th Mounted Brigade was sent to guard the aircraft, during the night of 26/27 June. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Maygar, the 8th and 9th Light Horse Regiments (3rd Light Horse Brigade) with three troops from the Machine Gun Squadron, one Section Field Ambulance and a detachment from the RFC, moved out from Tel el Fara at 03:30 to retrieve the aircraft on 27 June. They travelled across sand hills, with intervening areas of hard ground, to take over from the regiment of the 5th Mounted Brigade at 08:00. A bag of tools and a sketch showing <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> two machine guns, camera, and ammunition had been buried near the Martinsyde, were dropped at 07:30 from an aircraft which flew out from Deir el Belah airfield.

And in doing so, {{you will find}} the joy and passion for life that they have. When he says to follow the markings of the children and you will find <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk ends, it is not a literal command to physically follow them. Rather he is saying put on the mindset of a child and you will, in turn, find the imagination and joy and innocence that children have. Children do not have to work at finding <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk ends, they know. They know because they know nothing else, the joyful, imaginative mindset they have is purely natural. While adults minds have been influenced by the hardships of the world, and in turn have to work at finding <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk ends. Adults must leave behind the black smoke and look beyond the dark streets that come with adulthood in order to truly find <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk ends.|$|R
