5|$|Teratological (developmentally abnormal) {{forms of}} H.aurantiaca were {{reported}} <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom.

5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain. This decline has been shown <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> striatum and extrastriatal regions.C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery.

The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E

5|$|Firehawk {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains. There are six cars with four seats in each row {{for a total}} of 24 riders per train. There were three trains during the ride's first year at Geauga Lake, however only two have been used since. The third train became a parts donor for the first two. Originally, riders reclined on the lift hill – rather than in the station – and returned to an upright position prior to re-entering the station. However, this was changed <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> station due to problems that arose during the ride's first season. The trains feature the Firehawk logo on the front colored yellow and red. Previously at Geauga Lake, the X-Flight logo was colored lime green and dark blue.|$|E

5|$|Neptune's {{dark spots}} are thought <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as {{holes in the}} upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they {{are thought to be}} vortex structures. Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.|$|E

5|$|On May 18, 1980, a major {{volcanic}} eruption occurred at Mount St. Helens, a volcano located in Skamania County, {{in the state}} of Washington, United States. The eruption (a VEI 5 event) was the most significant {{volcanic eruption}} <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California. It has often been declared as the most disastrous volcanic eruption in United States history. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's north slope.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art.

5|$|The Atlantic puffin is {{a species}} of seabird in the order Charadriiformes.
