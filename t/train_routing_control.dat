40|$|The {{rolling stock}} {{circulation}} depends {{on two different}} problems: the rolling stock assignment and the <b>train</b> <b>routing</b> problems, which up to now have been solved sequentially. We propose {{a new approach to}} obtain better and more robust circulations of the rolling stock train units, solving the rolling stock assignment while accounting for the <b>train</b> <b>routing</b> problem.

This new integrated approach provides a huge model. Then, we solve the integrated model using Benders decomposition, where the main decision is the rolling stock assignment and the <b>train</b> <b>routing</b> is in the second level. For computational reasons we propose a heuristic based on Benders decomposition.

40|$|Abstract — Secure QoS routing {{algorithms}} are {{a fundamental}} part of wireless networks that aim {{to provide services}} with QoS and security guarantees.

In this paper, we propose a novel secure and reliable multi-constrained QoS aware routing algorithm for VANETs.

40|$|Inter-domain routing {{is based}} on a fully {{decentralized}} model, where multiple Autonomous Systems (AS) interact via the BGP protocol. Although BGP is the "glue " of the Internet, it faces a lot of problems regarding its fully distributed nature, policy enforcement capabilities, scalability, security and complexity. Due to the widespread adoption of BGP, only incrementally deployable solutions are feasible. Taking this observation into account, we describe a new, backwardscompatible routing model which {{is based on}} outsourcing and logically centralizing the <b>routing</b> <b>control</b> plane. We claim that outsourcing enables enhanced inter-domain routing. As multiple ASes outsource their <b>routing</b> <b>control</b> plane to the same outsourcing service contractor, AS clusters are being gradually formed. A logically centralized multi-AS <b>routing</b> <b>control</b> platform based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles is the natural point for taking efficient routing decisions, detecting policy conflicts, troubleshooting routing problems, and evolving BGP. We present the technical and financial incentives which support the feasibility of the model and also propose an implementation scheme to facilitate it...|$|R

To effectively cope with these events, the real-time railway traffic management problem (rtRTMP) seeks for <b>train</b> <b>routing</b> and scheduling methods which minimize delay propagation.

40|$|In the {{real-time}} {{railway traffic}} management problem, {{the number of}} alternative routings available to each train strongly affects {{the size of the}} problem and the time required to optimally solve it. The <b>train</b> <b>routing</b> selection problem identifies a suitable subset of alternative routings to be used for each train in the real-time railway traffic management. This paper analyzes the impact of solving the <b>train</b> <b>routing</b> selection problem at different levels. The problem can be solved at tactical level right after the timetabling process, using historical traffic data and with abundant computation time. In this case the problem constitutes an integration step between the timetabling and the real-time traffic management. Alternatively, the problem can be solved at operational level right before the real-time railway traffic management problem solution, using up to date traffic perturbation and a realtime time limit of computation. Experiments are performed on two French test cases, the line around Rouen and the Lille station area, for several disturbed and disrupted scenarios.

We propose an algorithm for the problem of routing and scheduling of a single freight train in a passenger rail network. However, the multiple freight <b>train</b> <b>routing</b> and scheduling problem is shown to be NP-complete, even for simplified instances. Specifically, we show that both routing and scheduling of freight trains are difficult, even when only two freight trains are considered.
