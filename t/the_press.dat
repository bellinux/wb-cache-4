The third diorama depicts <b>the</b> <b>press</b> during the Japanese occupation, whereas the fourth depicts <b>the</b> <b>press</b> during the National Revolution– including the formation of the PWI. The fifth diorama shows the state of <b>the</b> <b>press</b> during the New Order under President Suharto, a time of great press censorship. The final diorama depicts <b>the</b> <b>press</b> after the beginning of Reformasi in 1998, in which greater freedom of <b>the</b> <b>press</b> has been granted.|$|E

5|$|Alastair Campbell was the Labour Party's Press Secretary and led a {{strategy}} to neutralise the influence of <b>the</b> <b>press</b> (which had weakened former Labour leader Neil Kinnock) and create allies for the party. While in government, Campbell established a Strategic Communications Unit, a central body whose role was to co-ordinate the party's media relations and ensure that a unified image was presented to <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> Because of his background in tabloid journalism, Campbell understood how {{different parts of the}} media would cover stories. He was a valued news source for journalists because he was close to Blair– he was the first press secretary to regularly attend cabinet meetings.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of <b>the</b> <b>press</b> all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of <b>the</b> <b>press</b> regarding that decision.|$|E

5000|$|The Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles {{is a book}} {{collecting}} and bibliophile club run by, and primarily for, students at Oxford University. It was founded in 1950 {{by a group of}} young bibliophiles headed by John Granger, Bent Juel-Jensen and R. John Rickett, and the first meeting was held in Hilary Term of 1951. For fifty years the Society held regular lectures, visits and other events during the University terms, and many of the leading bibliographers, librarians, book collectors, booksellers and other literary figures of the period spoke to the Society or hosted visits. Many of the Society's junior members went on to become prominent figures in the world of books, and some later served as senior members of the Society. One of the most influential members was John Sparrow, Warden of All Souls, who encouraged a love of books and manuscripts in a generation of students, and hosted a termly [...] "Warden's Meeting" [...] at which members were encouraged to bring items from their own libraries to pass round and say a few words about; the tradition of the [...] "Warden's Meeting" [...] continued after 1986, when the Warden himself was too ill to host the meetings and, indeed, after his death in 1992. Another of the Society's traditions was the quality of the termly programme cards, often produced by the leading printers and private <b>presses</b> of <b>the</b> age, including the Oxford and Cambridge University <b>Presses,</b> <b>the</b> Rampant Lions <b>Press,</b> <b>the</b> Samson <b>Press,</b> <b>the</b> Fantasy <b>Press,</b> <b>the</b> Kit-Cat <b>Press,</b> Big Wheel <b>Press,</b> <b>the</b> Perpetua <b>Press,</b> <b>the</b> Incline <b>Press,</b> <b>the</b> Whittington <b>Press,</b> <b>the</b> Libanus <b>Press,</b> <b>the</b> Rocket <b>Press,</b> <b>the</b> Stanbrook Abbey <b>Press</b> and <b>the</b> Stamperia Valdonega.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{overview}} <b>the</b> local <b>press</b> of Konya since 1960, a date which isconsidered a historical breaking point.

Beyond the studies about thenational and <b>the</b> global <b>press,</b> specific and historical approaches to <b>the</b> local <b>press</b> are quite rare. Although there are historical studies studying the pre- 1960 era in more general approaches andwithout a specific micro-level subject in focus; the development process after this date was notyet able to attract the attention it deserved. The {{aim of this}} study was to overview the situation ofthe local press in a historical context, on the example of <b>the</b> Konya <b>press.</b> <b>The</b> local <b>press</b> ofKonya is considered as a typical sample of mainstream local press in Turkey...|$|R

40|$|Ahatraet-Using a {{binocular}} {{search coil}} technique, we measured oculomotor behavior during gentle pressing {{with a finger}} on the outer canthus of one eye. With a steadily pressed viewing eye, and the fellow eye occluded, the occluded eye deviates while <b>the</b> <b>pressed</b> eye does not. If the eye is rapidly <b>pressed</b> and released, <b>the</b> compensation of rotational force in <b>the</b> <b>pressed</b> eye becomes incomplete, so that both eyes move. At high frequencies of press (> 1 Hz) <b>the</b> <b>pressed</b> eye is deviated and the contralateral eye no longer moves. In darkness <b>the</b> <b>pressed</b> eye always rotates but the contralateral eye never does, demonstrating that any inflow from proprio~ptors sensing rotation of <b>the</b> <b>pressed</b> eye does not affect oculomotor posture as measured in the fellow eye. With binocular viewing the results are more variable. On some trials neither eye moves, while on others both move. The results {{can be interpreted as}} a Hering’s law controlled attempting to reconcile disparate inputs from the two eyes. The results confirm and extend, with objective measures, earlier conclusions from subjective experiments...|$|R
