40|$|Five rats responded under {{concurrent}} fixed-interval variable-ratio schedules of food reinforcement. Fixed-interval values {{ranged from}} 50 -seconds to 300 -seconds and variable-ratio values ranged from 30 to 360; a five-second changeover delay {{was in effect}} throughout the experiment. The relations between reinforcement ratios obtained from the two schedules and the ratios of responses and time spent on the schedules were described by Baum's (1974) generalized matching equation. All subjects undermatched both response and <b>time</b> <b>ratios</b> to reinforcement ratios, and all subjects displayed systematic bias {{in favor of the}} variable-ratio schedules. Response ratios undermatched reinforcement ratios less than did <b>time</b> <b>ratios,</b> but response ratios produced greater bias than did <b>time</b> <b>ratios</b> for every subject and for the group as a whole. Local rates of responding were generally higher on the variable-ratio than on the fixed-interval schedules. When responding was maintained by both schedules, a period of no responding on either schedule immediately after fixed-interval reinforcement typically was followed by high-rate responding on the variable-ratio schedule. At short fixed-interval values, when a changeover to the fixed-interval schedule was made, responding usually continued until fixed-interval reinforcement was obtained; at longer values, a changeover back to the variable-ratio schedule usually occurred when fixed-interval reinforcement was not forthcoming within a few seconds, and responding then alternated between the two schedules every few seconds until fixed-interval reinforcement finally was obtained...|$|R

40|$|Background: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to compare between weight and gender {{categories}} the attack and pause times during the 2007 Taekwondo World Championship. Methods: a total of 88 rounds (47 male and 41 female contests) were analyzed. Results: there was no difference in attack/balancing <b>times</b> <b>ratio</b> between genders (0. 13 ± 0. 06 vs 0. 13 ± 0. 06, P > 0. 05). The attack number was significantly higher in round 3 than in round 1 for all categories and genders. The balancing time was lower during the round 3 than round 1 for low-weight male and high-weight female categories. The delta of change from round 1 to 3 (round 3 - round 1) for attack time and attack/balancing <b>times</b> <b>ratio</b> were lower in male than female. Conclusions: female seems to intensify more the combat in the last round than male, and this seems be related to the weight division...|$|R
