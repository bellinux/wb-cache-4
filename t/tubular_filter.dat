To this end, the following objectives were defined for this study: • To extend or improve upon the constant pressure compressible cake filtration model, predictive solution procedure, and standard laboratory characterisation techniques re qulred 10 obtain the empirical model parameters, presented in Rencken (1992). A new generalised area contact constant pressure compressible cake filtration model was developed for both the internal cylindrical and planar filtration geometries. The model utilises a heuristically developed area contact function which relates the interparticle contact area to the solids compressive pressure within the cake. If the area contact is zero, the model reduces to the conventional point contact model as presented in Rencken (1992). The sludge used in this investigation was found to exhibit a negligible degree of area contact.

The separation of oil in water dispersions is an important process, with research principally concentrating upon polymeric and ceramic filters where the filtration mechanism is predominantly by capture within {{the depth of the}} filter. This work utilises novel metal filters which possess a non-tortuous pore channel and so filter by a sieving mechanism. An evaluation of a variety of types of metal surface filters was conducted with {{a large proportion of the}} research focusing upon a filter possessing circular pores which open into a conical shape. Rejection of challenging emulsified oil droplets was solely by exclusion due to size at this pore. Enhancement of emulsion filtration was combined with the surface filters using a selection of rod and helical inserts within a <b>tubular</b> <b>filter</b> to modify the flow conditions; in the case of helical inserts to produce a centrifugal velocity upon the less dense oil droplets away from the filter surface. Further filtration enhancement was produced by air backflushing to alleviate fouling of the filter surface and electrolytic generation of bubbles to capture oil drops on bubbles. The latter method increased the overall feed size and should have increased the centrifugal separation by lowering particle or aggregate density. Research is also reported into the mechanism of rejection of emulsified oil droplets using filters with circular pores. The mechanism has been evaluated and shown to depend on the capillary pressure of deformable oil drops impinging upon the pore. A mathematical model is described, which predicts the deformation of drops using the physical properties of contact angle and interfacial tension combined with the properties of pore size, shape and droplet size...|$|E

Intravenously injected L-lysine is rapidly cleared from plasma and the effect on tubular protein reabsorption is transient.

Rats placed in metabolic cages were treated with 20 [*]mmol/kg/ 6 [*]h of L-lysine, glycine, or water. Urines were analyzed for proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and radioimmunoassay. Proximal tubule uptake of proteins and expression of apical membrane receptors were investigated by immunocytochemistry. In vitro uptake and receptor expression were studied using a yolk sac cell line. L-lysine administration produced increased urinary excretion {{of a large number}} of proteins while the effect on tubular accumulation of selected proteins was variable. L-lysine treatment induced changes in the localization of two receptors responsible for <b>tubular</b> endocytosis of <b>filtered</b> proteins. In conclusion, oral L-lysine treatment induced proteinuria, in particular albuminuria, as efficiently as previous reports on intravenous infusion. The effect on tubular protein accumulation was variable suggesting differential effects on tubular reabsorption and degradation of filtered proteins.

40|$|Abstract] A simple, <b>tubular</b> {{biotrickling}} <b>filter</b> {{was designed}} for optimal removal of ammonia and odour in ventilation air from a pig house. The removal and transformation of ammonia was studied in detail by analysis and modelling of chemical gradients through the filter. Good correspondence between measurements and model was obtained by using conventional substrate and inhibition kinetics of ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria. Highest rates of ammonia removal were observed in the central section of the filter. Near the air outlet and water inlet the process was ammonia limited, while high nitrous acid concentrations almost excluded any biological activity near the air inlet and water outlet. Nitrous acid inhibition also stabilized pH at 6. 5 - 7 all through the filter. Being sensitive to both ammonia and nitrous acid the nitrite oxidation process occurred mainly in the filter sections near the air outlet / water inlet, and only 8 % of the nitrite was turned into nitrate. Water supply only exceeded evaporation by 20 % but modelling indicated that additional watering would have limited effect on filter efficiency. The filter was also robust to varying loading, as a 4 -fold increase in ammonia inlet concentration only reduced filter efficiency from 86 to 76 %...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The definition, history and applications of Microfiltration (MP) are briefly reviewed in Chapter 1. The physical mechanisms and mathematical models of the filtration process including concentration polarization (CP), gel polarization (GP) and pore blocking are given in Chapter 2. Crossflow microfiltration membrane fouling and the deposition of solids onto the filter surface have been investigated using a process fluid (seawater), latex and a ground mineral. The performance of various membrane materials has also been studied, including: acrylonitrile, polypropylene, PTFE, ceramic and stainless steel. The seawater filtration work showed in Chapter 3 that good filtrate flux rates can be maintained if material fouling or depositing on the membrane can be prevented from entering the membrane structure. A surface deposit may be removed by mechanical means such as backflushing with permeate or compressed air. This aspect of the work indicated that a more comprehensive study of fouling was required. Existing crossflow filtration membrane models did not adequately represent even the simplest filtration when penetration of the membrane structure applied. Such conditions occurred during latex filtration in Chapter 4. Latex of varying sizes and density were manufactured and filtrations using acrylonitrile membranes were performed. Considerable deposition of latex inside the membrane pores occurred despite the nominal rating of the membrane being less than the latex particle diameter. Thus the membranes relied on a depth filtration mechanism rather than a surface straining mechanism for filtration effectiveness. A standard filtration blocking model was modified for use in crossflow microfiltration, coupled with a mass balance {{on the amount of}} material filtered. This mathematical model was then used to predict and correlate the rate of filtration flux decay with respect to filtration time during crossflow filtration. The model provided acceptable accuracy and is an improvement on existing empirical models for the flux decay period. Under the circumstances of membrane penetration it is advisable to minimise the amount of material entering the membrane structure. Mechanical means to achieve this were investigated and a novel anti-fouling method using a centrifugal field force and enhanced shear stress at the membrane surface was developed. The filtration of limestone slurries with three different <b>tubular</b> <b>filters</b> are presented in Chapter 5, in which one filter was conventional, the other two novel ones were specially designed for the separation of particles with a density {{different from that of the}} liquid, one used a helical channel around the filter, and the other had tangential inlet and outlet endcaps.

40|$|ABSTRACT Increased {{exposure}} of the <b>tubular</b> epithelium to <b>filtered</b> protein is a proposed mechanism of progressive renal failure associated with glomerular disease, but how this protein overload translates into tubular damage remains unclear. We have examined a model of adriamycin-induced proteinuria {{to determine the effect}} of locally synthesized C 3, the central proinflammatory protein of the complement cascade. C 3 �/ � kidney isografts placed in wild-type C 3 �/� mice were protected from proteinuria-associated complement activation, tubular damage, and progressive renal failure despite the presence of abundant circulating C 3. The quantity of urinary protein was unaffected by the absence of C 3, and thus the influence of C 3 was not explained by alteration in the filtered protein load. These results suggest that local synthesis of complement from renal epithelial cells is a critical mediator of tubular damage in proteinuria-associated renal disease. Our results concur with previous findings of increased synthesis of C 3 in human tubular epithelium exposed to high concentrations of protein in vitro. Because progressive renal damage in humans associates with proteinuria regardless of cause, our findings have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of renal failure from many common causes, immunological an...|$|R

Partic-ularly, tubular objects are everywhere elongated in one principal direction – which varies spatially – and are thin in the other two perpendicular directions.

In this article, we present a low-level <b>tubular</b> structure detection <b>filter.</b> This filter relies on paths, which are semi-global features that avoid any blurring effect induced by scale-space convolution. More precisely, our filter is based on recently developed morphological path operators. These require sampling only in a few principal directions, are robust to noise and do not assume feature regularity. We show that by ranking the directional response of this operator, we are further able to efficiently distinguish between blob, thin planar and tubular structures. We validate this approach on several applications, both from a qualitative and a quantitative point of view, demonstrating noise robustness and an efficient response on tubular structures...|$|R
40|$|Severe sepsis {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by acute renal failure with renal tubular dysfunction. Albuminuria is a common finding in septic patients and we studied whether {{it was due to}} an impairment of proximal <b>tubular</b> endocytosis of <b>filtered</b> albumin. We studied the regulation of megalin and cubilin, the two critical multiligand receptors responsible for albumin absorption, during severe experimental endotoxemia. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused a time- and dose-dependent suppression of megalin and cubilin expression that was paralleled by a decrease in plasma albumin levels and an increase in the urine concentration of albumin in mice. Incubation of rat renal cortical slices with LPS also reduced the mRNA expression of megalin and cubilin. Further, LPS suppressed megalin and cubilin mRNA expression in murine primary proximal tubule cells and decreased the uptake of FITC albumin in these cells. In addition, the increase in urine levels of albumin in response to ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute renal failure was paralleled by a decrease in the expression of megalin and cubilin. Thus, our data indicate that the expression of megalin and cubilin is decreased during experimental endotoxemia and in response to renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. This downregulation may contribute, in part, to an increase in urine levels of albumin during acute renal failure...|$|R
40|$|Fibrosis {{represents}} the common final pathway of many chronic diseases including inflammatory, ischemic and metabolic disorders. There is great need for non-invasive biomarkers that reflect {{activity of the}} fibrogenic process and can help predict progression. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) seems an ideal biomarker for monitoring ongoing fibrosis, since {{it is an important}} fibrogenic cytokine that is readily quantifiable in body fluids. Plasma and urine CTGF levels are increased in various chronic diseases. However, there is lack of knowledge of the processes contributing to elevated CTGF levels, which hampers correct interpretation. Thus far, CTGF levels were expected to reflect CTGF tissue expression. Aim of this thesis was to determine whether elimination and distribution processes may also influence CTGF levels. To investigate this, the pharmacokinetic profiles of CTGF and its N-terminal fragment (N-CTGF), the predominant form of CTGF in plasma and urine, were studied. Rodent and human studies showed that plasma N-CTGF is highly dependent on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In healthy rodents, intravenously administered N-CTGF was primarily eliminated by the kidney. Plasma N-CTGF accumulated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with the highest levels in end stage kidney disease. Successful kidney transplantation resulted in a decrease of plasma CTGF proportional to the increase of GFR. In contrast, full length CTGF was primarily eliminated by the liver in healthy rodents, presumably via a low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 -mediated pathway. Full length CTGF had a large distribution volume due to a protamine-sensitive process, presumably extensive binding to heparan sulphate proteoglycans. Rodent and human studies demonstrated that urinary CTGF is highly dependent on tubular function. In healthy subjects hardly any CTGF was excreted into the urine, due to almost complete proximal <b>tubular</b> reabsorption of <b>filtered</b> CTGF via megalin-mediated endocytosis. Impairment of tubular protein reabsorption, either by Gelofusine or in megalin-deficient mice, resulted in substantially increased urinary CTGF excretion. Urinary CTGF was tightly associated with β 2 -microglobulin in CKD patients, indicating that elevated urinary CTGF may reflect proximal tubular dysfunction. In diabetes mellitus, a disorder characterized by high renal CTGF expression, urinary CTGF was determined by both decreased <b>tubular</b> reabsorption of <b>filtered</b> CTGF and increased CTGF expression in glomeruli and medullary tubules. Plasma CTGF was further explored in two large patient populations. In hemodialysis patients, plasma CTGF was associated with residual kidney function and presence of cardiovascular disease. Elevated plasma CTGF increased the risk of all-cause mortality. Plasma CTGF was not removed by low flux hemodialysis and its concentration increased over time while hemodiafiltration substantially lowered plasma CTGF resulting in a sustained decrease. In patients with manifest vascular disease, plasma CTGF was related to GFR and total cholesterol and showed a robust association with the risk of new cardiovascular events and mortality. In conclusion, this thesis shows that impaired elimination and altered distribution may influence CTGF levels in chronic disorders, in addition to increased CTGF production. This knowledge is essential for correct interpretation of CTGF levels. Furthermore, CTGF may be regarded as risk marker for mortality in hemodialysis patients and patients with vascular diseas...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} reduction of renal mass results in proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial injury, culminating in end-stage {{chronic renal failure}} (CRF). The accumulation of lipids in the kidney can cause renal disease. Uptake of oxidized lipoproteins via scavenger receptors, reabsorption of filtered protein-bound lipids via the megalin-cubilin complex, and increased glucose load per nephron can promote lipid accumulation in glomerular, tubular, and interstitial cells in CRF. Cellular lipid homeostasis is regulated by lipid influx, synthesis, catabolism, and efflux. We examined lipid-regulatory factors in the remnant kidney of rats 11 wk after nephrectomy (CRF) or sham operation. CRF resulted in azotemia, proteinuria, lipid accumulation in the kidney, upregulation of megalin, cubilin, mediators of lipid influx (scavenger receptor class A and lectin-like oxidized receptor- 1), lipid efflux (liver X receptor α/β and ATP-binding cassette transporter), and fatty acid biosynthesis (carbohydrate-response element binding protein, fatty acid synthase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase). However, factors involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (sterol regulatory element binding protein, 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, SCAP, Insig- 1, and Insig- 2) and fatty acid oxidation (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, acyl-CoA oxidase, and liver-type fatty acid binding protein) were reduced in the remnant kidney.

40|$|Proximal <b>tubular</b> {{reabsorption}} of <b>filtered</b> sodium by the sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE 3), {{located on}} the apical membrane, is fundamental {{to the maintenance of}} systemic volume and pH homeostasis. NHE 3 is finely regulated by a variety of hormones and by changes in ionic composition and volume, likely requiring redistribution of the exchangers. We analyzed the subcellular distribution and dynamics of the exchangers by generating an epithelial line expressing NHE 3 tagged with an exofacial epitope, which enabled us to monitor exchanger mobility and traffic in intact cells. Using determinations of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in combination with dynamic measurements of subcellular distribution, we found that, in renal epithelial cells, NHE 3 exists in four distinct subcompartments: a virtually immobile subpopulation that is retained on the apical membrane by interaction with the actin cytoskeleton in a manner that depends on the sustained activity of Rho GTPases; a mobile subpopulation on the apical membrane, which can be readily internalized; and two intracellular compartments that can be differentiated by their rate of exchange with the apical pool of NHE 3. We provide evidence that detachment of the immobile fraction from its cytoskeletal anchorage leads to rapid internalization. These observations suggest that modulation of the mobile fraction of NHE 3 on the apical membrane can alter the number of functional exchangers on the cell surface and, consequently, the rate of transepithelial ion transport. Regulation of the interaction of NHE 3 with the actin cytoskeleton can therefore provide a new mode of regulation of sodium and hydrogen transport...|$|R

Four patients were treated for four days (short-term treatment) and five for periods between 13 and 27 days (long-term treatment). Administration of rhIGF-I increased inulin clearance, p-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance and the percent <b>tubular</b> reabsorption of <b>filtered</b> phosphate, and decreased plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and plasma phosphate during short-term administration. Kidney volume was unchanged in patients receiving the growth factor. rhIGF-I did not cause weight gain, proteinuria or hypoglycemia. Inulin clearance was not increased significantly above baseline after 13 or 20 days of IGF-I administration. PAH clearance remained elevated after 13 days, but not after 20 days of IGF-I. Levels of total circulating IGF-I were elevated above basal levels during the entire course of long-term IGF-I administration. In contrast, levels of circulating IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP 3) declined over time. Side effects related to IGF-I forced discontinuation of its use in two of five patients undergoing long-term treatment, and side-effects possibly related to IGF-I prompted discontinuation of its use in two others. We conclude that rhIGF-I can enhance glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow when administered short-term to humans with end-stage chronic renal renal failure. Further studies {{will be required to}} define its efficacy and usefulness long-term...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of a proton-coupled electrogenic high-affinity peptide transporter in the apical membrane of tubular cells has been demonstrated by microperfusion studies and by use of brush border membrane vesicles. The transporter mediates <b>tubular</b> uptake of <b>filtered</b> di- and tripeptides and aminocephalosporin antibiotics. We have used expression cloning in Xenopus laevis oocytes for identification and characterization of the renal high-affinity peptide transporter. Injection of poly(A) + RNA isolated from rabbit kidney cortex into oocytes resulted in expression of a pH-dependent transport activity for the aminocephalosporin antibiotic cefadroxil. After size fractionation of poly(A) + RNA the transport activity was identified in the 3. 0 - to 5. 0 -kb fractions, which were used for construction of a cDNA library. The library was screened for expression of cefadroxil transport after injection of complementary RNA synthesized in vitro from different pools of clones. A single clone (rPepT 2) was isolated that stimulated cefadroxil uptake into oocytes approximately 70 -fold at a pH of 6. 0. Kinetic analysis of cefadroxil uptake expressed by the transporter's complementary RNA showed a single saturable high-affinity transport system shared by dipeptides, tripeptides, and selected amino-beta-lactam antibiotics. Electrophysiological studies established that the transport activity is electrogenic and affected by membrane potential. Sequencing of the cDNA predicts a protein of 729 amino acids with 12 membrane-spanning domains.

40|$|Intrarenal {{complement}} activation {{leads to}} chronic tubulointerstitial injury in animal models of proteinuric nephropathies, making this process a potential target for therapy. This study investigated whether a C 3 -mediated pathway promotes renal {{injury in the}} protein overload model and whether the abnormal exposure of proximal <b>tubular</b> cells to <b>filtered</b> complement could trigger the resulting inflammatory response. Mice with C 3 deficiency were protected to a significant degree against the protein overload–induced interstitial inflammatory response and tissue damage, and they had less severe podocyte injury and less proteinuria. When the same injury was induced in wild-type (WT) mice, antiproteinuric treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril reduced the amount of plasma protein filtered, decreased the accumulation of C 3 by proximal tubular cells, and protected against interstitial inflammation and damage. For determination of the injurious role of plasma-derived C 3, as opposed to tubular cell–derived C 3, C 3 -deficient kidneys were transplanted into WT mice. Protein overload {{led to the development}} of glomerular injury, accumulation of C 3 in podocytes and proximal tubules, and tubulointerstitial changes. Conversely, when WT kidneys were transplanted into C 3 -deficient mice, protein overload led to a more mild disease and abnormal C 3 deposition was not observed. These data suggest that the presence of C 3 increases the glomerular filtration barrier's susceptibility to injury, ultrafiltered C 3 contributes more to tubulointerstitial damage induced by protein overload than locally synthesized C 3, and local C 3 synthesis is irrelevant to the development of proteinuria. It is speculated that therapies targeting complement combined with interventions to minimize proteinuria would more effectively prevent the progression of renal disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to design and manufacture a <b>tubular</b> low pass <b>filter.</b> The filter was designed with the technique of impedance steps and it meets the necessary specifications and frequency mask. Besides, I wanted {{to carry out a}} process of design and manufacture filters as automated as possible in order to follow the same process more quickly in future designs. The reason to develop this project has been the need for filters in the radiofrequency laboratory. These filters can be purchased nowadays but the problems of buying them are their high cost and the long delivery time. Therefore, in this project I want to find out whether we can manufacture filters with similar characteristics to the filters that are on the market, with a lower cost and avoiding the long delivery time. The type of filter that I have designed is explained {{at the beginning of this}} document. Moreover, the characteristics that I wanted to achieve are described in detail. Then, the calculations that were carried out to obtain the ideal filter dimensions and the automation of these operations using Matlab are presented. Once the ideal filter design was obtained, it was simulated with the circuit simulatos ADS. In order to obtain simulations as real as possible, the filter was implemented and simulated with a 3 D software: HFSS. Some discrepancies were observed, so that the previously calculated dimensions were modified to obtain the filter performance required. To finish the document, the manufacturing process is explained, the measurements of the resulting prototype are shown and the conclusions and future lines are exposed...|$|R
40|$|Serum {{ascorbic acid}} (AA) is reduced in {{diabetic}} patients. Aim {{of this study}} was 1) to verify whether such a decrease might be due to an altered urinary excretion of AA, and 2) whether this latter was modified in presence of early diabetic nephropathy with microalbuminuria (albumin excretion rate [AER] > 20 micrograms/min) in a group of 21 patients affected by insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) as compared with 13 healthy controls matched for sex, age, dietary AA intake, and creatinine clearance per 1. 73 m 2 (CCl). Mean serum AA (+/- SD) was lower in diabetics (40. 3 +/- 14 microM/l) than in controls (85. 1 +/- 23. 5 microM/l; p = 0. 0001) and {{there was no difference between}} serum AA of patients with or without microalbuminuria. Urinary excretion of AA to creatinine x 100 (UAA/Cr) was higher in micro- (n = 6; 4. 6 +/- 1. 7) as compared to normoalbuminurics (n = 15; 1. 6 +/- 0. 9) or controls (1. 5 +/- 1. 2; p = 0. 0001). For values exceeding renal threshold of tubular AA reabsorption (39 microM) the regression line of serum AA to UAA/Cr was significantly (p = 0. 001) steeper in diabetics than in controls, suggesting an impaired <b>tubular</b> reabsorption of <b>filtered</b> AA in IDDM. The ratio of AA clearance to CCl was moreover related to AER (r = 0. 48; p = 0. 03) and to blood glucose (r = 0. 51; p = 0. 01), being unrelated to uric acid clearance, glycosuria and to urinary excretion of both alanine aminopeptidase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase.

40|$|Renal net acid {{excretion}} requires <b>tubular</b> reabsorption of <b>filtered</b> bicarbonate, {{followed by}} secretion of protons and ammonium in the collecting duct, generating steep transtubular gradients for these ions. To prevent passive backleak of these ions, the tight junctions in the collecting duct must be highly impermeable to these ions. We previously generated a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK II) cell line with inducible expression of claudin- 8, a tight junction protein {{expressed in the}} collecting duct. In these cells, claudin- 8 was shown {{to function as a}} paracellular barrier to alkali metal and divalent cations. We have now used this model to test the hypothesis that claudin- 8 also functions as a paracellular barrier to acidic or basic ions involved in renal acid excretion. We developed a series of precise and unbiased methods, based on a combination of diffusion potential, short-circuit current, and pH stat measurements, to estimate paracellular permeability to protons, ammonium and bicarbonate in MDCK II cells. We found that under control conditions (i. e. in the absence of claudin- 8), these cells are highly permeable to the acidic and basic ions tested. Interestingly, proton permeation exhibited an unusually low activation energy similar to that in bulk solution. This suggests that paracellular proton transfer may occur by a Grotthuss mechanism, implying that the paracellular pores are sufficiently wide to accommodate water molecules in a freely mobile state. Induction of claudin- 8 expression reduces permeability not only to protons, but also to ammonium and bicarbonate. We conclude that claudin- 8 probably functions to limit the passive leak of these three ions via paracellular routes, thereby playing a permissive role in urinary net acid excretion...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{progressive}} nephropathies, overload of <b>tubular</b> {{cells with}} <b>filtered</b> proteins translates glomerular permeability dysfunction into cellular signals of interstitial inflammation. Megalin-mediated endocytosis of proteins and further processing by the endocytosis apparatus could be basic precondition {{for the following}} inflammation signals leading to fibrosis. Blockade of the protein-endocytosis so could preserve the physiological function and counteract the loss of renal function. However, {{it is not known}} whether Megalin-blockade is protective in progressive renal injury associated with severe proteinuria. This study therefore examines the role of the endocytosis-receptor Megalin in progressive nephropathies by confronting murine Megalin-deficient phenotypes with a model of DOCA-salt-induced hypertensive nephropathy with progressive interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Methods: DOCA-salt hypertensive nephropathy with persistent proteinuria was induced in Megalin-deficient mice by a two times subcutaneous implantation of a 50 mg 21 -day DOCA-release-pellet in intervals of 3 weeks and 1 % saline given as drinking water. Bloodpressure was telemetrically controlled all along. Renal damage was evaluated following measure¬ments of functional parametres and renal histology, which was studied by morphometry and immunohistochemistry. The expression of proinflammatory, inflammatory and proliferation markers was quantified by immunohistochemistry and Realtime Online PCR. Results: DOCA-induced rise of bloodpressure, the extent of proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis was not different in Megalin-deficient animals and controls. In contrast, the associated tubulointerstitial injury consisting of tubular dilatation and atrophy, interstitial infiltration and fibrosis, was significantly lower in Megalin-deficient phenotypes. Compared to controls, Megalin-deficient mice showed a significantly reduced amount of F 4 / 80 -positive macro¬phages, T-lymphocytes and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP- 1) in interstitial lesions. Proliferation-marker Ki- 67 was also significantly reduced in Megalin-deficient mice. The mRNA expression of MCP- 1, TGF-ß and Collagen III was upregulated in diseased kidneys, but also in Megalin-deficient mice not as prominent as in diseased controls. Conclusion: Megalin-deficiency substantially reduced the expression of proinflammatory, inflammatory and profibrotic markers and the subsequent renal fibrosis in DOCA murine model of hypertensive nephropathy. These findings support an important role for Megalin in proteinuric overload of proximal tubular cells and suggest that Megalin-blockade might be a new therapeutic strategy in progressive nephropathies...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{renal failure}} (ARF) is {{associated}} with increased morbidity and mortality rates. The need for dialysis is an independent risk factor for early mortality after complicated cardiac surgery. Human atrial natriuretic peptide (h-ANP) is a potent endogenous natriuretic and diuretic substance. The exogenous administration of h-ANP increases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) in clinical acute renal failure. Aim: To {{study the effects of}} the long-term infusion of h-ANP on GFR, RBF and renal outcome in patients with ischaemic ARF. To investigate the effects of h-ANP and furosemide on GFR, RBF and renal oxygen consumption (RVO 2). To validate two independent methods, the renal vein thermodilution and the infusion clearance technique for bedside estimation of absolute RBF and GFR {{in the intensive care unit}} without the use of urine collection. Methods: Renal tolerance to h-ANP was evaluated in 11 patients with ARF treated with h-ANP infusion (50 ng · kg- 1 ·min- 1) for at least 48 hours. h-ANP was abruptly discontinued and again re-instituted. Sixty-three patients with ischaemic ARF were randomised to either placebo or continuous infusion of h-ANP. Treatment with h-ANP/placebo continued until serum creatinine was reduced to below the trigger value for inclusion or the patients fulfilled predefined criteria for dialysis. The effects of h-ANP (n= 10) and furosemide (n= 9) on GFR, renal haemodynamics and RVO 2 were studied in cardiac surgery patients, with normal renal function, using the infusion clearance technique. Results: The discontinuation of long-term h-ANP infusion reduced urine flow, GFR and RBF. These variables were normalised when h-ANP treatment was re-instituted. Six (21 %) patients in the h-ANP group compared with 14 (47 %) in the placebo group required dialysis before or at day 21 (p= 0. 009). Eight (28 %) patients in the h-ANP group compared with 17 (57 %) in the placebo group suffered from the combined end point dialysis or death before or at day 21 (p= 0. 017). The reproducibility was highest for the infusion clearance technique, which also had the highest agreement with the reference method (urinary clearance). h-ANP caused an increase in GFR (12 %), sodium re-absorption (9 %) and RVO 2 (21 - 31 %), while furosemide reduced GFR (12 %), sodium re-absorption (26 - 31 %) and RVO 2 (18 - 29 %). For both ANP and furosemide, changes in GFR correlated strongly to RVO 2. Conclusions: No renal tolerance develops during the long-term infusion of h-ANP. The infusion of h-ANP reduces the probability of dialysis and improves dialysis-free survival in early, ischaemic ARF after complicated cardiac surgery. The infusion clearance method is superior to the renal vein thermodilution technique for estimating total RBF and GFR in ICU. The strong correlation between GFR and RVO 2 underscores the importance of GFR and the <b>filtered</b> <b>tubular</b> load of sodium as a major determinant of RVO 2...|$|R
40|$|Glomerulonephritis (GN) is a {{major cause}} of {{progressive}} chronic renal failure (CRF) and accounts for less than 20 % in the UK of patients requiring dialysis and transplantation. There are many forms of GN, of which IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common, affecting up to 2 % of the adult population. GN is characterised by irreversible and progressive glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and retention of uremic toxins. The rate of progression of GN is increased by various clinical factors including hypertension, and the quantity and specificity of proteinuria. Although albuminuria is most widely studied, higher molecular weight proteins such as immunoglobulins (Ig) are more associated with progression of renal disease. In this thesis I have explored the hypothesis that an interaction between <b>tubular</b> cells and <b>filtered</b> Ig/immuno complex (Ig/IC) may involve specific cellular receptors, and thus provide a novel mechanism for the initiation of tubular injury and fibrosis. Deposition of Ig and IC is seen in renal diseases such as membranous glomerulonephritis, and IgAN. Ig/IC are regarded as responsible for the initiation of glomerular injury in these diseases. However, whether Ig/IC contribute directly to tubular injury is unknown. We previously identified a novel IgA receptor, the Fcα/μ receptor (Fcα/μR), in mesangial cells which may contribute to IgAN. This receptor binds both IgA and IgM but not IgG. I hypothesised that Ig and IC, filtered at the glomerulus, may act on Ig receptors in human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) and may play a direct pathophysiological {{role in the development of}} interstitial fibrosis. Specifically, that filtered IgA may bind to the Fcα/μR in IgAN. The activation of Ig receptors may stimulate tubular cells to alter cell proliferation and extracellular matrix formation (e. g fibronectin (FN)), which are pathophysiological characteristics of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in GN. I studied primary and immortalised human PTEC using qualitative RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for expression of candidate Ig receptors. I investigated the expression of Ig receptors and their regulation by cytokines (e. g. IFN-γ, TGF-β 1 and IL- 1 α) known to be implicated in GN. The receptors studied include the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), the neonatal receptor (FcRn), the Fcα/μR, the classical IgG receptors (FcγR 1, γIIa, γIIb, γIII and the related FcR γ-chain) and the classical IgA receptor (FcαR). None of the classical IgG receptors were expressed by PTEC, nor was the classical IgA receptor. However, the FcRn, pIgR and the Fcα/μR were expressed. Gene expression of these receptors was investigated under cytokine regulation. IFN-γ, IL- 1 α and TGF-β 1 had no effect on FcRn gene expression. The expression of the pIgR gene was up-regulated by IFN-γ and the Fcα/μR transcript level was up-regulated by IL- 1 α and IFN-γ but down-regulated by TGF-β 1. Expression of Fcα/µR protein by tubular cells was confirmed by western blot analysis by using specific Fcα/µR monoclonal antibody. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of Fcα/µR by PTEC in both normal and diseased kidney and that IgG, IgA and IgM binding varies in parallel with gene expression of related Fc receptors. This binding was associated with increased FN production (assessed by ELISA) and reduced the proliferation of PTEC, demonstrated by [3 H]-thymidine uptake assay. I screened the ability of PTEC to release cytokines under normal conditions and confirmed this by ProteoPlex cytokine array. Among these cytokines there was no significant effect of Ig/IC on IL- 6, IL- 8 and GM-CSF released by PTEC, and this was confirmed by specific ELISA for each individual cytokine. The phosphotyrosine/phospho-ERK signalling pathway was unaffected by Ig/IC; however, IgM was able to activate the phospho-ERK pathway. These results suggest that there might be alternative signalling pathways activated by Ig/IC in PTEC. I then studied the effect of calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressive drugs as a model of tubular toxicity, and statins as immunomodulatory drugs, reputed to protect renal function and known to have immunomodulatory effects. I hypothesised that immunosuppressant agents/statins either alone or in combination with LPS might affect Ig receptors expression, cytokine release, FN production and proliferation by PTEC. My results inferred that immunosuppressive agents alone have a non-inflammatory response on Ig receptor expression. However, in combination with LPS, the study drugs showed a slight inhibitory effect on the expression of the pIgR on PTEC at the highest concentration only. There was no significant effect of immunosuppressant agents alone or in combination with LPS on IL- 6, IL 8 and GM-CSF released by PTEC. Cyclosporine, FK 506 and sirolimus were shown to inhibit both the production of FN and the growth of PTEC at high doses, thereby exerting an antiproliferative effect. Both simvastatin and fluvastatin inhibited LPS induced production of IL- 6, IL- 8 and GM-CSF, FN and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. 1 micromolar simvastatin/fluvastatin was associated with a 35 % reduction in unstimulated FN production, a 51 % reduction in proliferation, and reduced production of IL- 6 (58 %), IL- 8 (65 %) and GM-CSF (57 %). The expression of Ig receptors was increased in a dose-dependent manner in PTEC treated with statins alone or in combination with LPS. In conclusion, the expression of tubular FcRn, pIgR and Fcα/µR by PTEC is regulated by proinflammatory cytokines. The binding of IgA and IgM, possibly through the Fcα/µR, by PTEC may contribute to immune-mediated nephropathy. The FN production and the proliferation suggest that Ig/IC binding may contribute to the pathophysiology of IC-mediated renal disease. The ability of immunosuppressant agents to reduce FN production, proliferation, and pIgR expression by PTEC may offer potential new strategies for the prevention and treatment of nephrotoxicity, proteinuria and chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). The inhibitory effect of statins alone or in combination with LPS on FN production, proliferation and cytokines released suggest that statin therapy may have potential benefit in interstitial nephritis and fibrosis. On other hand, statins alone or in combination with LPS increased the expression of Ig receptors by PTEC. This thesis shows that the novel human Fcα/µR in PTEC may play an important role in the immune mechanisms involved in the tubular response during renal injury associated with tubular Ig/IC deposits in renal disease.
