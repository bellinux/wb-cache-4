5|$|Einstein {{contributed to}} these {{developments}} by linking {{them with the}} 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a <b>thermal</b> <b>equilibrium</b> state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature {{to be derived from}} one another by a simple shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.|$|E

5|$|From {{approximately}} 10−6 {{seconds after}} the Big Bang, during a period {{is known as the}} hadron epoch, the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the Universe was dominated by hadrons.

5|$|Heating in Enceladus has {{occurred}} through various mechanisms ever since its formation. Radioactive decay in its core may have initially heated it, {{giving it a}} warm core and a subsurface ocean, which is now kept above freezing through an unidentified mechanism. Geophysical models indicate that tidal heating is a main heat source, perhaps aided by radioactive decay and some heat-producing chemical reactions. A 2007 study predicted the internal heat of Enceladus, if generated by tidal forces, could be no greater than 1.1 gigawatts, but data from Cassini's infrared spectrometer of the south polar terrain over 16 months, indicate that the internal heat generated power is about 4.7 gigawatts, and {{suggest that it is}} in <b>thermal</b> <b>equilibrium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to <b>thermal</b> <b>equilibrium</b> that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E
5|$|The lepton epoch was {{the period}} in the {{evolution}} of the early Universe in which the leptons dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the Big Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in <b>thermal</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created. Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of the Universe was then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon epoch.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} stellar models of {{spectral}} type G is computed {{to study the}} rotation laws resulting from mean-field equations. The rotation laws of the slowly rotating Sun, the fast rotating MOST stars epsilon Eri and kappa 1 Cet and the rapid rotators R 58 and LQ Lup can easily be reproduced. We also find that differences in {{the depth of the}} convection zone cause large differences in the surface rotation law and that the extreme surface shear of HD 171488 can only be explained with a artificially shallow convection layer. We also check the <b>thermal</b> wind <b>equilibrium</b> in fast-rotating G dwarfs and find that the polar subrotation (dOmega/dz 0) is due to the Lambda effect as part of the Reynolds stresses.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} it is tried to {{estimate}} the reliability of a fully connected network of some unreliable nodes and unreliable connections (edges) between them. The proliferation of electronic messaging has been witnessed {{during the last few}} years. The acute problem of node failure and connection failure is frequently encountered in communication through various types of networks. We know that a network can be defined as an undirected graph N(V,E). It is believed that in a network the nodes as well as the connections can fail and hence can cause unsuccessful communication. So, it is important {{to estimate the}} network reliability to encounter the network failure. Various tools have been used to estimate the reliability of various types of networks. In this paper we are considering the approach of neuro optimization for estimating the network reliability. We use the simulation annealing to estimate the probabilities of various nodes in the network and Hopfield model to calculate the energies of these nodes at various <b>thermal</b> <b>equilibriums.</b> The state o...|$|R

He did not mention what he imagined to surround his perfectly reflective and thus perfectly conductive walls.

5|$|With ample {{current density}} and ionization, this forms a {{luminous}} electric arc (a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning) between the electrodes. Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization {{is determined by}} temperature), and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in <b>thermal</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> {{which is to say}} that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.|$|E
5|$|Water maser {{emission}} {{is observed}} primarily at 22GHz, {{due to a}} transition between rotational energy levels in the water molecule. The upper state is at an energy corresponding to 643 kelvins about the ground state, and populating this upper maser level requires number densities of molecular hydrogen of order 108 cm−3 or greater and temperatures of at least 300 kelvins. The water molecule comes into <b>thermal</b> <b>equilibrium</b> at molecular hydrogen number densities of roughly 1011 cm−3, so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region. Water masers emission has been successfully modelled by masers occurring behind shock waves propagating through dense regions in the interstellar medium. These shocks produce the high number densities and temperatures (relative to typical conditions in the interstellar medium) required for maser emission, and are successful in explaining observed masers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, so we should expect {{that there are more}} cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs. This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, and one of the coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The {{reason for this is that}} the Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, cool and become a non-radiating black dwarf in approximate <b>thermal</b> <b>equilibrium</b> with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E
