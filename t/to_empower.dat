5|$|Paul Taylor’s {{review in}} The Independent hails American Idiot as “the Hair of its generation”. Yet, {{as noted by}} Harry Lou in The Indianapolis Business Journal, “ts female {{characters}} are sketched even lighter than the main men are”. Although intended <b>to</b> <b>empower</b> the disillusioned youth of early 21st century America, American Idiot excludes the female voice from this discourse. This disempowering of the female {{is evident in the}} fact that the female leads are denied identity, let alone agency. Just one of the three is given a name, and all represent a stereotypical form of ‘woman’; the mother, the artistic muse, and the object of the voyeuristic male gaze.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford {{served in}} the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories until Alberta became a {{province}} in 1905.

He was considered a possible member of Haultain's executive council, likely in the post of Commissioner of Public Works, but the post instead went to George Bulyea. He joined many of his fellow MLAs in continuing to advocate for provincial status, finding that the limitations on a territory's means to raise revenue prevented the Northwest Territories from meeting its obligations.|$|E

Desertions were pandemic, and the recruitment campaigns for young people often drove them to the opposition. To better organize the military, seven military zones were established, each with its own Defence Council. The Defence Councils were established at the national, provincial and district level <b>to</b> <b>empower</b> the local PDPA.

5|$|The Watcher and {{his companions}} pursue Thaos {{to the city of}} Twin Elms, where they finally learn the truth behind Thaos' actions. The gods are {{synthetic}} beings created by ancient animancers to serve as a civilizing force for the world, which doesn't have any real gods. Thaos is the last survivor of their order, and has survived the centuries by transferring his soul from one body to the next. His eternal mission is to ensure that no one discovers the gods' secret, because then mortals would question their divine authority, and the world could then regress into sectarianism and barbarism. To this end, he works to discredit and suppress animancy wherever it flourishes, because modern animancers may eventually discover the truth through their science. He stole the souls of the Hollowborn <b>to</b> <b>empower</b> the goddess Woedica, who hates animancy and would see it destroyed. Though the other gods have an interest in protecting their secret, they do not want Woedica to dominate them, and so they help the Watcher reach Thaos.|$|E
5|$|Turner and Meyszner clashed {{continually}} throughout 1942, as Meyszner {{sought to}} remove all police matters from Turner's remit, including {{the supervision of the}} security forces of the Serbian collaborationist regime. In response, Turner fought hard to maintain control over these areas. Meyszner believed the only way to maintain peace and security was the use of brutal police methods; Turner wanted <b>to</b> <b>empower</b> the Nedić regime and then replace the military administration with a civil one, akin to the Reichskommissariat Niederlande, with himself as Reichskommissar (governor). Meyszner attempted to have Turner's staff downgraded and incorporated into Bader's staff but Wolff intervened to prevent this. However, Turner's approach was also seriously out-of-step with the Wehrmacht, which considered the territory a combat zone and wanted to eliminate inefficiencies and overlapping jurisdictions.|$|E

Barzahl cut off contact with Drypeak, preparing to repel the inevitable assault of the Shaper Council, who they wish to remain independent from. The Takers, a faction of intelligent serviles who had originated on Sucia Island, were given powers by Barzahl because they worked for him. In turn the Takers created powerful dragon-like beasts called drakons, taught the drakons how to create life themselves, and betrayed Barzahl. The Takers stand for the total destruction of the Shaper Council. The Awakened, the other servile faction in Geneforge 2, believe that Shapers should treat them as equals. They had {{been working with the}} Barzites, but the Awakened's leader Learned Pinner rejected the Barzites' view that serviles need to be controlled.
