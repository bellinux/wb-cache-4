5|$|Aspasia {{was born}} in the Ionian Greek city of Miletus (in the modern {{province}} of Aydın, Turkey). Little is known about her family except that her father's name was Axiochus, although it is evident that she must have belonged to a wealthy family, for only <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do</b> could have afforded the excellent education that she received. Some ancient sources claim that she was a Carian prisoner-of-war turned slave; these statements are generally regarded as false.|$|E
5|$|Baden-Powell invited {{boys from}} {{different}} social backgrounds to the camp, a revolutionary idea during the class-conscious Edwardian era. Eleven came from <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do</b> private boarding schools of Eton and Harrow, mostly sons of Baden-Powell's friends. Seven {{came from the}} Boys' Brigade at Bournemouth, and three came from the Brigade at Poole & Hamworthy. Baden-Powell's nine-year-old nephew Donald Baden-Powell also attended. The camp fee was dependent on means: one pound for the public school boys, and three shillings and sixpence for the others.|$|E
5|$|It's a touching, believable, often funny but {{ultimately}} sad tale {{of how one}} class {{can take advantage of}} another, even in the guise of patronizing benevolence. Though sometimes shifting abruptly in time, Vanaja is an arresting story of modern-day hardship and class exploitation, recalling Charles Dickens as well as Western fairy-tale lore. Domalpalli's settings are ultra-real in detail and color, from the crude, almost feudal deprivations of Vanaja's dirt-floor background to the stately rituals and autocratic entitlement of <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since the 1990s, the {{academic}} and cultural traditions of Komarovo have been weakened, and currently, the New Russians and <b>the</b> <b>well-to-dos</b> of Saint Petersburg construct new villas here or redesign existing dachas purchased from the older residents.|$|R
50|$|Ted now {{strives to}} prove himself to Larry and the other {{executives}} at Above All, to thwart the rumor of his imminent firing. Ted acknowledges Larry's cutthroat methods, but prefers the stress over sucking up to Willie. Ted's wife wants him to reconcile with Willie and take a cushy, stress-free job in Chicago. Ted contemplates leaving the industry altogether, knowing it will mean sacrificing his lavish lifestyle and his socializing with <b>the</b> <b>well-to-dos</b> in <b>the</b> movie industry.|$|R

5|$|Johnson was inexperienced in relationships, but <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do</b> widow {{encouraged}} him and provided for {{him with her}} substantial savings. The two were married on 9 July 1735, at St. Werburgh's Church in Derby. The Porter family did not approve of the match, partly because Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 21 years his elder. His mother's marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he stopped talking to her. Her other son Joseph later accepted the marriage, and her daughter, Lucy, accepted Johnson from the start.|$|E
5|$|Lie {{was born}} in Buitenzorg (now Bogor), West Java, on 1 November 1853, the first child of seven born to Lie Hian Tjouw and his second wife Oey Tjiok Nio. The elder Lie had four {{children}} from a previous marriage, with Lie Kim Hok his first child from the new marriage. <b>The</b> <b>well-to-do</b> peranakan Chinese couple was living in Cianjur at the time but went to Buitenzorg, Lie Hian Tjouw's hometown, for the birth as they had family there. The family soon returned to Cianjur, where Lie Kim Hok was homeschooled in Chinese tradition and the local Sundanese culture and language. By age seven he could haltingly read Sundanese and Malay.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} nineteenth century Tunbridge Wells {{experienced}} growth as a place for <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do</b> to visit and make their homes. It became a fashionable resort town again following visits by the Duchess of Kent, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and benefited from a new estate on Mount Pleasant and the building of the Trinity church in 1827, and improvements made to the town and the provision of facilities such as gas lighting and a police service meant that by 1837 the town population had swelled to 9,100. In 1842 an omnibus service was set up that ran from Tonbridge to Tunbridge Wells, enabling visitors to arrive from London within two hours, and in 1845 the town was linked to the railway network via a branch from South Eastern Railway's London-Hastings Hastings Line at Tonbridge. During this time Decimus Burton developed John Ward's Calverley Park estate.|$|E

5|$|On Sunday 20May in <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do</b> Strand {{district}} of London, Catesby met Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy and Guy Fawkes, at an inn called the Duck and Drake. Percy {{had been introduced}} to the plot several weeks after Wintour and Fawkes's return to England. Alone in a private room, all swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book, and then in another room celebrated Mass with the Jesuit priest (and friend to Catesby) John Gerard. Robert Keyes {{was admitted to the}} group in October 1604, and was charged with looking after Catesby's Lambeth house, where the gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored. Two months later Catesby recruited his servant, Thomas Bates, into the plot, after the latter accidentally became aware of it, and by March 1605 three more were admitted: Thomas Wintour's brother Robert, John Grant and John Wright's brother Christopher.|$|E
5|$|The first {{exporter}} of palm seeds was Ned King, a mountain {{guide for the}} Fitzgerald surveys of 1869 and 1876, who sent seed to the Sydney Botanic Gardens. Overseas trade began in the 1880s when {{it was found that}} one of the four palms endemic to the island, kentia palm (Howea forsteriana), which grows naturally in the lowlands, was ideally suited to the fashionable conservatories of <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do</b> in Britain, Europe and the United States, but the assistance of mainland magistrate Frank Farnell was needed to put the business on a sound commercial footing when in 1906 he became Director of a company, the Lord Howe Island Kentia Palm Nursery, whose shareholders included 21 islanders and a Sydney-based seed company. However, the formation of the Lord Howe Island Board of Control was needed in 1913 to resolve outstanding issues.|$|E
5|$|McKinley was a noted protectionist, and was {{confident}} of winning an election fought on that question. But it was free silver {{that became the}} issue of the day, with Bryan capturing the Democratic nomination as a foe of the gold standard. Hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince the voters that free silver would be harmful, and once that had its effect, even more were printed on protectionism. McKinley stayed at home in Canton, running a front porch campaign and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of the speeches he gave to organized groups of people. This contrasted with Bryan, who toured the nation by rail in his campaign. Supported by <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do,</b> urban dwellers, and prosperous farmers, McKinley won a majority of the popular vote and an easy victory in the Electoral College. McKinley's systemized approach to gaining the presidency laid the groundwork for modern campaigns, and he forged an electoral coalition that would keep the Republicans in power most of the time until 1932.|$|E
50|$|The grave plots are {{arranged}} into 120 different sections, {{each with its}} own geometric shape. The lavish way in which <b>the</b> more <b>well-to-do</b> individuals and families interred here chose to fashion their mausoleums using the latest art nouveau designs is immediately noticeable.|$|R
50|$|Eating habits {{also changed}} {{during the early}} 19th century, under French {{influence}}. This influence increased {{in the second half}} of <b>the</b> century. <b>Well-to-do</b> people ate four meals a day. Farmers ate primarily soup with bread and olive oil, supplemented with the produce of their farm.|$|R
60|$|The peasants {{have chosen}} their women. For the dark, {{handsome}} Englishwoman, {{who looks like}} a slightly malignant Madonna, comes Il Duro; for the 'bella bionda', the wood-cutter. But the peasants have always to take their turn after <b>the</b> young <b>well-to-do</b> men from <b>the</b> village below.|$|R

25|$|In 1850, when Morphy was twelve, {{the strong}} {{professional}} Hungarian chess master Johann Löwenthal visited New Orleans.

25|$|He was {{supported}} by his father's investments, but Milton became a private schoolmaster at this time, educating his nephews and other children of <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do.</b> This experience and discussions with educational reformer Samuel Hartlib led him to write his short tract Of Education in 1644, urging a reform of the national universities.|$|E
50|$|However, golfing was not {{widespread}} in Queensland {{by the turn}} of the century. The game was the preserve of the affluent, with founders and club members mostly from professional and business sectors. High membership fees and the cost of golfing equipment often excluded <b>the</b> less <b>well-to-do</b> from <b>the</b> sport.|$|R

50|$|After {{contacting}} Charles Voysey, Guy {{was eventually}} granted an audience on 20 December 1902. <b>The</b> 74-year-old <b>well-to-do</b> Voysey {{was surprised to}} be confronted with a coarse-dressed 16-year-old working class boy. After careful preliminaries {{on the part of}} Voysey, the meeting lasted three hours. Their friendship was to continue until Voysey’s death in 1912.|$|R
25|$|Before the hennin rocketed skywards, padded {{rolls and}} {{truncated}} and reticulated headdresses graced {{the heads of}} fashionable ladies everywhere in Europe and England. Cauls, the cylindrical cages worn {{at the side of}} the head and temples, added to the richness of dress of the fashionable and <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do.</b> Other more simple forms of headdress included the coronet or simple circlet of flowers.|$|E
25|$|In {{a number}} of his short stories and sketches, Caragiale makes use of another {{particularly}} Junimist theme, and investigates the glamorous but superficial impact of modernization on high society. In one sketch, a couple of ladies dine in an opulent salon, while cursing their maid, gossiping, and showing interest in vulgar subjects. The characters in these writings tend to resemble each other, evidencing the generic traits of <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tourists visiting Jenolan Caves {{can stay}} at the heritage-listed Jenolan Caves House. It was {{designed}} in 1897 by government architect Walter Liberty Vernon as a resort or retreat for the wealthy. To cater for the expectations of <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do,</b> Vernon included a ballroom and grand dining room, now Chisolm's Restaurant. Chisolm's is open for dinner every day, serving modern Australian cuisine. Facilities include an hotel/motel complex, self-contained cottages, restaurant, bar, and cafe.|$|E

25|$|Johnson bought oysters for his cat. In modern England, oysters are an {{expensive}} food for <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do,</b> {{but in the}} 18th century oysters were plentiful around the coasts of England and so cheap {{that they were a}} staple food of the poor. Johnson refused to send Francis Barber to buy Hodge's food, fearing that it would be seen as degrading to his servant, so he would personally buy the food for Hodge.|$|E
25|$|Quebec has {{the highest}} {{proportion}} of children going to private schools in North America. The phenomenon is not restricted to <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do.</b> Many middle class, lower middle class and even working class families scrimp and save {{to send their children}} to private schools. The government of Quebec gives a Pro rata subsidy for each child to any private school which meets its standards and follows its prescriptions, reducing tuition costs to approximately 30% of non-subsidized private schools.|$|E
25|$|While <b>the</b> <b>well-to-do</b> and privileged enjoyed {{life in the}} Lincombes and Warberries {{and other}} {{desirable}} locations with pleasing vistas, the labouring classes of Torquay lived below in overcrowded tenements, such as in George Street, Swan Street and Pimlico. These foetid dwellings in alleyways with open sewers were {{the homes of the}} unemployed and the domestic servants, labourers, artisans and others who, although they made the town tick, had to live in conditions where hunger and sanitary problems were a constant threat. In one year 66 lives were lost in six weeks in a cholera epidemic.|$|E
