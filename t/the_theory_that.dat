5|$|Likewise, the Eskayan speech variety {{has been}} {{associated}} with languages as disparate as Hebrew, Greek, and Etruscan. Recent studies have revealed that the syntax of Eskayan is virtually identical to that of Boholano-Visayan, lending weight to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> Eskayan is actually an auxiliary variety of this language.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} of the wreck refutes Goodall's theory of a torpedo explosion, while the eyewitness {{evidence of}} venting from the 4-inch magazine prior to the main explosion conflicts with <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> the Hood was blown up by her own guns.

5|$|Eastern Orthodox theologians are {{generally}} critical of <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> Gregory {{was influenced by}} neoplatonism. For example, Metropolitan Hierotheos of Nafpaktos argues in Life After Death that Gregory opposed all philosophical (as opposed to theological) endeavour as tainted with worldliness. This view is supported by Against Euthonius, where Gregory denounces Euthonius for placing {{the results of his}} systematic Aristotelean philosophy above the traditional teachings of the Church.|$|E
5|$|Hitler later {{blamed the}} failure of his {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, {{which had to be}} delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> the Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the Estonian {{astronomer}} Ernst Öpik gave {{a distance}} determination that supported <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> the Andromeda Nebula {{is indeed a}} distant extra-galactic object. Using the new 100inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate {{the distance to the}} nebulae: they were far too distant {{to be part of the}} Milky Way. In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> premise doublespeak {{are still}} indefinite, {{there are some}} <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> have {{parallels}} with <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> of doublespeak and Orwell's ideology in Nineteen Eighty-Four and might possibly provide {{a better understanding of}} where doublespeak's theories could have come from.|$|R
40|$|According {{to process}} reliabilism, a belief {{produced}} by a reliable belief forming process is justified. I introduce problems for this theory on any account of reliability. Does {{the performance of a}} process in some domain of worlds settle its reliability? <b>The</b> <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> answer ‘‘Yes’’ typically fail to state the temporal parameters of this performance. I argue <b>that</b> any <b>theory</b> paired with any plausible parameters has implausible implications. <b>The</b> <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> answer ‘‘No,’’ I argue, thereby lack essential support and exacerbate familiar problems. There are new reasons to avoid any reliability conditions on justification...|$|R

5|$|In 1984, the French {{government}} made an official investigation, concluding {{that it was}} possible that the aircraft had reached Newfoundland. In 1989, the NBC television series Unsolved Mysteries advanced <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> the two aviators made it across the ocean, but crashed and perished in the woods of Maine. One of Nungesser's relatives, William Nungesser, made several trips to Maine to search, focusing his energies around the north slope of Round Lake Hills in Washington County, Maine, as well as the area around Lake Winnipesaukee.|$|E
5|$|In his 1778 work Epochs of Nature Georges Buffon {{referred}} to fossils, {{in particular the}} discovery of fossils of tropical species such as elephants and rhinoceros in northern Europe, as evidence for <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> the earth had started out much warmer than it currently was and had been gradually cooling.|$|E

Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives.

Murray's father, Fred, and immediate family have disputed this theory. Fred Murray stated that he believes his daughter was abducted and is dead.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,400 gastroliths (stomach stones, 8 to 87mm in size) {{were found}} among the ribs and gastralia of {{specimen}} MPC-D100/127. The ratio of gastrolith mass to total weight, 0.0022, supports <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> these gastroliths helped the toothless animals in grinding their food. Features such {{as the presence of}} a beak and a U-shaped, downturned jaw, are indicators of facultative (optional) herbivory among coelurosaurian theropods. In spite of these features, fish vertebrae and scales were also {{found among the}} gastroliths, which suggests that it was an omnivore. Ornithomimosaurs in general are thought to have fed on both plants and small animals.|$|E
5|$|Most of the city's monumental {{projects}} were {{built on the}} wadi's northern bank. Among them is the Temple of Bel, on a tell which {{was the site of}} an earlier temple (known as the Hellenistic temple). However, excavation supports <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> the tell was originally located on the southern bank, and the wadi was diverted south of the tell to incorporate the temple into Palmyra's late first and early second century urban organization on the north bank.|$|E

5|$|On February 15, 1993, Clinton {{made his}} first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit. Two days later, in a nationally {{televised}} address to {{a joint session of}} Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenalism is <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> {{representations}} (or sense data) {{of external}} objects {{are all that}} exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell {{and many of the}} logical positivists during the early 20th century. A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and was popularized by Ernst Mach in the 19th century. This neutral monism, as it is called, resembles property dualism.|$|E

He also points out that Gargi is mentioned as the wife of Yajnavalkya in the manuscript. However, no other text affirms that Gargi was the wife of Yajnavalkya; rather, Maitreyi and Katyayani are listed as his two wives, leading to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> the Pune manuscript is a corrupted and more modern edition of the original text.|$|E
5|$|Several {{months after}} the {{recommendation}} to have thiomersal removed from vaccines was published, a speculative article was published in Medical Hypotheses, a non-peer-reviewed journal, by parents who launched the parental advocacy group SafeMinds to promote <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> thiomersal caused autism.
