25|$|It {{usually takes}} me {{an hour after}} I awaken {{to get all the}} pain out. It used to be easier when I was younger. I have more muscle and joint {{difficulties}} now... Recently the only way I could get control over the pain was by sitting in bed, pulling a chair close, and pressing my larynx against <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> That was very uncomfortable: But it was discomfort I was deliberately creating.|$|E

500|$|Kinman {{first used}} {{the large number}} of elkhorns shed near his farm every year to create a fence. [...] With the help of George Hill, about 1856 he created his first elkhorn chair, which he traded to Dr. Josiah Simpson of Fort Humboldt for a telescope. [...] The {{construction}} of an elkhorn chair included using matching horns to make the front legs and arms of the chair. [...] These horns interlocked with another matching pair, which formed the rear legs and <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> An elk-hide seat was added, along with actual elk feet as the feet of the chair, and the horns were connected beneath the seat.|$|E

500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{will support}} {{some of the}} weight of the occupant, {{reducing}} the weight on other parts of the body. In general, backrests come in three heights: Lower back backrests support only the lumbar region. Shoulder height backrests support the entire back and shoulders. s support the head as well and are important in vehicles for preventing [...] "whiplash" [...] neck injuries in rear-end collisions where the head is jerked back suddenly. Reclining chairs typically have at least shoulder-height backrests to shift weight to the shoulders instead of just the lower back.|$|E
