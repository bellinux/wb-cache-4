5|$|During the 1950s {{when the}} Belgians began to fear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of a {{powerful}} Luba elite would become a threat to colonial rule, the administration began to support Lulua organisations. This further contributed to the growing ethnic polarisation between the two groups. In 1952, an organisation called the Lulua Frères (Lulua Brothers) was established to campaign for socio-economic advancement of the Lulua group and became an unofficial representative of the Bena Lulua.|$|E
5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further education or training, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> might only affect around 25% {{of young people who}} may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state that young people would remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required to continue their education full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E
5|$|M.C. Curthoys and H.S. Jones argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of {{organised}} {{sport was}} one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton and Harrow.|$|E

5|$|Refused legal {{representation}} or bail, Lenin denied all {{charges against him}} but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing. He spent this time theorising and writing. In this work he noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of industrial capitalism in Russia had caused large numbers of peasants {{to move to the}} cities, where they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin argued that this Russian proletariat would develop class consciousness, which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow Tsarism, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie and to establish a proletariat state that would move toward socialism.|$|E
5|$|This {{thesis of}} a {{maritime}} foundation was {{contrary to the}} general scholarly consensus <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of civilization was based on intensive agriculture, particularly {{of at least one}} cereal. The production of agricultural surpluses had long been seen as essential in promoting population density and the emergence of complex society. Moseley's ideas would be debated and challenged (that maritime remains and their caloric contribution were overestimated, for example) but have been treated as plausible as late as Mann's summary of the literature in 2005.|$|E
5|$|With the {{situation}} to the south under control, Ivaylo had to confront a second Mongol attack to the north. This time the Bulgarians faced the elite forces of Nogai Khan. The Mongols prevailed and Ivaylo was besieged in the important city of Drastar on the southern bank of Danube, where he withstood a three-month siege. While bulk of the rebel army was engaged to the north, Michael VIII started negotiations with the nobility of Tarnovo and convinced the local dignitaries to recognize the claim of Ivan Asen III. In the beginning of 1279, a Byzantine army under Michael Glabas disembarked near Varna and set off to the capital, supported by a Mongol unit commanded by Kasim beg. The elite of Tarnovo spread rumours that Ivaylo had perished fighting the Mongols and opened the gates to the Byzantines and their protégé. Ivan Asen III was proclaimed emperor and Maria, {{who at the time}} bore Ivaylo's child, was exiled to Constantinople. To consolidate the support of the nobility, the new monarch married his sister Kira Maria to George Terter, one of Bulgaria's most powerful and influential feudal lords, whose estates were centred at Cherven. Kasim beg, who had been awarded the high court title protostrator, felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of George Terter was at his expense, deserted Ivan Asen III and joined the cause of Ivaylo.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, {{research}} by the USDA Forest Service suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> in maize cultivation 500 to 1,000 years ago {{in what is now}} the southeastern United States corresponded with a decline of freshwater mussels, which are very sensitive to environmental changes.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{from the}} Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) {{conducted}} a modelling study for a deep shale-gas {{formation in the}} North German Basin.

25|$|The {{actions of}} anti-Hindu and anti-India militant groups in Kashmir and Pakistan have {{reinforced}} anti-Muslim feelings in India, which has strengthened the Hindu Right.

25|$|The books do {{not refer}} to {{the degree to which}} wars and {{tensions}} between Muggle governments (e.g., the World Wars or the Cold War) influence the relations between the respective wizarding governments.

25|$|In 1977, Abraham Zaleznik {{distinguished}} {{leaders from}} managers. He described leaders as visionaries who inspire, while managers care about process. He claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of managers {{was the main}} cause of the decline of American business in the 1970s and 1980s. Lack of leadership is most damaging at the level of strategic management where it can paralyze an entire organization.|$|E

25|$|Like his mother, Kocher was {{a deeply}} {{religious}} man and {{also part of}} the Moravian Church. This was an uncommon trait that not many colleagues and co-workers shared and until his death, Kocher attributed all his successes and failures to God.

25|$|From the {{establishment}} of British rule in 1819 to the eve of World War II, Singapore's population grew rapidly from a small village {{of a few hundred}} to a large city of nearly a million. This growth and urbanisation is significant, given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of large modern cities and urban culture has been correlated with the rise of the modern gay identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{stones were}} sold off or used to {{reinforce}} the sea defenses along the Elbe; the funerary sculptures and monuments were broken up and used in {{the reconstruction of the}} city's rudimentary sewage system. The Senate was partly motivated by the desire to rid the city of an extraterritorial institution, but it is more than possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> in rents and the high demand for housing at the time also played a role. In any case, the incident was typical of the celebrated Philistinism of the Hamburg authorities. Five more medieval churches in the city were pulled down between 1807 and 1837.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s it was {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Darwin <b>Rise</b> was <b>the</b> South Pacific Superswell 100 Ma and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> volcanoes of <b>the</b> Darwin <b>Rise</b> erupted over <b>the</b> same mantle region as the volcanoes of French Polynesia today.

25|$|Bork wrote several books, {{including}} the two best-sellers The Tempting of America, about his judicial philosophy and his nomination battle, and , {{in which he}} argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of the New Left in the 1960s in the U.S. undermined the moral standards necessary for civil society, and spawned a generation of intellectuals who oppose Western civilization. During the period these books were written, {{as well as most}} of his adult life, Bork was an agnostic, a fact used pejoratively behind the scenes by Southern Democrats when speaking to their evangelical constituents during his Supreme Court nomination process.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 report {{released}} by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicted that large Asian economies such as China and India would play a more important role in global economic governance in the future. The report claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of emerging market economies heralded a new world order, in which the G20 would become the global economic steering committee. The ADB furthermore noted that Asian countries had led the global recovery following the late-2000s recession. It predicted that the region would have a greater presence on the global stage, shaping the G20's agenda for balanced and sustainable growth through strengthening intraregional trade and stimulating domestic demand.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh is {{a unitary}} state and {{parliamentary}} democracy. Bangladesh also {{stands out as}} one of the few Muslim-majority democracies. “It is a moderate and generally secular and tolerant — though sometimes this is getting stretched at the moment — alternative to violent extremism in a very troubled part of the world”, said Dan Mozena, the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh's legal code is secular, more citizens are embracing a conservative version of Islam, with some pushing for sharia law, analysts say. Experts say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> in conservatism reflects the influence of foreign-financed Islamic charities and the more austere version of Islam brought home by migrant workers in Persian Gulf countries.|$|E
