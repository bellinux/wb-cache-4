5|$|It is {{possible}} to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from each study alone—a statistical method known as meta-analysis.

It concluded <b>that</b> <b>half</b> the patients achieved a 50% reduction in seizures and a third achieved a 90% reduction.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Yugoslavia's new {{communist}} government announced that Sajmište had held {{a total of}} 100,000 prisoners during the war, half of whom were killed. The Yugoslav State War Crimes Commission later estimated {{that as many as}} 40,000 may {{have been killed in the}} camp, including 7,000 Jews. According to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, the overall death toll was greatly exaggerated by the communists for political purposes, and the real number of inmates was about 50,000, with 20,000 killed. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>half</b> of all Serbian Jews were killed at Sajmište. The Staro Sajmište memorial estimates that 23,000 people perished in the camp, of whom 10,000 were Jews.|$|E

5|$|Another issue confronting both Patton and the {{legislature}} {{was how to}} spend federal funds from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Kentucky's share of the settlement totaled $3.5billion over 25years. Because tobacco was a major cash crop in Kentucky, Patton proposed <b>that</b> <b>half</b> of the settlement be used to diversify the state's farmers' crops.

5|$|For a long time, {{sources of}} {{nitrogen}} compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions.

At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock {{in the manufacture of}} explosives in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E
