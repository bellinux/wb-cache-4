The rate-distortion optimization which jointly selects all coding parameters for a frame is first applied to single video object plane (SVOP) coding via the Lagrange multiplier method. The optimal bit allocation for multiple regions of interest (MROI) coding is then achieved using a weighted Lagrange multiplier technique. Finally, the generalized R-D optimization for multiple video object plane (MVOP) coding is realized with the weighted technique by including special handling of object boundary blocks, which provides the additional capability of object scalability. The weights allow direct selection of relative distortions {{in the different}} regions or object planes, and simulations on MPEG- 4 test sequences demonstrate the desired inhomogeneity in reconstruction quality. 1.

In such an environment, it is important to minimize disruptions caused by the changing topology for critical application such as voice and video. This presents a difficult challenge for routing protocols, since rapid reconstruction of routes is crucial in the presence of topology changes. By exploiting non-random behaviors for the mobility patterns that mobile users exhibit, we can predict the future state of network topology and perform route reconstruction proactively in a timely manner.
