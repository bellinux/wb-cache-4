5|$|Although he {{came from}} a privileged Anglo-Irish background, Synge's {{writings}} are mainly concerned with the world of the Roman Catholic peasants of rural Ireland and with what he saw as the essential paganism of their world view. Synge developed Hodgkin's disease, a metastatic cancer <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> untreatable. He died several weeks short of his 38th birthday as he was trying to complete his last play, Deirdre of the Sorrows.|$|E
5|$|Hazen's {{objective}} was to extend a road in a northwest direction following the general path of an old Cohâssiac Indian trail from Lower Coös to St. Johns, Quebec.

On January 11, 2013, Booker filed papers to form a campaign committee, without announcing whether or not he would run. Roughly one month after declaring his interest in running for the Senate, incumbent Lautenberg {{announced that}} he would not seek reelection.|$|E

5|$|The {{premise of}} the episode was based on three major ideas: a pyramid scheme {{involving}} body parts, a lottery in a small town, and the corporate beings assembling the destitute in Chinatown. The episode's writer, Vlaming, developed the latter two ideas and series creator Chris Carter merged all three ideas in the finalized script. The episode contained several elaborate special effects shots, most notably the scene wherein a frog bursts out of a victim's chest, which was created by using molds to create a fake human torso <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> placed over an actor.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} movies {{have been shot}} in Minneapolis, {{including}} The Heartbreak Kid (1972), Ice Castles (1978), Take This Job and Shove It (1981), Purple Rain (1984), <b>That</b> <b>Was</b> <b>Then,</b> This Is Now (1985), The Mighty Ducks (1992), Untamed Heart (1993), Beautiful Girls (1996), Jingle All the Way (1996), Fargo (1996), and Young Adult (2011). In television, two episodes of Route 66 were shot in Minneapolis in 1963 (and broadcast in 1963 and 1964). The 1970s CBS situation comedy fictionally based in Minneapolis, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, won three Golden Globes and 31 Emmy Awards.|$|E
5|$|After the Soviets {{took over}} Armenia in 1920, the Armenian American {{community}} {{was divided into}} two camps: one supporting Soviet Armenia (mostly members of the Hunchak and Ramgavar parties), another one against it (mostly made up of ARF members). During the 1933 World's Fair, Leon Tourian, the primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America, refused {{to give a speech}} because the Armenian tricolor of the 1918-1920 Republic was hanging behind him, while Etchmiadzin, the seat of the Catholicos of All Armenians, was in Armenia <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> part of the Soviet Union and used a different flag. This upset the Dashnak members present in the ceremony. The conflict reached a crisis on December 24, 1933, when several members of ARF assassinated Archbishop Tourian during the Christmas Eve service in New York's Holy Cross Armenian Apostolic Church.|$|E

5|$|Colonel England's 2/3rd Infantry Battalion was {{supported}} by the guns of the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and a troop of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment. The tanks were late in arriving, and England postponed his attack to 1030. The battalion came under artillery fire, mostly from a battery north of Bardia <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> engaged and silenced by the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. The advance resumed, only to come under machine gun and artillery fire from Wadi el Gerfan. An eight-man section under Lance Corporal F. W. Squires was sent to reconnoitre the wadi but attacked a battery position instead and returned with 500 prisoners. The wadi was found to contain large numbers of Italian soldiers from technical units who, untrained for combat, surrendered in large numbers. One company captured over 2,000 prisoners, including 60 officers.|$|E
5|$|Hinton {{followed}} the advice {{given to her}} and wrote her second novel, <b>That</b> <b>Was</b> <b>Then,</b> This Is Now in 1971. Following that, she wrote her shortest novel, Rumble Fish; {{it was published in}} 1975 after she had published a short story version in a 1968 edition of University of Tulsa's Alumni Magazine. Four years later in 1979, Tex was published and would be Hinton's last book for nine years as she devoted her time to raise her child. Hinton's next novel Taming the Star Runner was her first book that wasn't written in first-person point of view. Seven years after Taming the Star Runner, Hinton released her first children's book, Big David, Little David, which followed with the release of The Puppy Sister in 1995. In 2004, Hawkes Harbor, Hinton's first adult novel, was released. Hinton's most recent book, Some of Tim's Stories, was published in 2007 and is Hinton's third children's book. Overall, Hinton has written nine published books.|$|E
5|$|His opponents {{learned from}} Napoleon's innovations. The {{increased}} importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his {{creation of a}} highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As {{a result of these}} factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent change.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Highland Airways {{looked into the}} {{possibility}} of including Stroma in the hospital ambulance plane service <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> in operation. On 19 August 1937, Captain Fresson of Highland Airways landed a small aircraft in farmland adjoining the Mains of Stroma, and the following spring the islanders cleared an area of moorland {{on the west side}} of the island to create an airstrip. The first official flight landed in June 1938. However, the Second World War prevented any further developments and a regular service was not established. After the war, Highland Airways was taken over by British European Airways, which abandoned any interest in serving the island.|$|E
5|$|In their 1914 Flora of Jamaica, William Fawcett and Alfred Barton Rendle linked Sloane's {{illustration}} to {{the tree}} species <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> known as Ficus suffocans, a name that {{had been assigned to}} it in August Grisebach's Flora of the British West Indian Islands. Gordon DeWolf agreed with their conclusion and used the name F. maxima for that species in the 1960 Flora of Panama. Since this use has become widespread, Berg proposed that the name Ficus maxima be conserved in the way DeWolf had used it, a proposal that was accepted by the nomenclatural committee.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium's unique {{radioactive}} characteristics {{allowed it}} to be traced as it moved through various compounds in chemical reactions, at first {{this was the only}} method available to prove that its chemistry was different from other elements. As the first isotope of neptunium to be discovered has such a short half-life, McMillan and Abelson were unable to prepare a sample that was large enough to perform chemical analysis of the new element using the technology <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> available. However, after the discovery of the long-lived 237Np isotope in 1942 by Glenn Seaborg and Arthur Wahl, forming weighable amounts of neptunium became a realistic endeavor. Its half-life was initially determined to be about 3millionyears (later revised to 2.144millionyears), confirming the predictions of Nishina and Kimura of a very long half-life.|$|E

5|$|The 8-track {{tapes of}} the three shows were {{carefully}} put in storage by Warner Bros. Japan for future use. For the album's 21st anniversary in 1993, Deep Purple author and archivist Simon Robinson decided to enquire via the band's management if the tapes could be located. He discovered the entire show had been recorded well, including all the encores. In July, Robinson and Darron Goodwin remixed the tapes at Abbey Road Studios for an expanded edition, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> mastered by Peter Mew in September. To compromise between including {{as much of the}} shows as possible and setting a realistic price that most fans would accept, they decided to release a 3-CD box set, titled Live in Japan. This included all {{of the three}} main shows except for two tracks already available on the original album. In their place were two previously unreleased encores.|$|E
5|$|The film {{shows the}} traditions {{exhibited}} by courtesans, zamindars in coaches drawn by horses, and palaces that resembled 19th century architecture. The contemporary areas of Madurai and Thanjavur, especially their railway junctions, gave the film {{a sense of}} ambiguity <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> very common in Tamil cinema. The film recreated {{the manner in which}} the Devadasis were portrayed in the early 20th century, and also depicts the social conditions and the upper class milieu in Thanjavur. Real locations were mixed with the fictional town of Madhanpur, which was ruled by a king portrayed by Nambiar. The film also had undertones of the Chithirai festival.|$|E
5|$|When Shea {{was hired}} by NASA, President John F. Kennedy's {{commitment}} to landing men on the Moon was still only seven months old, {{and many of the}} major decisions that shaped the Apollo program were yet to be made. Foremost among these was the mode that NASA would use to land on the Moon. When Shea first began to consider the issue in 1962, most NASA engineers and managersincluding Wernher von Braun, the director of the Marshall Space Flight Centerfavored either an approach called direct ascent, where the Apollo spacecraft would land on the Moon and return to the Earth as one unit, or Earth orbit rendezvous, where the spacecraft would be assembled while still in orbit around the Earth. However, dissenters such as John Houbolt, a Langley engineer, favored an approach <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> considered to be more risky: lunar orbit rendezvous, in which two spacecraft would be used. A command/service module (CSM) would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a lunar module would land on the Moon and return to dock with the CSM in lunar orbit, then be discarded.|$|E
