They were drawn with Barcelona in the last 16, but Brown missed the 3–2 defeat in the first leg through suspension. He returned for the second leg at the Camp Nou, which Celtic lost 1–0. Brown was suspended for three league matches, including two Old Firm games, in April 2008. Due to this suspension, manager Gordon Strachan chose a midfield pairing of Barry Robson and Paul Hartley for the final weeks of the season. Brown made a total of 48 appearances for Celtic {{in his first season}} with the club, scoring three goals.|$|E

5|$|Most {{party members}} were teachers, {{employees}} of the French colonial government or non-commissioned officers in the colonial army. The VNQDD campaigned mainly among these facets of societythere were few workers or peasants in its ranks. The party's popularity {{was based on a}} groundswell of anti-French feeling in northern Vietnam in the 1920s; many writers had assailed society for glorifying military actions against China, Champa, Siam and Cambodia, Vietnam's historical rivals, while neglecting to oppose French colonialism. The VNQDD admitted many female members, which was quite revolutionary for the time. It set about seeking alliances with other nationalist factions in Vietnam. In a meeting on July 4, 1928, the Central Committee appealed for unity among the Vietnamese revolutionary movements, sending delegates to meet with other organisations struggling for independence. The preliminary contacts did not yield any concrete alliances. The VNQDD also assailed the Vietnamese communists of Ho Chi Minh for betraying the leading nationalist of the timePhan Bội Châuto the French in return for a financial reward.

5|$|The {{attack on}} the gap began at 7:30am on 11 August, as a flight of Savioa-Marchetti SM.81 medium bombers {{attacked}} British defenders on Punjab Ridge. This half-hour assault {{was followed by a}} long artillery bombardment lasting until noon. At 12:30, the infantry attack began. II Brigade began moving slowly towards the Indians through the trackless wilderness north of the road, XIV Brigade attacked Mill, Knobbly, and Observation Hills, and XV Brigade clambered atop Punjab Ridge, engaging its defenders. The attacks of XIV Brigade against the Rhodesians failed, but XV Brigade managed to drive off the Indian defenders of Punjab Ridge. Counterattacks were mounted against the Italians, but these were unsuccessful. The Italian {{attack on the}} hills was renewed the next day, 12 August.

5|$|The match {{began as}} a scrappy affair, with plenty of {{challenges}} and little expansive football on show. The game's first notable chance went to Rooney, but Kolo Touré intervened and blocked his effort. Rooney then played in Giggs, whose shot was closed down by Sol Campbell. It took a while before Arsenal gained composure and played their usual passing game, and a move involving Edu and Fredrik Ljungberg in the 19th minute resulted in Rio Ferdinand carelessly tackling the latter. Ferdinand was not shown a card for his challenge – the first controversial decision referee Riley made during the match, which surprised Arsenal as the defender made a professional foul to prevent Ljungberg running clear on goal. Bergkamp exchanged passes with Reyes {{to open up the}} United defence, but the Dutchman's shot was saved by Roy Carroll. The United goalkeeper was on hand to save Henry's low shot three minutes before the break, after the striker was put through by Edu. During the first half action, both Neville brothers (Gary and Phil) were booked for fouling Reyes. Ashley Cole also received a yellow card for his tackle on Rooney. The Arsenal defender was on <b>the</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a challenge by Van Nistelrooy minutes after, as he attempted to shield the ball and hold on to possession. Television replays showed Van Nistelrooy ran his studs down Cole's shins, but the striker was not punished by Riley despite the action being in full view of his assistant at the touchline.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{consensus}} that universalisation of modern energy services is central to reducing major elements of poverty and hunger, increasing literacy and education, and improving health care, employment opportunities, and lives of women and children. In India, more than 700 million people lack access to modern energy services for lighting, cooking, water pumping and other productive purposes. Without these services people—most often women—are forced to spend significant amount of their time and energy on subsistence activities. This acts {{as a barrier to}} the gender development. Although the links between gender, poverty and energy have been studied by many authors, not many have come out with practical solutions. The present paper explores the nexus between gender-energy-poverty, highlights areas of gender concern, and suggests actions. We analyse how women from rural areas and low income households are at <b>the</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> energy poverty. We then analyse the roles of different stakeholders in universalizing modern energy services with specific emphasis to women. We argue how women self help groups can be a vital link in large scale diffusion of energy efficient and renewable technologies. The paper concludes with policy prescriptions of sustainable development and gender empowerment through energy solutions...|$|R

25|$|Beginning in 1836, the American artist Samuel F. B. Morse, the American {{physicist}} Joseph Henry, and Alfred Vail {{developed an}} electrical telegraph system.
