25|$|Shivaji was {{a devout}} Hindu, but {{respected}} all religions within the region. Shivaji had {{great respect for}} other contemporary saints, especially Samarth Ramdas, to whom he gave the fort of Parali, later renamed as 'Sajjangad'. Among the various poems written on Shivaji, Ramdas' Shivastuti ("Praise of King Shivaji") is the most famous. Shivaji's son Sambhaji later built a samadhi for Ramdas Swami on Sajjangad upon the latter's death. Samarth Ramdas had also written a letter to Sambhaji guiding him on what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> not to do after death of Shivaji.|$|E
25|$|Feaver {{argued that}} his theory was {{different}} from other theories or models {{in that it was}} purely deductive, based on democratic theory rather than on anecdotal evidence, and better enabled analysis of day-to-day decisions and actions {{on the part of the}} civilian and military leadership It operated at the intersection of Huntington's institutional approach and Janowitz's sociological point of view. Huntington concentrated on the relationship between civilian leadership and the military qua institution while Janowitz focused on the relationship of the military qua individuals to American society. Agency theory provided a link between the two enabling an explanation of how civil-military relations work on a day-to-day basis. Specifically, agency theory would predict that the result of a regime of intrusive monitoring by the civilian leadership combined with shirking on the part of the military would result in the highest levels of civil-military conflict. Feaver suggested that post-Cold War developments had so profoundly reduced the perceived costs of monitoring and reduced the perceived expectation of punishment that the gap between what civilians ask the military <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> the military would prefer to do had increased to unprecedented levels.|$|E

500|$|Another quandary {{is that if}} the precogs' visions are infallible {{then the}} future cannot be otherwise, while if they are {{incorrect}} people will be punished for crimes they will never commit. Kowalski contends that the precogs only attain knowledge of what he calls the [...] "conditional future". He cites as evidence two examples: the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them, and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex-wife what would have happened to their child if he had lived. In the first example, Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him, and, in the second, she knows what will have happened to the Anderton's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life, in which she can see what he would have freely chosen <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> selections various people in his life would have freely made. According to Kowalski, the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Australian Idol, Coulter was offered recording contracts by record labels including the show's sponsor Sony BMG, but she signed with Australia's biggest independent label Shock Records. Coulter explained, [...] "I'd {{met with a}} number of labels and Shock were the only one that asked me what I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> kind of album I wanted to make and who I wanted to work with". Her debut single [...] "Hell No!" [...] was released in June 2005, ahead of the related self-titled debut album, Ricki-Lee. The song peaked at numberfive on the ARIA Singles Chart – remaining in the top-ten for three consecutive weeks. It was eventually certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association, for shipments of 35,000 copies. [...] "Sunshine" [...] was released as her second single in September, which peaked at numbereight and was also certified gold. Ricki-Lee was released on 3 October 2005, which peaked at number 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Coulter collaborated with a several producers and songwriters on the album, including Audius Mtawarira, Israel Cruz, Nitty, Jarrad Rogers and Kara DioGuardi, among others. [...] "Breathe" [...] was released as the album's third and final single in January 2006, and reached number14. At the 2006 Australian and New Zealand Urban Music Awards, Ricki-Lee was nominated for 'Best R Album'.|$|E
500|$|Geoffrey Marshall has characterised section 3 as a [...] "deeply mysterious provision" [...] {{in several}} respects, {{including}} judging how strong a provision it is [...] an issue since {{dealt with by}} the courts [...] but has also noted a disparity between what the Act might be expected <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> it does. He argues that a litigant would hope that courts would strive to uphold his rights under the Convention, accepting a derivation from them only rarely; instead section 3 requires courts to find compatibility with the Convention where possible [...] in other words, to strive {{to find that the}} Convention does not impact the claimant. Alison L. Young has examined the upper boundaries to courts' powers of interpretation. She puts forward three possible limits: firstly, where the text of a statute is not ambiguous; secondly, where reading in words is inappropriate; and, thirdly, where any interpretation is restricted to cases where it does not involve implied repeal. Young dismisses the first two as incompatible with the legislative history (and, in at least the first case, judicial history) and believes the third to present no rigid limit on courts' powers at all. The decision of Pepper v Hart provides a method for the legislative history of a bill {{to play a role in}} its interpretation.|$|E

500|$|As Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the {{utilitarian}} John Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience {{does not}} necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self. Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that [...] "conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home." [...] Arendt believed {{that people who are}} unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can [...] "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" [...] bad people are not full of regrets. Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One reason, she held, was that conscience, as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like consciousness: [...] "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God." ...|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy... you what the other guy's going to do, what he's going <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he wants you to do.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{previously}} {{announcing his}} international retirement following the 2014 World Cup, Pirlo reversed his decision, and under new Italy manager, and Pirlo's former Juventus manager Antonio Conte, Pirlo {{returned to the}} Italian squad. On 10 October, Pirlo started in Italy's second Euro 2016 qualifying match, which ended in a 2–1 home win over Azerbaijan, overtaking Zoff with his 113th appearance for Italy. Pirlo assisted Chiellini's first goal of the match from a corner kick. In August 2015, Pirlo was called for Italy's Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Malta and Bulgaria in September; he appeared in Italy's 1–0 home victory over Malta on 3 September, becoming the first MLS player to represent Italy; this was his final international appearance. In total, Pirlo made four appearances under Conte, as Italy qualified for Euro 2016 on 10 October in a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan. On 23 May 2016, Pirlo, along with fellow MLS compatriot Giovinco, was left off of Conte's 30-player shortlist for Italy's Euro 2016 squad. Regarding their omission, Conte commented in a press conference: [...] "When you make a certain choice and go to play in certain leagues, you do so taking it into account that they could pay the consequences from a footballing viewpoint". In response to Conte's comments, Pirlo stated to Sky Italia: [...] "I have spoken to Conte {{and there is no}} disappointment on my part, he knows what he has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he should not do. We had discussions during the season and both parties made their own decisions. He is the coach and it's only right he makes his decisions and decides what is best for him. I hope Italy win although the favourites are other teams such as Germany, Spain and France." ...|$|E
