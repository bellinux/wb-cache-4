Despite the aridity, three amphibian species inhabit the park: the canyon tree frog, <b>the</b> <b>lowland</b> leopard frog, and Couch's spadefoot, which lives in underground burrows, emerging to breed during summer rains. Forest fires, which create erosion-prone burned areas, have destroyed many of the leopard frog's breeding pools, which fill with sediment.

25|$|Several {{distinct}} sub-regions within Mesoamerica {{are defined}} by a convergence of geographic and cultural attributes. These sub-regions are more conceptual than culturally meaningful, and the demarcation of their limits is not rigid. The Maya area, for example, {{can be divided into}} two general groups: <b>the</b> <b>lowlands</b> and highlands. <b>The</b> <b>lowlands</b> are further divided into the southern and northern Maya <b>lowlands.</b> <b>The</b> southern Maya <b>lowlands</b> are generally regarded as encompassing northern Guatemala, southern Campeche and Quintana Roo in Mexico, and Belize. <b>The</b> northern <b>lowlands</b> cover <b>the</b> remainder of the northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. Other areas include Central Mexico, West Mexico, <b>the</b> Gulf Coast <b>Lowlands,</b> Oaxaca, <b>the</b> Southern Pacific <b>Lowlands,</b> and Southeast Mesoamerica (including northern Honduras).|$|R
30|$|Agriculture in the uplands of Batatal {{is clearly}} less {{intensive}} in fertilizer use than in <b>the</b> <b>lowlands,</b> especially given that banana {{production in the}} uplands is carried out without fertilization.

As the sea level changed following the Pliocene era, vegetation was laid down which was later converted into peat. The peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E

5|$|The Classic {{period is}} largely {{defined as the}} period during which <b>the</b> <b>lowland</b> Maya raised dated monuments using the Long Count calendar. This period marked the peak of {{large-scale}} construction and urbanism, the recording of monumental inscriptions, and demonstrated significant intellectual and artistic development, particularly in the southern lowland regions. The Classic period Maya political landscape has been likened to that of Renaissance Italy or Classical Greece, with multiple city-states engaged in a complex network of alliances and enmities. The largest cities had populations numbering 50,000 to 120,000 and were linked to networks of subsidiary sites.|$|E
5|$|A {{network of}} roads {{developed}} in the Lowlands in this period. Drover's roads, between the Highlands and north-east England, had become established {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century and a series of military roads were built and maintained as a response to the Jacobite Risings in the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the period, most farming was based on <b>the</b> <b>Lowland</b> fermtoun or Highland baile, but a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged. This was the beginning of a process that would create a landscape of rectangular fields and carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting roads. There was an attempt improve agriculture, resulting in new crops, techniques and enclosures began to displace the run rig system and free pasture.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it gained}} recruits, the rising began {{to suffer from}} {{internal}} divisions, particularly between the Highlanders who made {{up the bulk of}} the forces and <b>the</b> <b>Lowland</b> nobles and officers who were their commanders. In early 1654, nine months into the revolt, Middleton, a Lowland officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester, arrived with a commission to command from Charles II. Despite objections from his followers, Glencairn surrendered control over his forces, which had now reached 3,500 foot and 1,500 horse. That evening Sir George Munro, Middleton's aide insulted Glencairn's forces and the result was a duel in which Munro was wounded. Glencairn was arrested. He would eventually be released and retire from the conflict. A series of other disputes and duels undermined the leadership of the campaign {{for the remainder of the}} rising.|$|E
5|$|Antoninus Pius soon {{reversed}} the containment policy {{of his predecessor}} Hadrian, and Urbicus was ordered to begin the reconquest of Lowland Scotland by moving north. Between 139 and 140 he rebuilt a fort at Corbridge and by 142 or 143, commemorative coins were issued celebrating a victory in Britain. It is therefore likely that Urbicus led the reoccupation of southern Scotland , probably using the 2nd Augustan Legion. He evidently campaigned against several British tribes (possibly including factions of the northern Brigantes), certainly against <b>the</b> <b>lowland</b> tribes of Scotland, the Votadini and Selgovae of the Scottish Borders region, and the Damnonii of Strathclyde. His total force may have been about 16,500 men.|$|E

5|$|In 1529 the Chuj city of San Mateo Ixtatán (then {{known by}} the name of Ystapalapán) was given in encomienda to the conquistador Gonzalo de Ovalle {{together}} with Santa Eulalia and Jacaltenango. In 1549, the first reduction of San Mateo Ixtatán took place, overseen by Dominican missionaries, in the same year the Q'anjob'al reducción settlement of Santa Eulalia was founded. Further Q'anjob'al reducciones were in place by 1560. Q'anjob'al resistance was largely passive, based on withdrawal to the inaccessible mountains and forests. In 1586 the Mercedarian Order built the first church in Santa Eulalia. The Chuj of San Mateo Ixtatán remained rebellious and resisted Spanish control for longer than their highland neighbours, resistance that was possible owing to their alliance with <b>the</b> <b>lowland</b> Lakandon Ch'ol to the north.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{revision}} of the Oryzomys of western Mexico, M.D. Carleton and J.

On {{the basis of these}} differences, they recognized O.albiventer as a species separate from <b>the</b> <b>lowland</b> populations, which they classified under O.couesi. They confirmed that Eliot's molestus was based on a large example of O.abiventer, but left the status of the three forms Goldman had associated with albiventer—crinitus, aztecus, and regillus—open, noting that there was no convincing evidence that these represented the same species as O.albiventer. The identity and exact provenance of fulgens (supposed to be from the Valley of Mexico), and consequently its relationship to O. albiventer, remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|Most farming {{was based}} on <b>the</b> <b>lowland</b> fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} {{of a handful of}} families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Previous {{research}} indicated high {{variability in}} availability and habitat use by female moose in <b>the</b> <b>lowlands</b> of Gros Morne National Park (GMNP), Newfoundland and Labrador, an area dominated by bogs and forest. Here, we extend the earlier analysis {{with an additional}} 7 female moose (Alces alces americana) occupying the Park highlands, a region dominated by heath and shrub vegeta-tion with forest limited to sheltered valleys, typical of interior and highland parts of the province. Resource selection function (RSF) models with differences in habitat use between moose resident in the 2 regions and 2 moose that migrated from <b>the</b> <b>lowlands</b> in winter to the highlands in summer were rejected. In summer, more use of closed-canopy forest types occurred on <b>the</b> <b>lowlands,</b> while more use of non-forest habitat types occurred on the highlands. As before, we found that selection of disturbed forest is a winter phenomenon on <b>the</b> <b>lowlands</b> of GMNP; <b>the</b> same series of habitat types associated with disturbance were avoided in summer. Summer migration by about 20 % of GMNP moose to the highlands suggests that foraging opportunities are better during that season than in winter, a motivation for migration perhaps augmented by an overabundance of moose on <b>the</b> <b>lowlands</b> and unfavourable temperatures in disturbed areas that might otherwise serve as lowland foraging areas.
