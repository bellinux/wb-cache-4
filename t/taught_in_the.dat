5|$|Carpenter {{was born}} in 1807, in Exeter, the first child of Lant Carpenter, a Unitarian {{minister}} in Exeter, and Anna (or Hannah) Penn.

He established a boarding school at Great George Street, Brandon Hill, which was run by his wife and daughters, where Mary studied the sciences, mathematics, Greek and Latin.

5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, law was <b>taught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> City of London, {{primarily}} by the clergy. During the 13th century, two events happened that destroyed this form of legal education; firstly, a decree by Henry III of England on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London, and secondly a papal bull was issued in 1254 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the common law, rather than canon law. As a result, the existing system of legal education fell apart. The common lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, the nearest place to the law courts at Westminster Hall that was outside the City.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} from December 5 to December 6, Petras Vileišis printed 36,000 {{copies of the}} {{resolution}} for distribution. After the assembly, notorious for its loud, lengthy and intense debates, the delegates returned to their communities and started {{to carry out its}} resolutions. The old Russian administrations were replaced in 125 out of the 280 volosts (82 in Kaunas, 33 in Suvalkai, and 10 in Vilnius Governorates). These communities elected their own representatives, organized their own schools where classes were <b>taught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian language, and stopped paying taxes. While the first Russian responses were disorganized and confused, the authorities soon marshaled their armed forces and returned the situation back to normal. The process was relatively peaceful; {{there were only a few}} clashes between armed groups of peasants and Tsarist military forces. Unlike in neighboring Latvia or Estonia, peasants did not rise against their landlords. A number of the most prominent activists of this movement were arrested and sent to Siberia.|$|E

5|$|For several centuries, {{education}} {{at one of}} the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a barrister. A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be <b>taught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of moots and rote learning. He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students. At the end of each legal term, particularly promising students would be transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education. By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, {{when the}} {{government}} required that Hindi be <b>taught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school system, E.V. Ramasamy organised opposition to this policy through the Justice Party. After 1937, the Dravidian movement derived considerable support from the student community. In later years, opposition to Hindi played {{a big role in}} the politics of Tamil Nadu. The fear of the Hindi language had its origin in the conflict between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. To the Tamils, acceptance of Hindi in the school system was a form of bondage. When the Justice Party weakened in the absence of mass support, E.V. Ramasamy took over the leadership of the party after being jailed for opposing Hindi in 1939. Under his tutelage the party prospered, but the party's conservative members, most of whom were rich and educated, withdrew from active participation.|$|E
5|$|In March 1911, Eldred earned First Class rank. He {{subsequently}} {{completed the}} 21 merit badges required for Eagle Scout.

As originally implemented, Eagle Scout {{was part of}} the merit badge system and was not a rank. Thus Eldred, like several of the early Eagles, did not earn the Life or Star awards that later preceded Eagle Scout. Eldred's merit badges were noted in the Honor Roll of the August 1912 edition of Boys' Life.|$|E

5|$|The doctrinal {{changes in}} the church {{occurred}} gradually, but by 1994, most of the concepts of Armstrongism had been largely modified or discontinued. However, the major bombshell was dropped during {{what is now called}} the Christmas Eve Sermon. Tapes of Tkach's sermon (dated January 7, 1995) were delivered to local congregations for viewing. In this sermon, he publicly declared that the Worldwide Church of God was a New Covenant church and, therefore, not bound by the terms of the Old Covenant. Christian theology defines the Old Covenant as the Mosaic Law embodied in the Torah. Hence, by making this statement, Tkach officially dropped all doctrines based on Mosaic Law (i.e., the keeping of the Sabbath, the Holy Days, and the dietary laws), making observance of such practices an individual choice. He also dropped the requirement of tithing, declaring that giving as <b>taught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New Testament was voluntary. The last change had a significant and rather immediate impact on church finances.|$|E
5|$|The {{first school}} to be {{established}} in the town was Kirkcaldy Burgh School in 1582 {{with the help of}} the local minister, Dr David Spens. Until premises were found, pupils were <b>taught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minister's house. Notable pupils include Robert Adam and Adam Smith. The school was located at Hill Street before being replaced by Kirkcaldy Grammar School on St Brycedale Avenue in 1843. A Government list of 1872 described the school as being of 'higher class'. A new building for the school was gifted to the town in 1893 by Michael Barker Nairn, a linen manufacturer. Other schools were established in the town, including girls schools, subscription schools, and apprentice schools. The passing of the Education (Scotland) Act in 1872 replaced voluntary education in the town with a school-based education for all children aged 5 to 13.|$|E
