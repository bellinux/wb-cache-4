40|$|The {{use of a}} {{custom-made}} {{palladium complex}} for the telomerisation of isoprene with alcohols under green conditions is described. Using a very low catalyst loading (0. 1 mol%), this protocol allows for the reactions {{to be carried out}} without the need of high pressure equipment, at room temperature and under solventless conditions, affording high yields of telomerization products with high selectivity towards linear head-to-head and tail-to-head <b>telomer...</b>|$|E
40|$|The telomerization of 1, 3 -butadiene {{with various}} {{alcohols}} {{has been investigated}} using a catalyst based on a Pd(acac) 2 precursor and a phosphine ligand, TOMPP (TOMPP = tris-(o-methoxyphenyl) phosphine). We were able to demonstrate the capability of the catalyst to telomerize 1, 3 -butadiene with various multifunctional nucleophiles having primary and secondary alcohol functions. High yields of <b>telomer</b> products (> 98 %) were obtained in very short reaction times...|$|E
25|$|The {{product is}} {{oxidized}} by SO3 to form PFOA. Under reaction conditions, <b>telomers</b> form with varying length chains containing an even number of carbon atoms, as products mostly contain {{two to six}} tetrafluoroethylene taxogens. After oxidation, distillation is used to separate PFOA from the other perfluorinated carboxylic acids. The telomerization synthesis of PFOA was pioneered by DuPont, {{and it is not}} well suited to the laboratory. PFOA formed by telomerization is completely linear, in contrast to the mixture of structures formed by ECF.|$|R
40|$|<b>Telomers</b> ionically {{tethered}} to nanometer-sized particles yield self-suspended, nanoparticle-Iaden liquids with unusual dynamical features. By subjecting these suspensions to controlled, modest shear strains, {{we find that}} their flow behaviors observed using experiments performed on time scales of tens of seconds can be projected to obtain maps of their dynamical response on geological time scales. That such extraordinarily slow dynamic processes can be uncovered from real-time measurements by simply stretching a system provides a simple but powerful tool for interrogating extremely slow motions in other jammed physical states. © 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to PFPE, Krytox grease also contains <b>telomers</b> of PTFE {{and in fact}} {{was designed as a}} liquid or grease form of PTFE. It is thermally stable, nonflammable (even in liquid oxygen), and insoluble in water, acids, bases, and most organic solvents. It is nonvolatile and useful over a broad temperature range of -75 to 350 C or higher. Its high resistance to ionizing radiation makes it useful for the aerospace and nuclear industries. Formulations exist able withstand extreme pressure, resist outgassing in high vacuum, and operate under intense mechanical stress.|$|R
