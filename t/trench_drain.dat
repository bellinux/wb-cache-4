50|$|To clean a grated <b>trench</b> <b>drain,</b> the grates on top must be removed. This can be {{difficult}} or frustrating if the grates are stuck, or tools are needed to pull them up. If {{it is a long}} run <b>trench</b> <b>drain,</b> it is time consuming to remove the <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> grates and put them back after cleaning. Slot drain can be cleaned by moving along a cleaning paddle to move the sediment into a catch basin.|$|E
50|$|Pre-cast trench drains {{generally}} come in 4-inch widths but {{can range}} {{anywhere from a}} 1-3/4-inch slot to 2-inch-wide channels with grates, and up to any size imaginable through custom <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> divisions. A home owner could consider a pre-cast trench for a landscaping project as there are many pre-cast <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> systems being manufactured specifically for the residential market. A person generally {{can go to a}} pre-caster or a distributor and buy 50 feet of <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> out of the yard; the cost of the material to create the trench drains can be more expensive than simply using cast-in-place systems, however the money saved through installation, maintenance, and longevity heavily outweighs those costs.|$|E
50|$|Fundamentally, {{the slot}} drain is {{another type of}} <b>trench</b> <b>drain.</b> Slot {{describes}} its appearance on the ground. It is preferable in areas with heavy traffic, or which require intense cleaning.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are four}} common types of <b>trench</b> <b>drains</b> {{which are based}} on forming or {{installation}} method.

50|$|Trench drains {{are made}} in a factory that specializes in making {{concrete}} shapes. The channel pieces range in width and length, larger channels requiring heavy equipment to move them, however most channels can be picked up and moved easily by hand. The channels are formed in large metal forms that (usually) have a pre-determined channel width, depth, and slope. Like in the cast-in-place method, a metal frame {{is attached to the}} form and concrete is poured and finished in a factory atmosphere. The advantage to the pre-cast <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> is again time savings - big time savings at the job site. Pre-cast trench drains made of a polymer concrete are also more sturdy and reliable than cast-in-place trenches. Once a trough is dug, the pre-cast trench sections can be installed and quickly be put into service through numerous methods. A patty method can be used by placing clumps of concrete at each <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> channel joint and the channels can be levelled and set as such. Further installation methods involve clipping rebar through installation device used with the channel. Concrete will need to be poured to surround the <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> so that the load can be transferred from the channel and grate to the surrounding areas.|$|E
50|$|A {{slot drain}} is a linear drain used to {{evacuate}} ground water. The {{difference between a}} slot drain and the traditional <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> is that the slot drain {{does not have any}} kind of grating. In recent years, this drainage concept is more often used in both indoor and outdoor applications, such as fire halls, car washes, landscaping, shower rooms and garages.|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{instability}} of existing railroad track substructures and embankments cause track deflections that require frequent maintenance, slow orders, and overall inefficiency of railroad operations. Substructure instability {{can be caused}} weak subgrade soils, poor-quality ballast, or inadequate thickness of the ballast and subballast layers. Typical problems that develop are subgrade shear failure, ballast pocket formation, and fouled ballast. As these problems develop, drainage becomes inhibited {{and the presence of}} water accelerates the problem. Slope instability problems that affect rail operations include embankment fill slope failures and landslides in natural slopes. Water, or water pressure, is often the primary cause of these types of instability. <b>Trench</b> <b>drains</b> are simple ballast-filled excavations that provide an effective means of draining water from the track substructure, embankment slopes and landslide areas. Removing water from these environments can lead to an immediate improvement in stability. <b>Trench</b> <b>drains</b> are extremely adaptable to various site and subsurface conditions. They provide several advantages over other stabilization methods currently in use. They are simple to understand, economical to construct, and have proven effective on thousands of sites around the country...|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>trench</b> <b>drains</b> in {{construction}} {{began with the}} commission by the British Airports Authority of a company called Gatic. Airports were {{in need of a}} form of trench drainage with fewer movable parts and less tendency to collapse under heavy traffic than the traditional drainage gratings. Gatic designed and engineered the first stainless steel slot drain, and it was installed first at Stanstead Airport in the UK, following which it was specified at Britain’s most famous airport - Heathrow. These airports continue to use stainless steel slot drainage both airside and landside for surface water drainage requirements.|$|R
50|$|The popular {{trend in}} <b>trench</b> <b>drains</b> are linear systems. Linear as in line drain. Made from {{materials}} such as polymer concrete, fiberglass, structural plastic and steel, liner systems are the channel and grate components that are assembled in the trench and around which concrete is poured to form a drain system. By themselves, these liner systems {{do not have the}} strength and integrity to hold up under the physical requirements needed for the drain. A concrete (or asphalt) drain body is required to encase the channel to give the channel compressive strength and rigidity to ensure the drain will be able to withstand the traffic load it was designed to handle.|$|R
50|$|Trench drains are {{commonly}} confused with French drains, which {{consist of a}} perforated pipe that is buried in a gravel bed, and which are used to evacuate ground water. A slot drain, also wrongly associated with a <b>trench</b> <b>drain,</b> consists of a drainage pipe with a thin neck (or slot) that opens at the ground surface with sufficient opening to drain storm water.|$|E
50|$|A <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> (also channel drain, line drain, slot drain, linear drain or strip drain) is a {{specific}} type of floor drain containing a dominant trough- or channel-shaped body. It is used for the rapid evacuation of surface water or for the containment of utility lines or chemical spills. Employing a solid cover or grating that is flush with the adjoining surface, this drain is commonly made of concrete in-situ and may utilize polymer- or metal-based liners or a channel former to aid in channel crafting and slope formation. Characterized by its long length and narrow width, the cross-section of the drain {{is a function of the}} maximum flow volume anticipated from the surrounding surface. Channels can range from 1 in to 2 feet in width, with depths that can reach 4 ft.|$|E
50|$|This {{installation}} {{method is}} by far the most labor-intensive. In addition, material cost is a function of the width of the grate used in the trench.There are three main reasons why this is labor-intensive: the outlet pipe position in the floor, the levelling of the trench grate in the floor, and integration of the waterproofing. If the outlet is not exactly in the centre, then the channel must be customized, increasing cost and time to construct.This can be overcome by the use of modular <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> systems. These allow the drain pipe to be connected anywhere along the trench, giving the builder and plumber more freedom to place the services, reducing construction time and costs, particularly in high-rise situations where moving plumbing services can be nearly impossible. Achieving a curbless or hobless entrance for special needs access is more readily achieved with a modular system, as the levelling of the shower floor to the bathroom floor is inherently problematic with non-modular systems as they have no on-site adjustment.Waterproofing is possibly the most critical aspect of the bathroom when integrating a channel/trench drain. There are two ways to approach the waterproofing issue. First is to develop a proprietary method where the waterproofing and <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> are a kit. Second is to separate the waterproofing and trench drain.The first method has the benefit of an 'all-in-one' solution, but the downside is cost and limitation of the system in varying applications, i.e. limited generally to bathroom application. The second method is generally safest as the waterproofing is completed using established proven methods that most building contractors are familiar with. A second benefit is when the waterproofing is a separate item all methods of waterproofing (cementeous, bitumized, fibreglassed, paint-on, sweat-on, lead-lined, copper pan etc.) can be utilized. This will allow a modular system to be used in many applications such as pools, balconies, thresholds, pedestrian areas, public areas, essentially most wet areas where a waterproofing system is required, be it on ground or above (suspended slab).Stainless steel trench drains can also be installed in a home's shower and in commercial locations like hospital rooms, changing rooms and operating rooms.|$|E

Previous work had considered the soil surface covered by a water layer, thus acting as an equipotential of the seepage process. The difference between the two boundary conditions is rather significant in both the transient and steady state. In any real problem, the boundary conditions at the soil surface are likely to change continuously between the above limit, depending on the succession of rainy and dry periods at the particular site considered. The combined swelling and consolidation process resulting from intermittent rainfall is analysed, trying to give practical indications for the design of drain system...|$|R

50|$|The {{idea behind}} SuDS {{is to try}} to {{replicate}} the drainage patterns of natural systems by using cost-effective solutions with low environmental impact to drain away dirty and surface water run-off through collection, storage, and cleaning before allowing it to be released slowly back into the environment, such as into water courses. This is to counter the effects of conventional drainage systems that often allow for flooding, pollution of the environment - with the resultant harm to wildlife - and contamination of groundwater sources used to provide drinking water. The paradigm of SuDS solutions should be that of a system that is easy to manage, requiring little or no energy input (except from environmental sources such as sunlight, etc.), resilient to use, and being environmentally as well as aesthetically attractive. Examples of this type of system are basins (shallow landscape depressions that are dry most of the time when it's not raining), rain gardens (shallow landscape depressions with shrub or herbaceous planting), swales (shallow normally-dry, wide-based ditches), filter drains (gravel filled <b>trench</b> <b>drain),</b> bioretention basins (shallow depressions with gravel and/or sand filtration layers beneath the growing medium), reed beds and other wetland habitats that collect, store, and filter dirty water along with providing a habitat for wildlife.|$|E

40|$|Water {{flow through}} road {{structures}} {{is a topic}} of great interest in civil engineering, as water {{is one of the}} factors that most affects the hydraulic and mechanical behavior of road materials. Efficient design of subsurface drainage improves the performance of road pavement. Conventional drainage systems, such as trench drains may not be wholly effective in reducing water-related problems, and in fact, may inadvertently reduce pavement performance and service life. This can be because conventional drainage is projected in saturated conditions; however, most water flow near the surface occurs under unsaturated conditions. This paper presents an experimental study to design a new prefabricated prototype for the subsurface drainage of road pavements (SubDrain). SubDrain has been designed by using rapid prototyping Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) with powder polyamide material and experimental validation tests, with the aim to evaluate the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of the prototype. The results of this study show that the new prefabricated prototype is a potential technology solution to replace the conventional <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> systems currently used in road projects.

40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} of small dams often requires the reduction or control of groundwater seepage through or under earthen dams. The slurry trench method {{is well known}} for creating impermeable groundwater barriers and has been used for decades to create economical and positive cutoff walls in the core or foundation soils beneath dams and dikes of many types and sizes. This paper examines three innovative modifications of the slurry trench method and their applications in the {{rehabilitation of}} three small dams. Case histories of each dam and slurry trench method are described. The slurry trench technique uses an engineered fluid for support of trench walls. Usually the fluid is bentonite slurry that coats the trench walls and permanently blocks the free flow of water. If, however, the fluid is degradable, a permeable backfill, such as sand or gravel can be backfilled in the trench to create a permeable zone such as a toe drain or chimney drain. This method is known as the bio-polymer <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> method and has been used {{for more than a decade}} in the waste remediation industry to collect contaminated groundwater, and more recently in the rehabilitation of dams.

40|$|International audienceShallow {{landslides}} on steep (> 25 °) hillsides along Puget Sound {{have resulted}} in occasional loss of life and costly damage to property during intense or prolonged rainfall. As {{part of a larger}} project to assess landslide hazards in the Seattle area, the U. S. Geological Survey instrumented two coastal bluff sites in 2001 to observe the subsurface hydrologic response to rainfall. The instrumentation at one of these sites, near Edmonds, Washington, consists of two rain gauges, two water-content probes that measure volumetric water content at eight depths between 0. 2 and 2. 0 m, and two tensiometer nests that measure soil-water suction at six depths ranging from 0. 2 to 1. 5 m. Measurements from these instruments are used to test one- and two-dimensional numerical models of infiltration and groundwater flow. Capillary-rise tests, performed in the laboratory on soil sample from the Edmonds site, are used to define the soil hydraulic properties for the wetting process. The field observations of water content and suction show an apparent effect of porosity variation with depth on the hydraulic response to rainfall. Using a range of physical properties consistent with our laboratory and field measurements, we perform sensitivity analyses to investigate the effects of variation in physical and hydraulic properties of the soil on rainfall infiltration, pore-pressure response, and, hence, slope stability. For a two-layer-system in which the hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer is at least 10 times greater than the conductivity of the lower layer, and the infiltration rate is greater than the conductivity of the lower layer, a perched water table forms above the layer boundary potentially destabilizing the upper layer of soil. Two-dimensional modeling results indicate that the addition of a simple <b>trench</b> <b>drain</b> to the same two-layer slope has differing effects on the hydraulic response depending on the initial pressure head conditions. For slope-parallel flow conditions, pressure head is significantly reduced near the drain; however, for transient, vertical infiltration in a partially saturated soil, conditions consistent with those observed during monitoring at the Edmonds site, the drain decreases the thickness of a perched water table by a small amount...|$|E
40|$|The ‘Glasgow Surface Water Management Project’ is Glasgow City Council’s {{contribution}} to the Transformation of Rural and Urban Spatial Structure (TRUST) project, one of the European Union’s (EU) inter‐regional (INTERREG IIIB) funded research projects. This project assesses how sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) can contribute to relieving stress on the current predominantly combined sewer system. Fifty‐seven sites within Glasgow were assessed with a novel SUDS feasibility tool {{that can be used}} for stormwater resources assessment, development, planning and management in developed and developing countries. Two environmental desk studies incorporating historical planning issues that are relevant for regeneration were undertaken. A combination of infiltration trenches or swales with ponds or underground storage were the most likely SUDS options for the majority of the areas studied.

50|$|As with {{a number}} of modern service stations, many have an {{ecological}} aspect such as an sustainable drainage system, rain-harnessing or a renewable energy source. Cobham has been designed to include a sustainable drainage system that filters the water from silt and sand, cleans the water, and then naturally attenuates the water into local watercourses. Retention basins, swales and infiltration trenches deal with excess water, storm water and most importantly flood risk. The infiltration <b>trenches</b> <b>drain</b> water using pebbles and small stones which naturally filter and store water, the remaining stored water is channeled out of the site. The retention basins collect water runoff, and the water outflow out of the basins is carefully controlled, the lakes have water piped to infiltration trenches. Even though these basins are designed to collect water and drain water in a more controlled way, some water escapes and seeps (infiltrates) into the ground. Depending on the season the water level in all of these trenches and basins change dramatically. The infiltration trenches then flow into local watercourses. The swales (marsh areas) are less complex and drain water directly into the ground, they are surrounded by vegetation. Just like infiltration trenches, swales also attenuate, filter and clean water. Vegetation which is around the service area and its drainage system, helps to absorb harmful substances to the environment and clean water in the infiltration trenches, swales, retention basins and around the site.|$|R
40|$|The basin {{clay soil}} occupying an {{extensive}} {{area between the}} great rivers in the Netherlands {{is characterized by a}} profile with a highly permeable surface layer (20 cm) over a poorly permeable second layer (50 cm, K = 0. 05 metre/ day) and a highly permeable subsoil (KD) = 1 metre 2 /day). In this profile, a deep discharge in vertical direction through the second layer and in horizontal direction through the subsoil takes place. A shallow discharge in horizontal direction may occur, through the surface layer. There is surface run-off under special conditions. The occurrence of shallow discharge is determined by the relation between precipitation rate and infiltration capacity of the second layer. When the watertable remains below the top of this second layer, infiltration occurs in unsaturated soil, since infiltration capacity exceeds or practically equals the hydraulic conductivity of the second layer. But when the watertable reaches the top of the second layer, infiltration capacity becomes equal to the discharge rate of the drainage system in the highly permeable subsoil. The lower the initial watertable in the subsoil {{at the start of a}} rainy period, the longer the rain has to infiltrate into an unsaturated soil. Good drainage can be achieved under the rainfall of the Netherlands with an adequate system of ditches and tile lines only if in the highly permeable subsoil, so reducing radial resistance.

In this case pore pressure lowering, due to trenches, can be analyzed considering the progressively reduction of the saturated domain.
