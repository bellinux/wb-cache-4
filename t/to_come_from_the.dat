5|$|Royal {{power was}} restricted, as the king lost {{the power to}} give titles and {{positions}} of military officers, ministers and senators, and the starostwo territories for Crown lands, most {{of which would be}} awarded through an auction. In return, the king received four starostwa for personal possession. The royal (free) election was confirmed, with stipulations that future kings had <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Polish nobility, and sons and grandsons of any king could not succeed him to the throne till two others had held it in the interim.|$|E
50|$|Of this sum, $24.7 {{million was}} to be contributed by the State of New Jersey.

5|$|The eye of Hurricane Katrina was {{forecast}} to {{pass through}} the city of New Orleans. In that event, the wind was predicted <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north as the storm passed, forcing large volumes of water from Lake Pontchartrain against the levees and possibly into the city. It was also forecast that the storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain would reach , with waves reaching 7feet (2m) above the storm surge.|$|E
5|$|The olive appears <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{region of}} Persia and Mesopotamia, at least 6,000 years ago. It spread {{from there to}} nearby areas, and has been {{cultivated}} since the early Bronze Age (up to 3,150 BC) in southern Turkey, the Levant, and Crete. The ten countries with the largest harvests (in 2011) are all near the Mediterranean (Portugal being the tenth largest): together, they produce 95% of the world's olives.|$|E
5|$|At night, Reshef {{moved with}} his {{remaining}} forces {{north along the}} canal bank. Bypassing the 16th Brigade's positions, the Israelis soon found themselves {{in the center of}} a huge administrative area and vehicle park. Reshef's brigade had stumbled into the command and supply bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. The base was located near the canal on the assumption that it was the safest location from Israeli attacks, which was expected <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east, where the defenses were the strongest, not from the south, where they were the weakest. Both sides immediately opened fire, inadvertently leading to the destruction of supply trucks and SAM launchers. The Egyptians managed to organize a counterattack by units of the 21st Division; a battalion of the 14th Brigade and a battalion (less one company) of the 18th Brigade. The tanks repelled the Israelis, who sustained significant losses from vastly overwhelming opposing forces.|$|E

5|$|Depending on {{the success}} of VIII Corps attack, I Corps would then launch two {{supporting}} operations codenamed Aberlour and Ottawa. In the former the 3rd Infantry Division, supported by a Canadian infantry brigade, would attack north of Caen; the latter would be a move by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade to take the village and airfield of Carpiquet. Originally planned for 22 June, Epsom was postponed until 26 June, to make up deficiencies in manpower and materiel. The initial opposition was expected <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> depleted 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend ("Hitler Youth"), elements of the 21st Panzer Division, and the Panzer Lehr.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, the Indian National Congress {{was elected}} to power in the Presidency of Madras for the first time. Chakravarti Rajagopalachari was the first Chief Minister of the Presidency <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Congress party. He {{successfully}} enacted the Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity Act and introduced both prohibition and sales taxes in the Madras Presidency. His rule is largely remembered {{for the use of}} Hindi being made compulsory in educational institutions, a measure which made him highly unpopular as a politician and sparked widespread Anti-Hindi agitations, which led to violence in some places. Over 1,200 men, women, and children were jailed for their participation in such Anti-Hindi agitations while Thalamuthu and Natarasan died during the protests. In 1940, Congressional ministers resigned in protest over the Government of India's declaration of war on Germany without their consent. The Governor of Madras, Sir Arthur Hope, took over the administration and the unpopular law was eventually repealed by him on 21 February 1940.|$|E
5|$|In this period, {{while the}} Great Migration of African Americans {{out of the}} South to the North was beginning, blacks in the two regions dealt with {{different}} conditions. The {{vast majority of the}} millions of African Americans still lived in the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out of the political process. This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints of their environment. At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter registration and electoral restrictions. Trotter and other radicals tended <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination.|$|E

5|$|Lawrence {{was hired}} as an {{associate}} professor of physics at the University of California in 1928, and two years later became a full professor, becoming the university's youngest professor. Robert Gordon Sproul, who became university president the day after Lawrence became a professor, {{was a member of the}} Bohemian Club, and he sponsored Lawrence's membership in 1932. Through this club, Lawrence met William Henry Crocker, Edwin Pauley, and John Francis Neylan. They were influential men who helped him obtain money for his energetic nuclear particle investigations. There was great hope for medical uses <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> development of particle physics, and this led to much of the early funding for advances Lawrence was able to obtain.|$|E
5|$|The December 2002 Global and All-Inclusive Agreement devoted Chapter VII to {{the armed}} forces. It stipulated that {{the armed forces}} chief of staff, and the chiefs of the army, air force, and navy were not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same warring faction. The new 'national, {{restructured}} and integrated' army would be made up from Kabila's government forces (the FAC), the RCD, and the MLC. Also stipulated in VII(b) was that the RCD-N, RCD-ML, and the Mai-Mai would {{become part of the}} new armed forces. An intermediate mechanism for physical identification of the soldiers, and their origin, date of enrolment, and unit was also called for (VII(c)). It also provided {{for the creation of a}} Conseil Superieur de la Defense (Superior Defence Council) which would declare states of siege or war and give advice on security sector reform, disarmament/demobilization, and national defence policy.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{benefit of}} the TRIM command depends upon the free user space on the SSD. If the user {{capacity}} on the SSD was 100GB and the user actually saved 95GB of data to the drive, any TRIM operation would not add more than 5GB of free space for garbage collection and wear leveling. In those situations, {{increasing the amount of}} over-provisioning by 5GB would allow the SSD to have more consistent performance because it would always have the additional 5GB of additional free space without having to wait for the TRIM command <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> OS.|$|E

5|$|The {{break with}} Rome was not, by itself, a Reformation. That was <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{dissemination}} of ideas. The {{views of the}} German reformer Martin Luther and his school were widely known and disputed in England. A major manifestation of theological radicalism in England was Lollardy, a movement deriving from the writings of John Wycliffe, the 14th century Bible translator, which stressed the primacy of Scripture. But after the execution of Sir John Oldcastle, leader of the Lollard rebellion of 1415, they never again {{had access to the}} levers of power, and by the 15th century were much reduced in numbers and influence.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the word walrus is thought by J.R.R. Tolkien to derive from a Germanic language, {{and it has been}} {{attributed}} largely to either the Dutch language or Old Norse. Its first part is thought to derive from a word such as Dutch walvis 'whale'. Its second part has also been hypothesized <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Old Norse word for 'horse'. For example, the Old Norse word hrossvalr means 'horse-whale' and is thought to have been passed in an inverted form to both Dutch and the dialects of northern Germany as walros and Walross. An alternate theory is that is comes from the Dutch words wal 'shore' and reus 'giant'.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Combined Development Trust was to {{purchase}} or control the mineral resources needed by the Manhattan Project, and to avoid competition between the three. Britain had little need for uranium ores while the war continued, but was anxious to secure adequate supplies for its own nuclear weapons programme when it ended. Half the funding was <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States and half from Britain and Canada. The initial $12.5 million was transferred to Groves from an account {{in the office of}} the United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., that was not subject to the usual accounting auditing and oversight. By the time Groves resigned from the Trust at the end of 1947, he had deposited $37.5 million into an account he controlled at the Bankers Trust. Payments were then made from this account.|$|E

5|$|The {{two main}} sports {{with which the}} Rhondda {{appeared}} to produce quality participants were rugby union and boxing. One of the first true rugby stars <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rhondda was Willie Llewellyn, who not only gained 20 caps for Wales scoring 48 points, but {{was also the first}} Rhondda born member of the British Lions. Such was Llewellyn's fame that during the Tonypandy Riots, his pharmacy was left unscathed by the crowds due to his past sporting duties. Many players came through the Rhondda to gain international duty, and after the split between amateur rugby union and the professional Northern League, many were also tempted to the North of England to earn a wage for their abilities. Amongst the new league players was Jack Rhapps, Aberaman born, but living in the Rhondda when he 'Went North', eventually becoming the world's first dual-code international rugby player.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{means of}} paying for the statue was a commemorative coin. In early 1899, the commission sought enactment of legislation granting it an appropriation of $50,000 {{in the form of}} 100,000 commemorative half dollars, that could be sold to the public at a premium. Such a method had helped to finance (though with mixed success) the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Instead, Congress passed and McKinley signed on March 3, 1899, a civil appropriations bill that included provision for 50,000 silver one-dollar pieces to be granted to the commission. The bullion for the striking was to be purchased on the open market and was not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mint's remaining stocks acquired pursuant to the repealed Sherman Silver Purchase Act, though the Mint would not exhaust its inventory from that legislation until 1904. Congress placed a ceiling on the cost of the silver at $25,000. In the event, the United States Treasury bought 38,675.875 troy ounces of silver for $23,032.80. The designs were to be selected by the Mint Director, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{called for}} Hubble to be {{serviced}} in February 2005, but the Columbia disaster in 2003, {{in which the}} orbiter disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere, had wide-ranging effects on the Hubble program. NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe decided that all future shuttle missions {{had to be able}} to reach the safe haven of the International Space Station should in-flight problems develop. As no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the ISS during the same mission, future crewed service missions were canceled. This decision was assailed by numerous astronomers, who felt that Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk. HST's planned successor, the James Webb Telescope (JWST), was not expected to launch until at least 2018. A gap in space-observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers, given the significant scientific impact of HST. The consideration that JWST will not be located in low Earth orbit, and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure, only makes these concerns more acute. On the other hand, many astronomers felt strongly that the servicing of Hubble should not take place if the expense were <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> JWST budget.|$|E
