5|$|Ville Hermanni Valo {{was born}} on 22 November 1976 in Helsinki, Finland, to Kari and Anita Valo. A few months after Ville's birth, the Valo-family moved from Vallila to Oulunkylä, where Ville later {{attended}} comprehensive school. Anita Valo worked at a shoe shop, and later as {{an employee of the}} city of Helsinki, while Kari Valo was a taxi driver. He later gave up <b>this</b> <b>profession,</b> and opened a sex shop in Helsinki, called Aikuisten lelukauppa, where Ville worked occasionally as a teenager.|$|E
5|$|Born in Toronto {{with the}} surname Nudelman, Newman {{was the son}} of a Russian-Jewish {{immigrant}} father who ran a shoe shop. After studying at Ogden Public School, which he left at the age of thirteen, he later enrolled in the Central Technical School, studying art and design subjects. He initially attempted to follow a career as a stills photographer and an artist, specialising in drawing film posters. However, he found it so difficult to earn enough money to make a living from <b>this</b> <b>profession</b> that instead, he switched to working in the film industry itself. In 1938, he travelled to Hollywood, where he was offered a role with the Walt Disney Company on the strength of his graphic design work. However, he was unable to take the job due to a failure to secure a work permit. Returning to his native country, in 1941, he gained a job as a film editor at the National Film Board of Canada. He was eventually to work on over 350 films while an editor for the NFB.|$|E

25|$|In Poland, {{there are}} two main types of legal professions: {{advocate}} and legal counsel. Both are regulated and these professions are restricted only for people who graduated five-year law studies, have at least three years of experience and passed five difficult national exams (civil law, criminal law, company law, administrative law and ethic) or have a doctor of law degree. Before 2015, the only difference was that advocates have a right to represent clients before the court in all cases and the legal advisors could not represent clients before the court in criminal cases. Presently, the legal advisors can also represent clients in criminal cases so currently, the differences between <b>this</b> <b>professions</b> are only historical significance.|$|R

She achieved her first teacher's certificate in 1839, at only 17 years old. <b>This</b> <b>profession</b> interested Barton greatly and helped motivate her; she ended up conducting an effective redistricting campaign that allowed the children of workers to receive an education. Successful projects such as this gave Clara the confidence needed when she demanded equal pay for teaching.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} requirement {{was to have}} a three-person {{flight crew}} – captain, first officer and flight engineer – as opposed to a four- or five-person crew, as on other Soviet airliners. It became evident that a fourth crew member, a navigator, was still needed, and a seat was added on production aircraft, although their workstation was compromised due to the limitations of the original design. Navigators are no longer trained and <b>this</b> <b>profession</b> is becoming obsolete with the retirement of older Soviet-era planes.|$|E

Working from an office in Villiers Street, Gourley expanded his business to include the exportation of coal and the importation of timber.

25|$|The women {{involved}} {{in the practice of}} prostitution in Pakistan can be divided into three broad categories: women who have been trafficked or lured into the profession, women who have been born into the profession and women who willingly seek out a pimp to make extra money. Trafficked women are mainly found in the brothels, while those who willingly join <b>this</b> <b>profession</b> work as call girls, usually accompanied by a dalal or bharva or pimp. Those born into the profession are 'schooled' at home and operate under the management of their mother or another older female relative.|$|E

25|$|Men were {{introduced}} into the field of obstetrics {{in the nineteenth century}} and resulted in a change of the focus of <b>this</b> <b>profession.</b> Gynaecology directly resulted as a new and separate field of study from obstetrics and focused on the curing of illness and indispositions of female sexual organs. This had some relevance to some conditions as menopause, uterine and cervical problems, and childbirth could leave the mother in need of extensive surgery to repair tissue. But, there was also a large blame of the uterus for completely unrelated conditions. This led to many social consequences of the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Nathan's father passionately opposed London's public entertainments: he {{delivered}} a sermon which attributed Divine judgment {{to the collapse of}} the public seating area, during a bear baiting on a Sunday, at Beargarden in 1583, which resulted in several deaths. Nathan presumably did not intend a career in the theatre; he was a student of Richard Mulcaster at St. Paul's School in the late 1590s. At some point before 1600, he was impressed by Nathaniel Giles, the master of Elizabeth's choir and one of the managers of the new troupe of boy players at Blackfriars Theatre, called alternately the Children of the Chapel Royal and the Blackfriars Children. He remained in <b>this</b> <b>profession</b> for the remainder of his life, later adding to it the profession of a playwright. John Field was buried on 26 March 1588.|$|E

500|$|Exterior {{shots of}} the alien world were shot in Iceland, where filming {{occurred}} for two weeks.

Speaking about working at the volcano, Scott said, [...] "If one is afraid of nature in <b>this</b> <b>profession</b> then {{it would be best to}} find a different job". Filming also took place at Dettifoss, one of the most powerful waterfalls in Europe. The Iceland shoot involved 160 Icelandic crew members and over 200 imported crew. Scott said that the filming in Iceland comprised approximately fifteen minutes of footage for the film, and that the area represented the beginning of time. Morocco had been chosen as a location for these scenes, but the 2010 Arab Spring protests forced the change of venue. Alternatives including the Mojave Desert had been considered, but Scott explained that Iceland was ultimately chosen because [...] "here it is so rough and 'Jurassic-like' and that proved decisive".|$|E
500|$|... "Mom and Pop Art" [...] {{was written}} by current showrunner Al Jean and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April11,1999. It was the first episode Jean wrote after returning to The Simpsons writing staff. For three years, Jean had worked with Mike Reiss on the fantasy sitcom Teen Angel, a job which he despised. [...] "Every other day [...] I said 'I wish I was back at The Simpsons," [...] Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode. The idea for the episode came from {{a segment of the}} television news magazine 60 Minutes. The segment was about found artists, who, Jean said, [...] "take basically garbage and assemble it and turn it into artwork that would sell {{for tens of thousands of}} dollars." [...] Jean thought that <b>this</b> <b>profession</b> would fit Homer. In the episode, [...] "Start here tomorrow 7/17/95" [...] is written in blue paint on the Simpsons' garage door. The date refers to Scully and Julie Thacker's anniversary, which was on July17,1995. In the episode's setpiece, the Simpsons visit a hardware store. The segment was inspired by Jean's father, who owned a hardware store that Al Jean used to work in as a child. Later in the setpiece, Homer tries to construct a barbecue that he bought from the hardware store. The scene was also conceived by Jean, and is executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully's favorite setpiece.|$|E
