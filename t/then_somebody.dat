"Heartbreak Hotel" [...] was {{the second}} song Presley {{recorded}} at RCA Victor, following [...] "I Got a Woman", during his debut session at 1525 McGavock Street in Nashville on January 10, 1956. Presley arrived at the studio with the song ready to record without seeking RCA's approval, and although producer Steve Sholes was {{not sure that it}} would be a success, he recorded [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] believing that Presley knew what he was doing. Recording at RCA Victor was a different experience for Presley and his band, who were used to a more relaxed atmosphere at Sun Studio. Guitar player Scotty Moore later commented, [...] "It was a larger studio than Sun's and more regimented - they called everything by a tape number. We would sit around at Sun, eat hamburgers and <b>then</b> <b>somebody</b> would say, 'Let's try something.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Following the touring cycle for Cross Purposes, bassist Geezer Butler {{quit the}} band {{for the second}} time. [...] "I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much {{preferred}} the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing". Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released Plastic Planet in 1995. The album contained the song [...] "Giving Up the Ghost", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone ("I heard it's something about me..." [...] said Iommi. [...] "I had the album given to me a while back. I played it once, <b>then</b> <b>somebody</b> else had it, so I haven't really {{paid any attention to}} the lyrics... It's nice to see him doing his own thing – getting things off his chest. I don't want to get into a rift with Geezer. He's still a friend." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Tahil's departure, plots were {{abandoned}} and many scripts {{had to be}} rewritten. EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan revealed that it was intended that Dan would be murdered by his children after prolonged bullying and abuse, saying [...] "The family arrived in Albert Square in what {{was expected to be}} a huge storyline. The father [...] was an oppressive and violent bully – eventually his children were going to kill him. It was all scripted – how they buried him in a shallow grave, how they dealt with it, and how it all exploded. And then Dalip got bloody deported. He was actually on the studio floor and they marched him off. Broken legs, nervous breakdowns – we can deal with that. But when actors are physically taken away by the government and deported, there's not much you can do. Fifty scripts had to be reworked. And because all the episodes had been written around this big storyline, we had to keep the same amount of Ferreira material." [...] The murder storyline was replaced with one concerning a kidney transplant between Ronny and his newly discovered half brother Tariq. Jordan admitted they could have recast the character of Dan, but it may have looked [...] "tacky": [...] "We couldn't go, 'Tonight, the part of Mr Ferreira will be played by Michael French with a suntan'. We were trying to do it with integrity. <b>Then</b> <b>somebody</b> said, 'What if Ronnie Ferreira's mate Tariq turns out to be his half-brother and we do the whole kidney transplant thing?' And, of course, it was like watching paint dry. 'Can I have your kidney?' 'No. Oh, go on then...'" [...] Jordan told the Daily Mirror the Ferreiras were [...] "the least successful characters I created – through no fault of their own." ...|$|E

Dixon {{believes that}} the song's lyrics are about the couple's [...] "implicit promise of regeneration through love." [...] 29 lines in length, {{all of which are}} exactly five syllables, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] is a love song about a couple's transformation from friends into [...] "something more". The film's theme song, its lyrics [...] "capture the essence of the film" [...] by describing the relationship between Beauty and the Beasts two main characters, specifically citing ways in which the two have changed each other for the better and finally learned to accept their differences and mistakes. According to Jake Cole of Not Just Movies, the first stanza begins [...] "in earnest, and the subtlety of it has the ironic effect of being overpowering." [...] Beginning with Lansbury singing the lyrics [...] "Tale as old as time, true as it can be," [...] JoBlo.com wrote that the song [...] "offers a sure sign of romance between the Beauty and her Beast." [...] Meanwhile, Songfacts believes that [...] "The message of the song is that a couple can be 'as old as time' no matter how different they are." [...] According to Chris Lucas of Moviepilot, Ashman's lyrics describe the couple's [...] "hesitation and surprise at falling in love unexpectedly," [...] while author Thomas S. Hischak wrote in The Disney Song Encyclopedia that the song is [...] "about how two tentative hearts are united in love." [...] Featuring the line [...] "Barely even friends, <b>then</b> <b>somebody</b> bends, unexpectedly," [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune {{believes that the}} ballad [...] "makes the case for all lovers to look past their partners' faults and into their hearts," [...] while Cole wrote, [...] "Ashman goes for the truth ... we don't know we're in love until we spend time with someone and unforced adjustments make the pieces fall into place." [...] The Emperor's Old Groove: Decolonizing Disney's Magic Kingdom author Brenda Ayres cited the song as an [...] " [...] that a reciprocal power relationship has developed between Belle and the Beast ... confirm 'his transformation, her legitimacy, and their powerful unity."

[...] The Meanings of [...] "Beauty and the Beast": A Handbook author Jerry Griswold believes that the song's opening line [...] "tale as old as time" [...] alludes to the fact that Belle's story is an ancient, timeless one [...] "deliberately situated within the context of other traditional tales;" [...] hers is simply [...] "the newest incarnation" [...] of it. The Translation of the Songs in Disney's [...] "Beauty and the Beast": an example of Manipulation author Lucía Loureiro Porto agrees that although the song [...] "does not tell any story, it is made of phrases that imply that love is as old a feeling as mankind." [...] According to Perry Seibert of AllMovie, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] is [...] "as sappy as Ashman ever got as a lyricist." [...] Seibert believes that the song [...] "acknowledges its own banality ... without minimizing or mocking its inherently sweet description of true love." [...] Reflecting upon Ashman's death, Roger Moore of the Chicago Tribune believes that the song [...] "was [...] farewell to love and life and imagination." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roberts, a self-confessed fan of Christie's works, {{made the}} episode into a comedy. [...] Roberts based the episode on his {{favourite}} Christie works: Crooked House, {{which focuses on}} secrets within an aristocratic society, and the 1982 film adaptation of Evil Under the Sun. Speaking of both works, Roberts noted that it was [...] "quite strange writing a modern Doctor Who with posh people in it. We don't really see posh people on television anymore, except at Christmas", and [...] "there's something funny about the veneer of upper class respectability and the truth of any family underneath". He also stated that [...] "there's really nothing nicer than watching a lot of English actors hamming {{it up in a}} vaguely exotic location... and <b>then</b> <b>somebody's</b> murdered!" [...] The episode's title was deliberately chosen to sound [...] "vaguely Christie-ish", but Roberts admitted that [...] " [...] never used 'the blank and the blank' construction".|$|R
