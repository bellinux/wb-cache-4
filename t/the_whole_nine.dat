The program earned him an Emmy nomination in 2002 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, along with Matt LeBlanc, but the two lost to Ray Romano.

500|$|In {{many of her}} World Grand Championship portraits, Nipper {{painted a}} montage {{depicting}} the horse's life and show career. She first used this technique for a portrait of Pride's Generator. When Nipper asked the horse's owner, Claude Crowley, if she could do a montage, Nipper said, [...] "He said 'I don't know what that is, but why not?'" [...] The style soon caught on and was requested by other horse owners. Nipper herself bred Tennessee Walking Horses, and once bred a mare to <b>The</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Nine</b> Yards, a World Grand Champion, of whom she had previously painted a portrait. Although the portrait was painted before the horse ever won a title, Nipper depicted him with roses around his head. The horse's owner later said she almost sent the picture back.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{two different}} modelling approaches for the Austrian forest sector. While the ATM (Austrian Trade Model) is a normative optimization model, {{based on the}} Global Trade Model developed at IIASA, the FOHOW (Simulation Model of the Austrian Forest Sector) is a descriptive simulation model, written in the Dynamo simulation language. ATM and FOHOW also differ in scope, with ATM being a global model covering <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> world (<b>nine</b> separate regions with Austria as the center) and FOHOW being basically a national model for Austria. Both models include <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> forest sector from timber growth to paper consumption. Thus the level of detail is naturally low. The ATM deals with fourteen, the FOHOW with nine different products ranging from raw materials (e. g. roundwood) to final products (e. g. paper). The models can be used mainly for long-term policy analysis ("what-if" questions) rather than for forecasting purposes. While an ATM-run starts at 1980, a FOHOW-run already begins in 1965; both end at 2030. Beside a base scenario, several scenarios were tested in parallel for both models under similar assumptions. The results of a selected number of scenario-runs are presented.

And behold! the apples were beginning to ripen, and lit up the whole palace with their brightness. At the same moment nine golden pea-hens flew swiftly through the air, and while eight alighted upon the boughs laden with fruit, the ninth fluttered to the ground where the prince lay, and instantly was changed into a beautiful maiden, more beautiful far than any lady in the emperor's court. The prince at once fell in love with her, and they talked together for some time, till the maiden said her sisters had finished plucking the apples, and now they must all go home again.

60|$|The {{moment was}} critical. It {{appeared}} to the cavalry commander that the Dervishes would actually succeed, and their success must involve the total {{destruction of the}} Camel Corps.

They would meet in direct collision the swarms of men who were hurrying down the trough. The diversion might enable the Camel Corps to escape. But the ground was bad; the enemy's force was overwhelming; the Egyptian troopers were prepared to obey--but that was all. There was no exalted enthusiasm such as at these moments carries sterner breeds to victory. Few would return. Nevertheless, the operation appeared inevitable. The Camel Corps were already close to the river. But thousands of Dervishes were running swiftly towards them {{at right angles to}} their line of retreat, and it was certain that if the camelry attempted to cross this new front of the enemy they would be annihilated. Their only hope lay in maintaining themselves by their fire near the river-bank until help could reach them, and, in order to delay and weaken the Dervish attack the cavalry would have to make a desperate charge.|$|E

Within the palace were still assembled in the council-chamber all the chief magistracies, the eighty members of the senate, and the other select citizens who had been in hot debate through long hours of daylight and torchlight whether the Appeal should be granted or whether the sentence of death should be executed on the prisoners forthwith, to forestall the dangerous chances of delay. And the debate had been so much like fierce quarrel that the noise from the council-chamber had reached the crowd outside. Only within the last hour had the question been decided: the Signoria had remained divided, four of them standing out resolutely for the Appeal in spite of the strong argument that if they did not give way their houses should be sacked, until Francesco Valori, in brief and furious speech, made the determination of his party more ominously distinct by declaring that if the Signoria would not defend the liberties of the Florentine people by executing those five perfidious citizens, there would not be wanting others who would take that cause in hand to the peril of all who opposed it.

40|$|The {{current study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate a possible relationship between a loss of nerve fibers of the SNP and the recruitment or infiltration of DCs in the diabetic cornea. It includes the analysis of the cornea over a period of nine weeks by the use of two different animal models presenting DM I and DM II. The results measured by quantification of the DCD, NFD, NFT and Co-Localization of DCs and nerve fibers of the SNP are mainly based on the in vivo CCM. To investigate the cellular structures in a qualitative manner, we used specific cell surface markers and analyzed <b>the</b> prepared corneal <b>whole</b> mounts with confocal microscopy. The results and the subsequent discussion led to the following conclusion: (1) Regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation of the increased BG-level and the increased DCD in STZ-treated BALB/c mice. In ob/ob mice there was a significant negative correlation between both parameters. (2) The DCD of STZ-treated BALB/c mice showed a gradual increase over the period of one to nine weeks in contrast to the ob/ob mice with a nearly constant high level of DCD. (3) Regression analysis of DCD and NFD showed a significant negative correlation in of STZ-treated BALB/c mice. This observation could not be confirmed in ob/ob mice. (4) The NFT in STZ-treated BALB/c and ob/ob mice showed a relative constant level over <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> period of <b>nine</b> weeks. (5) The Co-Localization of DCs and nerve fibers of the SNP did not show any differences over <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> period of <b>nine</b> weeks. The {{current study was}} able to show a relation between the loss of corneal nerve fibers and the increase of DCs under diabetic conditions. We suppose that a high BG-level and the related metabolic changes lead to a recruitment of DCs into the cornea and consequently to inflammation. Due to an interaction between nerve fibers and DCs soluble factors like cytokines or the formation of MNTs could lead to corneal polyneuropathy. To verify this assumption, cellular and molecular mechanisms between nerve fibers and DCs have to be analyzed to provide information on a functional association of both cell types in the diabetic cornea...|$|R
