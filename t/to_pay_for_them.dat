5|$|King Frederick William IV {{suffered}} a stroke in 1857 and could no longer rule. This led to his brother William becoming Prince Regent of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1858. Meanwhile, Helmuth von Moltke had become chief of the Prussian General Staff in 1857, and Albrecht von Roon would become Prussian Minister of War in 1859. This shuffling of authority within the Prussian military establishment would have important consequences. Von Roon and William (who took an active interest in military structures) began reorganizing the Prussian army, while Moltke redesigned the strategic defense of Prussia by streamlining operational command. Prussian army reforms (especially how <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them)</b> caused a constitutional crisis beginning in 1860 because both parliament and William—via his minister of war—wanted control over the military budget. William, crowned King Wilhelm I in 1861, appointed Otto von Bismarck {{to the position of}} Minister-President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck resolved the crisis in favor of the war minister.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{bimetallism}} {{grew in the}} 1870s, {{and resulted}} in {{the passage of the}} Bland–Allison Act of February 28, 1878, over the veto of President Rutherford B. Hayes. This legislation required the Treasury to purchase {{millions of dollars worth of}} silver bullion each month, and coin it into silver dollars—the denomination was restored as a legal tender, except when gold was specified by law or private contract. Renewed support for silver led to the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, greatly increasing the silver purchases, and requiring the Treasury <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> in banknotes that could be redeemed for gold. Over the next three years, $132,000,000 in gold was withdrawn from the Treasury, and amid another depression President Grover Cleveland secured the repeal of the silver purchase act.|$|E
5|$|Bonsaint and Scully visit Melissa's home, {{but find}} it unoccupied. Bonsaint tells Scully that Melissa was once {{married to a}} local fisherman, but was widowed when he was inexplicably found dead aboard his fishing boat, the hook on his winch driven through his skull. Later, it is {{revealed}} that he found Chinga in a lobster trap {{and gave it to}} Polly as a present shortly before he died. Bonsaint also explains that there had been an incident between Polly and Jane Froelich, the proprietor of a local daycare center, when Jane slapped Polly over her behavior. Meanwhile, Riggs meets Melissa and Polly at an ice cream shop. Melissa describes how she has seen images of violent deaths, such as Dave's, before they occur. Riggs gives Melissa the key to a remote cabin and suggests that she leave town. When Polly asks one of the workers for more cherries, the worker insists that she needs <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> Just then, the worker is nearly killed when her hair gets caught in the mixer until Riggs saves her.|$|E

25|$|Hanson {{attended}} Burwood Public and Fort Street High Schools, {{but left}} before completing his third year. He continued however to pursue piano lessons, aided by teacher Anne Spillane who kindly {{provided him with}} free lessons as his family was too poor <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> He was thereby eventually able, in 1930 {{at the age of}} seventeen, to gain the Licentiate (piano) of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. From 1930 until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he made a living by teaching piano and by working in a variety of menial jobs.|$|E

Khan too was forced to resign along with Nawaz Sharif in 1993, and an interim government was formed until the new elections. A parliamentary election was called after by the Pakistan Armed Forces. Both Sharif and Benazir Bhutto campaigned with full force, targeting each other's personalities.

25|$|Toungoo went on {{to conquer}} all of Lower Burma by 1541, gaining {{complete}} control of Lower Burma's manpower, access to Portuguese firearms and maritime wealth <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> And Tabinshwehti would quickly exploit these new found assets for further expansions. By incorporating Portuguese mercenaries, firearms and military tactics as well as experienced former Hanthawaddy military commanders to the Toungoo armed forces, the upstart kingdom seized up to Pagan (Bagan) from the Confederation by 1545. The campaigns against Arakan (1545–47) and Siam (1547–49), however, fell short. In both campaigns, Toungoo forces won all major open battles but could not overcome the heavily fortified defences of Mrauk-U and Ayutthaya.|$|E
25|$|The {{conquest of}} Martaban now gave his upstart regime {{complete}} control of Lower Burma's manpower, access to foreign firearms and maritime wealth <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> And he would use these new found assets for further expansions. The sudden emergence of Toungoo did not go unnoticed. Both Ava-based Confederation and Arakan now promised military help to Prome, which was the gateway to Upper Burma. Throughout the rainy season of 1541, Tabinshwehti assembled a massive combine naval and land invasion force. His 13 naval squadrons (9000 troops, nearly 1400 war boats and transport boats) were commanded by ethnic Mon lords of Lower Burma while his land armies of 8000 troops were led by himself and Bayinnaung.|$|E

De Vere wrote to Burghley outlining a plan to purchase the manoral lands of Denbigh, in Wales, if the Queen would consent, offering <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> by commuting his £1,000 annuity and agreeing to abandon his suit to regain the Forest of Essex (Waltham Forest), and to deed over his interests in Hedingham and Brets for the use of his children, who were living under Burghley's guardianship in his home.|$|E

25|$|Lackawanna Steel Co. had a rocky {{relationship}} with the town of West Seneca. The company demanded large investments in sewer, water, gas and road improvements but refused <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> (even though the company was much wealthier than the town). The large influx of workers from the company's old Pennsylvania site swelled the Town's population, leading {{to the creation of}} extensive tracts of extremely substandard housing and severe public health problems (including outbreaks of cholera, typhoid and influenza). To save the town, West Senecans proposed separating the area around the steel mill as its own incorporated municipality. Lackawanna Steel opposed the incorporation of the proposed municipality (to be named Lackawanna), but it relented in 1909 after the two-year-long Panic of 1907 nearly bankrupted the Town of West Seneca and imperiled the company's operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{vessel was}} {{originally}} built by Cammell Laird as Hudson Cavalier, {{one of four}} STaT 32 class oil tankers ordered by John Hudson Fuel and Shipping. She was laid down at the Birkenhead shipyard on 5 November 1973. After construction had started on {{three of the four}} ships, John Hudson found it could not afford <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> Cammell Laird completed the three vessels, with Hudson Cavalier launching on 24 July 1975, and after sea trials were completed, all three were laid up in port while the shipbuilder sought to charter or sell them. On 27 October 1978, the Ministry of Defence expressed interest in chartering two of the tankers, and after conversion for use as an underway replenishment vessel, Hudson Cavalier entered service with the RFA on 8 June 1979 as RFA Appleleaf. The ship was acquired under a ten-year bareboat charter.|$|E
25|$|Toungoo went on {{to conquer}} all of Hanthawaddy by mid-1541, gaining {{complete}} control of Lower Burma's manpower, access to foreign firearms and maritime wealth <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> And Tabinshwehti would use these new found assets for further expansions. By incorporating Portuguese mercenaries, firearms and military tactics to the Toungoo armed forces, Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung continued to grow as military leaders. The duo also benefited from having experienced former Hanthawaddy military commanders like Saw Lagun Ein and Smim Payu serve as their top military advisers and generals. With their help, Bayinnaung delivered key decisive victories at the Battle of Padaung Pass (1542) against Prome's ally Arakan and the Battle of Salin (1544) against the Confederation, enabling Toungoo to take over central Burma {{as far north as}} Pagan (Bagan). After Bayinnaung crushed Arakanese forces in April 1542, Tabinshwehti was so pleased with the victory that he made Bayinnaung the heir-apparent of the kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The Organisation for European Economic Co-operation {{took the}} leading role in allocating funds, and the OEEC {{arranged}} for {{the transfer of the}} goods. The American supplier was paid in dollars, which were credited against the appropriate European Recovery Program funds. The European recipient, however, was not given the goods as a gift, but had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> (usually on credit) in local currency. These payments were kept by the European government involved in a special counterpart fund. This counterpart money, in turn, could be used by the government for further investment projects. Five percent of the counterpart money was paid to the US to cover the administrative costs of the ERP. The Marshall Plan money was in the form of grants that {{did not have to be}} repaid. In addition to ERP grants, the Export-Import Bank (an agency of the US government) at the same time made long-term loans at low interest rates to finance major purchases in the US, all of which were repaid.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{pattern of}} foreign trade after 1949 was to import industrial producer goods from developed countries and <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> with exports of food, crude materials, and light manufactures, especially textiles. The pattern was altered as circumstances demanded; {{in the period}} of economic collapse following the Great Leap Forward (1958–60), food imports increased from a negligible amount in 1959 to 39 percent of all imports in 1962. At the same time, imports of machinery and equipment dropped from 41 percent to 5 percent of the total. From this time on, food and live animals remained a significant, although declining, share of imports, amounting to 14.8 percent of the total in 1980 but dropping to 4.1 percent in 1985. The pattern also shifted over time as China's industrial sector expanded, gradually increasing the share of exports accounted for by manufactured goods. Manufactures provided only 30 percent of all exports in 1959, 37.9 percent in 1975, and grew to 44.9 percent in 1985.|$|E
25|$|The {{gameplay}} {{departs from}} the standard platforming genre of the first Castlevania for a game more similar to the nonlinear gameplay of Metroid, with several RPG elements such as a world map which the player is free to explore and revisit. Simon, controlled by the player, can talk with townspeople who will offer him clues or lies. He can also go to merchants who will sell items, either for fighting enemies or for traversing to unreachable areas. <b>To</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> he must collect hearts, which are dropped by defeated enemies. In addition to the ordinary items in Simon's inventory, he can also purchase new whips in a few locations of the game. He begins with a standard Leather Whip, and can upgrade to stronger ones with each new purchase. Simon's Quest introduces an Experience Rating system, also found in role-playing games, which is increased by collecting hearts. After he finds a sufficient amount, his level and maximum health will increase with his Experience Rating.|$|E
