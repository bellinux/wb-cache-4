25|$|In {{the single}} toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is {{suspended}} on the eccentric shaft {{which leads to}} a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher. The swing jaw, suspended on the eccentric, undergoes two types of motion- swing motion towards the fixed jaw due to the action of <b>toggle</b> <b>plate</b> and vertical movement due the rotation of the eccentric. These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the crushing jaws. These type of jaw crushers are preferred for the crushing of softer particles.|$|E

Through the simulation analysis of the movement process, trajectories of moving jaw side plate and a movable jaw <b>toggle</b> <b>plate</b> and related parameters were obtained and compared and verify the simulation model and theory model. The results show that: the simulation model reflects the motion characteristics of the theoretical model well. So it provides theoretical reference for improvement of dynamic performance analysis and structure design of jaw crusher and has important application value in engineering...|$|E
