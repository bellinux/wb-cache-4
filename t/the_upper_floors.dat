5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors,</b> holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
5|$|Day-to-day {{life at the}} Glidden House {{was mostly}} {{carried out in the}} home's {{basement}} which contained a full kitchen, dining room, and living room. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> were used for guests and for sleeping quarters. In 1877 Glidden's daughter, Elva, married William H. Bush in the homestead.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, {{the hotel}} {{received}} extensive repairs in 1951. This {{consisted of a}} whole new set of top floors, while the mansard roof of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> of the hotel was rebuilt in a plain neo-Georgian white brick.|$|E
50|$|The Hiram Lodge of the Masonic Order rented <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> from 1821 to 1823. The SeniorOrder of United American Mechanics rented <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> from 1847 {{until at}} least 1853, when the Junior Order was {{established}} at the schoolhouse. The Charter Oak Library was established in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> in 1855. <b>The</b> predecessor of the Germantown Historical Society, then known as the Site and Relic Society, used the lower floor as a museum from 1903 to 1908.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> of Tighnabruaich has {{a number}} of smaller rooms, again opening off the central stair hall and off halls {{radiating}} from this. Some of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> rooms have partially raked ceilings of plasterboard, following the line of the roof trusses.|$|R

5|$|In 1985, Humphrey swam into San Francisco Bay {{and then}} up the Sacramento River towards Rio Vista. Five years later, Humphrey {{returned}} and became stuck on a mudflat in San Francisco Bay immediately north of Sierra Point below the view of onlookers from <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> of the Dakin Building.|$|E
5|$|All five {{floors are}} {{connected}} by a central scale-and-platt staircase, added in the early 17th century to replace a turnpike stair in the south-west. The rooms of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> have impressive panelling and decorated ceilings. The main hall, in the south part of the block, has been divided, but retains a large fireplace with the carved initials WS and JE, for William Sinclair and his wife Jean Edmonstone, and the date 1597.|$|E
5|$|Following the Restoration of Charles II, Mylne was {{reconfirmed}} in {{his post}} of Royal Master Mason, and was commissioned in 1663 to survey <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> of Holyrood Palace. The resulting plans are the earliest surviving architectural drawings from Scotland, and {{are held in}} the Bodleian Library in Oxford. His design for {{the completion of the}} palace went unexecuted, with the work eventually being carried out by Sir William Bruce in the 1670s.|$|E

5|$|In Columbus, Ohio the Huntington Center {{was briefly}} evacuated, and {{occupants}} on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> of the Rhodes State Office Tower and the Vern Riffe State Office Tower reported feeling strong shaking. Evacuations also occurred in Canton and Akron. In Cleveland, {{the press box}} at Progressive Field shook during the third inning of a Cleveland Indians baseball game.|$|E
5|$|Montacute, {{like many}} Elizabethan mansions, is built in an 'E' shape, a much-used plan in this era. On {{the ground floor}} was the great hall, kitchens and pantries, on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors,</b> {{retiring}} rooms for the family and honoured guests. Over the centuries, the layout and use of rooms changed: drawing and dining rooms evolved on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is formed by a composite steel and concrete frame, with various setbacks in its profile, meaning <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> are much smaller in area than lower levels. Outrigger trusses {{at the top}} of the building and at the various setbacks help to stiffen the building's reinforced concrete core against the strong winds prevalent in the area. The base of the building features a small park, for which the tower is named.|$|E

5|$|Up {{until early}} 2010, the keeper's cottage had been off-limits to visitors. Two of the ground-floor rooms {{have now been}} opened: the living-room is {{furnished}} in a 1930s/40s style, while the old kitchen area currently holds a couple of display cases, {{with a view to}} showing hitherto unseen artefacts from the museum's collection of smaller items. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> remain closed to visitors.|$|E

50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{included}} the city cellar, auction rooms, and the remand prison. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor's</b> eastern half {{had a large}} hall and room for refreshments, conversation rooms and an atrium. The western half of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> was <b>the</b> session hall of the Magistrate and a common room for city elders.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{was decorated with}} dark wood panelling. The large staircase is located {{to the side of}} the building, connecting the lower <b>floor</b> with <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> lower floor originally consisted of a large room surrounded by smaller rooms which were used as the administration office for the Nederlandsch Indische Kunstkring. In 1999, the lower floor was converted into a single continuous large room. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> was used as an art gallery and sometimes rented as reception room. The building was a landmark in the Menteng area. Today, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> has been reconverted into an art gallery.|$|R
5|$|During World War II, {{and after}} Perry Ellwood died in 1943, May Ellwood again altered the home; {{to save on}} fuel oil, she had <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> of the house closed off. During this period, the library functioned as a guest room and a {{bathroom}} was added across the library's west wall. The bathroom was removed before the house opened as a museum in 1967. The library's plaster cornice and other architectural details have been restored based on a 1912 photograph. In 1964 the home was donated {{to the city of}} DeKalb and converted into a museum.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too {{advanced}} and expensive for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the reunification}} of Jerusalem in 1967, the city {{embarked}} on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were opened in the new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, weaning customers {{away from the city}} center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas. The Zion Cinema closed in 1972 and was demolished. In its place, a high-rise building containing the Kikar Zion Hotel (on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors)</b> and a branch of Bank Hapoalim (on the lower floors) was erected.|$|E

5|$|The Greater London Council {{sold the}} {{building}} to the New River Company, with the property {{becoming part of the}} London Merchant Securities portfolio. The building was renovated between 1979 and 1982 by McLaughlin & Harvey Ltd with architects Elsom Pack & Roberts converting the building for office use and renaming it Angel Corner House. The ground floor is now a branch of The Co-operative Bank, and the ORC International market research agency occupies <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors.</b> The building is now privately owned by Hamilton Investment Properties.|$|E
5|$|The hostel {{and conference}} centre is entered through a wide glazed atrium {{which serves as}} a large foyer {{containing}} the cafe and some Scouting displays. From the atrium the large hall is reached which can serve as an auditorium with seating for up to 300 people. The first floor has a restaurant seating 100 guests; the second floor has meeting rooms, and conference facilities for groups up to 80 delegates per room. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors</b> contain 180 hostel bedrooms. In an average year, 30thousand people spend the night, and 100thousand meals are served in the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The late 18th {{century was}} a period of change in the {{interior}} design of English country houses. The Baroque concept of the principal floor, or piano nobile, with a large bedroom suite known as the state apartments, was gradually abandoned in favour of smaller, more private bedrooms on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floors.</b> The principal floor became a series of reception rooms, each with a designated purpose, creating separate withdrawing, dining, music, and ballrooms. In the late-18th century, it became common to arrange reception and public rooms on a lower floor, with bedrooms and more private rooms above. West Wycombe perfectly reflects this arrangement.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> {{building}} {{was designed for}} use as staff offices and facilities. The two stairways providing access to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> are found at the western and eastern ends of the floor. The eastern stair is a narrow dog-leg timber stairs on a steel frame which dates from about the mid-20th century. The western stair is an earlier timber dog leg stair. The central first floor hallway provides access {{to a number of}} large, well lit office spaces. Natural lighting from the windows lining the building is supplemented on both the northern and southern sides with a series of skylights, which though probably not original are certainly an early development of the building and reflect the use of the rooms as offices. The partitioning on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> is constructed with lath and plaster walls and the ceilings are also lath and plaster. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor</b> has more decorative finishes than the lower floor with moulded archways along the hall, and cornices and skirting boards of various sizes in the halls and rooms. Early paint schemes are evident in many places of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
