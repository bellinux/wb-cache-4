Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acid.</b> These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the papillary dermis.

40|$|Disinfection by {{products}} of haloacetic acids and perchlorate pose significant health risks, even at low mug/l levels in drinking water. A new method for the simultaneous determination of nine haloacetic acids (HAAs) and perchlorate {{as well as}} some common anions in one run with ion chromatography was developed. The HAAs tested included mono-, di-, <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acids,</b> mono, di-, tribromoacetic acids, bromochloroacetic acid, dibromochloroacetic acid, and bromodichloroacetic acid. Two high-capacity anion-exchange columns, a carbonate-selective column and a hydroxide-selective hydrophilic one, were used for the investigation. With the carbonate-selective column, the nine HAAs as well as fluoride, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and sulfate could be well separated and determined in one run. With the very hydrophilic column and a gradient elution of sodium hydroxide, methanol and deionized water, the nine HAAs, fluoride, chloride, nitrite, nitrate as well as perchlorate could be simultaneously determined in one run within 34 min. The detection limits for HAAs were between 1. 11 and 9. 32 mug/l For perchlorate, it was 0. 60 mug/l. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{determination}} of nine haloacetic acids (HAAs) with ion chromatography (1 C) coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was developed. With the very hydrophilic anion-exchange column and steep gradient of sodium hydroxide, the nine HAAs could be well separated in 15 min. After suppression with an ASRS suppressor that was introduced in between IC and ICP-MS, the background was much decreased, the interference caused by sodium ion present in eluent was removed, and the sensitivities of HAAs were greatly improved. The chlorinated and brominated HAAs could be detected as (CIO) -C- 35 and Br- 79 without interference of the matrix due to the elemental selective ICP-MS. The detection limits for mono-, di-, <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> were between 15. 6 and 23. 6 mug/l.

40|$|In this study, the {{disinfection}} byproduct formation potential (DBPFP) {{of three}} surface waters with the {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) content of 2. 5, 5. 2, and 7. 9 mg/L was investigated. The formation and distribution of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were evaluated. Samples collected from three surface waters in China were fractionated based on molecular weight and hydrophobicity. The raw water containing more hydrophobic (Ho) fraction exhibited higher formation potentials of haloacetic acid and trihalomethane. The DBPFP of the surface waters did not correlate with the DOC value. The values of DBPFP per DOC were correlated with the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) for Ho and Hi fractions. The obtained results suggested that SUVA cannot reveal the ability of reactive sites to form disinfection byproducts for waters with few aromatic structures. Combined with the analysis of FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the raw waters and the corresponding fractions, {{it was concluded that}} the Ho fraction with phenolic hydroxyl and conjugated double bonds was responsible for the production of trichloromethanes and <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acids.</b> The Hi fraction with amino and carboxyl groups had the potential to form dichloroacetic acids and chlorinated trihalomethanes.

40|$|The {{previous}} research on the occurrence of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water has focused on trihalomethane (THMs) formation and evolution, in particular within distribution systems. In this study, the variability of occurrence of haloacetic acids (HAAs) before and after treatment was investigated. The investigation focused on point–to-point fluctuations of HAAs in different treatment stages within the treatment plant. The research was also carried out {{to find out the}} possible sources for the presence of HAAs before chlorination in the raw water. The results showed that the presence of HAAs from the raw water point until the filtered water occurred due to industrial waste and sewages. Subsequent formation of HAAs from treated point until service reservoir due to disinfection. The HAAs concentration was the highest and most variable in the plant where level of DBP precursor indicators and the chlorine dose were both higher. However, HAAs level and in particular dichloroacetic acids (DCAA) (the preponderant HAAs species in the waters under study), <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> (TCAA) decreased dramatically during filtration, very probably because of the biodegradation within the filter.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the serum levels of insulin and some adrenal steroid hormones in men chronically exposed to low doses of {{trichloroethylene}} (TCE). A total of 85 workers participated in this study. Each worker had urine collected and analyzed for <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> (UTCA) on the same day that a blood sample was taken for analyses of serum testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), androstenedione, cortisol, aldosterone, and insulin. The mean concentration of environmental TCE was 29. 6 ppm and the mean UTCA was 22. 4 mg/g creatinine (range 0. 8 - 136. 4). TCE exposure did not cause any significant changes to the adrenal steroid hormone productions. The results showed that UTCA was significantly correlated to serum insulin levels. Insulin and SHBG responded in tandem, with the highest levels found in workers exposed to TCE for less than 2 years; levels of both parameters were significantly lowered in those exposed for more than 2 years. A triphasic response in insulin levels to TCE, which depended on the duration of exposure, was noted. Initial exposure caused an acute rise in insulin levels. This was followed by a fall to normal levels in those exposed 2 - 4 years and then a slight rise in those exposed for more than 6 years.

40|$|Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a {{chlorinated}} aliphatic {{organic compound}} often detected as pollutant in soils and ground water. “Green technologies” based on phytoremediation were proven to be effective to reclaim organic pollutants (e. g. TCE) and heavy metals from different environmental matrices. In this work, we use Zea mays L. {{for the removal of}} high TCE concentrations from medium cultures. In particular, we investigated a sealed bioreactor where the growth medium was contaminated with an increasing amount of TCE, in the range 55 – 280 mg/L; the removal capability of the maize plants was assessed by means of GC-MS and LC-MS analyses. An accurate mass balance of the system revealed that the plants were able to remove and metabolise TCE with an efficiency up to 20 %, depending on the total amount of TCE delivered in the bioreactor. Morphometric data showed that the growth of Z. mays is not significantly affected by the presence of the pollutant up to a concentration of 280 mg/L, while plants show significant alterations at higher TCE concentrations until the growth is completely inhibited for [TCE] ≃ 2000 mg/L. Finally, the presence of several TCE metabolites, including dichloroacetic and <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acids,</b> was detected in the roots and in the aerial part of the plants, revealing that Z. mays follows the green liver metabolic model.

Calibration plots {{were found to be}} linear in the range 2 mM to 2. 0 M; replicate determinations of a 5. 2 mM citric acid (n[*]=[*] 4) solution gave a coefficient of variation of 1. 43 %. Additions of metal ions, such as Ag+, Pb 2 +, Cu 2 +, Fe 3 + and Ca 2 +, were found not to interfere. The effects of hesperidin, cysteine, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), ascorbic, formic, malic, malonic, tartaric, oxalic and <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> on the determination of citric acid were examined and, under the conditions employed, only oxalic acid and EDTA were found to give any significant interference.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the doping of thin polyaniline (PANI) films, {{prepared by the}} chemical oxidation of aniline, with different acids. The initial step in the investigation is the preparation of PANI films from aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. This is followed by dedoping with ammonia to obtain a PANI base, which is subsequently doped with strong acids (e. g. hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric and <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acids)</b> and with a weak acid (acetic acid). The dopant weight fraction (w), which is connected with the gain of mass during the doping of PANI, was determined in situ using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The behavior of PANI upon doping with different anions derived from strong acids indicates that both proton and the anion uptake into the polymer chains occur sharply, rapidly, completely, and reversibly. However the uptake in the case in acetic acid is characterized by slow diffusion. The doping was studied at different concentrations of acetic acid. A second cycle of dedoping–redoping was also performed. The kinetics of the doping reaction is dominated by Fickian diffusion kinetics. The diffusion coefficients (D) of the dopant ions into the PANI chains were determined using the QCM and by UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy {{in the range of}} (0. 076 – 1. 64) × 10 − 15 cm 2 s− 1. It was found that D in the second cycle of doping is larger than that evaluated from the first cycle of doping for high concentrations of acetic acid.
