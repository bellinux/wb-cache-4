IMA Lab was designed to address museum-specific technology needs not currently met by software vendors and to provide consulting services to museums and nonprofit organizations that want <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>technology</b> to help solve problems and meet objectives. IMA Lab projects include TAP, steve.museum, and the IMA Dashboard. TAP is a mobile tour application for iPod Touch that presents visitors with content related to the IMA's collection, such as artist interviews, text and audio files, and pictures. Steve.museum, for which IMA Lab is the technical lead, is a project that explores social tagging as {{a new way to}} describe collections and make them more accessible.|$|E

In part, this is explained by their limited view that technologies have in learning.

[...] The ideology of futurism Idol adopted was panned by Robbins, while the music itself was hardly different from his previous work. [...] "For the most part, other than keyboards that add a pervasive nod to the jittering beat of techno-rave music, Cyberpunk sounds pretty much like every other Idol album." ...|$|E

40|$|Digital {{technologies}} are increasingly acknowledged {{as an important}} aspect of early childhood education. A significant problem for early childhood education has been how to understand the pedagogical <b>use</b> of <b>technologies</b> in a sector that values play-based learning. This paper presents a new framework to understand how children learn <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>technologies</b> through play. The Digital Play Framework is based on the sociocultural concept of tool mediation and Corrine Hutt’s work regarding epistemic and ludic activity as basis for understanding play. The Digital Play Framework presents a series of indicators for how children learn <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>technologies</b> as cultural tools, first by exploring the functionality of technologies through epistemic activity, and second by generating new content through ludic activity...|$|R

2500|$|Richey defined {{educational}} technology as [...] "the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating, using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources". The Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) denoted instructional technology as [...] "the {{theory and practice}} of design, development, utilization, management, and evaluation of processes and resources for learning". As such, {{educational technology}} refers to all valid and reliable applied education sciences, such as equipment, as well as processes and procedures that are derived from scientific research, and in a given context may refer to theoretical, algorithmic or heuristic processes: it does not necessarily imply physical technology. Educational technology is the process of integrating technology into education in a positive manner that promotes a more diverse learning environment and a way for students to learn how <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>technology</b> as well as their common assignments ...|$|E
