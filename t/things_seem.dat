In particular, {{there is no such thing}} as a perception which may be considered in and of itself (a quale). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to them are inherently authoritative on how <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.|$|E
25|$|After issuing the {{challenge}} to McKinney, Joe begins to find himself becoming very popular around the office for his bravery. Meg and Natalie, however, do not feel fighting McKinney will solve anything, and both attempt to tell Joe as much, to no avail. Joe seeks out the aid of an ex B movie star-turned-martial arts instructor named Chuck Scarett (Jim Belushi) to teach him to defend himself. <b>Things</b> <b>seem</b> to finally be going right for Joe, as he has begun to see Meg and has even been given a promotion at work he had been hoping for. When Meg realizes Jeremy (Greg Germann), a colleague she works closely with for the company (who {{also happens to be}} attracted to her), only gave Joe a non-existing position at the office to prevent him from suing the company, she resigns in fear that she might one day have to demote or even fire Joe. Meg again tries to persuade Joe not to fight McKinney, and finally gives him an ultimatum: if he does not call off the fight with McKinney, their relationship is over.|$|E
500|$|Despite his dominance, he {{had trouble}} drawing {{scholarship}} offers, as his weight of [...] scared off many teams. “A {{lot of people are}} just wary of guys that big,” Mississippi Gulf Coast coach Steve Campbell said. “You know when people say that if <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> {{too good to be true}} that they usually are. A big guy like that who's that athletic, you just don't believe what you're seeing.” Particularly noted for his lower body strength, Cody had a squat max of [...] in junior college.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} theodicy was {{expanded}} mainly {{with the thought}} of Weber and his addition of ethical considerations to the subject of religion. There is this ethical part of religion, including [...] "(1) soteriology and (2) theodicy. These mean, respectively, how people understand themselves {{to be able to be}} in a correct relationship with supernatural powers, and how to explain evil – or why bad <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to happen to those who seem to be good people". There is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class. [...] "Theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil.... In contrast, theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved." [...] Weber also writes that [...] "the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies, which emphasise that prosperity is a blessing of God... theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next." [...] Thus these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion.|$|E
500|$|Murphy and Mark Brydon {{ended their}} romantic {{relationship}} but were still contractually obligated to record another album, which became Moloko's 2003 album Statues. When she finished touring, {{she found herself}} alone and had to re-evaluate the friendships she had built. During this time, she got to know Matthew Herbert, whom she had met when he remixed several of Moloko's songs. Murphy had {{wanted to work with}} him again, commenting that [...] "it felt very natural…because Matthew makes <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> quicker and easier". During the first day of recording with Herbert, he had her bring an unspecified object so that they could hit it against a microphone and record the sound it made. Herbert's approach was that for Murphy to go solo, the album should revolve around her and the sounds that surround her. They wanted to carry out recording and audio mixing in one room, so Herbert invested in a studio. There, Herbert recorded Murphy's voice without accompaniment so that she could better hear how her voice naturally sounded. On occasion, the two added instruments to a track by having her hire an instrumentalist, sometimes to play an unusual instrument such as a hammered dulcimer.|$|E
500|$|His first {{appearance}} of 2007–08 {{came as a}} 75th-minute substitute in a 2–0 defeat away to Darlington on 11 August 2007 and following a 2–1 away defeat against Bradford City on 25 August he said [...] "I'm pleased with my form at the moment because I've been working hard to try {{and stay in the}} team and I'm happy that <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to be going well for me at the moment". Mackin joined Conference Premier club Droylsden on 24 January 2008 on a one-month loan, having made seven appearances for Wrexham by that point in 2007–08. He made his debut two days later in a 1–0 home victory over Kidderminster Harriers and on 31 January 2008 the loan was extended {{until the end of the}} season after earning [...] "rave reviews" [...] for his performances. His only goal for Droylsden came in the 70th minute against Torquay United on 1 April 2008, which was their only goal in a 2–1 home defeat. He made 15 appearances and scored 1 goal for Droylsden before returning to Wrexham after being recalled from the loan in April 2008. The four appearances he made following his return were described as [...] "battling", and the last of these included his first goal for Wrexham in a 4–2 win away to Lincoln City on 3 May 2008, which was Wrexham's final match in the Football League before their relegation to the Conference Premier. He later commented [...] "I got a little touch on it and I'm not sure if the defender got the final touch but it went straight in and I'm very pleased with it!" [...] He finished the season with 11 appearances and 1 goal for Wrexham, with opportunities in the team again being rare.|$|E

[...] Determined to stir up some trouble, Medea anoints poor Ryang with magic eyedrops. If Ryang makes eye contact with a girl who already has romantic {{interest}} of any sort, an evil affinity will result. [...] Ryang is destined to suffer 108 evil affinities and cannot control who he affects.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout May, {{accounts}} came to {{him from}} London {{of the success of}} I puritani and the failure of a revival of Norma (due to the poor performances by both the Adalgisa and Pollione), although later reports of Giulietta Grisi's Norma—in contrast to those of Pasta—were not good either, and Bellini was pleased that it was not Grisi who gave the opera in Paris. [...] Over the summer, Bellini's general mood was reported to be [...] "dark": [...] discussion with the Opéra could not proceed until a new director was appointed; [...] "he writes long letters, crowded with projects, ideas, reveries that the hand seems to have trouble restraining"; and, as Weintock concludes, all of these <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to [...] "inescapably suggest a man deeply disturbed physically, psychologically, or both".|$|E

2500|$|Chalmers' {{argument}} is that it seems plausible that such a being could exist because {{all that is needed}} is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe and observe about a human being must be true of the zombie. None of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be described scientifically via physics whether it is conscious or not. The mere logical possibility of a p-zombie demonstrates that consciousness is a natural phenomenon beyond the current unsatisfactory explanations. Chalmers states that one probably could not build a living p-zombie because living <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to require a level of consciousness. However (unconscious?) robots built to simulate humans may become the first real p-zombies. Hence Chalmers half-joking calls for the need to build a [...] "consciousness meter" [...] to ascertain if any given entity, human or robot, is conscious or not.|$|E
2500|$|The Keeleys {{arrive at}} the Goldmans' (who are calling {{themselves}} [...] "Coleman" [...] for the evening to hide their Jewish heritage) redecorated apartment; they are greeted by Agador, who is passing himself off as a Greek butler named [...] "Spartacus" [...] for the night. Despite a few near misses, including Louise discovering {{that all of the}} old-fashioned books on the shelves are Nancy Drew mysteries, Agador only preparing a soup for dinner, and the dinner plates themselves featuring Greek depictions of homosexuality, <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to be going smoothly. Unfortunately, Katherine gets caught in traffic, and the Keeleys begin wondering where [...] "Mrs. Coleman" [...] is. Suddenly, Albert enters, dressed and styled as a conservative middle-aged woman. Armand, Val, and Barbara are nervous, but Kevin and Louise are tricked by the disguise, especially when Albert delivers tirades about the collapse of morality in the United States; the act is so convincing that Louise even becomes jealous of Albert, accusing her husband of flirting with her.|$|E
2500|$|When Orthodox Christians {{refer to}} Fallen Nature {{they are not}} saying that human nature has become evil in itself. Human nature is still formed {{in the image of}} God; we are still God's creation, and God has never created {{anything}} evil. But our fallen nature remains open to evil intents and actions. It is sometimes said that we are [...] "inclined to sin"; that is, we find some sinful things attractive. It is the nature of temptation to make sinful <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> the more attractive, and it is the fallen nature of humans that seeks or succumbs to the attraction. Orthodox Christians reject the Augustinian position that the descendants of Adam and Eve are actually guilty of the original sin of their ancestors. But just as any species begets its own kind, so fallen humans beget fallen humans, and from the beginning of our existence we lie open to sinning by our own choice.|$|E

2500|$|The {{execution}} of Dorrego generated a huge controversy in Buenos Aires. Varela wrote a new mail to Lavalle, instructing him to forge documents to make <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> {{as if he}} had conducted a trial in Navarro, but Lavalle kept this mail as well. The federals saw Dorrego as a martyr and increased their rejection for the military government. The National Convention in Santa Fe (the highest national authority at the time) rejected the coup and the {{execution of}} Dorrego as crimes of high treason against the state, and appointed Estanislao López the leader of the troops that would be sent to remove the government in Buenos Aires. The provinces of Córdoba and Entre Ríos joined the offensive, and then the others. The government in Buenos Aires began a campaign of political repression against all federals. Lavalle was soon reinforced by general José María Paz [...] The number of deaths caused by the political repression was so high that in 1829 Buenos Aires had a higher number of deaths than births.|$|E
2500|$|Uchikoshi {{prioritized}} storylines over characters, {{and used}} the feeling of discomfort {{as the foundation of}} the narrative. He first came up with a setting, and then made characters along with the drama and stories behind them. After this, he decided on the core of the game's story, and created a flowchart based on it, which became the [...] "bone structure of the story". According to Uchikoshi, it did not matter that the setups of the games were far-fetched, as long as their internal logic worked; he said {{that as long as the}} story is interesting and immersive, implausible situations feel plausible to the player. On the other hand, he felt that if he had specifically tried to make it more plausible, by forcing explanations that justify the situations, the story would become boring and the implausible would look even more implausible. Instead, he chose to rely on players' imagination, saying that players can make <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> plausible in ways he had not even imagined himself. One thing he did to make the stories more believable was adding concepts such as Schrödinger's cat, which he felt added flavor and kept players wondering whether a particular concept could be the main idea of the game; he felt that when players wonder that, it makes the story feel more real, as they create the game world in their minds.|$|E
2500|$|Though using profanity on occasion, Butters {{does not}} indulge in foul-mouthed {{language}} {{as often as}} the other children on the show, instead preferring to use minced oaths; [...] "oh hamburgers" [...] is one he uses frequently, as well as [...] "gee whiz" [...] mostly in earlier seasons. Butters speaks with a mild stutter and tends to fidget with his hands. The other characters perceive him as [...] "nerdy", and he obliviously maintains a wholesome attitude and mild disposition despite the tragedy and abuse that he frequently encounters. His happy-go-lucky persona {{has been described as}} resembling that of a typical 1950s sitcom child character, and is usually presented {{in stark contrast to the}} harsh treatment he receives at the hands of his friends and strict parents, including his mother's deranged attempt to murder him after discovering his father's bisexuality, as well as when his grandmother happens to be in town and constantly bullies him during her stay. Stone describes him as embodying [...] "permanent innocence". [...] Butters, however, sees himself as a problem child because his parents tell him so and often expresses remorse at being [...] "out-of-control". Exceptions to this include the episode [...] "The Ungroundable", in which Butters makes his parents worry about their ability to ground him when he refuses to be punished. This rebellious behavior begins after he joins the vampire kids at his school, but ends when he helps the Goth kids burn down a Hot Topic store. He is also known for being gullible, quickly believing anything told to him by others and tending to do whatever he is told to do with little protest, no matter how ridiculous these <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to be. As such, he is always made an unknowing accomplice in Cartman's various devious schemes. There are cases, however, where Butters has shown a darker side, such as in episodes like [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] and [...] "Butterballs"; in the latter of which he viciously assaulted Dr. Oz and verbally castigated his abusive grandmother.|$|E

60|$|For most {{practical}} purposes {{these differences are}} unimportant, but to the painter they are all-important: the painter has to unlearn the habit of thinking that <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to have the colour which common sense says they 'really' have, and to learn the habit of seeing things as they appear. Here we have already the beginning {{of one of the}} distinctions that cause most trouble in philosophy--the distinction between 'appearance' and 'reality', between what <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to be and what they are. The painter wants to know what <b>things</b> <b>seem</b> to be, the practical man and the philosopher want to know what they are; but the philosopher's wish to know this is stronger than the practical man's, and is more troubled by knowledge as to the difficulties of answering the question.|$|E
