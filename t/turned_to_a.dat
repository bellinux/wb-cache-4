5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> northwest motion before resuming a track to the west-northwest. On May7 it intensified {{into a deep}} depression, and though its winds had increased, the structure became disorganized as the center became exposed from the thunderstorm activity. The convection waned, due {{to the influence of}} dry air from the Arabian Peninsula, as well as from wind shear. As a result, the IMD downgraded it to depression status early on May8. However, later in the day, convection redeveloped over the western half of the circulation, and it again reached deep depression status, about 830km (515mi) southeast of Oman.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of his book on the fur trade, Innis <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> study of an earlier staple—the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500years. While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.|$|E

5|$|As 1943 {{gave way}} to 1944, many {{problems}} remained. Tests began on the machinery at K-25 in April 1944 without a barrier. Attention <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new process developed by Kellex. Finally, in July 1944, Kellex barriers began to be installed in K-25. K-25 commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of the}} product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment. Uranium partially enriched in K-25 was fed into the calutrons at Y-12 to complete the enrichment process.|$|E
5|$|By July 11, dry air and {{unfavorable}} {{wind shear}} prevented the convection from developing near the center. The low became elongated, though on July 12 the overall convection became more concentrated as it <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> northeast drift. An approaching mid-level trough caused {{the system to}} accelerate northeastward across Florida Panhandle, though upon doing so the thunderstorm activity quickly diminished. On July 13, forecasters expected the system to be absorbed by the approaching trough. However, the low pressure area emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean near North Carolina early on July 14, and upon doing so its convection increased and became better organized. The circulation and convection became further defined, and the National Hurricane Center estimates the system developed into Tropical Depression One late on July 14 about 45miles (75km) west-southwest of Hatteras, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Yojimbo, Kurosawa found himself under {{pressure}} from Toho to create a sequel. Kurosawa <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> script he had written before Yojimbo, reworking it to include the hero of his previous film. Sanjuro {{was the first of}} three Kurosawa films to be adapted from the work of the writer Shūgorō Yamamoto (the others would be Red Beard and Dodeskaden). It is lighter in tone and closer to a conventional period film than Yojimbo, though its story of a power struggle within a samurai clan is portrayed with strongly comic undertones. The film opened on January 1, 1962, quickly surpassing Yojimbos box office success and garnering positive reviews.|$|E

After the century's earliest convention disenfranchising voters in a constitution that was proclaimed, each modification of the Virginia Constitution has {{been sent to the}} voters for referendum approval. Virginia's women suffrage movement was unsuccessful until the national ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, and the General Assembly did not ratify until 1952, but women could vote beginning in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ginger was {{the second}} longest-lasting Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record. The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season, Ginger spent 27.25days as a tropical cyclone, lasting from September6 to October3. Twenty of those days (September 11 – September 30), Ginger was classified as a hurricane. The storm formed northeast of the Bahamas, {{and for the first}} nine days of its duration tracked generally eastward or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110mph (175km/h). On September14, Ginger slowed and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> general westward track, passing near Bermuda on September23. There, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa now <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more {{conventional}} story with Rhapsody in August—the director's first film fully produced in Japan since Dodeskaden {{over twenty years}} before—which explored the scars of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki {{at the very end}} of World War II. It was adapted from a Kiyoko Murata novel, but the film's references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director rather than from the book. This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star: Richard Gere, who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine. Shooting took place in early 1991, with the film opening on 25 May that year to a largely negative critical reaction, especially in the United States, where the director was accused of promulgating naïvely anti-American sentiments, though Kurosawa rejected these accusations.|$|E

5|$|Kurosawa, with {{producer}} Sōjirō Motoki {{and fellow}} directors and friends Kajiro Yamamoto, Mikio Naruse and Senkichi Taniguchi, formed a new independent production unit called Film Art Association (Eiga Geijutsu Kyōkai). For this organization's debut work, and first film for Daiei studios, Kurosawa <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> contemporary play by Kazuo Kikuta and, together with Taniguchi, adapted {{it for the}} screen. The Quiet Duel starred Toshiro Mifune as an idealistic young doctor struggling with syphilis, a deliberate attempt by Kurosawa to break the actor away from being typecast as gangsters. Released in March 1949, it was a box office success, but is generally {{considered one of the}} director's lesser achievements.|$|E
5|$|On September29, {{shortly after}} Keith formed, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for the Yucatán peninsula from Chetumal to Cabo Catoche in Quintana Roo. The next day as Keith was nearing hurricane intensity, the watch was upgraded to a warning, and {{a tropical storm}} warning and hurricane watch was issued for the Belize coastline from Belize City to the Mexican border. At that time, the trajectory was expected to go more to the northwest, and when the storm <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slow westward drift, hurricane warnings were issued for the Belize coast with only about 24hours of lead time for the offshore islands. The warnings for the Yucatán peninsula were dropped as Keith weakened.|$|E
5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters have <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> digital mode {{of broadcasting}} called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. One {{reason is that}} digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts {{to as much as}} one million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.|$|E

On Mount Olympus, the Galatians had fortified {{themselves with a}} ditch and other defensive works. For the first two days, the Romans scouted the mountains. On the third day, the Romans attacked the Galatian position with their skirmishers. At first the battle was evenly matched but when the fighting came to close range, the superior Roman weapons and armour won them the battle. The battle <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> massacre for the Galatians when the Romans stormed their camp. The Galatians lost some 10,000 men and had around 40,000 captured during the aftermath.|$|E
5|$|The coin {{stems from}} {{the desire of the}} Columbian Exposition's {{organizers}} to gain federal money to complete construction of the fair. Congress granted an appropriation, and allowed it to be in the form of commemorative half dollars, which legislators and organizers believed could be sold at a premium. Fair official James Ellsworth wanted the new coin to be based on a 16th-century painting he owned by Lorenzo Lotto, reputedly of Columbus, and pushed for this through the design process. When initial sketches by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber proved unsatisfactory, fair organizers <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> design by artist Olin Levi Warner, which after modification by Barber and by his assistant, George T. Morgan, was struck by the Mint.|$|E
5|$|Theo Osterkamp {{pointed to}} the massed {{formations}} used by the British (Big Wing), and put their use down to the ineffectiveness of the 15 September raids. Göring was delighted {{with the news that}} the British were committing mass formations to battle. The Big Wing's use would allow the German fighters to engage and destroy RAF fighters in large numbers. However, the Germans had not realised this stratagem was by no means the uniform strategy in Fighter Command. Nevertheless, the OKL were still confident of victory. It blamed the bad weather and RAF's last-minute change of strategy for prolonging summer operations. Still, the Luftwaffe bomber crews were ordered to prepare winter quarters. The campaign turned to London for the duration of 1940. It would witness some large-scale daylight air battles, but it gradually <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> campaign by night. It would become known as The Blitz.|$|E

5|$|With the {{construction}} of canals, newly reclaimed Everglades land was promoted throughout the United States. Land developers sold 20,000lots {{in a few months}} in 1912. Advertisements promised within eight weeks of arrival, a farmer could be making a living, although for many it took at least two months to clear the land. Some tried burning off the sawgrass or other vegetation, only to learn that the peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fine black powder and created dust storms. Though initially crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} moved off the {{southeast}} {{coast of the}} United States on September 1. Gradually decaying, the front degenerated into an area of cloudiness and showers {{just east of the}} Georgia coast on September 2. Tracking eastward, a weak low-pressure area developed the next day. It slowly became better organized as its motion became erratic, and by late on September 4 the convection had become concentrated to the east of the center. On September 5, a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated the system had not acquired the characteristics of a tropical or subtropical cyclone. Interaction with an upper-level trough resulted in moderate wind shear which suppressed further development, and by September 6 the thunderstorm activity lost much organization. Upper-level winds became increasingly favorable, allowing the convection to concentrate about halfway between North Carolina and Bermuda. With a deep-layer ridge to its north, the system <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> steady west-northwest track. A reconnaissance aircraft flight late on September 7 reported a very elongated center, with peak flight winds of 55mph (90km/h) about 100miles (160km) northeast of the center. Subsequent to the flight, the center became slightly better organized, and based on the large wind field and the presence of an upper-level low to its west-southwest, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Subtropical Storm Gabrielle early on September 8 while located about 385miles (625km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September16 with copious convection. It tracked westward, developing into Tropical Depression Twelve on September21 while located {{a few hundred miles}} west of Cape Verde. Without intensifying further, the depression turned northward, due to a weakness caused by the deepening of a 200 mbar cut-off low near the Iberian Peninsula. Under the influence of a building high pressure area, the depression <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> northwest and later westward drift. It into Tropical Storm Josephine on September24, although increased wind shear from a trough weakened the storm back to a tropical depression on September26. It remained weak for several days, gradually turning to the north due to a weak trough over the northwestern Atlantic. On October1, another high pressure area halted its northward movement, causing Josephine to turn to the east. That day, it re-intensified into a tropical storm as it began to execute a small cyclonic loop. An approaching trough caused Josephine to accelerate north-northeastward, and with favorable conditions it intensified into a hurricane on October5, after existing nearly two weeks.|$|E
