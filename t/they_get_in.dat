25|$|The {{choice of}} {{discount}} rate is subjective. A smaller rate values future generations equally {{with the current}} generation. Larger rates (e.g. a market rate of return) reflects humans' attraction to time inconsistency—valuing money that they receive today more than money <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the future. The choice makes a large difference in assessing interventions with long-term effects. One issue is the equity premium puzzle, in which long-term returns on equities may be rather higher than they should be. If so then arguably market rates of return {{should not be used}} to determine a discount rate, as doing so would have the effect of undervaluing the distant future (e.g. climate change).|$|E

And how do you sum up what will one day be viewed as one of the most significant moments in the history of college football? I’m not exaggerating....Boise State beating Oklahoma in a New Year’s Day bowl game is college football’s equivalent to George Mason reaching the Final Four, with one extremely significant difference: George Mason had its chance to compete for the national title; Boise State does not. Like it or not, Boise State 43, Oklahoma 42 just became the single biggest argument to date for a college football playoff....Not only did <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the game, they made a major statement on behalf of their mid-major brethren that none of us will soon forget.|$|E

While there, he {{was offered}} the role of father Danny Brogan in Cape Wrath, an Ecosse Films series about a family being moved on a witness {{protection}} scheme to a mysterious village. He {{signed on to the}} seven-part series in September 2006 and filmed the series {{until the end of the}} year. He relished working on the character's back story as it confounded the expectations of both him and the audience. The series was broadcast in Britain and America in 2007. The following year, he played the part of Colonel Brandon in Andrew Davies' serial Sense and Sensibility. When he first got the script in 2007, he was unsure if British television needed another Jane Austen adaptation, but he took the role when he saw how Davies had given more screen time to the male characters than <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the 1995 film adaptation. He also appeared as Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk in The Other Boleyn Girl (2008). He compared Norfolk to bassist Lemmy from Motörhead and researched the role by reading history books and literature from the 16th century.|$|E
500|$|When Peter {{tries to}} {{apologize}} the next day, Lois is still upset {{with him for}} missing their date and has {{decided to go to}} the country club dance with Quagmire. Later that night, Peter and Brian sneak into the dance to prevent the kiss that caused Lois {{to fall in love with}} Quagmire. <b>They</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> by crawling through the air vent, but crash through and kill one of the guys playing in the band on the stage, so Brian has to play guitar and sing. Peter tries to convince Lois that they belong together but she stubbornly informs Peter that he had his chance and blew it, and therefore she loves Quagmire now. Peter almost gives up but Brian notices Chris, Stewie, and Meg disappearing from a family picture, indicating that they have fallen off the plane of existence and tells Peter it is his last chance to do something that proves he loves Lois. Peter then demonstrates his passion by punching Quagmire and kissing Lois, showing that he cares deeply for her and wins back her love. He asks her to marry him and she accepts. In honor of this success, Brian and the band play [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up" [...] by Rick Astley. The episode ends with things seemingly back to normal, with the exception of Roger from American Dad! apparently living with the family.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Torn and Frayed", as his penance, Castiel {{has turned}} {{back on his}} [...] "angel radio" [...] and travels around helping people who have need of help or healing. He {{demonstrates}} this by healing a sick infant that won't stop crying. After getting a distress call from Samandriel, Naomi summons Castiel to rescue the angel. Castiel enlists Dean's help and repeatedly wonders where Sam is, unaware that Sam and Dean are currently not getting along. After getting the ingredients for a [...] "demon bomb", Castiel gets Sam as they will {{need all the help}} they can get to rescue Samandriel and yells at Sam and Dean for their behavior. At the warehouse, Castiel tells Sam and Dean what symbols to neutralize and where so he can enter and gives Sam his sword so he has a weapon against demons. After Sam and Dean clear the way, Castiel enters, but is weakened by the other sigils in the building. Samandriel's screams cause him to remember being tied down by Naomi who approaches his eye with a mysterious instrument and is unable to help Sam and Dean in breaking into the room where Samandriel is. After <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>in,</b> Castiel frees Samandriel while Sam and Dean deal with the demons guarding him and takes the other angel outside. There, Samandriel begs for Castiel not to return him to Heaven and tries to warn him that [...] "they" [...] are controlling him. Before Samandriel can explain, Naomi forces Castiel to kill him for being a [...] "traitor". Castiel is horrified by this, but Naomi reveals that Samandriel telling Crowley about the angel Word of God tablet puts all in angels in danger and Castiel is a hero. Under her orders, he claims to Sam and Dean that he was forced to kill Samandriel in self-defense and that he is taking him back to Heaven to put him to rest (in reality so Naomi can determine just how much he broke), but his weird behavior and the fact that his eye starts bleeding arouses Sam and Dean's suspicions that he is being controlled.|$|E

2500|$|In late August, Harris lost {{another key}} staffer, Rhyan Metzler, {{in the wake}} of a {{disastrous}} political rally at Orlando Executive Airport. Only 40 people showed up for the event, and Harris blamed the paltry turnout in part on a last-minute change in location.

2500|$|In the USA, the {{negative}} usage {{appears to have}} continued into the 1930s. F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1922 novel The Beautiful and Damned uses the word twice: [...] "It {{was one of the}} type known as 'tourist' cars, a sort of brummagem Pullman ... a single patch of vivid green trees that guaranteed the brummagem umbrageousness of Riverside Drive". Gilbert Seldes, in his 1924 book The Seven Lively Arts, wrote in praise of Krazy Kat: [...] "everything paste and brummagem has had its vogue with us; and a genuine, honest native product has gone unnoticed". It appears in two essays by H.L. Mencken from 1926: [...] "Valentino" [...] ("Consider the sordid comedy of his two marriages – the brummagem, star-spangled passion that invaded his very deathbed!") and [...] "A Glance Ahead" [...] ("It would be hard to find a country in which such brummagem serene highnesses are revered with more passionate devotion than <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the United States.") Mencken's influence is apparent when the term appears in John Fante's 1939 novel Ask the Dust: [...] "The church must go, it is the haven of the booboisie, of boobs and bounders and all brummagem mountebanks." [...] More recently, Lemony Snicket, in his 1999 young adult novel The Reptile Room, introduces brummagem as a rare synonym for [...] "fake".|$|E
