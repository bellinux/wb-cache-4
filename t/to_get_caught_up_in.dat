Mike Wallace, Joe Nemechek, Tony Raines, Vickers and Martin Truex Jr. rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Of the other drivers in the Chase, Edwards was twelfth, Burton 17th and Johnson 20th. The two drivers that failed to qualify were Sam Hornish Jr. and Patrick Carpentier.

Shortly after the shooting began, Stormont MP Paddy Kennedy went with Short Strand residents to the local RUC base and demanded protection for their homes. Across the River Lagan, in the Markets area, other IRA members assembled and prepared to reinforce the Short Strand should it be invaded. British soldiers eventually arrived in armoured vehicles and cordoned off the roads around the Short Strand, which denied the IRA [...] "any hope of reinforcement". At the time, the British Army said that its soldiers fired no shots because [...] "owing to the confused situation, {{it was impossible to}} identify targets". British Army Colonel Mike Dewar later said: [...] "The whole incident had taken its course because the Army was so chronically overstretched that night in Belfast. The one spare platoon in the whole of west Belfast was not able to get through rioting Protestants to the Short Strand". Journalist Tony Geraghty wrote that sometimes [...] "The gunfire eased long enough to allow an occasional British Army personnel carrier (a 'Pig') to whine past, illuminated by the flames in a token gesture of law-and-order". Another journalist who witnessed the battle, Peter Taylor, later said:The shooting intensified but the soldiers still declined to intervene and separate the two sides – either because they felt they were not numerically strong enough or because they did not wish <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the middle of a sectarian fight, in the darkness, with shots being fired by both sides.|$|E

In his reviews of the Blu-ray/DVDs, Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk mentions the [...] "strong likeability factor of each of the main characters". Anime News Network writer Rebecca Silverman, in her review of the 20th volume, said, [...] "Mashima still manages to get some action and laughs in as well, including one especially funny subplot involving Gajeel. Wendy takes over from Lucy as the primary female of the series for most of this volume, and how you feel about that will probably depend upon which character you prefer."

[...] Nicole Villeneuve of Candadian magazine Exclaim! also offered a positive review and wrote how the album was full of [...] "lively hooks and crisp songs in a taut pop-punk package." [...] Chad Grischow of IGN scored the album at 8.5 out of 10 and called it a [...] "vibrant, infinitely listenable treat."

He noted how the album [...] "will delight pop-punk purists and NFG faithful alike", before praising the songwriting as some of the band's most infectious to-date.

[...] Jason Heller of The A.V. Club was less receptive, awarding the album a [...] "C" [...] grade and bemoaning the bands, [...] "same bouncy/bittersweet dynamic.
