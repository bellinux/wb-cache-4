5|$|After {{several years}} of {{comparatively}} weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that {{a bill of rights}} listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegatesincluding future Bill of Rights drafter James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt <b>to</b> <b>enumerate</b> individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.|$|E
5|$|Regardless {{of whether}} Calabi–Yau compactifications of string theory provide a correct {{description}} of nature, {{the existence of}} the mirror duality between different string theories has significant mathematical consequences. The Calabi–Yau manifolds used in string theory are of interest in pure mathematics, and mirror symmetry allows mathematicians to solve problems in enumerative algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the numbers of solutions to geometric questions. A classical problem of enumerative geometry is <b>to</b> <b>enumerate</b> the rational curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold such as the one illustrated above. By applying mirror symmetry, mathematicians have translated this problem into an equivalent problem for the mirror Calabi–Yau, which turns out to be easier to solve.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June, Maisky {{agreed to}} the sending of two {{commissions}} to Spain, <b>to</b> <b>enumerate</b> foreign volunteer forces, and to bring about their withdraw. It was estimated to cost £1,750,000 to £2,250,000, borne by member countries of the Committee. The Nationalists wished to prevent {{the fall of the}} favourable Chamberlain government in the United Kingdom, and so were seen to accept the plan. With much bemoaning, the Republicans also accepted the plan. The Nationalists demanded belligerent rights first, then withdrawals of 10,000 from each side after, which amounted to a rejection of the plan. Following the Munich Agreement – judged by Chamberlain to have been a success – Britain would host similar mediation in Spain. Negrín would propose the removal of the International Brigades, a majority of whom were now Spaniards, at the last meeting of the League of Nations, thereby showing his contempt for the Non-Intervention Committee. Similarly, Italians would leave Spain under the Anglo-Italian agreement, not through the Committee.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe study {{permutation}} enumeration of the hyperoctahedral group Bn {{through a}} combinatorial {{use of the}} Bn-analogues of symmetric functions, denoted AB. We define an appropriate homomorphism ζ:AB → Q[x] and remarkably, applying this homomorphism {{to one of the}} bases of AB produces polynomials which correspond <b>to</b> <b>enumerating</b> Bn with respect to descents. Applying ζ to a second basis corresponds <b>to</b> <b>enumerating</b> a conjugacy class of Bn with respect to a new descent type statistic which arises naturally...|$|R

25|$|Most simply, given {{a list of}} polyominoes {{of order}} n, squares may be added next to each polyomino in each {{possible}} position, and the resulting polyomino of order n+1 {{added to the list}} if not a duplicate of one already found; refinements in ordering the enumeration and marking adjacent squares that should not be considered reduce the number of cases that need to be checked for duplicates.

25|$|A more {{sophisticated}} method, described by Redelmeier, {{has been used}} by many authors as a way of not only counting polyominoes (without requiring that all polyominoes of order n be stored in order <b>to</b> <b>enumerate</b> those of order n+1), but also proving upper bounds on their number. The basic idea is that we begin with a single square, and from there, recursively add squares.

25|$|The {{information}} assurance process typically {{begins with the}} enumeration and classification of the information assets to be protected. Next, the IA practitioner will perform a risk assessment for those assets.

The assessment then considers both the probability and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability in an asset, with impact usually {{measured in terms of}} cost to the asset's stakeholders.
