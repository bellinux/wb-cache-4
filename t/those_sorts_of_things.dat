6000|$|... "If you did," [...] Brooks {{answered}} him, [...] "you'd {{do it by}} yourself, and you'd stand a {{fair chance}} of being run out. There's {{going to be no}} preaching or hymn-singing here. <b>Those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> are very well in their way, but they've {{nothing to do with this}} show. I'm not sure whether we shall open on Sundays or not. If we do it will be only for the ordinary business. Now let's get to work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, you see, I took up {{natural history}} {{and a whole lot}} of other {{subjects}} at the same time, and one can’t remember everything, can one? I used to know the difference between the Sardinian dormouse and the ordinary kind, and whether the wry-neck arrives at our shores earlier than the cuckoo, or the other way round, and how long the walrus takes in growing to maturity; I daresay you knew all <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> once, but I bet you’ve forgotten them.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{keep your}} mouth shut, my dear. You'll learn all <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> in time, and nobody notices it if you don't say anything." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{generally}} their own fault if they don't get the main things," [...] he insisted. [...] "But, see here, I'll attack {{you with your}} own weapons. Here am I, forty-one years old, {{in love with you}} since I was thirty-two. What about those nine years? I am dropping into the ways of untidy, unsatisfactory bachelordom. I only order new clothes when some friend chaffs me into it, and if I do I forget the ties and shirts and <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> I've lost all interest in myself. I loaf at the club, play auction bridge when I might be doing something a great deal better, and drink a whisky and soda when any one asks me. I hang on to the business, but when I've finished my work I drift. In another five years' time I shall begin to stoop, I shall live with cigar ash all over my clothes, and I shall have to be taken home from the club every other night. Your doing, Marcia--your responsibility." ...|$|E
5000|$|In December 2014, {{photographs}} showing Queensland police vehicles featuring Santos company logos created {{controversy and}} pushed the topic of corporate sponsorship of police activity into the mainstream media. Santos contributed approximately $40,000 to the program. Queensland Police commissioner Ian Stewart described the vehicles as [...] "PR vehicles that we use at shows, we use at expos, all of <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> just as any PR machine would be used by a company or another government organisation." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stewart {{was already}} {{cast in the}} part of Lin McAdam and {{he spent a lot of}} time {{practicing}} with the rifle so he would look like an authentic westerner. As Mann later described, [...] "Stewart was magnificent walking down a street with a Winchester rifle cradled in his arm. And he was great too actually firing the gun. He studied hard at it. His knuckles were raw with practising... It was <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that helped make the film look so authentic, gave it its sense of reality." [...] An expert from the Winchester company, Herb Parsons, actually did the trick shooting required for the film, and assisted Stewart in his training.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mention it}} before, because I don't talk much <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> I don't pretend to {{understand}} them, {{and it is}} better to leave them alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! ah! I forgot; {{there are}} cutlets and <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> My hand {{is not in}} yet for this work, aunt. Well, as I was saying about Cambridge--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's found {{a better}} job," [...] he admitted. [...] "Kind of queer in his health, though. I've been taken {{a little like}} it myself, but <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> pass off--they pass off." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{think any}} {{criticism}} I got in India was probably right. Normally I take <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> in my stride, but I think I had {{an attitude that}} had been ingrained in by...people who'd told me about their tours there. So I was a bit outspoken when I shouldn't have been, because I was really on edge {{to make sure that}} the food was adequate and the hygiene was all right. Which it wasn't. It was disgraceful really and I think we were badly let down. It was probably all right if you were a drinker on that tour because at least you could write yourself off. But the Redpaths and Lawrys and Stackpoles and Sheahans, who weren't big drinkers, who were just trying to be dedicated sportsmen, found it hard. Relaxing on a tour was nearly impossible.|$|E
5000|$|Work for {{the album}} began in 2000, {{when it was}} {{initially}} titled Chemical Four. The album explores new gear such as the Parker MIDI Fly guitar. When asked about if the album is a [...] "back-to-roots" [...] album following their change in style for Surrender three years previous, Ed Simons said [...] "The first three or four numbers do remind me of those days when we were so excited about putting together little grooves and beats - that whole cut-up era of hip-hop. We had Grand Wizard Theodore DJing at our gigs then. Like that scratch segment in 'Afrika', those tiny segments where {{it sounds like a}} DJ cutting in, <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> used to really excite us. But some of the music is totally removed from that. 'Hoops' is totally different than anything we - or anyone - have ever done". The album took eighteen months to record.|$|E
5000|$|The Identicards {{given to}} Marcus and Franklin are for Jim Fennerman and Daniel Lane, respectively. Their backstory {{is that they}} are a young married couple on holiday to Mars on their honeymoon. This is a rare look at human social issues in the Babylon 5 {{universe}} and insinuates that by the 23rd century, same-sex marriage is perfectly legal not only on Earth but throughout Earth-controlled space. Same-sex relationships and themes in television SF were not typical at this time. In a 2014 interview, show creator J. Michael Straczynski said that [...] "We didn't make {{a big deal out of}} them being married. We played it exactly as if it was a male-female couple being married, or pretending to be married. I think it didn't have much of a fuss about it because it's science fiction, you're expected to be able to do <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> more readily than you can in a mainstream show. But yeah, we were out there in the forefront of these things 20 years ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a moment; {{that is very}} likely. I {{sent you}} word {{that you would have}} to pay for taking it up. Of course they don't abandon <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> without some consideration." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who? I! Oh, no--I don't think <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> I suppose I shall marry some day. I've a house {{fit for a}} lady to-morrow, {{from top}} to bottom, linen and all. And my property's my own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you are going to say. Well, perhaps it is rash. But when you are going to foreign courts, what are you to do? If you have got <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> you must wear them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, indeed," [...] said Supplehouse; [...] "as {{he always}} does <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> No man makes so good an {{explanation}} of circumstances, or comes out with so telling a personal statement. He ought to keep himself in reserve for <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{he always}} had a twist," [...] said Lady St Julians, [...] "and used to breakfast with that horrid Mr Trenchard, and do <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> But still with his immense fortune, I should think he would become rational." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is to be}} {{feared that}} the two Americans were not as thrilled by this sad recital as the fair narrator had expected, and even Dick ventured {{to point out that}} <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> {{happened}} also to his countrymen, and were not peculiar to the casa.|$|R
6000|$|... "Breweries and all <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> necessitate {{money to}} start with; {{one has to}} pay {{premiums}} or invest capital in the undertaking, and so forth. And as we have no money available, and can scarcely pay our debts as it is, it's no use thinking about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{knew the}} {{governor}} {{would not have}} it. Money and rank and <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> are not particularly charming to me. But still things should go together. It is all very well {{for you and me}} to be pals, but of course it will be expected that Mary should marry some--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't seem to me," [...] I said, [...] "to be {{anything}} else. You talk like a tadpole. Haven't you any other interest in life? What about home, and patriotism, and Shakespeare--all <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things?</b> Why {{not give it}} a square meal, and silence it {{for an hour or}} two; leave yourself free to think of something else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} take my advice," [...] the doctor said earnestly, [...] "you will lay in five times as much. Say ten sacks of flour, two hundred-weight of sugar, and {{everything}} else in proportion. <b>Those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> haven't got up in price, yet; but you will see, everything will rise {{as soon as the}} blockade begins in earnest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Makes me {{feel kind of}} ashamed," [...] Richard muttered. [...] "I've {{never done}} {{anything}} but play around all my life. Anyway, <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> don't come to us in our country. America's too powerful and too isolated to need help of that description. We shouldn't have any use for politicians of your class, or for Secret Service men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the tastiest {{present for}} a gentleman {{to make to}} his lady that has come out since--since <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> have come out at all. You'll {{let me show you}} the articles, sir. It will give me the sincerest pleasure." [...] And Mr. Kantwise {{proposed}} to leave the room in order that he might introduce the three boxes in question.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Huffington Post, O'Brien stated, “We became really interested in mixing southern aspects of music -- soul, rock, blues, <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> -- with a progressive outlook, where we got really into dance music, house music, techno, psychedelic rock. We became really interested in mixing all those sounds; something future-looking and also vibe-y and comfortable, but different all together.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Lance was {{nestling}} {{close up}} {{to him in the}} dark, and he {{was surprised to find that}} round face wet with tears. 'Papa would not let him lie dull and moped all day long,' he said. 'O Fee, I can't keep away; I am so sorry for him. When that terrible cramp comes, it is of no use to say <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> to him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That {{is why she}} was {{so anxious}} to come,” said Mrs. Norbury; “she put off another {{engagement}} in order to accept my invitation. She’s had visions and dreams, and all <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> that have come true in a most marvellous manner, but she’s never actually seen a ghost, and she’s longing to have that experience. She belongs to that Research Society, you know.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He edits the CATHEDRAL MONTHLY," [...] {{said her}} hostess, [...] "and he's {{enormously}} learned about memorial brasses and transepts {{and the influence}} of Byzantine worship on modern liturgy, and all <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> Perhaps he is just a little bit heavy and immersed in one range of subjects, but it takes all sorts to make a good house-party, you know. You don't find him TOO dull, do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} which I like best; this, or my own place at Boxall Hill. You have the {{advantage}} here in trees, and <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> But, as to the house, why, my box there is very comfortable, very. You'd hardly know the place now, Lady Arabella, if you haven't seen it since my governor bought it. How {{much do you think}} he spent about the house and grounds, pineries included, you know, and <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No indeed I have not. You have scolded me {{too much}} for match-making, for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now, meant nothing. One says <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>of</b> course, without any idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the {{smallest}} wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose all Parliament {{people make}} asses of {{themselves}} sometimes, Lords {{as well as}} Commons. I don't see how a man is to go on talking for ever about laws and landleagues, and <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> without doing so. It is all bosh to me. And so I should think it must be to you, as you don't do it. But I {{do not think that}} father is worse than anybody else; and I think that his words are sometimes very beautiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you {{can cure}} her {{if you want}} to," [...] the doctor declared, [...] "and if you do, you will have the sweetest {{companion}} for life any man could have. But you'll {{have to give up}} the idea of town houses and racing and yachting, and grouse moors in Scotland, and all <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> I suppose you've been looking forward to. You'll have for some time, at any rate, to give every moment of your time to your wife." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “There’s {{no doubt}} in {{forestry}} {{now a lot of}} data that are being collected are novel, using a lot of measurements from airplanes and satellites. These are opening up new avenues for discovery. Also [we] have electronic sensors [that] can measure a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> impossible to measure by any tools we had in the past. They use very high-definition imagery, three-dimensional imagery, and multi-spectrum imagery, parts of the spectrum are not even visible to human eyes. So <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> will no doubt have major impact going forward.” [...]...|$|R
