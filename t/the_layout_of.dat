40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} that spontaneous eye movements occur when visuospatial information is recalled from memory. Such gazes closely reflect the content and spatial relations from <b>the</b> original scene <b>layout</b> (e. g., Johansson et al., 2012). However, when someone has originally read a scene description, the memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text itself might compete with {{the memory of the}} spatial arrangement of the described scene. The present study was designed to address this fundamental issue by having participants readscene descriptions that where manipulated to be either congruent or incongruent with <b>the</b> spatial <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text itself. 28 participants read and recalled three texts: (1) a scene description congruent with <b>the</b> spatial <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text; (2) a scene description incongruent with <b>the</b> spatial <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text; and (3) a control text without any spatial scene content. Recollection was performed orally while gazing at a blank screen. Results demonstrate that participant’s gaze patterns during recall more closely reflect <b>the</b> spatial <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene than the physical locations of the text.
