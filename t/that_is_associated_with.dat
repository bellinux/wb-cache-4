5|$|Air {{rises and}} rotates around a {{vertical}} axis, {{usually in the}} same direction as low-pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> a localized low-pressure region within a supercell. Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. About 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the United States, but only half produce tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{can bring}} mild weather {{with a little}} rain and surface winds of , or they can be cold and dangerous with torrential rain and winds exceeding , (sometimes referred to as windstorms in Europe). The band of precipitation <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the warm front is often extensive. In mature extratropical cyclones, an area known as the comma head on the northwest periphery of the surface low can be a region of heavy precipitation, frequent thunderstorms, and thundersnows. Cyclones tend to move along a predictable path at a moderate rate of progress. During fall, winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through {{the depth of the}} troposphere to cause snowfall.|$|E

5|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} genetic disorder <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> protein misfolding and aggregation. Excessive repeats of the glutamine amino acid at the N-terminus of the Huntingtin protein cause aggregation, and although {{the behavior of the}} repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease. As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure. Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the Huntingtin protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with rational drug design methods to stop the aggregate formation. The N17 fragment of the Huntingtin protein accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown. Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease. Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.|$|E
5|$|Its {{main body}} is solid {{sterling}} silver and silver gilt, while its plinth {{is made of}} malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which {{the names of the}} title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles {{on either side of the}} trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season. The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.|$|E
5|$|Paxillus involutus can {{be found}} growing on lawns and old meadows {{throughout}} its distribution. Fruit bodies are generally terrestrial, {{though they may be}} found on woody material around tree stumps. They generally appear in autumn and late summer. In California, David Arora discerned a larger form associated with oak and pine which appears in late autumn and winter, as well as the typical form <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> birch plantings and appears in autumn. Several species of flies and beetles have been recorded using the fruit bodies to rear their young. The mushroom can be infected by Hypomyces chrysospermus, or bolete eater, a mould species that parasitises Boletales members. Infection results in the appearance of a whitish powder that first manifests on the pores, then spreads over the surface of the mushroom, becoming golden yellow to reddish-brown in maturity.|$|E

5|$|This is a {{timeline}} {{of the events}} relating to the discovery that peptic ulcer disease and some cancers are caused by H. pylori. In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that peptic ulcer disease (PUD) was primarily caused by Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium with affinity for acidic environments, such as the stomach. As a result, PUD <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> H. pylori is currently treated with antibiotics used to eradicate the infection. For 30 years prior to their discovery, it was widely believed that PUD was caused by excess acid in the stomach. During this time, acid control was the primary method of treatment for PUD, to only partial success; among other effects, it is now known that acid suppression alters the stomach milieu to make it less amenable to H. pylori infection.|$|E
5|$|Visual scene {{displays}} are {{a different}} method of organizing and presenting symbols. These are depictions of events, people, objects, and related actions in a picture, photograph, or virtual environment representing a situation, place, or specific experience. They are similar to activity displays in that they contain vocabulary <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> specific activities or routines. For example, {{a photo of a}} child's room may be included in the child's AAC system. Objects and events within the photograph are then used as symbols for communication. Research suggests that visual scene displays are easier than grid displays for young children or those with cognitive impairments to learn and use.|$|E
5|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism {{has yet to}} be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with the mirror neuron system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the mirror neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.|$|E

5|$|Old-style serif typefaces by Garamond and {{his colleagues}} finally fell out of use {{altogether}} {{with the arrival of}} what is now called the Didone style of printing in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, promoted by the Didot family in France and others. This favoured a much more geometric, constructed style of letter which could show off the increasingly refined paper and printing technologies of the period. Mosley comments: The upheavals of the Revolution coincided with the major shift in the style of printing types <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the family of Didot, and the stock of old materials abruptly lost its value, except as scrap. Punches rust, and the copper of matrices is recyclable. All traces of the early types that had been {{in the hands of the}} trade typefounders like Le Bé, Sanlecque and Lamesle in Paris vanished completely. No relics of them were saved anywhere, except in commercial centres that had become relative backwaters, like Antwerp, where the Plantin-Moretus printing office piously preserved the collection of its founder... the term caractères de l'Université became attached by default to the set of apparently early matrices that had survived, its provenance forgotten, in the mixed stock of materials of the national printing-office.|$|E
