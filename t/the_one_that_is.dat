5|$|Navenby {{is served}} by its own village school, Navenby Church of England Primary School. It is a {{voluntary}} controlled school for children aged 4–11. There is a choice of nearby senior schools for older Navenby pupils, although none are within the village. Lincolnshire County Council operates a preference system for parents, which allows them to choose a preferred school, rather than one {{for which they are}} in the catchment area. The closest senior school to Navenby, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> within the Designated Transport Area, is Sir William Robertson High School at Welbourn. This is a mixed comprehensive school named after Field Marshal William Robertson, who was born in Welbourn and served in the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Two-level utilitarianism is {{virtually}} {{a synthesis of}} the opposing doctrines of act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism states that in all cases the morally right action is the one which produces the most pleasure, whereas rule utilitarianism states that the morally right action is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> in accordance with a moral rule whose general observance would create the most happiness. In terms of two-level utilitarianism, act utilitarianism can be likened to the 'critical' level of moral thinking, and rule utilitarianism to the 'intuitive' level.|$|E
5|$|Following the Ottoman {{withdrawal}} from Niš in 1878, the tower was roofed over, and in 1892 a chapel was built around it. In 1937, the chapel was renovated. A bust of Sinđelić was added the following year. In 1948, Skull Tower and the chapel enclosing it were declared Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance and {{came under the}} protection of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Further renovation of the chapel occurred again in 1989. As of 2013, 54 skulls remain on the tower. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> said to belong to Sinđelić is enclosed in a glass container. Seen as a symbol of independence by Serbs, the tower is mentioned in the writings of French Romantic poet Alphonse de Lamartine and English travel writer Alexander William Kinglake. In the two centuries since its construction, it has become a popular tourist attraction, visited by between 30,000 and 50,000 people annually.|$|E

5|$|Mutation bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{different}} mechanisms involved. Firstly, the UVA-radiation creates oxidative stress, which in turn oxidizes existing melanin and leads to rapid darkening of the melanin, also known as IPD (immediate pigment darkening). Secondly, there {{is an increase in}} production of melanin known as melanogenesis. Melanogenesis leads to delayed tanning and first becomes visible about 72 hours after exposure. The tan that is created by an increased melanogenesis lasts much longer than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> caused by oxidation of existing melanin. Tanning involves not just the increased melanin production in response to UV radiation but the thickening of the top layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{electrode}} potentials {{are usually}} tabulated as reduction potentials. However, the reactions are reversible {{and the role}} of a particular electrode in a cell depends on the relative oxidation/reduction potential of both electrodes. The oxidation potential for a particular electrode is just the negative of the reduction potential. A standard cell potential can be determined by looking up the standard electrode potentials for both electrodes (sometimes called half cell potentials). <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> smaller will be the anode and will undergo oxidation. The cell potential is then calculated as the sum of the reduction potential for the cathode and the oxidation potential for the anode.|$|E

There are three distinct populations of N. gemmeus in Southland, Otago and Canterbury, differentiated by coloration and the time of their breeding seasons. In addition to recognizing gemmeus as {{one of a number of}} separate species within the genus, some biologists think that the three different populations of this species should be elevated to subspecies status to place more emphasis on their conservation management.|$|E

25|$|It was {{originally}} commissioned {{for the church}} San Marcuola and is usually believed to be hanging today in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. The painting was removed from San Marcuola by the mid-seventeenth century as attested by Carlo Ridolfi.

The precise history of the painting is unclear, but it is perhaps <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> recorded as being part of the collection of King Charles I of England.

25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings {{there is something}} that is very seldom found in the art of today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some of these pictures before and in a place that had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I had seen them in the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around.

When working on side stepping, the skier is supported to keep the stump of their leg on the uphill side. Elite skiers are taught to avoid using outriggers as crutches. Skiers are taught to turn using their leg instead of their ski poles. Skiers {{in this class}} can use the outrigger to assist in maintaining their balance as they turn on the hill. A skier with an above the knee amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation. In getting on ski lifts, skiers with above the knee amputations in this classification should lift their outriggers off the ground and point them forward.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of independent Ukraine implemented policies {{to broaden the}} use of Ukrainian and mandated a progressively increased role for Ukrainian {{in the media and}} commerce. The most significant was the government's concerted effort to implement Ukrainian, as the only official state language in the country, into the state educational system. Despite the Constitution, the Law on Education (grants Ukrainian families (parents and their children) a right to choose their native language for schools and studies) as well as the Law of Languages (a guarantee for the protection of all languages in Ukraine) the education system gradually reshaped from a system that was only partly Ukrainian to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> overwhelmingly so. The Russian language is still studied as a required course in all secondary schools, including those with Ukrainian as the primary language of instructions. The number of secondary school students who received their primary education in Ukrainian has grown from 47.9% in 1990-1991. (the last school year before the Ukrainian independence) to 67.4% in 1999 and to 75.1% by 2003-2004 (see table). The Ukrainization has achieved even greater gains in the higher education institutions where as of 1990-1991 only 7% of students were being taught primarily in Ukrainian. By 2003-2004 the percentage of the college and technicum students studying in Ukrainian reached 87.7% and for the students of the University-level institutions this number reached 80.1% (see table).|$|E
