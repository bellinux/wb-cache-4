5000|$|The cargo trailer is, {{by means}} of a king pin, hooked to a horseshoe-shaped {{quick-release}} coupling device called a fifth wheel or a turntable hitch {{at the rear of the}} <b>towing</b> <b>engine</b> that allows easy hook up and release. The truck trailer cannot move by itself because it only has wheels at the rear end: it requires a forward axle, provided by the <b>towing</b> <b>engine,</b> to carry half the load weight. When braking hard at high speeds, the vehicle has a tendency to fold at the pivot point between the towing vehicle and the trailer. Such a truck accident is called a [...] "trailer swing", although it is also commonly described as a [...] "jackknife". Jackknifing is a condition where the tractive unit swings round against the trailer, and not vice versa.|$|E
5000|$|A {{tractor unit}} (prime mover or {{traction}} unit) is a characteristically heavy-duty <b>towing</b> <b>engine</b> that provides motive power for hauling a towed or trailered load. These {{fall into two}} categories: very heavy-duty typically off-road capable, often 6×6, military and commercial tractor units, including ballast tractors; and heavy and medium duty military and commercial rear-wheel drive [...] "semi tractors" [...] used for hauling semi-trailers.|$|E
50|$|On 1 December, {{she began}} an {{extensive}} refit. During the yard work, she was reclassified an ocean-going tug and redesignated AT-169 on 1 March 1944. The long overhaul was completed on 5 March, {{and the ship}} proceeded to Brisbane. Coming under the operational control of Commander, Service Force, 7th Fleet, Whippoorwill arrived at Brisbane on 20 March. For the next 10 days, 21 to 31 March 1944, she underwent final conversion to an ocean-going tug. This involved the removal of her minesweeping gear {{and the addition of}} a heavy-duty <b>towing</b> <b>engine</b> which had once been fitted on board Dobbin (AD-3).|$|E

5000|$|Highlighting {{the latter}} part of her long tour of {{research}} support work was a towing operation—something she had not been configured for in many, many years. Underway from Bayonne on 31 January 1967, Allegheny sailed for Bermuda, arriving on 3 February. No longer possessing a <b>towing</b> <b>engine</b> or fittings, the research vessel had to jury-rig a towing arrangement to the [...] "Monster Buoy" [...] (General Dynamics Buoy [...] "Bravo")- Setting out for the west coast of the United States on 11 February, Allegheny and the [...] "Monster Buoy" [...] headed for the Pacific. Touching briefly at Guantanamo Bay for provisions from 17 to 19 February, Allegheny and her charge transited the Panama Canal on 23 February, and set out for Acapulco on the 25th. En route, the tug and her tow ran into 40-knot winds and 15-foot seas in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, but reached their destination on 4 March. Underway on the 7th, Allegheny delivered her tow one week later, on the 14th, having successfully completed a 32-day, 4,642-mile journey. Retracing her course, the tug returned to Bermuda on 16 April, via Acapulco, the Panama Canal, and Kingston, Jamaica.|$|E

50|$|In {{her career}} Aurania was never very popular, {{she was known}} as a badly rolling ship. During her maiden voyage on 23 June 1883 she left Liverpool for Queenstown and finally for New York, but halfway through the Atlantic her engine failed due to overheating.

50|$|The sand for {{the bricks}} was {{extracted}} from pits on Midhurst Common, {{close to the}} brickworks. The sand was extracted by a Ruston steam navvy and loaded into small wagons to be <b>towed</b> by <b>engine</b> to the manufacturing plant. There the sand would be screened before being conveyed into one of two Polysius mixing drums, to be mixed with chalk, which had been delivered from Cocking in 1 cwt sacks, and water. The mixing process lasted about 30 minutes after which the slaked mixture would be transferred through an edge runner mill to the brick presses. There were two Sutcliffe duplex presses which exerted 100 ton pressure on each pair of moulds producing 2800 bricks per hour, and a German-made Bernhardi press, with eight single moulds which produced 1200 bricks per hour.|$|R

50|$|Modernised between 1892 and 1893, she {{was held}} in reserve at Portsmouth until 1904. From March to June 1902 she served {{temporarily}} as port guard ship at Portland with {{the crew of the}} permanent guardship HMS Revenge, which was in for a refit. In July the same year she was temporarily commissioned by Captain John de Robeck, who transferred to the HMS Warrior when it had finished a refit to become depot ship. Her name changed to Calcutta in 1904, she served as depot ship at Gibraltar until 1914; she was then <b>towed</b> home, her <b>engines</b> being by this time inoperable, and became an artificers' training establishment at Portsmouth under the name of Fisgard II. By this time she was lacking masts, funnels, armament and superstructure, and was quite unrecognisable as the ship which had been widely regarded as Reed's masterpiece.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{chairlifts}} {{were installed}} at Sun Valley, Idaho in 1936, skiers had relied on tows powered by horses or water wheels. In the early 1930s, the Canadian Alex Foster designed a towing device powered by an automobile <b>engine.</b> <b>Tow</b> ropes and bars could be dangerous, and many skiers found them unpleasant - especially on longer or steeper runs. Curran's chairlift raised skiers {{off the ground}} allowing them to rest and gain an enjoyable view of mountains, ski-runs, and resorts. “People were marveling over how well the chairlifts worked,” and it [...] "hit the sweet spot of cost and comfort," [...] said Kirby Gilbert, a ski historian. A two-person lift was introduced in 1946, followed by three and four skier models of the next twenty years.

Local repairs kept Marathon in port until March, when the gunboat prepared for Exercise Multiplex 1-74, a combined gunboat-aircraft attack exercise on a carrier battle group. While at sea on 18 April, however, Marathon suffered a fuel leak and fire in the turbine spaces that burned into the crew spaces, forcing the ship to shut down her <b>engines.</b> <b>Towed</b> into port the following day, the gunboat was drydocked in AFDL-10 for repairs.|$|R
50|$|They are bitterly {{opposed by}} bus {{operators}} Alec Pearce (Ewan Roberts) and Vernon Crump (Jack MacGowran), but the line's supporters persuade the Ministry of Transport to grant them a month's trial period with an inspection at the end. Dan Taylor (Hugh Griffith), a retired track layer, {{knows how to}} run an engine and joins the venture. On the maiden run, Crump and Pearce try to block a crossing, first with their lorry {{and then with a}} passing steam roller operated by Harry Hawkins (Sid James), but the steam locomotive is too powerful and pushes them off the track. The next day, Crump and Pearce persuade an irate Hawkins to shoot holes in the water tower, but the passengers form a bucket brigade and refill the engine from a nearby river. The night before the inspection, Hawkins, Crump and Pearce sabotage the line by using the steamroller to <b>tow</b> the unguarded <b>engine</b> and coach down the gradient, where it runs off the track. The village solicitor, Blakeworth, is mistakenly blamed and arrested.|$|R
5|$|On 1 November 1900, Kaiser Friedrich III {{replaced}} Kaiser Wilhelm II as the I Squadron flagship; the latter, as {{the fleet}} flagship, remained {{assigned to the}} squadron for tactical purposes. From 4 to 15 December, Kaiser Wilhelm II and the I Squadron went on a winter training cruise to Norway; the ships anchored at Larvik from 10 to 12 December. At 01:30 on 2 January 1901, she was steaming from Danzig to Kiel with Kaiser Friedrich III when the latter struck an underwater obstacle. The shock from the collision damaged the ship's boilers and started {{a fire in the}} coal bunkers. Kaiser Wilhelm II took her sister in <b>tow,</b> although the <b>engines</b> on Kaiser Friedrich III were restarted along the way. The ships eventually reached Kiel, where temporary repairs were conducted. Kaiser Wilhelm II went into drydock in January 1901 for overhaul and some modernization work. This included the reconstruction of a larger bridge and the removal of some of her searchlights. While the ship was laid up, Admiral Hans von Koester replaced Hoffmann as the fleet commander, a position he would hold until the end of 1906.|$|R
40|$|Importance of {{wheel in}} the {{automobile}} is obvious. The vehicle (car) may be <b>towed</b> without the <b>engine</b> {{but at the}} same time even that is also not possible without the wheels, the wheels along the tyre has to carry the vehicle load, provide cushioning effect and cope with the steering control. The main requirements of an automobile wheel are; it must be strong enough to perform the above functions. It should be balanced both statically as well as dynamically. It should be lightest possible so that the unsprung weight is least. The Wheel has to pass three types of tests before going into production, they are Cornering fatigue test, Radial fatigue test and Impact test. In this thesis radial fatigue analysis is done to find the number of cycles at which the wheel is going to fail. The 2 D of the wheel was created in MDT, the drafting package and the same was exported to ANSYS, the finite element package using IGES translator where the 3 D model of the wheel is created. The wheel is meshed using SOLID 45 element. A load of 2500 N was applied on the hub area of the wheel and a pressure of 0. 207 N/mm 2 is applied on the outer surface of the rim. The pitch circle holes are constrained in all degrees of freedom. The analysis is carried under these constraints and the results are taken to carryout for further analysis i. e. fatigue module to find the life of the wheel...|$|R
5000|$|Used {{for very}} short {{distances}} where a rope, chain, or {{a length of}} webbing {{is attached to the}} casualty, which must have a working braking system as it will be used to slow both vehicles. This can be dangerous, unless both drivers are competent enough to do it. Although many people believe this is illegal on motorways it is not in Europe, as long as the relevant trailer laws are complied with, i.e., correctly configured lights and signing, observing trailer speed limits, etc. In the US this is simply called a [...] "flat tow", and it is not common practice to use the brakes of the rear vehicle to stop both vehicles. As typically a car is being flat <b>towed</b> because the <b>engine</b> won't run, and without a running engine the power brakes don't work, it could be dangerous as well as difficult to slow and stop two vehicles using only the brakes that only half function. Instead, it is typical for the towing vehicle to drive normally, but avoiding sharp acceleration or braking. All the person driving the rear vehicle has to do is gently apply the brakes whenever the tow chain begins to slacken, and anticipate stops so he or she can drag the brakes and come to a halt without excessive slack in the chain. This still requires a relatively skilled driver, as neither the power brakes or power steering will function, and you must take care to steer wide in sharp corners and never allow the chain to slacken, or it may get jerked and broken, or worse, drag underneath the vehicle and possibly cause damage or even loss of control.|$|R
40|$|Engine fleet {{management}} {{has always been}} one of the most challenging tasks in any airline as it requires assuring reliability and cost effectiveness of engine operation at all times. The engine maintenance expenses are quite significant and accounts for about one third of the total aircraft maintenance costs. For all airlines with “Labour & Material” type of contractual arrangement with respective OEM / MRO provider, maximizing <b>engine’s</b> Time On-Wing (<b>TOW)</b> is extremely crucial to face lower maintenance costs, while at the same time abiding by governing airworthiness standards. <b>Engine’s</b> <b>TOW</b> is generally limited due to at least one of the following reasons: performance degradation reflected by lower Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) margin, hot section hardware life monitored by regular borescope inspections and Life Limited parts (LLP) expiry enforced by OEM or regulatory authority. After introducing relevant aero engine maintenance concepts and terminology, this thesis will serve to provide both qualitative and quantitative assessment of how certain operational factors of flight profile influence engine performance deterioration and maintenance costs. One such factor is the thrust rating of the engine. Higher thrust gives rise to higher internal temperatures, exposing engine hardware to greater mechanical and thermal stresses and therefore leading to faster rate of degradation and earlier engine removal. This thesis will be of interest to airlines having at least two different types of aircraft models in their fleet with different average flight profiles but powered by the same engine model with the required thrust variant. A particular engine may spend some time first on the aircraft that requires higher thrust rating before being switched to the aircraft that requires lower thrust rating or vice versa. This thesis will look into the feasibility of such an operational strategy through different aspects and discuss its effectiveness in retaining the engine performance for a longer time, thereby affecting the operating fuel costs and restoration costs per flying hour expected at the time of shop visit...|$|R
5|$|All fifteen Hamilcars which {{participated in}} the first lift on 17 September arrived over the landing zones safely, but {{problems}} were experienced {{when they came in}} to land. Two of the gliders landed on soft ground, which caused them to rapidly decelerate; this, combined with the majority of their equipment being {{in the front of the}} gliders, resulted in them flipping onto their backs. Three of the pilots were killed and the fourth was badly wounded and later taken prisoner, and several passengers were wounded; the 17-pounder anti-tank guns on board the gliders were damaged beyond repair. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully, although one overran the landing zone and hit a railway embankment; this damaged the two Universal Carriers being carried by the glider, although both were later salvaged. The lift on 18 September was delayed for several hours due to poor weather conditions, and the glider force did not take off until approximately 11:00. En route to the landing zones, one Hamilcar was forced to cast off and land at an airfield in England after its <b>tow</b> aircraft developed <b>engine</b> trouble, and another ditched in the English Channel when its tug developed engine troubles as well; both had been carrying 17-pounder anti-tank guns. The rest of the Hamilcars encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire as they landed, with several being hit. As a result, one Hamilcar landed short of the landing zone after being hit in the wing, and another was forced to make an emergency landing far from the landing zone after being hit; the stores, pilots and passengers were captured by German forces shortly after the glider landed. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully. The third lift on 19 September did not take place due to weather problems, and because several of 1st Airborne Division's landing zones had been overrun. Finally on 21 September the weather cleared, but due to 1st Airborne Division's deteriorating situation it was decided that the 878th Aviation Engineer Battalion would not be delivered. As such, only a single Hamilcar accompanied 1st Polish Independent Parachute Brigade when it set off for its drop near the town of Driel; this was the same Hamilcar which had been forced to land in England on 19 September when its tug had experienced engine trouble. However, the tow rope between the glider and tug snapped over Belgium, and it was forced to land near Ghent.|$|R
