5|$|The {{alignment}} of today’s Route 124 was first {{designated as a}} part of pre-1927 Route 5 in 1916, a route that was to run from Delaware, Warren County to Newark. In 1927, <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route became a part of Route 24, a route that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. A freeway, which is the current {{alignment of}} Route 24, was proposed for <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route in the 1950s that was approved in 1960. Route 24 was moved to the new freeway between the John F. Kennedy Parkway on the Millburn/Summit border and Interstate 78 (I-78) in 1972, with Route 124 being designated along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point. In 1992, the Route 24 freeway was completed between I-287 in Hanover Township and the John F. Kennedy Parkway. As a result, Route 124 was extended west along the former Route 24 to U.S. Route 202 in Morristown.|$|E

However, Samus retains all energy tanks she acquired previously.|$|E
5|$|A {{third part}} of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars. The survey would have helped {{scientists}} understand more about solar system formation, including the occurrence of hot Jupiters. <b>This</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet hunt was designed to study systems {{with one or more}} Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM {{would have been able to}} execute its three primary planet-finding missions.|$|E

5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Schuyler Avenue (which runs as Hudson County Route 507 {{to the south}} of Route 7 and Bergen County Route 130 to the north of Route 7), the road turns NNW, narrowing again to two lanes undivided. In <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route, it had a concurrency with County Route 507 (both Bergen and Hudson counties). It keeps this configuration for about a half mile, as it still runs along the Kearny/North Arlington border.

5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely {{at the core of}} his decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. <b>This</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 was taken from the trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route286 (NY286) is an east–west {{state highway}} in the {{vicinity}} of the city of Rochester, New York, in the United States. It links Rochester to its eastern suburbs and to western Wayne County. The western terminus of the route is at exit7 on NY590 just inside the Rochester city limits. Its eastern terminus is at NY350 in Walworth. NY286 is named Browncroft Boulevard from NY590 to its junction with Qualtrough and Clark roads in Penfield. <b>This</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway passes through predominantly residential areas. East of this intersection, the route is known as Atlantic Avenue and traverses more rural areas.|$|E

5|$|The Route 21 freeway {{was planned}} to extend north to Interstate 80 in Elmwood Park at the {{interchange}} with County Route 507, crossing over the Passaic River. However, this extension was opposed by residents {{who lived on}} the east side of the Passaic River, and for a quarter-century, traffic headed for Paterson had to use local streets in Passaic. In the 1980s, plans were resurrected for completing the Route 21 freeway along the west bank of the Passaic River to U.S. Route 46 in Clifton. Official plans were made in 1996, and in late 1997, construction began on <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freeway. It opened on December 20, 2000 at a cost of $136 million.|$|E
5|$|The city {{developed}} {{on both sides}} of the prominent Arkansas River, which flows in a wide, sandy-bottomed channel. Its flow through the Tulsa area is controlled by upstream flood control reservoirs, but its width and depth can vary widely throughout the year, such as during periods of high rainfall or severe drought. A low-water dam maintains a full channel at all times in the area adjacent to downtown Tulsa. <b>This</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river is known as Zink Lake.|$|E
5|$|The first {{region on}} either side of the bilayer is the {{hydrophilic}} headgroup. <b>This</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9nm thick. In phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5nm outside the hydrophobic core. In some cases, the hydrated region can extend much further, for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head. One common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane, which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration.|$|E
