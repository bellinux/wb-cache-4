5|$|Nefarious: Merchant of Souls {{documents}} modern human trafficking, specifically sexual slavery. While <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>men</b> {{and boys}} who are trafficked around the world, the United States Department of State (DoS) estimates that about 80% of human trafficking victims are female, and the film focuses on them. Information is presented from a Christian worldview—despite the subject matter, there is no profanity or nudity in the film, although there are scenes showing alcohol consumption and women wearing skimpy clothing.|$|E
25|$|Although kawaii is {{typically}} a female-dominated fashion, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>men</b> who decide to partake in this trend. Some men decide to transform themselves into women, more specifically kawaii women. They {{are able to}} transform themselves by wearing wigs, false eyelashes, applying makeup, and wearing kawaii female clothing. This is seen predominately in male entertainers, such as Torideta-san, a DJ who transforms himself into a kawaii woman when working at his nightclub.|$|E
25|$|It {{is natural}} to a {{republic}} {{to have only}} a small territory, otherwise it cannot long subsist. In a large republic <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>men</b> of large fortunes, and consequently of less moderation; there are trusts too great {{to be placed in}} any single subject; he has interest of his own; he soon begins to think that he may be happy, great and glorious, by oppressing his fellow citizens; and that he may raise himself to grandeur on the ruins of his country. In a large republic, the public good is sacrificed to a thousand views; it is subordinate to exceptions, and depends on accidents. In a small one, the interest of the public is easier perceived, better understood, and more within the reach of every citizen; abuses are of less extent, and of course are less protected.|$|E

The storyline proved popular with viewers, and both Barlow and Porter received a high volume of messages through the social networking website Twitter from viewers expressing their surprise at Rae's involvement.

2500|$|The Old Testament was {{compiled}} and edited by various men {{over a period}} of centuries, with many scholars concluding that the Hebrew canon was solidified by about the 3rd century BC. [...] The works have been subject to various literary evaluations (both secular and religious). Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: “In the Jewish Old Testament, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>men,</b> things and speeches in so grand a style that Greek and Indian literature have nothing to compare to it. One stands with awe and reverence before these tremendous remnants of what man once was... The taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone of 'greatness' and 'smallness'.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Swami Vivekananda warned it is {{completely}} unfair to discriminate between sexes, as there is not any sex distinction in atman (soul), the soul has neither sex, nor caste nor imperfection. He suggested not to think that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>men</b> and women, but only that there are human beings. Swami Vivekananda felt, The best thermometer to the progress of a nation is its treatment of its women and {{it is impossible to}} get back India's lost pride and honor unless they try to better the condition of women. [...] Vivekananda considered men and women as two wings of a bird, and it is not possible for a bird to fly on only one wing. So, according to him, there is no chance for welfare of the world unless the condition of woman is improved.|$|E

2500|$|Poet Charles Baudelaire was a {{contemporary}} critic of George Sand: [...] "She is stupid, heavy and garrulous. [...] Her ideas on morals {{have the same}} depth of judgment and delicacy of feeling as those of janitresses and kept women... The fact that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>men</b> who could become enamoured of this slut is indeed a proof of the abasement of the men of this generation." [...] Other writers of the period, however, differed in their assessment. Flaubert, by no means an indulgent or forbearing critic, was an unabashed admirer. Honoré de Balzac, who knew Sand personally, once said that if someone thought George Sand wrote badly, it was because their own standards of criticism were inadequate. He also noted that her treatment of imagery in her works showed that her writing had an exceptional subtlety, having the ability to [...] "virtually put the image in the word".|$|E
2500|$|Originally, woodcarving was {{a solitary}} {{activity}} with all aspects done by one person, usually a male. As sales soared in the 1980s, the work {{began to be}} shared among family members. Women and children help mostly with sanding and painting, leaving men to contribute {{less than half of}} the work that goes into the figures. Despite this, pieces are still referred to as the work of one person, usually the male carver. There are exceptions to this. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>men</b> who paint better than they carve and in the community of San Pedro Taviche, women collect and carve wood about as often as the men. [...] In most cases, all the work on pieces is done by family members. Families may hire other relatives or strangers if faced with a large order. However, only the most established of carving families can have any permanent outside help and a number of these refuse to hire outsiders.|$|E
