5|$|The ZX Spectrum +3, {{released}} in 1987, looked {{similar to the}} +2A but featured a built-in 3-inch floppy disk drive (like the Amstrad CPC 6128) instead of the <b>tape</b> <b>drive,</b> and was in a black case. It was launched in 1987, initially retailed for £249 and then later £199 and was the only Spectrum capable of running the CP/M operating system without additional hardware.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the last}} decade or so, file and {{directory}} encryption to tape is gradually given way to device-level encryption, with the encryption being performed by the <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> instead of the system CPU.

5000|$|The 2400 <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> {{consisted}} of a combined drive and control unit, plus individual 1/2" [...] <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> attached. With System/360, IBM switched from IBM 7 track to 9 track <b>tape</b> format. 2400 <b>drives</b> could be purchased that read and wrote 7 track tapes for compatibility with the older IBM 729 <b>tape</b> <b>drives.</b> In 1967, a slower and cheaper pair of <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> with integrated control unit was introduced: the 2415. In 1968, the IBM 2420 tape system was released, offering much higher data rates, self-threading tape operation and 1600bpi packing density. It remained in the product line until 1979.|$|R

25|$|The dining {{philosophers}} {{problem is}} an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them. It was originally formulated in 1965 by Dijkstra as a student exam exercise, presented in terms of computers competing for access to <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> peripherals. Soon after, Tony Hoare gave the problem its present formulation. The sleeping barber problem is also attributed to Dijkstra.|$|E
25|$|For the {{magnetic}} tape sound recording Kornél Tolnai used magnetic tape {{as a medium}} for magnetic recording, made of a thin magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic. Most audio, video and computer data storage is this type. It was developed in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording. Devices that record and play back audio and video using magnetic tape are tape recorders and later on video tape recorders. A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape is a <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> (tape unit, streamer).|$|E
50|$|<b>Tape</b> <b>drives</b> {{built for}} the 3480 were {{initially}} designed for IBM System/370 computers. Therefore, the first 3480 <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> communicated through a bus and tag interface. Later models {{were able to take}} advantage of ESCON and high voltage SCSI interfaces. The advent of the SCSI interface made it possible to connect 3480 family <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> to personal computers, which enabled mainframe-to-PC data exchange.|$|R

25|$|A common {{application}} of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a <b>tape</b> <b>drive.</b> In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension {{to be applied to}} the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.|$|E

50|$|The IBM 3590 is {{a series}} of <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> and {{corresponding}} magnetic tape data storage media formats developed by IBM. The first drive, having the IBM product number 3590, was introduced in 1995 under the nickname Magstar. The 3590 series of <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> and media are not compatible with the IBM 3592 line of drives that replaced it. They can store up to 60 GB of data (uncompressed).

50|$|<b>Tape</b> <b>drives</b> can be {{connected}} to a computer with SCSI (most common), Fibre Channel, SATA, USB, FireWire, FICON, or other interfaces. <b>Tape</b> <b>drives</b> are used with autoloaders and tape libraries which automatically load, unload, and store multiple tapes, increasing the volume of data which can be stored without manual intervention.|$|R
2500|$|The 1980 Caprice Classic saw {{its first}} major {{revision}} since the 1977 downsizing. To further improve the fuel {{economy of the}} car, {{efforts were made to}} reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. The Caprice received all new exterior sheet metal, without drastically changing the look of the car. To improve aerodynamics the hood was tapered lower, while the trunk area was higher. The grille was now an egg crate style while the tail-light panel featured three separate square lights per side. All the doors and components within were redesigned to be lighter, including the window crank mechanisms, which now used a <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> mechanism. Greater use of aluminum including in-bumper reinforcement and in-sedan/coupe radiators helped to further reduce the overall weight of the vehicle. 1980 models were approximately [...] lighter than 1979 models.|$|E

[...] which included the ZX Spectrum, for £5 million. This included Sinclair's unsold stock of Sinclair QLs and Spectrums. Amstrad made more than £5 million on selling these surplus machines alone. Amstrad launched two new variants of the Spectrum: the ZX Spectrum +2, based on the ZX Spectrum 128, with a built-in <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> (like the CPC 464) and, the following year, the ZX Spectrum +3, with a built-in floppy disk drive (similar to the CPC 664 and 6128), taking the 3" [...] disks that many Amstrad machines used.|$|E
