As the Lower Mississippi River had been closed to American shipping for nearly a decade, farmers in western Pennsylvania were forced to turn their grain into whiskey. The substantial reduction in volume resulting from the distillation of grain into whiskey greatly reduced the cost to transport their crops to the populous east coast, which was the only place where there were markets for their crops.

Although the latter now resided chiefly in what is now Iraq, they insisted on retaining control of Khurasani affairs and demanded that the province's revenues be sent west to supply their salaries, something strongly resisted by the local Arab and Iranian elites. The resulting tension was eased when al-Fadl ibn Yahya, universally praised as a model governor, was appointed to Khurasan in 793, but was re-fanned in 796, when a member of the abnaʾ, Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, was placed in charge of the province.

40|$|Based on {{historical}} research, focusing mainly on early-modern Europe, {{it is assumed}} that taxation functions as a booster of state capacity and Quality of Government (QoG). The presence of this relationship for modern-day developing states is however heavily contested. This paper analyzes the relationship in a sub-Saharan context. By using new taxation data, which disaggregates resource income from other types of taxation (drawn from African Economic Outlook [2010]) we can with greater specificity dissect the different effects of different types of taxation. Through a multivariate regression analysis the paper shows that taxation, and in particular direct and indirect taxation, as a share of GDP seems to be associated with higher levels of QoG, although this relationship is at times weak. Furthermore, the relative dependence on direct and, to an extent indirect, <b>taxation,</b> <b>measured</b> as its share of the total tax base is shown to be more consistently coupled with better QoG. Thus, the paper concludes, more research on the importance of both size and shape of the tax base is warranted and needed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the tax {{structures of the}} Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries {{by focusing on the}} quality of governance and demographic changes as two influential factors in region’s economies. The objective of is to determine whether these factors can explain the variation in the tax structures of these countries. Results from regressions on the MENA countries and the ones based on a larger sample of 61 countries show that these factors affected the level of <b>taxation,</b> <b>measured</b> by the tax ratio, more strongly than they affected the tax composition. While the quality of governance seems to have affected the tax structures in the MENA countries more than in other comparable Non-OECD countries, demographics seems to have played a bigger role in determining the tax structures in other Non-OECD countries. However, neither of these factors explained changes in the income tax share satisfactorily. One key result is that the increase in the quality of governance has decreased the reliance on domestic taxes on goods and services. The paper provides a discussion on the policy implications of these results. Tax structure, quality of governance, demographics, MENA countries...|$|R

40|$|Ireland’s Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) {{with the}} EU/IMF {{requires}} government {{to introduce a}} recurring annual property tax. While the MoU has not specified the precise form this new <b>taxation</b> <b>measure</b> will adopt, commitments in the National Recovery Plan 2011 - 2014 and Fine Gael/Labour Programme for Government have pointed towards the introduction of an annual Site Value Tax (SVT). Budget 2011 suggested that the yield from this tax source would grow from € 180 m in 2012 to reach € 530 m in 2014. Similarly the MoU commits government to raising additional taxation revenues of € 1. 5 bn in 2012 and € 1. 1 bn in 2013 with both to be partly funded by a property tax and increases to that tax. To date assessments of the feasibility of a SVT (by the Commission of Taxation and the Department of Finance) have pointed towards a series of practical difficulties associated with its introduction. This paper outlines a proposal to overcome these difficulties and to introduce a credible, fair and reliable annual SVT from January 2013.

In July 1919, Kriegsabgaben (war levies) on income and wealth were introduced, as well as the first German inheritance tax. In December 1919, an additional Reichsnotopfer (a one-time [...] "emergency" [...] tax on wealth) was levied, causing outrage among the better-off. In March 1920, a federal income tax followed.

50|$|The {{theoretical}} {{foundations of}} the MCF {{can be found in}} the excess burden of <b>taxation</b> as <b>measured</b> by equivalent variation, compensating variation and consumer surplus. Relatedly, the social MCF is the basis for the conditions of an optimal tax system and optimal spending on public services. Thus, the outcome of a tax reform can be calculated using pre- and post-reform MCFs as well as price indices. Practically, MCFs can be calculated based on the tax rate and the elasticities of demand and supply. It is consequently related to the (compensating variation-based) marginal excess burden of taxation (MEB), but is comparatively superior in terms of policy analysis.|$|R
