500|$|A {{wide range}} of species perished in the K–Pg {{extinction}}. The best-known victims are the non-avian dinosaurs.

It is estimated that 75% or more of all species on Earth vanished. Yet the devastation caused by the extinction also provided evolutionary opportunities. In {{the wake of the}} extinction, many groups underwent remarkable adaptive radiations—a sudden and prolific divergence into new forms and species within the disrupted and emptied ecological niches resulting from the event.

500|$|Industrially, ammonia (NH3) is {{the most}} {{important}} compound of nitrogen and is prepared in larger amounts than any other compound, because it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>organisms</b> by serving as a precursor to food and fertilisers. It is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell. The presence of hydrogen bonding has very significant effects on ammonia, conferring on it its high melting (−78°C) and boiling (−33°C) points. As a liquid, it is a very good solvent with a high heat of vaporisation (enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks), that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high dielectric constant, and is less dense than water. However, the hydrogen bonding in NH3 is weaker than that in H2O due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in NH3 rather than two in H2O. It is a weak base in aqueous solution (pK'b 4.74); its conjugate acid is ammonium, [...] It can also act as an extremely weak acid, losing a proton to produce the amide anion, [...] It thus undergoes self-dissociation, similar to water, to produce ammonium and amide. Ammonia burns in air or oxygen, though not readily, to produce nitrogen gas; it burns in fluorine with a greenish-yellow flame to give nitrogen trifluoride. Reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products. Ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides.|$|E
