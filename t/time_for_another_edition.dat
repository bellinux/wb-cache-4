50|$|In 1994 it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> of the European Championships. Storp {{managed a}} throw of 19.39 metres, which {{was enough to}} secure a fourth place. Both the bronze {{medalist}} and the silver medalist, who was her countryfellow Astrid Kumbernuss, threw 19.49 metres. Storp did not compete at the next major event, the 1995 World Indoor Championships. At the 1995 World Championships, she once again underperformed {{in the final round}} with a throw of 18.81 metres. This time, it was enough for an eighth place, tied with seventh but losing on countback (measuring the second best throw in the competition). Astrid Kumbernuss won the event, with Kathrin Neimke in fourth place. Storp's season's best was only 18.95, achieved in July in London. 1996 was an Olympic year, and Storp was selected for her second Olympic Games. With 19.06 metres she finished sixth in the Olympic shot put final, one place ahead of Kathrin Neimke while Kumbernuss again won the event.|$|E
5000|$|... 1989 was {{the biggest}} year for Pontiac with respect to press coverage, promotions, and performance. It was not well known at the time, but in 1989, Pontiac {{produced}} the quickest and fastest American production car. The [...] "Excitement Division" [...] was also asked to provide a car to pace the 73rd running of the Indianapolis 500; sadly, {{it would be the}} final time a Pontiac would ever receive that honor. The Trans Am model was now 20 years old, and it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> anniversary <b>edition,</b> with this special 20th Anniversary Trans Am {{to be based on the}} existing Trans Am GTA. Through a unique partnership between Pontiac and an engineering firm called Prototype Automotive Services (PAS), the Trans Am GTA was equipped with a more powerful version of the turbocharged Buick 3.8L V6, originally developed for the Buick Regal Grand National, and the Turbo Trans Am (TTA) became the vehicle Pontiac supplied to pace the Indianapolis 500. Ultimately, 1,555 TTA replicas, rated at 250 hp, were produced for sale, five of those being test cars. But after Car and Driver magazine tested the car, logging a 0-60 mph run in 4.6 seconds, and a standing quarter-mile in 13.4 seconds at 101 mph, they called the 250 hp rating [...] "exceedingly modest," [...] estimating the actual output to be [...] "closer to 300 hp." [...] They also subsequently reported that it was the [...] "quickest 0-60 sprinter available in any US production-car showroom - at any price." [...] The Car and Driver evaluation produced the best acceleration performance of any mainstream publication to test a regular TTA press car from the Pontiac fleet, partly because Car and Driver realized that the turbo boost must be [...] "preloaded" [...] to get maximum performance figures. But short-distance sprinting was not all this car could do well. Early in 1989, Motor Trend ran their top speed test article [...] "Flat-out Fastest American Cars II-the Sequel." [...] During this test, the TTA did 162 mph, and was the fastest production car evaluated in the test. However, Motor Trend declared the winner to be a 1989 Corvette ZR-1, which went much faster, but was not a production car (it was a prototype that Chevrolet intended to release for production in 1989, but did not come out until 1990). [...] So by a slight technicality, the TTA could be called the flat-out quickest (0-60 4.6 sec.) and fastest (162 mph) American production car in 1989. It is interesting to note that the only constraint on the top speed of 162 mph was that the TTA was being limited by the engine redline and automatic transmission (with which all TTA's were equipped). When PAS installed a ZF 6-speed manual transmission into one of the cars, they were able to reach 181 mph. Perhaps more importantly than the performance tests provided by the industry magazines was the fact that these cars were capable of much faster acceleration times - with minimal modifications. In fact, with $300 in new parts installed, 12.5-second quarter-mile runs were achievable - without manually shifting gears or the need to trailer the vehicle to the track! Because of this, the TTA has gained a cult following among amateur racing enthusiasts.|$|R

Burton and Letchford had met several years before when the latter was 18 and in Florence beginning his art education. They discussed the possibility of illustrating the Nights. Burton's suggestion of illustrating the Nights had appealed greatly to Letchford on account of the unlimited scope such a subject would give to an artist who loved the East and had a boundless imagination. Letchford commenced study of Eastern images for his paintings, though only one of the illustrations was painted in Burton's lifetime.|$|R
