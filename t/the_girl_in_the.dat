5|$|In Europe, 17-year-old Brigitte Bardot wore scanty bikinis (by {{contemporary}} standards) in the French film Manina, la fille sans voiles ("Manina, {{the girl}} unveiled"). The promotion for the film, released in France in March 1953, drew {{more attention to}} Bardot's bikinis than to the film itself. By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re-titled Manina, <b>the</b> <b>Girl</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bikini. Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. Working {{with her husband and}} agent Roger Vadim she garnered significant attention with photographs of her wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France.|$|E

5|$|Riya has {{suffered}} a number of untimely incidents. During the filming of Shaadi No. 1 in France, she was knocked unconscious after being accidentally {{run over by a}} stuntman's motorbike, but she was not seriously injured. Shortly before the release of Silsiilay, in which she starred opposite her boyfriend Ashmit Patel, a 90-second video clip was circulated on Multimedia Messaging Services and the internet, showing the pair in compromising situations in a hotel bedroom. This was {{one of a number of}} controversies that erupted when celebrities were caught in similar situations using cameraphones. Following this incident, the couple split up, although Riya denied that she was <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MMS clip. One commentator claimed that the footage was an orchestrated publicity stunt. In 2007, she underwent a brief detoxification period in Bangkok for addiction to chocolate.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} Lochner's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime, and remained so until the 16th century. Early examples in ink after his Virgin in Adoration are in the British Museum and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. The influence of Lochner's Last Judgement {{can be seen in}} Hans Memling's Gdansk altarpiece, where the gates of Heaven are similar, as is the rendering of the blessed. Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne, and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during his travel to Italy. The latter's Altar of Saint John is similar to Lochner's Flaying of Bartholomew, especially in the executioner's pose, while his Saint Columba altarpiece includes two motifs from Lochner's Adoration of the Magi triptych; specifically, the king in the central panel {{with his back to the}} viewer, and <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right hand wing holding a basket containing doves.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to writing}} The Demi-Virgin, Hopwood was a {{well-established}} author of bedroom comedies. His past {{efforts in the}} genre included Fair and Warmer, produced by Edgar Selwyn in 1915, and The Gold Diggers, produced by David Belasco in 1919. Producer Albert H. Woods had an even longer track record in the genre, starting with The Girl from Rector's in 1909. Such material had been very profitable for Woods, who commissioned originals and adapted foreign farces, and for Hopwood, {{who was one of}} the most successful authors in the genre. Their first work together was <b>The</b> <b>Girl</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Limousine in 1919, which Hopwood revised from an earlier script by Wilson Collison. Hopwood then helped revise Ladies' Night in 1920 and Getting Gertie's Garter in 1921. The Demi-Virgin was Hopwood's first play written for Woods without a collaborator. Hopwood was inspired by an earlier theatrical adaptation of Les Demi-vierges, an 1894 novel by the French writer Marcel Prévost that had been dramatized in 1895, but used little from it beyond the title.|$|E

The film coincided with the BBC's Africa Lives season of programming and with the global Make Poverty History campaign. The message of the film is conveyed through the character-driven story of Lawrence (Nighy) and Gina (Macdonald) dealing with their feelings for one another while challenging political concerns at the G8 Summit in Reykjavík.|$|E

40|$|Depression {{rates rise}} {{dramatically}} {{from the early}} to late adolescence. Especially young adolescent girls with elevated depressive symptoms {{are at high risk}} for developing a depression during adolescence or adulthood. Therefore, the prevention of depression is important especially in this high-risk group. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the effectiveness of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) component of the depression prevention program 'Op Volle Kracht' (OVK) among Dutch adolescent girls with elevated depressive symptoms. In total, 102 adolescent girls (11 - 15 years) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first and second year of secondary school participated <b>in</b> this study. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental group (n[*]=[*] 50) followed the eight CBT-lessons of OVK and reported depressive symptoms 1 week prior to the start of the lessons, after every lesson, at one-month and 6 -months follow-up. <b>The</b> <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group (n[*]=[*] 52) exclusively reported depressive symptoms at the same time points. Latent Growth Curve Modeling showed that <b>the</b> decrease <b>in</b> depressive symptoms was significantly larger for <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental group compared to <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group. Furthermore, it was found that at 6 -months follow-up, <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental group had significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms compared to <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group. These findings indicate that the CBT-component of OVK effectively reduces depressive symptoms in short term and possibly prevents the development of a clinical depression...|$|R
