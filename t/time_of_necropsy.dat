40|$|AIM [...] To {{demonstrate}} {{the role of}} cytopathology in examining tumours found at post mortem examination. METHODS [...] Tumour deposits were found in 25 hospital necropsies. Cytological diagnosis made at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>necropsy</b> was compared with subsequent paraffin wax embedded histological sections. RESULTS [...] In 19 out of 20 cases with no previous histological diagnosis, cytology at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>necropsy</b> provided rapid and accurate assessment of tumour type. Subsequent histological examination of formalin fixed material merely refined the diagnosis in some cases. In the remaining five cases in which tumour type was known, cytological examination of deposits found at necropsy provided extra information that was useful for compiling a provisional report. CONCLUSIONS [...] Rapid cytological examination of tumours found during post mortem examinations provides accurate relevant information {{which can be used}} to produce a more comprehensive provisional necropsy report. The technique has advantages over frozen section histology and can provide useful cytological experience for histopathology trainees...|$|E

The clinical signs comprised nasal discharge, pyrexia, cough and increased respiratory rates. A total of 28 calves died in the 2 herds. The laboratory investigations revealed that BRSV was involved and probably initiated both outbreaks. Furthermore, the serological results suggested that the vaccine induced only sparse levels of antibodies probably due to the presence of maternally derived antibodies at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> vaccination. <b>Necropsy</b> findings in 5 calves revealed changes typical for infectious pneumonia with involvment of BRSV.

40|$|AIM [...] To {{investigate}} whether routine formalin fixation of all brains coming to necropsy increases {{the rate of}} detection of brain abnormalities relative to either selective formalin fixation of brain tissue or fresh dissection of all brain tissue {{at the time of}} post mortem examination. METHODS [...] A retrospective study of 300 medicolegal necropsies was performed. One hundred cases were examined by doctors with little or no formal training in necropsy pathology. One hundred cases were examined by forensic pathologists, who used their discretion as to whether to fix the brain in formalin. A further 100 cases were examined by neuropathologists; all the brains had already been fixed at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>necropsy.</b> RESULTS [...] When examined by doctors with little or no formal necropsy pathology training, only 15 % of brains were found to be abnormal.

40|$|To {{define the}} immune {{responses}} against phenotypically and pathogenically distinct lentiviruses, we used an immunoblotting assay to study antibodies to viral proteins of ovine lentivirus (OvLV) in 16 experimentally and 12 naturally infected sheep. Two distinct phenotypes of OvLV {{were used to}} experimentally infect lambs: strain 85 / 34, a "rapid/high" isolate which rapidly induced lysis in infected primary macrophage cultures and replicated to relatively high titers, and strains 84 / 28 and 85 / 14, "slow/low" isolates which induced slowly progressive syncytia with minimal lysis in vitro and replicated only to low titers in the same cell type. Serum antibodies against four major viral structural proteins, gp 105, p 25, p 16, and p 14, were detected. In a longitudinal study of experimentally infected lambs, the antibody to p 25 (major gag protein) usually appeared first (average, about 3 weeks postinoculation [p. i. ]) and was followed in about 2 weeks by p 16, p 14, and gp 105 almost simultaneously. Six of 16 animals did not develop anti-p 14 antibody by the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>necropsy</b> at 9 to 29 weeks p. i. Two of 10 lambs which developed antibody to p 14 had the antibody only transiently from 3 to 8 or 13 weeks p. i. and lost it by the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>necropsy</b> at 21 or 22 weeks p. i. In contrast, antibodies to the other three structural proteins remained fairly constant until the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>necropsy.</b> There were differences in the antibody responses of the experimentally infected lambs to the two phenotypes of OvLV. Seven of 10 (70 %) lambs which were inoculated with the rapid/high strain developed antibody to p 14, whereas only 17 % of the lambs inoculated with the slow/low strains had antibody to this protein. In the longitudinal study, no decline was observed in the activity of any specific antibody such as that which occurs with anti-p 24 antibody in human immunodeficiency virus infection, except {{in the case of}} anti-p 14 antibody in two lambs. There {{were no significant differences in}} antibody titers against p 25, p 16, and p 14 in final blood samples between rapid/high virus- and slow/low virus-infected groups. However, the rapid/high virus-infected group developed a fivefold-higher geometric mean titer of anti-env product (gp 105) antibody than did the slow/low virus-infected group (P </= 0. 1). Antibody titers to all major structural proteins, except p 14, in the naturally infected sheep were markedly lower than those in experimentally induced OvLV infections (P </= 0. 01). The failure of the slow/low virus-infected group to develop anti-p 14 antibody may suggest diminished viral replication in vivo or a failure of the host to recognize p 14 in the slow/low virus-infected group. Since the geometric mean antibody titer to gp 105 was threefold higher in lambs with lymphoid interstitial pneumonia than in those without lesions and since no differences were observed in the titers of other antiviral antibodies between these groups, we found no evidence to suggest that levels of such antibodies correlated with protection from OvLV-induced disease...|$|E
30|$|All the {{molecular}} methods utilised {{in our study}} were employed to identify sex of 29 dead vulture samples. The sex identified by molecular methods for 17 tissue samples from dead vultures was found consistent with that known to the breeding centre for 13 samples.

40|$|Background: Ventral incisional hernias {{still remain}} a common {{surgical}} problem. We tested {{the feasibility of}} transvaginal placement of a large synthetic mesh to repair a porcine hernia. Methods: Seven pigs were used in this survival model. Each animal had creation of a 5 -cm hernia defect and underwent a transvaginal repair of the defect with synthetic mesh. A single colpotomy was made using a 12 -cm trocar for an overtube. The mesh was cut to size and placed through the trocar. A single-channel gastroscope with an endoscopic atraumatic grasper was used for grasping sutures. Further fascial sutures were placed every 5 cm. Results: Mesh repair was feasible in all 7 animals. Mean operative time was 133 minutes. Technical difficulties were encountered. No gross contamination was seen at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>necropsy.</b> However, 5 animals had positive mesh cultures; 7 had positive cultures in the rectouterine space in enrichment broth or on direct culture.

Hypophyses of {{four groups}} of 50 female rats (F,-nulliparous, F,-multiparous, F,-standard diet, and F,-low protein) were {{examined}} by light microscopy and immunocytochemistry by the avidin-biotin complex method. In pituitary glands of rats fed a low protein diet, {{the incidence of}} neoplasms of the pars distalis, the number of multifocal tumors, {{and the degree of}} neoplastic cellular atypia were significantly reduced. Pituitary adenomata in rats fed a low protein diet also caused significantly less brain compression at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>necropsy</b> than in rats fed a standard diet. All but two neoplastic foci from the 83 tumors stained for prolactin, and 14 of these also stained for growth hormone.

40|$|AIM: To examine current {{practice}} {{and to establish}} criteria for the use <b>of</b> histopathology in <b>necropsy</b> practice. METHODS: During an audit <b>of</b> <b>necropsy</b> reporting, consensus {{could not be reached}} about the use of routine histopathology. Therefore local guidelines were formulated and {{current practice}} was compared with these guidelines. Fifteen consecutive necropsies undertaken by each consultant were reviewed and the use of histopathology noted. RESULTS: In general, the standard <b>of</b> <b>necropsy</b> reporting was reasonably high. Tissue was retained for histopathology in 25 % <b>of</b> <b>necropsies</b> and 72 % <b>of</b> these <b>necropsy</b> reports included a histopathology report. Using the guidelines, the assessors judged that histopathology might have been valuable in a further 19 %. It was felt that routine histopathology would not have been helpful in determining the cause of death in the remaining 56 %. The importance of the pathologist's clinical judgement in individual cases was stressed. At reaudit, nearly two years later, there was no significant change in practice, reflecting the lack of consensus. CONCLUSIONS: Even when histopathology might contribute to finding the cause of death, it was not always done. However, the assumption that histology is invariably helpful in determining the cause of death is challenged...|$|R

Recently issued guidelines have recommended investigations to be performed following sudden unexpected death in infants. Aims: To evaluate the quality and value of infant postmortem reporting. Methods: Postmortem reports from 1994 – 1996 and 1998 – 2000 in Ireland were evaluated using the National Sudden Infant Death Register. Scoring was by a modification of the Rushton system based {{on the extent of}} the postmortem data. The finding of additional pathological information was also assessed. Results: Of the 274 cases registered during the selection period, reports were available for 245. Overall quality <b>of</b> <b>necropsy</b> reporting was below the minimum accepted standard in 55. 5 %; 47 % <b>of</b> the <b>necropsies</b> were performed in regional paediatric pathology centres.

The only significant intergroup difference in serum biochemical or hematologic parameters was an increase in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activity in both RSO and PHHO groups. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of lipidosis in cardiac and skeletal muscle and revealed mild mitochondrial degeneration, causing a depression of the P/O ratio of the RSO group and a State III respiratory rate depression of the PHHO group.

40|$|Abstract. Adult Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni were {{recovered}} at autopsy. The number of eggs of both species {{present in the}} tissues and passed in the excreta {{was related to the}} number of female worms (worm pairs) recovered. Only 26 % of S. haematobium infections were active at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>necropsy.</b> Forty-seven percent of S. haematobium females were in the mesenteric circulation and 52 % were in genitourinary organs. S. haematobium worm pairs were sedentary, laying eggs in single sites for prolonged periods. In addition, the worm pairs seemed to be clustered in active genitourinary lesions. S. haematobium eggs calcified and accumulated in the tissues, and a geometric mean of 600, 000 eggs per worm pair was found. Large numbers of eggs remained in inactive cases. There was a significant increase in eggs per female worm in older persons. The relative contribution of egg accumulation (increasing the numerator) and worm death (decreasing the denominator) to this phenomenon are not known. In contrast, S. mansoni eggs were not retained in the tissues to the degree exhibited by S. haematobium. There was an apparent equilibrium between egg deposition and egg excretion or destruction. A geometric mean of 15, 900 eggs per worm pair was present, and did not change with age. The total number of eggs per female worm and the relative pr...|$|E
40|$|Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis' ('Candidatus M. turicensis') is a hemoplasma {{species that}} infects felids. It differs from other feline hemoplasma species {{due to its}} {{particular}} infection kinetics and phylogenetic similarity to rodent hemoplasma species. The lower and shorter bacteremia produced by 'Candidatus M. turicensis' suggests a possible tissue sequestration of the organism. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore this possibility. Five specified-pathogen free cats were subcutaneously inoculated with 'Candidatus M. turicensis' and sacrificed 86 days after inoculation. Thirty-one selected organs were collected upon necropsy, and samples were analyzed by real-time Taqman(®) PCR. The humoral immune response was monitored by DnaK ELISA. All five cats had detectable 'Candidatus M. turicensis' loads in the majority (52 - 100 %) of the tested tissues. High 'Candidatus M. turicensis' tissue loads (average 3. 46 × 10 (4) copies/ 10 mg) were detected in the samples. The presence of the organisms in the tissues could not be explained by the blood burdens because the blood of four out of five cats tested PCR-negative at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>necropsy.</b> This is the first study to describe the distribution of 'Candidatus M. turicensis' in various organs; it also demonstrates that, in contrast to other feline hemoplasma species, significant sequestration of 'Candidatus M. turicensis' occurs in many tissues. These results represent an important step toward the understanding of the pathogenesis of 'Candidatus M. turicensis'...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionSquamous cell {{carcinoma}} (SCC) {{is the second}} most common form of skin cancer in the United States. The efficacy of a pharmaceutically elegant radiotherapeutic bandage, previously described by us for application against SCC of the skin, was tested {{for the first time in}} vivo using a subcutaneous SCC mouse model and a therapeutically relevant radiation dose. MethodsFemale athymic nude mice were injected with human Colo- 16 SCC cells subcutaneously and after eight days (average tumor volume: 35 ± 8. 6 mm 3) received no treatment, or were exposed to non-radioactive or radioactive (92. 5 ± 18. 5 MBq) bandages for approximately 1 h (n= 10 per group). After treatment, tumors were measured over fifteen days, tumor volume ratios (TVRs) compared and histopathology performed. ResultsFifteen days after treatment, the TVR of the radioactive bandage treatment group was 3. 3 ± 4. 5, while TVRs of the non-radioactive bandage treatment and no treatment control groups were 33. 2 ± 14. 7 and 26. 9 ± 12. 6, respectively. At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>necropsy,</b> there was mild focal epidermal hyperplasia surrounding a small area of epidermal ulceration in the radioactive bandage group. No other examined tissue (i. e., muscle, liver, kidney, lung, spleen and heart) showed significant lesions. ConclusionsOur radiotherapeutic bandage exhibits promising efficacy against SCC of the skin in a mouse model. It can be individually tailored for easy application on tumor lesions of all shapes and sizes, and could complement or possibly replace surgery in the clinic...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the frequency of post-mortem examinations was conducted in the paediatric age group. Among the factors found to influence necropsy rates were (i) age at death, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>necropsy</b> decreasing with age; (ii) cause <b>of</b> death, <b>necropsy</b> frequency varying with major diagnostic groups; (iii) investigation conducted before death, necropsy frequency decreasing when the clinical picture was ill-defined; and (iv) place <b>of</b> death, <b>necropsy</b> being less frequent when death occurred outside hospital. These findings imply (a) that necropsy practices may be governed by habit and convenience {{as well as by}} desire to complete the clinical picture, and (b) that more equitable balances in such practices should be sought {{if there is to be}} improvement in the quality of mortality data...|$|R
40|$|AIM [...] To {{investigate}} {{the quality of}} perinatal and infant necropsies and assess {{the relation between the}} quality and value of this investigation in different outcome groups. METHODS [...] Cohort analysis of 540 deaths during 1993 of babies between 20 weeks' gestation and one year of age born to women usually resident in Wales. Cases were identified from the All Wales Perinatal Survey. Each case was assessed to establish whether the necropsy yielded clinically relevant information. The quality <b>of</b> <b>necropsy</b> was assessed by scoring aspects identified as being part <b>of</b> the <b>necropsy.</b> RESULTS [...] Necropsy was performed in 335 (62 %) cases, and the report was available for assessment in 314 cases. The quality <b>of</b> <b>necropsy</b> was below the minimum standard in 46 % (143 / 314) of cases. The highest quality necropsies were carried out on fetal deaths at 20 to 23 weeks' gestation (12 % (10 / 85) below standard), compared with 65 % (87 / 133) below standard on stillbirths and 68 % (21 / 31) on sudden unexpected infant death. Overall, 42 % (131 / 314) <b>of</b> <b>necropsies</b> were performed in a regional paediatric pathology centre including 88 % (76 / 88) of fetal deaths, 23 % (31 / 133) of stillbirths and 30 % (29 / 96) of infant deaths. The quality score for the necropsy performed in a regional centre failed to achieve the minimum acceptable score in 8 % (11 / 131) of cases compared with 72 % (132 / 182) for those done elsewhere. The cause of death was detected by necropsy in 17 % (52 / 314) of cases. The quality <b>of</b> <b>necropsy</b> was significantly higher when {{the cause of death was}} revealed than when nothing new was found. CONCLUSIONS [...] The overall quality of the perinatal and infant necropsy is poor. This is regrettable as valuable information can be revealed frequently by a good quality necropsy. Adherence to Guidelines for Postmortem Reports recently published by the Royal College of Pathologists should improve the situation...|$|R
