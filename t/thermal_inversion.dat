40|$|A {{study of}} {{temperature}} profiles, climatic records, and chemical data for Lake Lanao, a low-altitude tropical lake, over 14 months {{shows that the}} annual pattern of heat distribu-tion depends partly on a’seasonal air temperature minimum and p&y on nonseasonal cli-matic changes. The lake circulated during January and February {{at the time of}} seasonal cooling, was intermittently stable during March and April, and was stratified during all other months. During stratification the principal thermocline achieved equilibrium with storm winds at 40 - 50 m. Secondary and tertiary thermoclines repeatedly split the epilim-nion into an upper turbulent layer and a lower stagnant layer for periods up to 2 months, but were displaced or dissipated at irregular intervals by storms. The term ntelomixis is proposed to denote the mixing of chemically divergent layers during stratification. Changes in the shape of thermal profiles in Lake Lanao include sharpening of thermo-clines by wind and convection, smearing of thermoclines by internal water movements, unstable <b>thermal</b> <b>inversions</b> due to cooling at the surface, and stable <b>thermal</b> <b>inversions</b> on the bottom that result from heat retention during cool weather...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{inference}} of a carbon-rich atmosphere, with C/O 1, {{in the hot}} Jupiter WASP- 12 b motivates {{the exotic}} new class of carbon-rich planets (CRPs). We report a detailed study of the atmospheric chemistry and spectroscopic signatures of carbon-rich giant (CRG) planets, the possibility of <b>thermal</b> <b>inversions</b> in their atmospheres, the compositions of icy planetesimals required for their formation via core accretion, and the apportionment of ices, rock, and volatiles in their envelopes. Our results show that CRG atmospheres probe a unique region in composition space, especially at high temperature (T). For atmospheres with C/O 1, and T 1400 K in the observable atmosphere, most of the oxygen is bound up in CO, while H 2 O is depleted and CH 4 is enhanced by up {{to two or three}} orders of magnitude each, compared to equilibrium compositions with solar abundances (C/O = 0. 54). These differences in the spectroscopically dominant species for the different C/O ratios cause equally distinct observable signatures in the spectra. As such, highly irradiated transiting giant exoplanets form ideal candidates to estimate atmospheric C/O ratios and to search for CRPs. We also find that the C/O ratio strongly affects the abundances of TiO and VO, which have been suggested to cause <b>thermal</b> <b>inversions</b> in highly irradiated hot Jupiter atmospheres.

40|$|The recent {{inference}} of a carbon-rich atmosphere, with C/O >= 1, {{in the hot}} Jupiter WASP- 12 b motivates {{the exotic}} new class of carbon-rich planets (CRPs). We report a detailed study of the atmospheric chemistry and spectroscopic signatures of carbon-rich giant planets (CRGs) and the compositions of icy planetesimals required for their formation, and the apportionment of ices, rock, and volatiles in their envelopes. For C/O >= 1, most of the atmospheric oxygen is occupied by CO for T > 1400 K and pressure (P) = 1 strongly depletes the abundances of TiO and VO available to form <b>thermal</b> <b>inversions,</b> which is adequate to rule out <b>thermal</b> <b>inversions</b> due to TiO/VO {{even in the most}} highly irradiated hot Jupiters, such as WASP- 12 b. Adopting stellar abundances (C/O = 0. 44) for the primordial disk composition and low-temperature formation conditions (T <= 30 K) for WASP- 12 b leads to a C/O ratio of 0. 27 in accreted planetesimals, and, consequently, in the planet's envelope. In contrast, a C/O ratio of 1 in the envelope of WASP- 12 b requires a substantial depletion of oxygen in the disk, by a factor of ~ 0. 41 for the same formation conditions. This scenario also satisfies the constraints on the C/H and O/H ratios reported for WASP- 12 b. If, alternatively, hotter conditions prevailed in a stellar composition disk such that only H 2 O is condensed, the remaining gas can potentially have a C/O ~ 1. However, a high C/O in WASP- 12 b caused predominantly by gas accretion would preclude super-stellar C/H ratios which also fit the data. Comment: Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
40|$|Broadband secondary-eclipse {{measurements}} of hot Jupiters have indicated {{the existence of}} atmospheric <b>thermal</b> <b>inversions,</b> but their presence {{is difficult to determine}} from broadband measurements because of degeneracies between molecular abundances and temperature structure. We apply high-resolution (R = 100 000) infrared spectroscopy to probe the temperature-pressure profile of HD 209458 b. This bright, transiting hot-Jupiter has long been considered the gold standard for a hot Jupiter with an inversion layer, but this has been challenged in recent publications. We observed the thermal dayside emission of HD 209458 b with CRIRES / VLT during three nights, targeting the carbon monoxide band at 2. 3 microns. <b>Thermal</b> <b>inversions</b> give rise to emission features, which means that detecting emission lines in the planetary spectrum, as opposed to absorption lines, would be direct evidence of a region in which the temperature increases with altitude. We do not detect any significant absorption or emission of CO in the dayside spectrum of HD 209458 b, although cross-correlation with template spectra either with CO absorption lines or with weak emission {{at the core of the}} lines show a low-significance correlation signal with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 - 3. 5. Models with strong CO emission lines show a weak anti-correlation with similar or lower significance levels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of absorption or emission from H 2 O at these wavelengths. The non-detection of CO in the dayside spectrum of HD 209458 b is interesting in light of a previous CO detection in the transmission spectrum. That there is no signal indicates that HD 209458 b either has a nearly isothermal atmosphere or that the signal is heavily muted. Assuming a clear atmosphere, we can rule out a full-disc dayside inversion layer in the pressure range 1 bar to 1 mbar.
