5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>meal</b> <b>plan.</b> A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect <b>the</b> <b>meal</b> <b>plan.</b> First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

5000|$|An article {{summarizing}} {{the view of}} the American Diabetes Association contains the statement: [...] "Sucrose-containing foods can be substituted for other carbohydrates in <b>the</b> <b>meal</b> <b>plan</b> or, if added to <b>the</b> <b>meal</b> <b>plan,</b> covered with insulin or other glucose-lowering medications. Care should be taken to avoid excess energy intake." [...] Sucrose does not increase glycemia more than the same number of calories taken as starch. It is not recommended to use fructose as a sweetener. Benefits may be obtained by consumption of dietary fibre in conjunction with carbohydrate; as Francis (1987) points out, evidence suggests that carbohydrate consumed with dietary fiber will have a lower impact on glycemic rise than the same amount of carbohydrate consumed alone.|$|E

40|$|Objective To develop <b>meal</b> <b>plans</b> using grain-based foods demonstrating how to {{incorporate}} wholegrain foods into {{a balanced diet}} for weight maintenance for different cuisines. The present study examines <b>the</b> ability of <b>meal</b> <b>plans</b> with ≥ 4 grain-based servings daily to meet nutrient recommendations using lacto-ovo vegetarian and rice-based cuisines. Design Eighteen plans from each cuisine for three age brackets for both genders were developed. Plans aimed for ≥ 4 servings of grain-based foods daily, with separate plans for all wholegrain, all refined-grain and half wholegrain–half refined-grain foods. <b>Meal</b> <b>plans</b> followed an isoenergetic approach and were designed to meet specific Australian nutrient reference values and serving sizes. Results All plans met the Recommended Dietary Intake or Adequate Intake for targeted nutrients except for Fe in <b>the</b> rice-based <b>meal</b> <b>plan</b> for females aged ≥ 19 years (17 mg). In the plans for 14 – 18 year and ≥ 19 year age groups, four servings of grain-based foods could be accommodated. In the plans for 9 – 13 years, {{increasing the number of}} grain-based food servings to four reduced micronutrients levels delivered by the total diet. Specific food choices were made to ensure nutrient targets were met across each category for wholegrain and refined-grain plans. The major difference in nutrients between wholegrain and refined-grain foods was found in the vegetarian cuisine, where <b>the</b> <b>meal</b> <b>plans</b> containing whole grains produced on average 30 % higher fibre (38 – 53 g) levels than those with refined grains (27 – 40 g). Conclusions With careful food selection, <b>meal</b> <b>plans</b> with ≥ 4 servings of grain-based foods daily can meet nutrient reference values for lacto-ovo vegetarian and rice-based cuisines...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references.

Subjects included male and female university students, ages 18 and older from all class years. Subjects were surveyed using the EAT- 26 survey. A total score and subscale scores of oral control, dieting, and bulimia and food preoccupation on the EAT- 26 {{were used for the}} comparison. The results of a standard t test showed {{a significant difference in the}} EAT- 26 total score between groups using the different residence hall <b>meal</b> <b>plans.</b> ANOVA results indicated a significant main effect of EAT- 26 scores by gender and an effect approaching significance by <b>meal</b> <b>plan.</b> Other demographics such as age and year in school were not associated with the score. Subjects indicated in the demographic data, <b>the</b> number of <b>meals</b> eaten per week at the residence hall foodservice. These numbers were similar between the two residence halls. However, in females using <b>the</b> flexible <b>meal</b> <b>plan</b> a correlation between <b>the</b> number of <b>meals</b> eaten per week and the total EAT- 26 score was seen.

Typically, the college tracks students' usage of their plan by counting the number of predefined meal servings, points, dollars, or number of buffet dinners. The plan may give the student a certain number of any of the above per week or semester and they may or may not roll over to the next week or semester.|$|E

Consistency, timing, composition, and caloric content of food intake and physical activity, age, sex, growth, and pubertal status alter meal-plan needs. Self-monitoring of blood glucose {{should be used to}} individualize <b>the</b> <b>meal</b> <b>plan.</b> The general American Diabetes Association recommendations suggest that 50 - 65 % of total calories be from carbohydrates from foods with a lower glycemic index and/or high fiber content. Protein should contribute 12 - 20 % of total calories and fat < 30 %, with < 10 % saturated fat and < 300 mg/day cholesterol. More severe fat restriction should be considered in individuals with persistent lipid abnormalities when compared with sex- and age-adjusted values. Calories should be sufficient for growth and development, with growth data obtained several times a year and plotted on standardized weight, height, and velocity charts. Blood pressure should be similarly plotted on age- and sex-standardized curves. All meal plans should be individualized, but certain circumstances require special attention in IDDM patients: 1) lack of minerals or vitamins in a youngster who is a picky eater; 2) eating disorders (i. e., obesity, bulimia, anorexia nervosa); 3) specific gastrointestinal diseases (i. e., Crohn's disease, celiac disease, giardiasis, or IgA deficiency); 4) low iron stores because of associated achlorhydria and positive gastroparietal antibodies; 5) alternative sweeteners, especially in pregnant women and very young children; 6) mineral balance changes that may occur with increased soluble fiber intake and episodes of hyperglycemia with or without ketosis/ketoacidosis; 7) changes in physica...|$|E
