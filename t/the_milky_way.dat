5|$|The rate of star {{formation}} in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> The rate of supernovae in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy. This suggests that the latter once experienced a great {{star formation}} phase, but {{is now in a}} relative state of quiescence, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> is experiencing more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{proof of}} <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> {{consisting}} of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> {{and discovered that}} it is composed of {{a huge number of}} faint stars.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December {{solstice}} position (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, {{the lowest point}} on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> appear (from {{the surface of the}} Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> Given that <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.|$|E

5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> but has a visible star count of only 1% of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> The lack of {{luminosity}} is because {{there is a lack of}} star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{a debate}} {{took place between}} Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis (the Great Debate), {{concerning}} the nature of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> spiral nebulae, and {{the dimensions of the}} Universe.

5|$|On December 1, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Voyager 1 had detected the first Lyman-alpha radiation originating from <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> galaxy.

5|$|Our {{solar system}} orbits within <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> a {{barred spiral galaxy}} that is a {{prominent}} member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> that are obscured from view.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond in order for <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows {{a great deal of}} detail at +6.1. This makes <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with a {{diameter}} between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years. <b>The</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars. There are probably at least 100 billion planets in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge {{of one of the}} spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. The stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The very center is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which {{is likely to be a}} supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> {{runs through}} the constellation, {{featuring}} prominent objects such as the open cluster NGC 5823 and the planetary nebula NGC 5315. Circinus hosts a spiral galaxy, the Circinus Galaxy, which was discovered in 1977 and is the closest Seyfert galaxy to <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> The Alpha Circinids (ACI), a meteor shower also discovered in 1977, radiate from this constellation.|$|E
5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> passes through Perseus, but {{is much less}} obvious than {{elsewhere}} in the sky as it is mostly obscured by molecular clouds.

50|$|From a {{viewpoint}} in <b>the</b> LMC, <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> total {{apparent magnitude}} would be −2.0—over 14 times {{brighter than the}} LMC appears to us on Earth—and it would span about 36° across the sky, the width of over 70 full moons. Furthermore, because of the LMC's high galactic latitude, an observer there would get an oblique view of the entire galaxy, free from the interference of interstellar dust that makes studying in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> plane difficult from Earth. The Small Magellanic Cloud would be about magnitude 0.6, substantially brighter than the LMC appears to us.|$|R
50|$|Further {{efforts to}} see behind <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way’s</b> ZOA {{such as the}} ALFAZOA and ALFALFA surveys {{may be able to}} perform more {{accurate}} measurements and place better constraints on the parameters of the void in the future. The surveys, conducted using the Arecibo radio telescope, will attempt to look for light from distant galaxies that has been redshifted to a wavelength that will stand out in comparison to the noise caused by <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way’s</b> Zone of Avoidance. However, these surveys have limited range in the north-south (declination) direction, due to operation constraints of the Arecibo telescope.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} {{globular}} clusters discovered continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947.

5|$|The {{sources of}} most GRBs are billions of {{light years away}} from Earth, {{implying}} that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy {{in a few seconds}} as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime) and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years). All observed GRBs have originated from outside <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> galaxy, although a related class of phenomena, soft gamma repeater flares, are associated with magnetars within <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> It has been hypothesized that a gamma-ray burst in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> pointing directly towards the Earth, could cause a mass extinction event.|$|E

5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count the stars in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> and determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions within <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> SIM Lite was {{to measure}} the internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies.

5|$|Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, {{commonly}} known as the Circinus Galaxy. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> since their dim light is obscured by gas and dust. This oblong spiral galaxy with 6.9by3.0arcminutes and 26,000light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane.
