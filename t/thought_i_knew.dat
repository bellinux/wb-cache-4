500|$|The Los Angeles Times spent a full {{paragraph}} on a vignette {{about two}} high school prom dresses. [...] The junior prom dress was a conservative powder blue gown to wear with a nerdy date. The senior prom dress was a sexy black mini dress that was befitting of her more desirable date. The dresses presented an identity crisis to one character: [...] "Here's the thing – I've never really known for sure which {{of those two}} people I am – the girl who almost doesn't get asked to the prom at all or the girl who gets {{to go with the}} really cute guy. Every time I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> which one I was, I {{turned out to be the}} other. Which is one reason I think I got married, to, like, end the confusion." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1962 he {{appeared}} in Wendy Toye's comedy film We Joined the Navy before teaming up again with Peter Sellers in Only Two Can Play, Sidney Gilliat's film of the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis; Powell noted with pleasure [...] "the armour of his gravity pierced by polite bewilderment". She compared Le Mesurier with the well-known American straight-face comedian, John McGiver. After appearing in another Sellers film in 1962—Waltz of the Toreadors—Le Mesurier joined him in the 1963 comedy The Wrong Arm of the Law. Powell again reviewed the pair's film, commenting that [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> by now every shade in the acting of John Le Mesurier (not that I could ever get tired of any of them); but there seems a new shade here". In the same year {{he appeared}} in a third Sellers film, The Pink Panther, as a defence lawyer, {{and in the second}} Tony Hancock vehicle, The Punch and Judy Man. Le Mesurier played Sandman in the latter film; Powell wrote that the role [...] "allowed a gentler and subtler character than usual". He also appeared in a series of advertisements for Homepride flour in 1964, providing the voice-over for the animated character Fred the Flourgrader; he continued as the voice until 1983.|$|E
2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what the world was like, I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E

2500|$|While {{out walking}} on New Years Day 1987, Drummond {{formulated}} {{a plan to}} make a hip-hop record. However, [...] "I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself", he said. [...] "...although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I <b>thought,</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> Jimmy , I {{knew he was a}} like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said 'Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu'. And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, 'where I was coming from'".|$|E

Four of these were issued as singles, [...] "Hammerhead" [...] (October), [...] "Heaven on a Stick" [...] (February 1988), [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] (June) and [...] "Always the Way" [...] (November). James later told Debbie Kruger that [...] " [...] was not {{necessarily}} about me, but let's say I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what I was talking about. I wrote it with Simon Hussey; the music Simon and I wrote together and I wrote the lyrics. From memory it seemed to come quite easily". The album peaked at No.4 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart, while [...] "Hammerhead" [...] reached No.8 and [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] at No.4 on the related Kent Music Report Singles Chart. [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] also reached No.6 on the ARIA Singles Chart.|$|E

2500|$|Andrews {{was born}} in Bangor, Maine. His parents {{divorced}} when he was 12 months old. He was raised by his mother's parents in Pineville, Louisiana. They moved to Monroe, Louisiana, when he was ten years old. After he {{graduated from high school}} in Monroe, he decided to live with his mother in St. Louis. They did not get along very well. He said, [...] "I was young and set in my ways and <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> everything like every child does." [...] He worked for his stepfather as a maintenance man at the motel that his stepfather managed. Andrews needed parts to repair a broken vacuum cleaner, so he went to the O.K. Vacuum repair shop co-owned by Rusty Wallace's father and uncle. Gary Wallace, Rusty's uncle, had a conversation with Andrews about vacuum cleaners and other topics. Gary Wallace offered Andrews a job. Andrews helped move the vacuum cleaner repair shop to a larger facility. Andrews worked closely with Rusty Wallace and the two got to know each other well. [...] After work, he helped fix Wallace's USAC stock car, starting in 1979. He moved with Wallace to the ASA in 1983 when the team won the championship. Wallace moved from USAC to NASCAR in 1984, and Andrews moved to Louisiana to run Wallace's Sportsman for his driver Nicki Fraisson. Andrews quit in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Blanchett {{returned}} to the theatre in 2009 with the Sydney Theatre Company production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Liv Ullmann. She starred as Blanche DuBois alongside Joel Edgerton as Stanley Kowalski. Ullmann and Blanchett had been meaning to collaborate on a project since Ullman's intended film adaption of A Doll's House fell by the wayside. Blanchett proposed embarking on Streetcar to Ullmann, who jumped at the opportunity after initial discussion. The production traveled from Sydney to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. It was critically and commercially successful and Blanchett received critical acclaim for her performance as Blanche DuBois. The New York Times critic Ben Brantley said, [...] "DuBois has been pulled gently and firmly down to earth by Ms. Blanchett and Ms. Ullmann ... What Ms. Blanchett brings to the character is life itself, a primal survival instinct ... All the baggage that any [...] "Streetcar" [...] usually travels with has been jettisoned. Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play {{as if it had}} never been staged before, with the result that, as a friend of mine put it, [...] "you feel like you’re hearing words you thought you knew pronounced correctly for the first time."" [...] The Washington Posts Peter Marks proclaimed, [...] "What Blanchett achieves in the Sydney Theatre Company's revelatory revival of [...] "A Streetcar Named Desire" [...] amounts to a truly great portrayal—certainly the most heartbreaking Blanche I've ever experienced." [...] John Lahr of The New Yorker said of her portrayal, [...] "Blanchett, with her alert mind, her informed heart, and her lithe, patrician silhouette, gets it right from the first beat ... Blanchett doesn’t make the usual mistake of foreshadowing Blanche’s end at the play’s beginning; she allows Blanche a slow, fascinating decline ... I don’t expect to see a better performance of this role in my lifetime." [...] Jane Fonda, who attended a New York show, deemed it [...] "perhaps the greatest stage performance I have ever seen", and Meryl Streep declared, [...] "That performance was as naked, as raw and extraordinary and astonishing and surprising and scary as anything I've ever seen ... She took the layers of a person and just peeled them away. I thought I'd seen that play, I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> all the lines by heart, because I've seen it so many times, but I'd never seen the play until I saw that performance." [...] Blanchett won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. The production and Blanchett received Helen Hayes Awards, for Outstanding Non-Resident Production and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production award, respectively.|$|E
