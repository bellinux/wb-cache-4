50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Advantage</b> <b>was</b> a 4 MHz Z80a-based {{computer}} with 64 KB of user RAM and 16 KB of graphics RAM. It used two single-sided, double-density 180 KB floppy disk (hard-sectored) drives and an optional 5 MB Winchester disk. <b>The</b> <b>Advantage</b> <b>was</b> {{known for its}} 640×240 graphics capabilities and was sold with four demonstration programs, one of which plotted and calculated a pattern of lines reminiscent of the Arcade game Qix. <b>The</b> <b>Advantage</b> also had an optional 8088 co-processor board available that ran MS-DOS 1.0. When <b>the</b> <b>Advantage</b> <b>was</b> introduced NorthStar had moved its offices, manufacturing and warehousing facilities to 14440 Catalina St. in San Leandro, California. NorthStar remained at that location until they ceased operations.|$|R

25|$|Even {{though the}} number of vessels was in parity, the total of guns favored the rebel navy. With 91 cannons, 430 sailors and 234 troops {{in front of the}} 36 cannons (2 in a land battery) and 442 men of <b>the</b> royalists, <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> {{supposedly}} on <b>the</b> revolutionary side. Nonetheless, as a third of the force was concentrated on the lead ship Hércules, so <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> tied to its performance and luck.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> circuit {{switched}} {{approach and}} therefore better specified {{quality of service}} for vocal communication than with Wireless LAN.|$|R

5000|$|The {{line was}} single throughout, with {{numerous}} passing places. In {{the event of}} two [...] "trains" [...] meeting between passing places, <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> {{to be decided by}} lot.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same as other post and core systems; however, {{there are some}} points which make it different such as: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> {{that instead}} of {{studying}} simply to pass the admission exams, the student will study topics more targeted to their training and future specialization. <b>The</b> main <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> that students choose their speciality more according to their interests and less according to their rank. (Indeed, the rank obtained after standard preparatory classes determines a list of schools with their specialities).|$|R
50|$|Back in <b>the</b> room, <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> revealed. <b>The</b> {{team with}} <b>advantage</b> had to {{convince}} two others from the opposite team to make them safe. All tried their very best.|$|R
5000|$|... initiative; Silman {{notes that}} this (along with {{superior}} development) {{is a dynamic}} imbalance that must be used quickly if <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> not to fade away.|$|R

50|$|When {{it came to}} conference rivalry {{games played}} at home, <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> nearly split, at 4-3 (.571) with the higher-ranked team coming out on top in each case.|$|R
5000|$|This {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> {{very much on}} the side of the [...] "Weimarian School". There is a parallel in Liszt's will of September 14, 1860. Liszt wrote: ...|$|R
25|$|They {{were armed}} with long spears and with {{poisonous}} and steel arrows. Their iron weapons {{gave them an}} advantage in warfare, and when armed with guns <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> decisive.|$|R
50|$|Land Rover {{have used}} a drum brake on the gearbox output shaft for over fifty years. <b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> that all four wheels can be braked with the parking brake.|$|R
60|$|MENDOZA. Last night <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> with me. <b>The</b> robber of {{the poor}} was {{at the mercy of}} the robber of the rich. You offered your hand: I took it.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> good uniform {{response}} to gamma radiation and accurate overall dose reading, capable of measuring very high radiation rates, sustained high radiation levels do not degrade the fill gas.|$|R
50|$|The {{transient}} techniques {{perform a}} measurement {{during the process}} of heating up. <b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> that measurements can be made relatively quickly. Transient methods are usually carried out by needle probes.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> all his. He {{would run}} along at {{reasonable}} speed, choose a narrow place, stop his car {{so as to}} obstruct the road, and get out with his rifle.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> {{integration}} points do {{not need}} to be located according to a regular tensor-product based structure, thus naturally fitting the need of covering an irregularly trimmed domain homogeneously.|$|R
50|$|The second {{equation}} combines {{each pair}} of fractions from the first into a single fraction, thus doubling the speed of convergence. <b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> that x and y are only computed once.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> {{that even}} with an aging battery, the {{flashbulb}} still gets a high current pulse and thus reliably fires, although the recycle time between flashes increases as the battery ages.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{introduce}} new compression function design principles supporting variable output lengths (multiples of size n). They {{are based on}} a function or block cipher with an n-bit output size. In the case of the compression function with a (t + 1) n-bit output size, in the random oracle and ideal cipher models, their maximum <b>advantages</b> from <b>the</b> perspective of collision resistance are O (t 2 q 2 tn + q 2 2 (t+ 1) n). In the case of t = 1, <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> near-optimal. In <b>the</b> case of t> 1, <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> optimal...|$|R
50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> {{that album}} covers that were {{originally}} textured, such as Back in Black by AC/DC or Fear of Music by Talking Heads can retain the texturing on the CD release.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first-move <b>advantage</b> {{enjoyed by}} White {{is much greater}} in this game than in {{standard}} chess. Hence, it is a game imbalanced against Black. Although <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> significant, no attempts to prove a win for White have been successful.|$|R
3000|$|... ‘Almost real’ test-observed {{modes of}} vibration, <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> {{that we could}} neglect the {{influence}} of damping in the problem of dynamic equilibrium and warrant comparison with numerical modes obtained in non-damped free vibrations.|$|R
60|$|Decree as of record; it <b>is</b> {{found that}} <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> {{side of my}} Lord Chatterino, but the {{excellence}} of the estate {{on the other side}} is believed to equalize the parties.|$|R
5000|$|ENQUIRE {{was similar}} to Apple's HyperCard which also lacked {{clickable}} text and was not [...] "hypertext", but ENQUIRE lacked an image rendering system. <b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> that it was portable and ran on different systems.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, the kettles were heated inside steam jackets. <b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> {{that all}} had the same steam {{pressure}} and the temperature was uniform. As a result, only one quality of salt was produced.|$|R
5000|$|... so <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> {{at least}} about 0.996. This is a near-certain distinguisher, but it's not a {{security}} failure because it's no faster than brute force search, after all, {{it is the}} brute force search.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} {{perceive}} what a striking likeness you drew {{the day before}} yesterday," [...] said Lucy, with a pretty laugh of triumph. She enjoyed her lover's confusion; <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>was</b> usually on his side.|$|R
