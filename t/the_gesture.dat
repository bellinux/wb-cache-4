5|$|<b>The</b> <b>gesture</b> {{dates back}} to Ancient Greece {{and it was also}} used in Ancient Rome. Historically, it {{represented}} the phallus. In some modern cultures, it has gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect, and has been used by music artists (notably more common among hardcore punk bands and rappers), actors, celebrities, athletes, and politicians. Most still view <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> as obscene. The index finger and ring finger besides the middle finger in more contemporary periods has been likened to represent the testicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle finger}} gesture {{was used in}} Ancient times {{as a symbol of}} sexual intercourse, in a manner meant to degrade, intimidate and {{threaten}} the individual receiving <b>the</b> <b>gesture.</b> It also represented the phallus, with the fingers next to the middle finger representing testicles; from its close association, <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> may have assumed apotropaic potency. In the 1st-century Mediterranean world, extending the finger was one of many methods used to divert the ever-present threat of the evil eye.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Alexander adopted some {{elements}} of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies {{of many of his}} countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.|$|E

40|$|Text {{entry on}} touch screen devices is often {{performed}} through Soft keyboards. One {{of the latest}} research trends is to abandon the traditional tapping interaction {{in favor of more}} natural gesture-based interactions on these key- boards. The interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>gestures</b> is performed through sketch-based techniques. In this paper we present the sketch-based technology re- lated to the interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>gestures</b> needed to enter text through KeyScretch, a novel text entry method which has been proven to be more efficient than the traditional tapping-based method. The method enables text entry through <b>the</b> input of <b>gestures</b> associated to word chunks. <b>The</b> <b>gestures</b> are guided by a menu which appears around a key of the keyboard as soon as the user presses it. The proposed procedures improve the interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>gestures</b> and consequently increase the accuracy of the method. This improvement is measured through a simula- tion in which the sketch-based recognition is compared to the target-based menu item selection through an estimation of the error rate...|$|R
5|$|Hugh {{afterwards}} became archdeacon of York and {{treasurer of}} York, sometime around 1143, probably through the patronage of William FitzHerbert {{while he was}} serving his first term as Archbishop of York. While treasurer, {{he was a member}} of the party at York that wanted to elect Hilary as archbishop after William FitzHerbert's deposition in 1147. The successful candidate was Henry Murdac, the Abbot of Fountains, who was supported by the bishops of Durham and Carlisle, William of St. Barbara and Æthelwold respectively. Murdac excommunicated Hugh, who returned <b>the</b> <b>gesture.</b>|$|E
5|$|Linguist Jesse Sheidlower {{traces the}} gesture's {{development}} in the United States to the 1890s. According to anthropologist Desmond Morris, <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> probably came to the United States via Italian immigrants. The first documented appearance of the finger in the United States was in 1886, when Old Hoss Radbourn, a baseball pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters, was photographed giving it {{to a member of}} their rival the New York Giants. In the film Speedy (1928), Harold Lloyd's character gives himself the finger into a distorting mirror at Luna Park, about 24 minutes into the film.|$|E
5|$|Many metal musicians when {{performing}} live {{engage in}} headbanging, which involves rhythmically beating {{time with the}} head, often emphasized by long hair.

40|$|International audienceJunior {{physicians}} mainly learn {{during their}} observation in the operative room. The senior physicians evaluate them {{based on the}} same kind of observation. Knowledge transfer evaluation is thus done without quantitative methods and it mainly lies on a subjective assessment. In this paper, we present some recent techniques used to objectively evaluate medical <b>gestures.</b> <b>The</b> classical techniques used are Hidden Markov Models (HMM) or Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Both techniques lies on the temporal analysis of <b>the</b> <b>gestures.</b> We proposed here a technique based on the arc length parametrization in order to analyze <b>the</b> <b>gestures</b> in space which is more appropriate because it gives information about the shape of <b>the</b> <b>gestures</b> independently of <b>the</b> chosen coordinate system...|$|R

5|$|The open {{right hand}} of the monk is {{interpreted}} as an oath-making gesture, or a blessing gesture in Christian tradition. The red book in the left hand refers to the oath book of the city (in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> of the right hand), or the municipal law book which is bounded in red and has been handed down since 1365. Another interpretation {{is that it is}} a gospel book.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E

40|$|In {{face-to-face}} communication, {{we often}} unconsciously move our {{hands in the}} air. These "(hand) gestures" {{are one of the}} most important tools for children with limited language ability. This study explored the relationship between language ability and gestures during childhood by conducting two experiments. Experiment 1 investigated <b>the</b> <b>gestures</b> and speech of normal preschoolers and revealed that <b>the</b> <b>gestures</b> found among preschoolers have common features with those of adults. Experiment 2 investigated gestures and speech in the case of three crippled children. This experiment revealed that although the movements of the disabled children were restricted, there still existed some similarities in <b>the</b> <b>gestures</b> of crippled and typical development children. This result suggests that <b>the</b> relationship between <b>gestures</b> and speech is stable from childhood. In addition, an analysis of <b>the</b> perspective of <b>gesture</b> (subjective or objective) indicated the possibility that <b>the</b> development of <b>gestures</b> during childhood is supported by several factors.

5|$|Athletes, {{including}} Stefan Effenberg, Ron Artest, Luis Suárez, Juan Pablo Montoya, Iván Rodríguez, Danny Graves, Jack McDowell, Natasha Zvereva, Josh Smith, Bryan Cox, and Johnny Manziel {{have been}} suspended or fined for making <b>the</b> <b>gesture.</b> José Paniagua was released by the Chicago White Sox after giving the middle finger to an umpire; he hasn't played in the majors since. Baseball executive Chub Feeney once resigned after giving the finger to fans on Fan Appreciation Night. Bud Adams, owner of the National Football League's Tennessee Titans, was fined US$250,000 for giving both middle fingers to the fans of the Buffalo Bills during a game.

5|$|During World War II, {{the trophy}} {{was held by}} 1938 winners Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian {{vice-president}} of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent Adolf Hitler and the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden {{marked the beginning of}} a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographer requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air.

5|$|In November 1997, Gascoigne {{received}} a five-match ban after being sent off for violent conduct during the Old Firm derby following an incident with Celtic midfielder Morten Wieghorst. In January 1998, Gascoigne courted serious controversy after {{he played a}} mock flute (symbolic of the flute-playing of Orange Order marchers) during an Old Firm match at Celtic Park. <b>The</b> <b>gesture</b> infuriated Celtic fans who had been taunting him and Gascoigne was fined £20,000 by Rangers after the incident. He also {{received a}} death threat from an Irish Republican Army (IRA) Member following the incident.

5|$|In {{his final}} days, Irwin sold his rights from his {{scoreboard}} business for $2000. Though he sent $1500 to May and only $500 to Elizabeth, his Boston widow {{was surprised at}} <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> since Irwin rarely visited Boston and provided almost no financial support to their family. In fact, May {{said that he had}} not been away from New York {{for more than a few}} days at a time in 27 years. She said that his only long trips were baseball-related, when he would scout players in other cities. Before he left New York for the final time, he told May that he was going to say goodbye to friends in Boston and that he would return to New York.

5|$|It was {{originally}} planned that United States President Ronald Reagan should {{take part in}} the Second World War memorial event in the Bundestag, shifting the emphasis from remembering the past to highlighting West Germany in its partnership with the Western Bloc. On Weizsäcker's strong urging, the occasion was marked without Reagan, who visited West Germany several days earlier instead, surrounding the G7-summit in Bonn. Reagan's visit nevertheless sparked controversy, especially in the United States. In an attempt to reproduce <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> made by Kohl and French President François Mitterrand a year earlier at Verdun, the chancellor and Reagan were set to visit the military cemetery in Bitburg. This raised objections, since the cemetery included the last resting place for several members of the Waffen-SS.|$|E
5|$|Prost won his fourth, and final, title, {{but in a}} {{year where}} he was {{regularly}} challenged by teammate Hill, and Ayrton Senna. Shortly before the Portuguese Grand Prix in October 1993, Prost announced he would not defend his world title, as the clause in the Frenchman's contract did not extend to 1994 and Senna {{would be able to}} join Williams for the upcoming season, and instead opted to retire as the driver with the record for most grand prix victories — a record which stood for almost a decade. On the podium in Adelaide in 1993, Prost's last race, he and Senna embraced. Prost was surprised by <b>the</b> <b>gesture,</b> as Senna had declined a handshake the race before.

30|$|Unlike other <b>gestures,</b> <b>the</b> R^ 2 and T_diff {{values of}} the {{synthesized}} motion curves for <b>the</b> tapping <b>gesture</b> are not significantly improved. This {{can be explained by}} the duration of <b>the</b> tapping <b>gesture</b> as compared to dragging and zooming <b>gestures.</b> <b>The</b> average duration of <b>the</b> tapping <b>gesture</b> was 0.35 ± 0.15 s compared to 1.26 ± 0.25 and 0.88 ± 0.123 s for horizontal dragging and zoom <b>gestures</b> respectively. Thus, <b>the</b> tracking instabilities have a smaller effect on the shape of motion curves and timing differences.

5|$|As an {{exception}} to the retired-number policy, MLB began honoring Robinson by allowing players to wear number 42 on April 15, Jackie Robinson Day, which is an annual observance that started in 2004. For the 60th anniversary of Robinson's major league debut, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day in 2007. <b>The</b> <b>gesture</b> was originally the idea of outfielder Ken Griffey, Jr., who sought Rachel Robinson's permission to wear the number. After receiving her permission, Commissioner Bud Selig not only allowed Griffey to wear the number, but also extended an invitation to all major league teams to do the same. Ultimately, more than 200 players wore number 42, including the entire rosters of the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. The tribute was continued in 2008, when, during games on April 15, all members of the Mets, Cardinals, Washington Nationals, and Tampa Bay Rays wore Robinson's number 42. On June 25, 2008, MLB installed a new plaque for Robinson at the Baseball Hall of Fame commemorating his off-the-field impact on the game as well as his playing statistics. In 2009, all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches, and umpires) wore number 42 on April 15.|$|E
