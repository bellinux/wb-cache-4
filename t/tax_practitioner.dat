40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> {{can play}} an {{important}} role in assisting taxpayers to meet their compliance obligations. The increased use of <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> over the past decade suggests that more and more taxpayers are seeking their advice on the application of tax legislation and assistance to ensure that they file accurate returns. This confirms that <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> are well positioned to influence the compliance decisions of taxpayers. However, studies have shown that there is a disparity between the type of advice preferred by taxpayers and that provided by <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Since research that explores the reasons for this disparity, particularly from a South African perspective, was found to be limited, the objective of this study was to identify potential reasons for the disparity by examining the factors that influence the behaviour of <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> in the hope that this might assist in managing the expectation gap between the type of advice desired by taxpayers versus the type of advice provided by <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Using semi-structured interviews conducted with <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> employed at a Big 4 firm, a number of potential factors identified in previous studies were tested. The results proved that the behaviour of <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> is influenced by various factors that may all affect the manner in which advice is given to clients and the nature of such advice.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between taxpayers and <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> is complex, as many diverse aspects shape their interaction. This explains why taxpayers and <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> hold different expectations regarding tax services, {{leading to an}} expectation gap between taxpayers and <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> The primary objective of this qualitative study was to {{gain an understanding of}} the factors that contribute to the expectation gap between taxpayers and <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> in South Africa. To achieve this primary objective, the Interactive Qualitative Analysis process was used as a research method to identify the factors that contribute to the expectation gap. Data were collected from four different South African focus groups, namely taxpayers, and three separate groups of different types of <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Affinities were generated for each focus group, and possible cause-and-effect relations amongst the affinities were established using theoretical coding. A systems influence diagram was subsequently generated for each group to represent the entire system of influences and outcomes based on the perceptions of that focus group. Meta-themes relating to the key factors were identified by means of a thematic analysis of the affinities in a second coding cycle. These meta-themes {{led to the development of}} a conceptual framework of associations that describes the interactive nature of the expectation gap between taxpayers and their <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Based on these associations, propositions were generated, and mechanisms and interventions regarding the roles of different groups in reducing the gap were suggested. A model for reducing the expectation gap was also proposed, based on the main themes that emanated from this study. The overarching theme is communication between taxpayers and their <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> This theme relates to the remaining six themes. These are capability of taxpayers and <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners,</b> clarity on the nature and scope of tax service, transparency on the fee structure of a tax service, external influences on taxpayers, the collecting agent’s systems and processes and finally incompatible compliance behaviour attitudes between taxpayers and <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013. gm 2013 Taxationunrestricte...|$|R

The findings overwhelmingly showed that {{a capital gains tax}} (CGT) was not supported by most <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners,</b> A plausible reason for the strong opposition to a CGT by the <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> was attributable to the increased compliance costs and the interpretation surrounding the CGT legislation. The absence of a comprehensive CGT in New Zealand can potentially provide lucrative business opportunities for <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> by advising their clients to convert taxable incomes into tax free capital gains.

40|$|South African taxpayers {{currently}} consult either accountants (i. e., non-legal <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners)</b> or attorneys (i. e., legal <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners)</b> {{in order}} to acquire tax advice. The qualitative approach adopted in carrying out this study entails {{the examination of the}} differing rights applicable to a taxpayer depending on which adviser he decides to approach for tax advice. The concept of legal professional privilege is a common law right which has only ever been applicable to members of the legal profession. However, due to the recent regulation of <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> and the modernisation of the way taxpayers conduct their financial affairs in approaching both attorneys and accountants for tax advice it seems appropriate that this privilege should be extended beyond the legal profession. Upon consideration of the history and requirements of this privilege it is determined that this privilege is amenable to extension. Constitutional principles, with regard to the right to privacy and the right to equality in relation to the taxpayer obtaining the tax advice, are infringed {{as a result of the}} limitation imposed whereby only tax advice obtained from an attorney is protected. Lastly, the current legislative stances adopted by foreign jurisdictions, that currently permit or are considering permitting legal professional privilege to apply to tax advice obtained from non-legal <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> illustrate that there is a global movement toward removing the current restrictions on this principle. This has been accomplished by countries such as the United States of America and New Zealand by way of introduction of statutory provisions that allow for tax advice issued by non-legal <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> to be protected from disclosure to the revenue authorities in the respective countries. Based on the research conducted it is concluded that South Africa should therefore follow suit and create a separate statutory provision to protect tax advice obtained from non-legal <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Dissertation (Mcom) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

40|$|The {{move towards}} a full {{self-assessment}} tax regime in Australia has {{brought with it}} a greater representation of, and expanded role for <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Given that the resolution of many tax issues present significant ethical dilemmas for <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> in their role as the moral agent of their clients, and the close relationship of ethics and tax compliance, {{an evaluation of the}} nature and extent of ethical concerns as identified by <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> themselves has important implications both for the tax profession and tax administration. There have, however, been few empirical studies reported in Australia as to the range of ethical issues encountered in tax practice. Further, there has been a tendency in the literature to treat the tax profession as a homogeneous group, notwithstanding that tax services are provided through a variety of organisational structures ranging from sole-practitioners to large international public accounting firms (Big 5 firms). To investigate whether such a view of the tax profession in Western Australia is accurate or inappropriate, tax professionals were partitioned into the broad body of <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> in general practice (registered tax agents), in one group, and <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> engaged by the Big 5 firms, in a second group. The aim of this research was to investigate whether there were significant differences in the ethical perceptions between tax agents and Big 5 <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> A mail - questionnaire was used to elicit data as to the frequency and importance of a range of ethical issues in tax practice. For analysis, the list was subsequently reduced to a ÃŒTop 10 ÃŒ inventory. Overall, the practical differences were not dramatic with significant percentages of both groups rating those issues which related primarily to the conduct of professional responsibilities e. g., ensuring reasonable enquiries are undertaken, maintaining an appropriate level of technical competence, continuing to act for a client when it is not appropriate, as of most concern to <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> One issue on which there was a significant difference between the two groups was the ranking of loophole seeking on the frequency dimension. A tentative explanation for this difference (ranked ÃŒ 1 ÃŒ and ÃŒ 11 ÃŒ for Big 5 and tax agent respondents respectively) is offered in terms of client expectations of a "tax exploiter" role for Big 5 practitioners in contrast to a "tax enforcer/compliance" role for their tax agent counterparts. ...|$|R

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the <b>Tax</b> <b>Practitioners</b> Board’s implementation and administration of the regulatory arrangements for <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> under the <b>Tax</b> Agent Services Act 2009. Overall conclusionTaxpayers make extensive use of the services offered by <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> In 2011 – 12, <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> lodged over 70 per cent of individual income tax returns and over 90 per cent of business tax returns. Accordingly, the effective regulation of <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> is a critical element of Australia’s taxation regime. In 2010, after an extended period of policy and legislative development, the Tax Agent Services Act 2009 (TAS Act) established a new national regime for the regulation of <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> The new regime applies to all professionals who provide tax agent services for a fee and includes Business Activity Statement (BAS) agents as well as tax service providers. In 2011 – 12, there were around 52   000 registered <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> The TAS Act also established the <b>Tax</b> <b>Practitioners</b> Board, an independent statutory authority that is responsible for the new regulatory regime. For operational purposes, the appointed members are known as ‘the Board’ and collectively the Board and its supporting staff are known as the <b>Tax</b> <b>Practitioners</b> Board (TPB). The inaugural Board was constituted in November 2009 and the regulation of <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> under the TAS Act commenced on 1 March 2010. In its first three years of operation the Board has established an appropriate governance framework, introduced an effective national registration system for <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners,</b> and is developing a regulatory assurance function to ensure compliance with the provisions of the TAS Act. The Board initially focussed on clarifying its legislated powers under the TAS Act and establishing key policies for registering and regulating <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Nevertheless, intense periods of registration activity 17 have tested the TPB’s processes and there have been considerable delays in dealing with applications, prompting concerns being raised by stakeholders. In response, the TPB streamlined registration processes and has largely overcome the registration backlog. In a similar vein, the new regulatory assurance arrangements established by the TAS Act, which require the Board to administer a Code of Professional Conduct and civil penalties regime, have taken time to implement. The Board is still refining its approach and processes for some regulatory arrangements. By way of background, upon appointment in November 2009 the Board determined its priorities, noting that it had less than four months to develop policy, procedures and systems to commence registration of <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> on 1 March 2010. The approach taken by the Board in setting its priorities demonstrated an awareness of the key issues it faced in implementing the new regulatory regime. These included bringing new groups of <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> (notably BAS agents) within the regulatory ambit and publishing draft policies on a number of important aspects of the new requirements. By 1 March 2010, the Board had a new national registration system functioning, albeit still requiring further development, and had begun to develop registration policies, established a committee structure and undertaken extensive stakeholder consultation. Notwithstanding these achievements, there would have been benefits in the Board formalising its implementation strategy and monitoring its progress against defined outcomes and timeframes. It would also have assisted the Board to prioritise administrative arrangements and determine timeframes for making the transition from implementation to a business‑as‑usual state. The Board takes an active role in setting the direction for TPB operations and has implemented governance arrangements including business planning, risk management and performance monitoring. These are at various stages of maturity and, in some respects, have taken longer to establish than might be expected. The TPB’s Portfolio Budget Statements key performance indicators (KPIs) are activity measures without any associated performance targets. An important area for attention in the near future is developing appropriate KPIs for measuring {{the effectiveness of the}} program in achieving its objective, and reporting achievements against these KPIs and deliverables, including associated service standards. The registration of <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> is a key responsibility of the Board. The standard registration requirements of the TAS Act and transitional arrangements created large workload peaks often outside the control of the TPB. This situation, and the volume of applications received, challenged the registration system capability and the capacity of the TPB to process applications in a timely way. The time taken, and information systems problems, created dissatisfaction among stakeholders. From a peak in August 2010 of 18   000 applications (an existing backlog of about 8000 applications and 10   000 applications being received), the backlog at the beginning of 2013 was less than 2000 applications and continues to diminish with the introduction of streamlined applications processing and improved system capability. Of some concern though, is that the proposed quality assurance framework has not been finalised and implemented, and a number of important draft registration procedures have yet to be finalised and approved. A key objective of the new regulatory regime is to provide assurance that <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners</b> meet appropriate standards of professional and ethical conduct. The Board has civil penalty and injunction options and may apply a range of administrative sanctions for misconduct. In the last three years, the TPB has actioned over 5090 complaints against <b>tax</b> <b>practitioners,</b> including four cases where a civil penalty was imposed by the Federal Court of Australia. In 2011, the Board established a policy framework to guide its regulatory assurance activities, but the constituent documents were developed progressively and many of the principles, objectives, workload estimates and performance measures in the various documents do not align. The Board has adopted a risk-based approach to compliance but current compliance risks do not reflect the TPB’s strategic risks, or those outlined in other compliance documents. There are also a number of areas that still require further development, particularly building a compliance intelligence capability and implementing a formal regulatory quality assurance process. In addition, a number of key regulatory assurance procedures were still in draft form as at January 2013. The ANAO has made three recommendations aimed at improving the TPB’s administrative arrangements and regulatory assurance function. These include: developing and reporting against KPIs and the TPB’s service standards; aligning compliance risks and streamlining the TPB’s compliance framework; and developing an intelligence gathering and analysis capability...|$|R
