5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>simply</b> did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
5|$|In 491 BC, Darius sent emissaries {{to all the}} Greek city-states, {{asking for}} a gift of 'earth and water' in token of their {{submission}} to him. Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit; in Sparta, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> thrown down a well. This meant that Sparta was also effectively at war with Persia.|$|E

5|$|After his {{graduation}} in 1947, García Márquez {{stayed in}} Bogotá to study {{law at the}} Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where he had a special dedication to reading. La metamorfosis by Franz Kafka «in the false translation of Jorge Luis Borges» was a work that especially inspired him. He was excited {{with the idea of}} writing, not traditional literature, but a style similar to his grandfather's stories, in which «they inserted extraordinary events and anomalies as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> an aspect of everyday life». His desire to be a writer grew. A little later, he published his first, La tercera resignación, which appeared in the September 13th, 1947 edition of the newspaper El Espectador.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} Final Fantasy XV, Tabata {{decided to make}} a high-definition remaster of Type-0 for eighth-generation consoles. Developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, Final Fantasy Type-0 HD was {{originally}} announced at E3 2014, and released worldwide in March 2015. After Type-0s release, Tabata stated {{in an interview that he}} wished to explore the distant history of Orience after the events of the game. Trademarks for Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 were registered shortly after the Type-0 trademark, but it was suggested that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> a protective measure. During interviews given in 2014, Tabata commented that he wished to work on Type-1 after completing XV, and later explained the conceptual Type series as a means of publishing Final Fantasy games too experimental for the main series. He hoped to continue with the Type series if Type-0 HD was commercially successful.|$|E

25|$|Reel Injun explores many {{stereotypes}} about Natives in film, from the Noble savage to the Drunken Indian. It profiles such figures as Iron Eyes Cody, an Italian American who reinvented {{himself as a}} Native American on screen. The film also explores Hollywood's practice of using Italian Americans and American Jews to portray Indians in the movies and reveals how some Native American actors made jokes in their native tongue on screen when the director thought <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> speaking gibberish.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{of retail}} {{friction}} models from the dealer promos were {{the lack of}} manufacturing paint schemes (<b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> molded in different colors, like many other promotionals) and usually had {{the addition of a}} friction motor located on the front axle, noticeable by the studded white vinyl gear that protruded around the axle (and through the oil pan)(see Gibson, p45). By contrast, the promo version often had a special lower engine plate that covered where the friction motor was placed on the commercial model. Early on, some cars, such as the 1953 Studebaker Commander promo, had the addition of acetate windows, while the friction powered model was windowless (Doty 2000b, p88).|$|E
25|$|Czechoslovak-produced T-34-85s {{were used}} by Egypt in the Arab-Israeli Wars of 1956 and 1967 in the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt went on to build the T-34-100, a local and unique {{conversion}} that {{was made up of}} a Soviet BS-3 100mm heavy field-artillery gun mounted within a modified turret of the T-34-85. In 1956, they were used as regular tanks to support Egyptian infantry, but by 1967, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> dug in to be used as defensive gun-emplacements. Israel captured many of Egypt's T-34-85s but it is unknown if they ever saw active service in the Israeli Army, but it is known that the captured Egyptian T-34-85s were re-painted by Israel and also displayed on parade after the Suez Crisis of 1956 with Israeli Army markings.|$|E

25|$|Another {{test was}} electronic; {{they were asked}} to {{influence}} the burnout point of a common fuse. After they were given a chance to work it with their mind, an increasing amount of current was run through the fuse until it blew. The two proved to have amazing abilities in this test after a few trials, eventually causing the fuses to blow immediately once they got used to it. In fact, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> palming the already blown fuses and then handing them back to the experimenters. They also found that pressing down {{on one end of the}} fuse in its holder, or just touching it briefly, caused the instruments to record unusual results that were interpreted by the experimenters as psi effects.|$|E

During the filming of Viva Las Vegas, Elvis began an affair with his co-star Ann-Margret. When Priscilla read of these reports in the press, she confronted Elvis. He told her that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> rumors to promote the film and that she should not believe {{everything}} that she read in the press. For the next few years, Elvis would have intimate relationships with many of his leading ladies and co-stars, all the while denying their existence to Priscilla. Eventually she was allowed to visit him in Hollywood, but her visits were kept short.|$|E
25|$|From {{the fifteenth}} century, when the Tutsi arrived {{in what is}} now Rwanda as migrant pastoralists, to the onset of colonization, Rwanda was a feudal monarchy. A Tutsi monarch ruled, distributing land and {{political}} authority through hereditary chiefs whose power was manifest in their land and cattle ownership. Most of these chiefs were Tutsis. The land was farmed under an imposed system of patronage under which Tutsi chiefs demanded manual labor in return for the rights of Hutus to occupy their land. This system left Hutus with the status of serfs. Additionally, when Rwanda conquered the peoples on its borders, their ethnic identities were cast aside and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> labeled “Hutu”. Therefore, “Hutu” became an identity that was not necessarily ethnic, but rather just associated with subjugation.|$|E
