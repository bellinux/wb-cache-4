5|$|There {{were still}} fine mediaeval screens {{in the church}} in 1810, {{possibly}} lost when repairs were done in 1813–16; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone</b> by 1862. According to the History and Antiquities of the County of Cardigan (1810) by Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick: The chancel and north transept are separated {{from the rest of}} the church by light and elegant carved screens, which, from the elaborate workmanship they display, were probably erected about the time of Henry the Seventh. They are coloured red, green and yellow, and though once very brilliant, are now so covered with dirt as to be scarce perceptible.|$|E
5|$|Mac {{leaves the}} party early, but {{the leader of}} the group appears at her room. When he tries to kiss her, she pulls away. Logan (Jason Dohring) and Dick (Ryan Hansen) go surfing. When Mac, Parker, and Veronica go to the leader’s house, they find a woman, but he invites them in anyway. Veronica finds cages of rats in Bronson’s house, but he says that they showed up on his {{doorstep}} one day. Logan has sex with a surfer woman, and when the police show up at Bronson’s house to inquire after the stolen rats, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone.</b> While investigating the hard drive of the lab’s computer, Mac finds leaves, which Veronica discovers are green tea. She shows them to the coworker, Emi, and discovers that Emi stole one of the monkey’s toys.|$|E
5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone</b> for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E

5|$|Southern Rhodesian troops during World War I {{were all}} volunteers. Particularly during the war's early stages, not all male {{settlers}} of fighting age {{were expected to}} abandon their civilian lives for service abroad. Many {{of them were in}} vital industries like mining, and the Company administration did not grant financial allowances to support the families of married soldiers, so at least at first, only bachelors in non-essential positions were generally considered to have any moral obligation to sign up. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment, raised in early 1915, explicitly barred married men from its ranks to preempt the tribulations that might befall their families while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone.</b> Men of service age who remained at home were pressured by the national and local press to contribute to local security by joining the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers or the Rhodesian Reserves; editorials told readers that men who failed to do so were not fulfilling their patriotic duty, and warned that conscription might be required if not enough joined up.|$|E

25|$|As soon as Saint-Cyr's army marched north, Ferdinand and Queen Maria Carolina {{violated}} the agreement and invited the British and Russians to land expeditionary forces in their kingdom. Napoleon had been double-crossed. Lieutenant General James Henry Craig's 6,000 British and General Maurice Lacy of Grodno's 7,350 Russians landed at Naples on 20 November 1805. However, Napoleon's decisive {{victory at the}} Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805 resulted in {{the demise of the}} Third Coalition. As a result, both expeditionary forces were ordered by their governments to withdraw and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone</b> by mid-January. This left Ferdinand alone to face the fury of Napoleon, who had determined to conquer the Kingdom of Naples and hand the crown to his brother Joseph Bonaparte.|$|E

25|$|One widely {{accepted}} theory about {{the transformation of}} autonomous communities to chiefdoms is that an individual, or group of individuals must have used some degree of coercion to begin controlling others in their community. Stronger factions may have used coercion to force weaker factions to submit to their desires, {{and in order to}} do this they may have obtained their strength through a number of different ways. First, canny choices of farming plots allowed an individual or group of individuals to systematically gain an upper hand in crop production. Second, good alliance-building tactics may have been performed to stave off attacks by competing factions. And, lastly, healthy offspring would have ensured that an individual's lineage was secure for long after <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone,</b> allowing strong hereditary associations to control the fate of the dynasty.|$|E
25|$|A {{longer and}} rather baggy coat (still with sleeves rarely going below the elbow) made an {{appearance}} in the early 1660s and as the decade progressed became the most popular coat. By the late 1660s, an upturned cuff became popular although the sleeves had still remained above the elbows. By the 1670s, a vest or waistcoat was worn under the coat. It was usually made of contrasting, often luxurious, fabric, and might have a plain back since that was not seen under the coat. It was a long garment which by the 1680s reached just above the knees. With {{the end of the}} 1670s the sleeves became longer and the coat more fitted. The 1680s saw larger upturned cuffs and the waist of the coat became much wider. The coat could have lapels or none. This coat is known as the justacorps. The pockets {{on both sides of the}} coats were arranged horizontally or vertically (especially the mid to late 1680s) until the 1690s when the pockets were usually always arranged horizontally. The waistcoat could be sleeveless or have long sleeves. Typically, a long-sleeved waistcoat was worn in winter for added warmth. By the mid-1680s, ribbons were reduced to one side of the shoulder until by the 1690s, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{commander}} of Fort Lipantitlán, Nicolás Rodríguez, {{had been ordered}} to harass the Texian troops at Goliad. [...] Rodríguez took {{the bulk of his}} men on an expedition; while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone,</b> Westover's force arrived in San Patricio. [...] On November 3, a local man persuaded the Mexican garrison to surrender, and the following day the Texians dismantled the fort. Rodríguez returned as the Texians were crossing the swollen Nueces River to return to Goliad. [...] The Mexican soldiers attacked, but the longer range of the Texians rifles soon forced them to retreat. One Texian was injured, 35 Mexican soldiers were killed, and 1417 were wounded.|$|E

500|$|Hughes first {{pitched the}} series {{to the network}} through Mike Lazzo at Adult Swim {{sometime}} after late 2009, after producing a video mixtape that would be projected behind musical performers for the network's 2010 Carnival Tour event. He compiled footage for the mixtape using the Prelinger Archives, as well as various online sources, and applied visual effects to them [...] "until you didn't quite {{know what you were}} looking at." [...] He originally imagined for it to exist as a [...] "bizarre collection" [...] of Internet and archival footage intertwined with clips from Adult Swim shows, [...] "set to good music." [...] He ultimately had to omit the latter material, however, as the network would still have to acquire licenses for their own series in derivative works. He found that once <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone,</b> [...] "the show really opened up." ...|$|E
500|$|The clearcutting and {{repeated}} fires changed all of this. New growth was often composed of different plants and trees than {{had originally been}} there. Near Beaver Run in Quehanna there are wetlands that were originally hemlock forest. Hemlocks transpire large amounts of water and once <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone</b> the soil was too wet to support most trees; the bracken and ferns that replaced the hemlocks altered the soil qualities to discourage trees as well. Within the Quehanna Wild Area [...] are wetlands. Fires and erosion removed nutrients from the soil, and in some areas the soil was so poor in nutrients that only white birch, a pioneer species, would grow there. Marion Brooks Natural Area has the largest stand of white birch in Pennsylvania and the eastern United States. These trees are now 80to 90years old and reaching {{the end of their}} lifespans.|$|E
500|$|During the two-month American tour, {{the band}} became {{increasingly}} unhappy, often venting frustrations on each other, leading to several physical confrontations. The band members were homesick; Albarn said, [...] "I {{just started to}} miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England so I started writing songs which created an English atmosphere." [...] Upon the group's return to Britain, Blur (Albarn in particular) were upset by the success rival group Suede had achieved while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone.</b> After a poor performance at a 1992 gig that featured a well-received set by Suede on the same bill, Blur {{were in danger of}} being dropped by Food. By that time, Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American grunge bands like Nirvana. Although sceptical of Albarn's new manifesto for Blur, Balfe gave assent for the band's choice of Andy Partridge (of XTC) to produce their follow-up to Leisure. The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group.|$|E

500|$|The first writers {{assigned}} to the script were twins Julius and Philip Epstein who, against the wishes of Warner Brothers, left at Frank Capra's request early in 1942 {{to work on the}} Why We Fight series in Washington, D.C. While <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone,</b> the other credited writer, Howard Koch, was assigned; he produced thirty to forty pages. When the Epstein brothers returned after about a month, they were re{{assigned to}} Casablanca and—contrary to what Koch claimed in two published books—his work was not used. The Epstein brothers and Koch never worked in the same room at the same time during the writing of the script. Koch later commented, [...] "When we began, we didn't have a finished script... Ingrid Bergman came to me and said, 'Which man should I love more...?' I said to her, 'I don't know... play them both evenly.' You see we didn't have an ending, so we didn't know what was going to happen!" [...] In the final budget for the film, the Epsteins were paid $30,416, and Koch earned $4,200.|$|E
2500|$|After a night march, Nolan, his troopers and {{the buffalo}} hunters reached Cedar Lake about 8:00 AM on July 22. The large [...] by [...] long lake in 1875 {{was now a}} dry lake.

While <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone,</b> Parker arrived to visit and stayed about six hours. When Tafoya, Harvey and Cook returned they reported fresh signs of Indians heading toward Double Lakes. About noon on July 25, they arrived at Double Lake and found it was dry. They dug for water.|$|E
2500|$|Schröder's 5th Column started marching through Binche at 8:00 am {{and soon}} {{discovered}} French troops near Bonne-Espérance Abbey. This was Mayer's division, now isolated. Schröder detached Wilhelm Lothar Maria von Kerpen to outflank the French, while he pushed ahead toward Anderlues. The French fell back without fighting to Mont-Sainte-Geneviève where Kerpen discovered them somewhat later {{and asked for}} assistance. Schröder sent a detachment of Barco Hussars to dislodge the French, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone</b> when the hussars arrived. In the evening, the 5th Column reunited in front of Fontaine-l'Evêque where Schröder found the tail of Kléber's retreating column and scattered it. The spoils included a convoy of provisions collected by Kléber's foraging parties.|$|E

2500|$|Also at 9 p.m., at {{a formal}} council of war, Milroy and his {{officers}} {{made the decision}} to try to [...] "cut their way through" [...] to Harpers Ferry on the old Charles Town Road, the very same road that Confederate Johnson and his division were marching toward to cut off. All of the cannons were spiked and their carriages destroyed. Shortly after midnight, the Federal soldiers pulled their colors and left their works so quietly that Early's Confederates did not know <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>gone</b> until morning. The column massed in the low ground between Star Fort and Fort Milroy, then moved down along the railroad line and the Valley Pike toward the Charles Town crossroad, just south of Stephenson's Depot.|$|E

[...] And [...] also states, [...] "Violence (that is, robbery) is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor any of theirs; neither shall there be wailing for them."
