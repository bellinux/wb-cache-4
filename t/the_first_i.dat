500|$|Residente o Visitante was {{recorded}} in various countries, as the band was on tour during {{the making of the}} album. [...] Residente explained that the group did not feel any pressure to compete with the success of Calle 13, and felt that the recording of Residente o Visitante was a smoother process than the first: [...] "The main difference for us this time around was that we had more opportunities, more tools and more money. We were also on tour at the same time, unlike <b>the</b> <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> spent my time writing during the travels, while my brother would write the music." [...] Residente was invited by La Mala Rodriguez to come to Spain to collaborate on a song. [...] He agreed, as he greatly admired La Mala's work, and the two met for drinks where they discussed the kind of song they wanted to create before going to the studio to record what would later become [...] "Mala Suerta Con el 13".|$|E
500|$|As in Islam, a {{fundamental}} tenet of Judaism is that God is {{not bound by}} any limitations of time, matter, or space, and {{that the idea of}} any person being God, a part of God, or a mediator to God, is heresy. The Book of Ezra, which Judaism accepts as a chronicle of the life of Ezra and which predates Muhammad and the Qur'an by around 1000 years, gives Ezra's human lineage as being the son of Seraiah and a direct descendant of Aaron. Tractate Ta'anit of the Jerusalem Talmud, which predates Muhammad by two to three hundred years, states that “if a man claims to be God, he is a liar.” Exodus Rabba 29 says, [...] "'I am the first and I am the last, and beside Me there is no God' I am <b>the</b> <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> have no father; I am the last, I have no brother. Beside Me there is no God; I have no son." [...] However the term 'sons of gods' occurs in Genesis. The Encyclopedia of Judaism clarifies that the title of 'son of God' is attributed a person whose piety has placed him in a very near relationship to God and [...] "by no means carries the idea of physical descent from, and essential unity with, God".|$|E

[...] "From <b>the</b> <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> regarded myself as under obligation to my country to preserve the faces of its historic men and mothers." [...] Brady returned to New York in May 1852 after a long absence in Europe. While there he sought treatments for the ill effects of mercury poising, a common occurrence among daguerreians.|$|E

2500|$|... "Semper Fidelis"'s first strain {{begins with}} a very simple V-I progression, {{creating}} a wave-like sense of tension and relief. Note its use of dominant seven chords to make the V chord stronger. This extension is used in many marches. Towards the end, however, the progression gets more harmonically interesting. In {{the middle of the}} measure before the trumpet [...] "fanfare," [...] the chord alters to C♯dim7 instead of remaining on C as before. Because it leads to a G7 chord rather than a D minor chord, {{this is an example of}} a common-tone diminished seventh chord. This chord [...] "leads" [...] into the V chord (G), which is then followed by a D7 chord. A D chord in the key of C would be the ii chord, and all ii chords must be minor. However, the D chord in this case is not minor. Rather, it is known as a secondary dominant, in which a dominant chord is borrowed from another key, hence [...] "secondary dominant". [...] A secondary dominant naturally leads into a chord other than <b>the</b> <b>first</b> (<b>I</b> chord). In this case, it leads into the V (G7).|$|E
2500|$|Josephine Seaton, a keen {{observer}} {{and the daughter}} [...] of {{the publisher of the}} National Intelligencer,William Seaton, states the navy yard strikers {{played a significant role in}} the Snow riot: [...] "Snow will certainly be torn to pieces by the mechanics if he be caught, and they are in full pursuit of him. Unfortunately, several hundred mechanics of the navy yard are out of employment, who, aided and abetted by their sympathizers, create the mob, — <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> have ever seen, not recollecting those of Sheffield, and it is truly alarming." [...] Seaton was one of the few whites to record the strike, a strike which revealed the corrosive effects of racism on the navy yard workforce as white workers sought to blame their own precarious economic situation on free and enslaved African Americans. The riot was widely publicized in many newspapers and alarmed the white community. As their economic situation deteriorated and stung by public criticism of their actions the navy yard mechanics and laborers sought to end the strike. The two sides came together in an agreement that both Hull and the workers accepted through the offices of an outside mediator, Dr. Alexander A. McWilliams, who had a medical practice adjacent to the navy yard and was known to both the workforce and Hull as a result the Department of the Navy encouraged mediation and the navy yard labor strike ended on 15 August 1835 when the mechanics returned to work.|$|E
2500|$|While Garbage had lyrical {{input from}} all band members, Manson was {{responsible}} for all the lyrics in Version 2.0.. Consequently, it was described by Manson as [...] "more direct and more personal than <b>the</b> <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> was able to verbalize things a little clearer this time—I mean, I'm no Nick Cave, I'm never gonna be Bob Dylan. I do what I can to express myself." [...] The singer [...] "tried to let the darker undercurrents come through to offset some of the pop melodies", adding that [...] "like human beings, songs shouldn't be one-dimensional". The singer declared that the introspective nature of Version 2.0 served to [...] "reassure myself while I'm going crazy" [...] due to her experiences during production, as she was [...] "living by myself in a hotel, and I {{had no one to}} really talk to" [...] and every day coming back by herself really late after working on the studio. Manson added that only [...] "The Trick Is to Keep Breathing" [...] had something that was out of her life, being inspired by her friend Ruthie Trouble. [...] "Medication" [...] came about from a frightful, isolating experience with the US medical system. The song, Manson explained, is [...] "a reflection on past ills in a way ... about taking blame on yourself for things that you had no control of at the time, and finally pushing off and realizing that this was not my fault. It wasn't all my fault. There's a huge relief and release that comes from that".|$|E
