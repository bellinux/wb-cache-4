25|$|The space-based portion {{will not}} need to support itself against gravity (other than {{relatively}} weak tidal stresses). It needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather, but will {{have to cope with}} space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares. Two basic methods of conversion have been studied: photovoltaic (PV) and solar dynamic (SD). Most analyses of SBSP have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity. Solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler. The use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt. Wireless power transmission was proposed early on as a means to <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> collection to the Earth's surface, using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies.|$|E
2500|$|Assume that a star radiates a {{continuous}} light spectrum up to X rays. Lyman frequencies are absorbed {{in this light}} and pump atoms mainly to first excited state. In this state, hyperfine periods are longer than 1 ns, so that an ISRS “may” redshift light frequency, populating high hyperfine levels. An other ISRS “may” <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> hyperfine levels to thermal electromagnetic waves, so that redshift is permanent. Temperature of a light beam is defined from frequency and spectral radiance by Planck’s formula. As entropy must increase, “may” becomes “does”.|$|E
2500|$|Transmitting {{solar energy}} {{wirelessly}} from the Earth to the Moon and back {{is also an}} idea proposed {{for the benefit of}} space colonization and energy resources. Physicist Dr. David Criswell, who worked for NASA during the Apollo missions, {{came up with the idea}} of using power beams to <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> space. These beams, microwaves with a wavelength of about 12cm, will be almost untouched as they travel through the atmosphere. They can also be aimed at more industrial areas to keep away from humans or animal activities. This will allow for safer and more reliable methods of transferring solar energy.|$|E
50|$|Turbomachinery, in {{mechanical}} engineering, describes machines that <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> between a rotor and a fluid, including both turbines and compressors. While a turbine <b>transfers</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> a fluid to a rotor, a compressor <b>transfers</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> a rotor to a fluid.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] SFS {{dissipation}} term is {{of particular}} interest, since it represents the <b>transfer</b> of <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> large resolved scales to small unresolved scales.

50|$|Processes <b>transferring</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> a non-thermal carrier to heat as {{a carrier}} do produce entropy (Example: mechanical/electrical friction, {{established}} by Count Rumford).Either the produced entropy or heat are measured (calorimetry) or the <b>transferred</b> <b>energy</b> of the non-thermal carrier may be measured.|$|R
50|$|Jumborg Ace has a {{vast array}} powers, {{including}} a sword coming from his stomach, missiles, and energy beams. He can cut enemies heads off with a kick or change his body into a slicing machine. He can also <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> his eyes if Jumborg 9 is out of power.|$|E
50|$|These {{two types}} of {{machines}} are governed by the same basic relationships including Newton's second Law of Motion and Euler's pump and turbine equation for compressible fluids. Centrifugal pumps are also turbomachines that <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> a rotor to a fluid, usually a liquid, while turbines and compressors usually work with a gas.|$|E

The delta-v required to transfer to the asteroid varies between 11 and 13 km/s; this change in delta-v oscillates over an approximately 200-year period with the current transfer cost near its maximum of 13 km/s.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the second}} stage a heat {{exchanger}} <b>transfers</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> the hot refrigerant into water to produce hot water. Water temperatures around 5°C and up are suitable at this stage.|$|R
50|$|A {{heat engine}} acts by <b>transferring</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> a warm region to a cool region of space and, in the process, {{converting}} {{some of that}} energy to mechanical work. The cycle may also be reversed. The system may be worked upon by an external force, and in the process, it can <b>transfer</b> thermal <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> a cooler system to a warmer one, thereby acting as a refrigerator or heat pump rather than a heat engine.|$|R
2500|$|A {{heat pump}} is {{a device that}} <b>transfers</b> heat <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> a source of heat to a {{destination}} called a [...] "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy {{in the opposite direction}} of spontaneous heat transfer by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses a small amount of external power to accomplish the work of <b>transferring</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> the heat source to the heat sink.|$|R
50|$|A {{firing pin}} is a {{lightweight}} part, which serves to <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> a spring-loaded hammer to the primer, while a striker is usually heavier, and is {{directly connected to}} the spring providing the energy to impact the primer. Striker mechanisms are generally simpler, since they combine the functions of hammer and firing pin in one.|$|E
50|$|Alloy {{systems that}} are liquid at room {{temperature}} have thermal conductivity far superior to ordinary non-metallic liquids, allowing liquid metal to efficiently <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> the heat source to the liquid. They also have a higher electrical conductivity that allows the liquid to be pumped by more efficient, electromagnetic pumps. This results {{in the use of}} these materials for specific heat conducting and/or dissipation applications.|$|E
50|$|Large {{versions}} of these clips, called automotive clips or battery clamps, {{are made of}} solid copper for low electrical resistance, and are used with thick insulated copper cables to make connections between automobile batteries. These jumper cables are capable of delivering hundreds of Amperes of current needed to directly power an automobile starter motor, or to <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> a charged lead-acid battery to a discharged one.|$|E
50|$|Wind waves, {{as their}} name suggests, are {{generated}} by wind <b>transferring</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> the atmosphere to the ocean's surface, and capillary-gravity waves play {{an essential role}} in this effect.

50|$|In {{continuum}} mechanics, {{an energy}} cascade {{refers to the}} <b>transfer</b> of <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> large scales of motion to the small scales - called a direct energy cascade. Or a <b>transfer</b> of <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> the small scales to the large scales - called an inverse <b>energy</b> cascade. This <b>transfer</b> of <b>energy</b> between different scales requires that {{the dynamics of the}} system is nonlinear.|$|R
5000|$|Wind-wave {{dissipation}} or [...] "swell dissipation" [...] is {{process in}} which a wave generated via a weather system loses its mechanical <b>energy</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>from</b> the atmosphere via wind. Wind waves, as their name suggests, are generated by wind <b>transferring</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> the atmosphere to the ocean's surface, capillary gravity waves play {{an essential role in}} this effect, [...] "wind waves" [...] or [...] "swell" [...] are also known as surface gravity waves.|$|R
50|$|Combustion {{products}} {{drive the}} gas turbines directly. First, air {{is drawn from}} the air intake to the compressor (driven by the turbine axle), then it is burned with natural gas in the combustion chamber. The hot combustion gasses then go through the actual turbine (driving the axle). From a thermodynamic standpoint, this is the standard Brayton cycle. Because the gas turbine does not <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> the combustion process to the turbine via steam, it avoids the cost, energy loss and environmental impact of the primary water cycle.|$|E
50|$|Wind {{waves are}} {{mechanical}} waves that propagate. along {{the interface between}} water and air; the restoring force is provided by gravity, {{and so they are}} often referred to as surface gravity waves. As the wind blows, pressure and friction perturb the equilibrium of the water surface and <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> the air to the water, forming waves. The initial formation of waves by the wind is described in the theory of Phillips from 1957, and the subsequent growth of the small waves has been modeled by Miles, also in 1957.|$|E
50|$|Heat engines, {{including}} Stirling engines, {{are sealed}} machines using pistons within cylinders to <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> a heat source to a colder reservoir, often using steam or another gas as the working substance. (See Carnot cycle.) The first illustration depicts a longitudinal {{section of a}} cylinder in a steam engine. The sliding part at the bottom is the piston, and the upper sliding part is a distribution valve (in this case of the D slide valve type) that directs steam alternately into {{either end of the}} cylinder. Refrigerator and air conditioner compressors are heat engines driven in reverse cycle as pumps.|$|E
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} mode-coupling {{theory of}} the lower-hybrid-drift instability is presented.

5000|$|Although a bypass engine {{improves}} propulsive efficiency it incurs {{losses of}} its own inside the engine itself. Machinery has {{to be added to}} <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> the gas generator to a bypass airflow. The low loss from the propelling nozzle of a turbojet is added to with extra losses due to inefficiencies in the added turbine and fan. These may be included in a transmission, or transfer, efficiency [...] However, these losses are more than made up by the improvement in propulsive efficiency. There are also extra pressure losses in the bypass duct and an extra propelling nozzle.|$|E
50|$|A {{physical}} system can {{have as many}} resonant frequencies as it has degrees of freedom; each degree of freedom can vibrate as a harmonic oscillator. Systems with one degree of freedom, such as a mass on a spring, pendulums, balance wheels, and LC tuned circuits have one resonant frequency. Systems with two degrees of freedom, such as coupled pendulums and resonant transformers can have two resonant frequencies. As the number of coupled harmonic oscillators grows, {{the time it takes}} to <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> one to the next becomes significant. The vibrations in them begin to travel through the coupled harmonic oscillators in waves, from one oscillator to the next.|$|E
50|$|The Phantom Stranger is a {{being caught}} in a time loop. Near {{the end of the}} universe, the Phantom Stranger {{approaches}} a group of scientists who are trying to <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> the Big Bang to extend the life of the universe. The Phantom Stranger realizes that one of the scientists is in reality an Avatar of Anti-life, and that their efforts will prevent the universe from ever existing. The story concludes with the Phantom Stranger passing a portion of himself to a scientist, who dives through the portal to the Big Bang, intercepts the beam that would have drained the Big Bang, and becomes the Phantom Stranger, completing the cycle.|$|E
