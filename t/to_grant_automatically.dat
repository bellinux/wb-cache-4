50|$|In late July 2014, English Premier League club West Bromwich Albion {{agreed to}} sign Gamboa {{for a fee}} {{estimated}} in the media as around £2 million. Because the player had insufficient recent international appearances for a work permit <b>to</b> be <b>granted</b> <b>automatically,</b> completion of the deal was dependent on a successful appeal to the Football Association, which was confirmed on 5 August.

50|$|The Isle of Man, {{together}} with the Channel Islands, the UK, and the Republic of Ireland form a Common Travel Area, which means there are no immigration controls imposed on those travelling inside the area.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{determination}} of split of total surplus among the negotiating parties (member countries and the acceding country) in a WTO accession negotiation using a sequential bargaining model. In particular, {{we are interested in}} the effect of the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle on the negotiation outcome. The MFN principle says that any tariff reduction offered by the applicant for accession has <b>to</b> be <b>automatically</b> <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> all existing members.

50|$|On 8 January 2015, English side Leicester City of the Premier League {{announced}} that they had agreed a deal to sign Kramarić on a three-and-a-half-year contract, confirming an earlier announcement by Rijeka. The transfer, however, was dependent on Kramarić being awarded a work permit on appeal, as he {{did not meet the}} requirements for one <b>to</b> be <b>automatically</b> <b>granted.</b> Four days after Leicester's announcement, an FA Panel recommended the approval of work permit, clearing the way for Leicester to apply to the UK Border Agency.|$|R
30|$|Obligation {{policies}} can {{be divided}} into process policies and IAM policies. IAM policies are responsible for the design and governance of the functionality of an IAM system, whereas process policies refer to rules that describe how core business processes within organizations are executed. Examples for IAM policies are the organization’s guidelines on access privilege re-certifications or provisioning policies that are used <b>to</b> <b>automatically</b> <b>grant</b> access <b>to</b> a set of resources when new employees join the company. Process policies, on the contrary, describe which permissions typically are activated together or sequentially in order to execute complete process activities.|$|R

The Supreme Court resolved complicated questions of how citizenship had been derived during the Revolutionary War. The court found that the jus soli is so consistent in American Law as <b>to</b> <b>automatically</b> <b>grant</b> American citizenship <b>to</b> children born in New York City between the Declaration of Independence and the Landing at Kip's Bay in 1776, but not to children born in New York during the British occupation that followed.|$|R

40|$|Current {{smartphone}} {{operating systems}} regulate application permissions by prompting users on an ask-on-first-use basis. Prior {{research has shown}} that this method is ineffective because it fails to account for context: the circumstances under which an application first requests access to data may be vastly different than the circumstances under which it subsequently requests access. We performed a longitudinal 131 -person field study to analyze the contextuality behind user privacy decisions to regulate access to sensitive resources. We built a classifier to make privacy decisions on the user's behalf by detecting when context has changed and, when necessary, inferring privacy preferences based on the user's past decisions and behavior. Our goal is <b>to</b> <b>automatically</b> <b>grant</b> appropriate resource requests without further user intervention, deny inappropriate requests, and only prompt the user when the system is uncertain of the user's preferences. We show that our approach can accurately predict users' privacy decisions 96. 8 % of the time, which is a four-fold reduction in error rate compared to current systems.

40|$|Evaluating the {{capacity}} of consumer loyalty programs to generate additional sales is essential for marketers who run such programs. However, customers 2 ̆ 7 self-selection into the loyalty programs makes this evaluation difficult. This is the case especially in set-ups where the reward is not <b>granted</b> <b>automatically</b> upon achieving {{a certain number of}} points. In the case of automatic rewards, marketing theory predicts that points accumulation accelerates as consumers approach the threshold of necessary points for the reward, and is also boosted after the redemption, in what is called `the rewarded behavior effect 2 ̆ 7. In this thesis I use these insights to develop two models for evaluating loyalty programs where the rewards are not <b>granted</b> <b>automatically.</b> The first model applies to programs where consumers use the accumulated points like cash, for day-to-day expenses, while the second applies to programs where consumers use the points for non-ordinary treats, which on average are much larger. I estimate the parameters of both models using data provided by AIR MILES, Canada 2 ̆ 7 s largest coalition loyalty program. I show how sample heterogeneity and the non-random timing of the reward cash-in can be confounded with true loyalty program effects and I tease apart these effects to obtain non-biased estimates of program profitability. I use the model insights to suggest ways in which AIR MILES can change the program to further boost its profitability, contingent on retailers 2 ̆ 7 contribution margins.
