5|$|In {{an attempt}} to exploit <b>the</b> <b>worn</b> surface, Yardley brought on the {{part-time}} left-arm unorthodox spin of Compton to partner Laker. The occasional bowler was inaccurate and Morris struck two fours in his first over to bring up Australia's 50 in 64 minutes. However, Compton's deceived Morris—who danced down the pitch and missed the ball—in the next over, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity with the batsman on 32 and Australia at 0/55. Laker beat Morris in the following over with an off break that spun a foot, before Compton removed Hassett for 17 with the score at 57.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fretting wear {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate {{the effects of the}} contacting shapes of spacer grid springs on <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behavior of a nuclear fuel rod in room temperature air and water. The main objective was to quantitatively compare <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behavior of <b>the</b> nuclear fuel rod with the variation of the contacting spring shapes. The variation of <b>the</b> real <b>worn</b> area in <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> scar, <b>the</b> change in <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> volume and <b>the</b> maximum <b>wear</b> depth with <b>the</b> slip amplitude were calculated and measured through an optical micrometer and surface profilometry. The results of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> tests showed that <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> volume and <b>the</b> maximum <b>wear</b> depth were sensitively affected by each spring shape with increasing slip amplitude and with a change of the test environment. From the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> scar, it is possible to separate the size of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> scar from <b>the</b> real <b>worn</b> area and <b>the</b> transferred one. In addition, we found that <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> volume has a linear relation with <b>the</b> real <b>worn</b> area rather than the size of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> scar and this was only determined by using each spring shape even though <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> tests were carried out with different conditions. From the above results, it is possible to evaluate a wear resistant spring by using the correlation between the variation of <b>the</b> real <b>worn</b> area and <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behavior at each spring shape...|$|R

Birds of the P. d. domesticus group have grey cheeks, while P. d. indicus group birds have white cheeks, as well as bright colouration on the crown, a smaller bill, and a longer black bib. The subspecies P. d. tingitanus differs little from the nominate subspecies, except in <b>the</b> <b>worn</b> breeding plumage of the male, in which the head is speckled with black and underparts are paler. P. d. balearoibericus is slightly paler than the nominate, but darker than P. d. bibilicus. P. d. bibilicus is paler than most subspecies, but has the grey cheeks of P. d. domesticus group birds. The similar P. d. persicus is paler and smaller, and P. d. niloticus is nearly identical but smaller. Of the less widespread P. d. indicus group subspecies, P. d. hyrcanus is larger than P. d. indicus, P. d. hufufae is paler, P. d. bactrianus is larger and paler, and P. d. parkini is larger and darker with more black on the breast than any other subspecies.|$|E

40|$|Wear {{modeling}} {{is essential}} to predict and improve wear re-sistance of machine parts. This article presents a fatigue wear model of plane sliding pairs under dry friction. <b>The</b> <b>wear</b> model is constructed through developing a dynamic contact model of surfaces and proposing a mean fatigue damage constant of asperities. It is simpler and more practical than existing fa-tigue wear models because it describes the quantitative relation-ship between <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> behaviors of <b>the</b> plane sliding pairs and the main factors including the load and sliding speed, mate-rial property, friction property, and surface topography of the pairs. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> model can predict <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> of each component of the sliding pairs. Reasonability and appli-cability of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> model are validated via pin-on-disc <b>wear</b> tests. <b>The</b> <b>wear</b> model is applicable to predict <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> of <b>the</b> plane sliding pairs, which is characterized by friction fatigue of contact surfaces. <b>The</b> <b>wear</b> model {{can also be used}} to guide the tribological design of sliding pairs in machinery...|$|R

25|$|After the Continuation War {{ended with}} Moscow Armistice Allied Control Commission demanded that all coastal guns larger than 120mm in calibre east of Porkkala {{had to be}} removed and placed in storage. This {{included}} the coastal fortifications around Porkkala, fortifications of the capital Helsinki (18 152mm guns) and the Kotka-Hamina area forts (17 152/45 C guns). This restriction was lifted in 1947 after signing of the Paris Peace Treaty. 152/45 C guns were badly worn out after the war, and several had cracked or broken barrels. An investigation of the barrel failures concluded that the guns could not withstand the pressures created by the gunpowder used. This led to a development of a new light weight high explosive shell which could be fired by a half-charge of gunpowder. <b>The</b> <b>worn</b> out gun barrels were replaced with newly developed 50 caliber 152 50 Tampella barrels.|$|E

A new mathematical method is issued for determining wear volumes in this study.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>wear</b> {{behavior}} of a forged Co- 29 Cr- 6 Mo alloy without any Ni and C added has been investigated by using a tribosystem consisting of a pin-on-disc type wear testing machine in distilled water containing different dissolved oxygen content. Dissolved oxygen content in the distilled water was controlled by aerating with oxygen or by deaerating with argon. <b>Wear</b> volume in <b>the</b> distilled water containing high oxygen content is approximately two times larger than in that containing low oxygen content. Accordingly, it is deduced that <b>the</b> overall <b>wear</b> volume is significantly affected by the dissolved oxygen content in the distilled water surrounding the tribosystem. Although abrasive wear, caused by wear debris, is operative as a <b>wear</b> mechanism in <b>the</b> present tribosystem irrespective of oxygen content, the transfer of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> debris to sliding surfaces, {{as well as the}} aggregation of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> debris on <b>the</b> sliding surfaces, is more prone to occur during <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> process with <b>the</b> lower oxygen content. Therefore, in the present tribosystem with the lower oxygen content, since the transfer of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> debris to <b>the</b> disc or the pin readily occurs, the generation of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> debris does not directly contribute to <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> volume, leading to <b>the</b> apparently lower <b>wear</b> volume in <b>the</b> tribosystem with lower oxygen content than in that with higher oxygen content; the transfer of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> debris is not counted as <b>wear</b> loss because <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> volume is estimated based on the loss in disc and pin weight that occurs during <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> test.
