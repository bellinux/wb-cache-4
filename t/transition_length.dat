40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for improving the}} numerical prediction of bypass transition heat transfer on a flat plate in a high-disturbance environment with zero or favorable pressure gradient. The method utilizes low Reynolds number k-epsilon turbulence models {{in combination with the}} characteristic parameters of the transition region. The parameters representing the characteristics of the transition region used are the intermittency, <b>transition</b> <b>length</b> and turbulent spot properties. An analysis is made of the <b>transition</b> <b>length</b> in terms of turbulent spot variables. The nondimensional spot formation rate, required for the prediction of the <b>transition</b> <b>length,</b> is shown by the analysis to be a function of the spot spreading angle, the dimensionless spot velocity ratio and the dimensionless spot area ratio. The intermittency form of the k-epsilon equations were derived from conditionally averaged equations which {{have been shown to be}} an improvement over global-time-averaged equations for the numerical calculation of the transition region. The numerical predictions are in general good agreement with the experimental data and indicate the potential use of the method in accelerating flows. Turbulence models of the k-epsilon type are known to underpredict the <b>transition</b> <b>length.</b> The present work demonstrates how incorporating transition region characteristics improves the ability of two-equation turbulence models to simulate bypass transition for flat plates with potential application to turbine vanes and blades...|$|E
40|$|Based on a Navier-Stokes approach, {{the flow}} around a lamiar airfoil is {{described}} together with transition prediction {{based on the}} e*-method. The main {{emphasis is placed on}} the computation of the transitional flow region, i. e. the range between fully laminar and fully turbulent flow. The extension and intermittency of the transition region are predicted on the basis of available models originating from the turbulent spot theory. A comprehensive computational study is performed as the <b>transition</b> <b>length</b> differs considerably depending on the model used. The influence of the <b>transition</b> <b>length,</b> varying from zero to 20 per cent chord, is investigated in a strong adverse and in a zero pressure gradient airfoil flow region. Based on the outcome of the study a conventional <b>transition</b> <b>length</b> model is proposed, which is applicable in flow regions where transition is predicted well upstream of the laminar separation location. Furthermore, a special <b>transition</b> <b>length</b> model is given, typically for low Reynolds number flows, where the boundary layer stays laminar up to separation. In this case transition is fixed right upstream of the laminar separation point, as the problem of laminar separation bubbles is not considered in the present context. The present investigation concerns the flow over the DoAL 3 laminar airfoil at 2 ° incidence. For that particular case, the e*-method predicts transition at 8 per cent chord on the upper surface. Along the lower surface, the computed N-factors are lower than the limiting N-factor up to laminar flow separation...|$|E

The deviation of the cubic parabola from the other curves for large values of Χ, ratios Χ/Α[*]>[*] 0.7, as well as the affinity of the clothoid with the SPTC are obvious. The most remarkable observation than can be made in the table is the fact that ΔΧ always zero for the SPTC (10 terms). Thus, the SPTC curve is symmetrically projected on its basic tangent. This property contributes to the simplicity of the alignment design. That is another reason to prefer the SPTC curve.|$|R

40|$|The {{capability}} of two k-epsilon low-Reynolds number (LRN) turbulence models, those of Jones and Launder (1972) and Lam and Bremhorst (1981), to predict transition in external boundary-layer flows subject to free-stream turbulence is analyzed. Both models correctly predict the basic qualitative aspects of boundary-layer transition with free stream turbulence, but for calculations started at low values of certain defined Reynolds numbers, {{the transition is}} generally predicted at unrealistically early locations. Also, the methods predict <b>transition</b> <b>lengths</b> significantly shorter than those found experimentally. An approach to overcoming these deficiencies without abandoning the basic LRN k-epsilon framework is developed. This approach limits the production term in the turbulent kinetic energy equation {{and is based on}} a simple stability criterion. It is correlated to the free-stream turbulence value. The modification is shown to improve the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the transition predictions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a Mach number {{correction}} on a model for predicting the length of transition was investigated. The <b>transition</b> <b>length</b> decreases as the turbulent spot production rate increases. Much of the data for predicting the spot production rate comes from low speed flow experiments. Recent data and analysis showed that the spot production rate is affected by Mach number. The degree of agreement between analysis and data for turbine blade heat transfer without film cooling is strongly dependent of accurately predicting the length of transition. Consequently, turbine blade heat transfer data sets were used to validate a <b>transition</b> <b>length</b> turbulence model.

Straight jaws in traditional stretch forming machines are replaced {{by a pair of}} opposed clamping mechanisms movable relative to each other during the forming process. In the present study, a wave-like surface part was selected as the study object, and the forming processes of traditional stretch forming and multi-gripper flexible stretch forming were performed using a commercially available finite element analysis software to show their influences on conformability of sheet metal. In addition, three levels of transition lengths in multi-gripper flexible stretch forming were chosen to investigate their influence on forming results. The simulation results show that multi-gripper flexible stretch forming would result in an easier conformability of sheet metal than traditional stretch forming. It is also found that the sheet metal can be formed without a <b>transition</b> <b>length,</b> which could significantly improve the material utilization.

In this paper it is shown that the density transition from vacuum to plasma {{can play an important}} role in the trapping process. The plasma wavelength in this transition region changes continuously, which means that the injected electrons see an altering wakefield. This can result in strong defocusing of the injected bunch. It is found that the effect becomes stronger for stronger wakefields, longer <b>transition</b> <b>lengths,</b> and lower injection energies. The transition region can be avoided if the bunch is injected into the wakefield at an angle. Injecting the bunch at an angle allows the bunch to be wider and results in more charge being trapped.

However, referring to cubic parabola calculations, for a ratio X/A[*]≥[*] 0.5 and taking in to account the approximate calculation procedure of ΔR it can lead to alignment design errors. Consequently, the usage limits for each transition curve should be well known. A new transition curve was also proposed in this work. The new curve is called Symmetrically Projected Transition Curve (SPTC). SPTC was found, in most cases, to have better performance than cubic parabola. Symmetry is an important characteristic of the SPTC and contributes to simplicity, accuracy and audit ability of the designed alignment. Finally SPTC can also be used as a transition curve between two adjacent circular arcs in the same direction.|$|R

The simulations are executed on six benchmark problems for the MJ model proposed by Faisca and Plaxco [7] and ten well-known benchmark problems for the HP model devised by Beutler and Dill [2]. The unfolding procedure utilizes the pull-move set as a neighbourhood relation and a new population-based search method.

40|$|Convectively {{unstable}} flows {{behave as}} amplifiers, and their laminar region {{can be extended}} by lowering the level of external disturbances. At first sight, complete laminarization appears possible in principle. However, it was sometimes {{pointed out in the}} past (e. g. Betchov 1961) that the velocity fluctuations associated with molecular agitation (those responsible of thermal noise and Brownian motion) in a fluid are 80 to 100 dB below the level of turbulent fluctuations, and thus of the order of magnitude required to provoke transition. Nevertheless, quantitative receptivity calculations have only ever been applied to external disturbances of acoustic or vortical origin or due to surface roughness, omitting thermal noise. Here the amplification of thermal noise by a boundary layer is explicitly computed, confirming that transition can be induced in this way. Therefore, even in a perfect environment with zero disturbances the extent of laminar flow is bounded.
