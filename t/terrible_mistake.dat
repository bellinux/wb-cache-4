5|$|It now {{dawned on}} the Privy Council {{that it had}} made a <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake.</b> Led by the Earl of Arundel and the Earl of Pembroke, on 19 July the Council {{publicly}} proclaimed Mary as queen; Jane's nine-day reign came to an end. The proclamation triggered wild rejoicing throughout London. Stranded in Cambridge, Northumberland proclaimed Mary himself—as he had been commanded to do by {{a letter from the}} Council. William Paget and the Earl of Arundel rode to Framlingham to beg Mary's pardon, and Arundel arrested Northumberland on 24 July. Northumberland was beheaded on 22 August, shortly after renouncing Protestantism. His recantation dismayed his daughter-in-law, Jane, who followed him to the scaffold on 12 February 1554, after her father's involvement in Wyatt's rebellion.|$|E
25|$|When Ulysses was {{stationed}} on the West coast of California at Fort Humboldt in 1854 {{he had at}} that point been away from his wife and family two years. Longing to return home, and also prompted by rumors of excessive drinking, Ulysses tendered his resignation. Shocked by the news, Jesse intervened, feeling Ulysses was making a <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake,</b> and urged Congressmen Andrew Ellison, and old friend of Jesse's, to get the War Department to order Grant home on recruitment duty instead, or otherwise grant him a six-month leave. Ellison presented the request to Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, but the request was denied. This {{would prove to be}} one more example of Jesse's involvement with his son's affairs.|$|E
25|$|At 11:10 the Light Brigade {{began their}} advance towards the Russians guns over a mile (~ 2km) away. When {{the first line}} was clear of the second, the order was given to 'Trot'. Initially {{there was nothing to}} {{indicate}} that Cardigan was not going to conform to Raglan's intentions, and it was only after he had travelled some 200 yards (~180 m) that the enormity of the misconstrued order became apparent to the spectators on the Sapouné Heights. Instead of inclining to the right towards the redoubts on the Causeway Heights and the captured British guns, the Light Brigade continued towards Obolensky's battery {{at the end of the}} valley. But it was too late to do anything. Nolan was the first to be killed when he dashed forward ahead of Cardigan, either in an effort to force the pace, or, suddenly realising the <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake</b> that was being made (and his part in it), in an attempt to change the direction of the brigade towards Raglan's intended objective. Whatever the reason, Nolan was hit by a splinter from a shell fired from one of the guns positioned on the Fedioukine Heights.|$|E

5000|$|The Party is a 1968 American comedy film {{directed}} by Blake Edwards, starring Peter Sellers and Claudine Longet. The film {{has a very}} loose structure, and essentially serves {{as a series of}} setpieces for Sellers's improvisational comedy talents.

500|$|Streep's {{first feature}} film role came {{opposite}} Jane Fonda in the 1977 film Julia, {{in which she}} had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress: [...] "I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene I shot with Jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene.

A compelling writer and a meticulous researcher, Tripathi’s work is both gripping and comprehensive.

500|$|The new {{publisher}} scrapped Vanderbilt's editorial policy, {{and began}} a campaign against vice. The Los Angeles police chief, James E.

[...] After Boddy began a crusade against crime and corruption, he weathered harassment by police and politicians, circulation rose, and the paper was soon showing a profit. Boddy also streamlined operations and stabilized the paper's management. During the first six years of Boddy's ownership, the Daily News maintained a conservative editorial policy. By 1932, Boddy had dropped the word [...] "Illustrated" [...] from the name of the paper. He was a personal supporter of Herbert Hoover's bid for reelection. Los Angeles newspaper owners met and decided that, with all newspaper owners supporting Hoover, one paper had to support Democratic candidate and New York governor Franklin Roosevelt, and Boddy and the Daily News volunteered for the job. The day after the election, which saw Roosevelt elected, Boddy turned to his city editor and said of the voters: [...] "They have made a <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake.</b> I helped them do it.

40|$|People {{often make}} <b>terrible</b> <b>mistakes</b> when {{addressing}} email messages. One type of costly mistake is an email leak, i. e., accidentally {{sending a message}} to an unintended recipient — a widespread problem that can severely harm individuals and corporations. An-other type of addressing error is forgetting to add an intended collaborator as recipient, a likely source of costly misunderstandings and communication delays. Several methods to address these problems have been recently proposed in the literature [2, 3]. In this pa-per we describe the implementation of some of these methods in a popular email client (Mozilla Thunder-bird), and conduct a 4 -week long user study based on this implementation. Results showed that more than 15 % of the human subjects reported that the client prevented real cases of email leaks, and more than 47 % of them utilized the provided recipient recommenda-tions. Overall the study shows that methods to prevent email addressing mistakes can be valuable additions to email communication, with more than 80 % of the subjects reporting that they would permanently use these methods if a few interface/optimization changes were included in our Thunderbird implementation...|$|R
