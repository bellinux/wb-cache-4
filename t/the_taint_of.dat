He would later draw on his own life at this time for his {{portrayal}} of Protosov in Tolstoy's The Living Corpse. Over the next few years he had numerous love affairs, and was prevented from a love marriage with one Esther Raizel because his own dubious reputation compounded <b>the</b> <b>taint</b> <b>of</b> his mother's divorce.

Landing on grass, she survives and decides to hunt him down and kill him in order to rid herself of his threat and her fears.|$|E

500|$|To {{the wider}} public, who knew little of his legal work, Hand was by then a folk hero. Social {{scientist}} Marvin Schick {{has pointed out}} that this mythic status is a paradox. Because Hand never served on the Supreme Court, the majority of his cases were routine and his judgments rooted in precedent. On Hand's retirement in 1951, Felix Frankfurter predicted that his [...] "actual decisions will be all deader than the Dodo before long, as at least many of them are already". Working for a lower court, however, saved Hand from <b>the</b> <b>taint</b> <b>of</b> political influence that often hung over the Supreme Court. Hand's eloquence as a writer played a larger part in the spread of his influence than the substance of his decisions; and Schick believes that the Hand myth brushes over contradictions in his legal philosophy. Hand's reputation as a libertarian obscures {{the fact that he was}} cautious as a judge. Though a liberal, he argued for judicial restraint in interpreting the Constitution, and regarded the advancement of civil liberties as a task for the legislature, not the courts. In his 1958 Holmes Lectures, for example, he voiced doubts about the constitutionality of the Warren Court's civil rights rulings. This philosophy of judicial restraint failed to influence the decisions of the Supreme Court during Hand's lifetime and afterwards.|$|E

The remaining traces of <b>the</b> <b>taint</b> <b>of</b> servility gradually faded, and the [...] "fiefs for service" [...] turned into proper hereditable fiefs, partly also because impoverished free nobles, while reserving their personal free status, voluntarily became ministeriales.|$|E
