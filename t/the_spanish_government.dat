Meanwhile, Alacán's father, a sailor, led a party of volunteers that tried to apprehend the pirate Roberto Cofresí y Ramírez de Arellano in 1824 and did arrest some of Cofresí's crew, {{for which he was}} honored by <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government</b> {{decided to}} upgrade its fleet of AMX-30Es {{in the late}} 1980s. The focus on {{upgrading}} Spain's AMX-30E's distracted attention from the Lince plan, which was eventually shelved in 1990 after Spain acquired {{a large number of}} M60 Patton tanks, which were no longer required by the U.S., in accordance with the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. These tanks replaced the M47s and M48s, and fulfilled Spain's need to modernize its tank forces in the short term. No prototype of the planned Lince tank was manufactured, and no announcements were made on who would receive the contract. Four years later <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government</b> procured and locally manufactured the Leopard 2, fulfilling the long-term modernisation goal established in the Lince programme.|$|E
5|$|The {{complaint}} to Turkey had a desired effect locally, with an apology from the country's {{government and a}} commitment to breaking diplomatic ties to Germany if required. However, it failed to elicit a response from Germany. The Allies' request to <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government</b> was relayed to the Germans, but identified almost immediately as deception and misdirection.|$|E

5|$|The last use {{of capital}} {{punishment}} in Spain took place on 27 September 1975 when {{two members of the}} armed Basque nationalist and separatist group ETA political-military and three members of the Revolutionary Antifascist Patriotic Front (FRAP) were shot dead by firing squads after having been convicted and sentenced to death by military tribunals for the murder of policemen and civil guards. Spain was Western Europe's only dictatorship at the time and had been unpopular and internationally isolated in the post-war period due to its relations with Nazi Germany in the 1930s {{and the fact that the}} authoritarian Spanish leader, Francisco Franco, had come to power by overthrowing a democratically elected government. As a result, the executions resulted in substantial criticism of <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government,</b> both domestically and abroad. Reactions included street protests, attacks on Spanish embassies, international criticism of <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government</b> and diplomatic measures, such as the withdrawal of the ambassadors of fifteen European countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{sentences}} provoked international {{criticism and}} protests against <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government.</b> Large demonstrations {{took place in}} Italy, Stockholm and Oslo, with the Swedish Prime Minister, Olof Palme, heading the Swedish demonstration. The Dutch foreign minister made a formal protest to the Spanish Ambassador. The Spanish Embassy in Lisbon was attacked and set on fire. The Spanish embassy in Switzerland was occupied for 2 hours by protesters. President of Mexico, Luis Echeverría, called for Spanish membership of the United Nations Security Council to be suspended, but this was vetoed by the US, who considered it an internal Spanish matter. Pope Paul VI asked <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government</b> to grant clemency to the condemned at his Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square, though he also condemned the crimes that the condemned were convicted of. Franco's brother, Nicolás Franco, joined calls for clemency, appealing to Franco's Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to Mercedes Barbudo, the Spanish {{authorities}} in Puerto Rico under Governor Miguel de la Torre, were {{suspicious of the}} correspondence {{between her and the}} rebel factions of Venezuela. Secret agents of <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>Government</b> had retained some of her mail and delivered it to Governor de la Torre. He ordered an investigation and had her mail confiscated. The Government believed that the correspondence served as propaganda of the Bolivian ideals and that it would also serve to motivate Puerto Ricans to seek their independence. Governor Miguel de la Torre ordered her arrest on the charge that she planned to overthrow <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>Government</b> in Puerto Rico. Since Puerto Rico did not have a women's prison she was held without bail at the Castillo San Cristóbal. Among the evidence which the Spanish authorities presented against her was Rojas letter. She was exiled to Cuba where she was able to escape and make her way to Venezuela where she spent her final days.|$|E

5|$|Eva {{was well}} {{received}} in Spain, where she visited the tombs of Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in the Capilla Real de Granada. Francoist Spain had not {{recovered from the}} Spanish Civil War (the autarkic economy and the UN embargo meant that the country could not feed its people). During her visit to Spain, Eva handed out 100-peseta notes to many poor children she met on her journey. She also received from Franco the highest award given by <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government,</b> the Order of Isabella the Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the authoritarian {{government}} in Portugal in 1974, <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government</b> was the sole surviving dictatorship in Western Europe, where several countries in 1975 were ruled by socialist parties which had long loathed Franco for coming to power by overthrowing a socialist democracy. Hostility to the use of capital punishment was widespread in Western Europe at this time and most Western European countries had ceased using it.|$|E
5|$|France had {{threatened}} to invade the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo. In 1808, the Spanish Crown sent their Navy, {{under the command of}} Puerto Rican Captain Ramón Power y Giralt, to prevent the invasion of Santo Domingo by the French by enforcing a blockade. Col. Rafael Conti organized a military expedition with the intention of defending the Dominican Republic. They were successful and were proclaimed as heroes by <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>Government.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1985 Sinclair {{developed}} the ZX Spectrum 128 (code-named Derby) {{in conjunction with}} their Spanish distributor Investrónica. Investrónica had helped adapt the ZX Spectrum+ to the Spanish market after <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government</b> introduced a special tax on all computers with 64KB RAM or less, and a law which obliged all computers sold in Spain to support the Spanish alphabet and show messages in Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government</b> {{decided to}} sign a {{contract}} with the French company GIAT to begin production of the AMX-30. However, it was not the advantages of the French vehicle itself that influenced the decision. Rather, it was the UK's unwillingness to sell their L7 tank-gun, the low cost of the AMX-30, and the French offer to allow Spain to manufacture the tank, that led the Spanish Army to favor the French armored vehicle.|$|E
5|$|It must {{be taken}} into account that Soviet T-26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>Government</b> during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
2500|$|Viceroy Alencastre {{suggested}} that Spain permit private Spanish merchant ships to sail between the Pacific ports of Acapulco and Callao. [...] In Acapulco, they {{could pick up}} Asian goods shipped on <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government's</b> Manila galleons, and they could also purchase European goods shipped on <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government's</b> Atlantic fleet to Veracruz and brought across Mexico. Alencastre pointed out that banning <b>Spanish</b> merchants in <b>the</b> Americas from trading between Acapulco (New Spain) and Callao (Peru) was simply making French merchants wealthy.|$|R

5|$|Since the {{existing}} tank fleet {{did not meet}} the Spanish army's needs, Spain opened talks with Germany and Krauss-Maffei over the possibility of future collaboration in regards to Spain's future tank, and sent a military delegation to Germany in 1994. Although the Germans offered Spain surplus Leopard 1 tanks and Soviet equipment incorporated into the German army after the reunification of Germany, <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government</b> declined these offers and pressed for the Leopard 2.|$|E
5|$|Spanish EAV-8Bs joined Operation Deny Flight, {{enforcing}} the UN's no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Spain did not send its aircraft carrier {{to participate in}} the Iraq War in 2003, instead deploying F/A-18s and other aircraft to Turkey to defend that country against potential Iraqi attacks. Starting in 2007, Spain was looking to replace its Harrier IIs–with the likely option being the F-35B. <b>The</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government,</b> in May 2014 however, announced that it had decided to extend the aircraft's service life to beyond 2025 {{due to a lack of}} funds for a replacement aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish forces {{expected}} the Americans {{to attack the}} northern region of the island and concentrated their defenses around San Juan and Arecibo. <b>The</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government</b> was also aware of a planned landing by the Americans at Fajardo, located {{on the east coast}} and had that town fortified. However, the southern and western regions of Puerto Rico were left with little or no defenses at all.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of Hurricane Beta, the U.S. {{ambassador}} to Nicaragua signed a disaster declaration on October28, prompting the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to send aid. Before the storm hit, $200,000 {{was sent to}} the country for emergency relief supply distribution and helicopter fuel. On November1, USAID and OFDA airlifted 200 rolls of plastic sheeting, 5,020 ten-litre water containers, and 2,736 hygiene kits, valued at $120,877. Another $22,000 was used to supply an aircraft and Bell 204/205 helicopter to assist affected areas. On November10, another $100,000 was sent for sanitation and health activities. The United Nations sent $10,000 to the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region to cover emergency needs. Forty-five tents were sent to communities in need. <b>The</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>Government</b> also sent $377,188 in aid and to Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|Angola {{agreed to}} trade oil to Slovakia {{in return for}} arms, buying six Sukhoi Su-17 attack {{aircraft}} on 3 April 2000. <b>The</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government</b> in the Canary Islands prevented a Ukrainian freighter from delivering 636tons of military equipment to Angola on 24 February 2001. The captain of the ship had inaccurately reported his cargo, falsely claiming the ship carried automobile parts. The Angolan government admitted Simportex had purchased arms from Rosvooruzhenie, the Russian state-owned arms company, and acknowledged the captain might have violated Spanish law by misreporting his cargo, a common practice in arms smuggling to Angola.|$|E
5|$|As the Monbar {{case and}} similar cases came to light, the GAL issue became {{increasingly}} controversial in the 1990s, with questions over whether members of <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>government</b> and state security service {{had known about}} the group's operations in places like Bayonne and, if so, to what extent they had supported and funded the attacks. This became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general election with Spanish Interior Minister, José Barrionuevo, and his security chief, Rafael Vera, implicated in the GAL case. In 1998, both were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and {{misappropriation of public funds}} to finance the GAL. Along with various corruption scandals and the poor state of the Spanish economy in the mid-1990s, the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the PSOE defeat.|$|E
