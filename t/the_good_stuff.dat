500|$|Each {{song was}} {{separately}} recorded, mixed and produced at various studios in the UK and North America. The album {{was written on}} tour, during periods {{of a couple of}} hours in between concerts, a studio was booked and the recording process begun, resulting in a sound with spontaneity and urgency through necessity. Bassist John Paul Jones recalled that [...] "We were touring a lot. Jimmy 's riffs were coming fast and furious. A lot of them came from onstage especially during the long improvised section of 'Dazed and Confused'. We'd remember <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>stuff</b> and dart into a studio along the way." ...|$|E

The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said [...] "In punk, <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>stuff</b> actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets." [...] The singles released from Insomniac were [...] "Geek Stink Breath", [...] "Stuck with Me", [...] "Brain Stew/Jaded", and [...] "Walking Contradiction".|$|E

500|$|Even some staunch traditionalists {{from both}} the urban and rural folk music {{communities}} had an affinity for the Kingstons' polished commercial versions of older songs. In her memoir And A Voice To Sing With, singer and activist Joan Baez recalled that [...] "Traveling across the country {{with my mother and}} sisters, we heard the commercial songs of the budding folk boom for the first time, the Kingston Trio's 'Tom Dooley' and 'Scotch and Soda.' Before I turned into a snob and learned to look down upon all commercial folk music as bastardized and unholy, I loved the Kingston Trio. When I became one of the leading practitioners of 'pure folk,' I still loved them..." [...] Arthel [...] "Doc" [...] Watson of North Carolina, {{one of the most respected}} and influential musicians performing traditional music, remarked, [...] "I’ll tell you who pointed all our noses in the right direction, even the traditional performers. They got us interested in trying to put <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>stuff</b> out there—the Kingston Trio. They got me interested in it!" ...|$|E
500|$|Jet Force Gemini was {{developed}} by Rare's Blast Corps team. Work on the game began in 1997 with lead engineer Paul Mountain, who had previously worked on Diddy Kong Racing. The inspirations of the game ranged from 80s arcade classics to more recent titles of the time. The free-roaming nature of Nintendo's Super Mario 64 influenced the scale and the openness {{of some of the}} backgrounds and settings, while the collecting and upgrading of weapons were inspired by Super Metroid. Mountain revealed that [...] "the behaviour of the bad guys was a mixture of arcade space shooter formations and Quake-style 'attack and cover' mechanics". According to him, [...] "I suppose, in short, we were inspired by all <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>stuff</b> we'd played and enjoyed playing." [...] Jet Force Gemini also borrowed elements from non-video game sources. Lead artist Lee Musgrave admitted, [...] "There are elements of Star Wars in there, Aliens, Dune, Battle of the Planets, even Stargate – it was a real mix of everything and anything 'space' related." ...|$|E
500|$|Greg Beeman, who {{directed}} the episode, spoke about Remi Aubuchon's hiring. He said that Remi had [...] "a lot of {{ideas about how to}} keep <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>stuff</b> we’d established in Season 1", and [...] "diminish the things that weren’t as strong". Steven Spielberg's original conception of Falling Skies was that the characters in the series would be nomadic. The idea for the second season was to [...] "create a mobile refugee camp made up of vehicles and rag-tag tents." [...] Chris Faloona, who was the Director of Photography in the first season, was unable to return due to commitments on another series, and Nate Goodman was hired. Aubuchon and Beeman discussed what was a head for the characters this season, and soon after, Beeman called Connor Jessup, who plays Ben Mason, and said [...] "I’ve just heard what the plans are for you for this season. [...] And my strong advice is that you get a trainer and start eating your Wheaties! [...] You are in a HUGE storyline is going to revolve around you… [...] You’re a warrior, you’re a skitter killer and you’re a badass!" [...] Jessup hired a trainer that very day.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the episode displayed The Simpsons [...] "at its best – not only hilarious but daringly outspoken on {{a whole range of}} issues – the failures of the education system, police abuses of power, the stifling of children's creativity." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "Separate Vocations" [...] represent The Simpsons [...] "at its apex as a well tuned talent machine grinding out <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>stuff</b> with surprising accuracy and skill." [...] Gibron added that the episode shows that [...] "even in territory they're not used to (Bart as a safety patrol, Lisa as a cursing class cut up), the Simpsons' kids are funny and inventive." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a four out of five rating and commented that the script's [...] "departure from the traditional roles assigned to Bart and Lisa makes for a fresh experience with many laughs." [...] Meyers thought the highlight of the episode was Bart's ride in the police car. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the theme of the episode was unoriginal, but commented that Bart's [...] "rapid embrace of fascism" [...] and Lisa's [...] "descent into hooliganism" [...] provide [...] "a number of funny opportunities, and 'Separate Vocations' exploits them well. Though it’s not one of the year’s best shows, it seems like a good one for the most part." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "just about perfect", writing: [...] "this {{was one of}} those high-energy episodes that narrowed its song focus [...] and found a just-right mix of cynicism and optimism, of banal reality and glam performance." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal commented: [...] "It's been a long premiere season of ups and downs, and this last show is a warm embrace that — let’s face it — you just don't want to let go." [...] The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson deemed the episode [...] "awesome", observing: [...] "While it was light on the usual humor, it was heavy on emotion, and I think that's ideal for a season finale. Glee ended its freshman season with a real wallop that took a couple of unexpected turns before pulling nicely into a satisfying finish." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "A-", deeming it among the best of the entire season. He felt that: [...] "On its own, 'Journey to Regionals' is a fantastic episode of Glee. As a capper to the season, it mostly works." [...] While VanDerWerff had some issues with the episode, including Shelby's sudden decision to adopt Beth, he summarized that: [...] "for once in this back nine, <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>stuff</b> absolutely overwhelms the stupid stuff." [...] Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News felt that: [...] "Glee wrapped up on a high note, leaving some of the season's less-appealing plotlines behind and heading towards the promise of more performances and more amazing Sue Sylvester one-liners next season." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. It {{was named the}} eighth best episode of The Simpsons by Sarah Culp of The Quindecim. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "Bart the Lover" [...] represent The Simpsons [...] "at its apex as a well tuned talent machine grinding out <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>stuff</b> with surprising accuracy and skill." [...] Gibron added that the episode shows that the made-up romance between Mrs. Krabappel and Woodrow [...] "works because it's so painfully true. [...] How the kiss-off to Mrs. Krabappel is created and handled shows that The Simpsons has heart to add to its humor." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 5/5 rating. He thought the intertwining of the two plots in the episode [...] "works very well, creating a fast paced story. Bart's alias, Woodrow, is a delight to hear in voice-overs and Homer's antics produce many laughs." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said [...] "Bart the Lover" [...] stands out as a [...] "very strong episode" [...] because it [...] "steers clear of most potentially sappy material and offers a lively piece. [...] The 'B' story in which Homer tries not to swear also swings and creates some great moments." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said they [...] "loved" [...] Homer's suggestion for the [...] letter from Woodrow: [...] "Dear Baby. Welcome to Dumpsville, population: you. P.S. I am gay." [...] In 2000, {{the staff of the}} Star Tribune listed their top ten episodes. [...] "Bart the Lover" [...] was listed at number four.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson's next solo album, The Long Weekend, {{appeared}} in March 1998 as a 2× CD. McFarlane noted the album had [...] "22 excellent tracks, [...] drew on blues, gospel and country elements". In May Wilson supported Kelly at the Metro in Melbourne where Wilson was [...] "crashing through a slightly hollow mix {{with a bunch}} of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>stuff,</b> picking the eyes out of his recent Long Weekend thing, and throwing in some older selections – the 'best done by Elvis' Mystery Train being a big blow, as is the pump action 'Shoot Out at Seven Eleven', while the big ballady 'Too Many Hearts' again is a glory and must be a single, surely". At the ARIA Awards that year he received another nomination as Best Male Artist, for The Long Weekend. In November he appeared at the Mushroom 25 Concert both as a solo artist and in Wilson Diesel.|$|E

40|$|We review incentive-centered {{design for}} user-contributed content (UCC) on the Internet. UCC systems, {{produced}} (in part) through voluntary contributions made by non-employees, face fundamental incentives problems. In particular, to succeed, users {{need to be}} motivated to contribute {{in the first place}} ("getting stuff in"). Further, given heterogeneity in content quality and variety, the degree of success will depend on incentives to contribute a desirable mix of quality and variety ("getting <b>good</b> <b>stuff</b> in"). Third, because UCC systems generally function as open-access publishing platforms, {{there is a need to}} prevent or reduce the amount of negative value (polluting or manipulating) content. The work to date on incentives problems facing UCC is limited and uneven in coverage. Much of the empirical research concerns specific settings and does not provide readily generalizable results. And, although there are well-developed theoretical literatures on, for example, the private provision of public <b>goods</b> (<b>the</b> "getting <b>stuff</b> in" problem), this literature is only applicable to UCC in a limited way because it focuses on contributions of (homogeneous) money, and thus does not address the many problems associated with heterogeneous information content contributions (<b>the</b> "getting <b>good</b> <b>stuff</b> in" problem). We believe that our review of the literature has identified more open questions for research than it has pointed to known results...|$|R
