25|$|In 1808 Southey met Walter Savage Landor, {{whose work}} he admired, {{and they became}} close friends. That same year he wrote Letters from England under the {{pseudonym}} Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella, an account of a tour supposedly from a foreigner's viewpoint. Through the mouth of his pseudonym Southey is critical of the disparity between <b>the</b> <b>haves</b> and have-nots in English society, arguing that a change in taxation policy {{would be needed to}} foster a greater degree of equity.|$|E
25|$|Trade {{dramatically}} altered Duala society. European goods became status symbols, {{and some}} rulers appointed Western traders and missionaries as advisors. A {{high proportion of}} Duala grew wealthy through the new trade, and tensions arose between <b>the</b> <b>haves</b> and have-nots. Competition escalated between coastal groups and even between related settlements. Traders exploited this atmosphere, and beginning in 1860, German, French, and Spanish merchants had established contacts and weakened the British monopoly. The Duala had gained a virtual hegemony over trade through the Wouri estuary.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for the Chicago Tribune, Monáe {{said that she was}} inspired by the quote [...] "The mediator between the hand and the mind is always the heart" [...] for the record. She discussed her incorporation of the android as a metaphor for a minority, whilst being the role of the story's protagonist also. In {{an interview}} for Blues & Soul, Monáe said [...] "she represents the MEDIATOR between <b>the</b> <b>haves</b> and the have-nots, the minority and the majority. So in that way she’s very similar to Neo, the Archangel from The Matrix. And basically her return will mean freedom for the android community".|$|E

500|$|Former {{legislator}} Albert Cheng {{noted that}} had Bokhary been charged under the Police Ordinance, {{and not the}} Offences Against the Person Ordinance, she would have faced a custodial sentence of up to two years; furthermore, the police failed to charge Bokhary for allegedly assaulting a policewoman {{at the police station}} after her arrest; the police also prosecuted her for careless driving instead of the more serious offence of dangerous driving. Cheng said: [...] "The public certainly has the right to voice its anger against any injustice. But, in this case, its targets shouldn't be the government or the courts, but Secretary for Justice Wong Yan-lung, who is responsible for prosecutions and all government legal matters." [...] Legislator and former Secretary for Security, Regina Ip, said: [...] "At the end of the day, the sense of outrage is not about justice and penalties, but about the widening inequality between rich and poor, between the corporate giant and the artless individual, and the yawning asymmetry of money, knowledge and expert power between <b>the</b> <b>haves</b> and have-nots of our society." [...] Political commentator Michael Chugani agreed that public anger existed due to the belief that Hong Kong society had become too unfair, and that the verdict was confirmation to some of this view. He said that the public outrage responsible for forcing the Department of Justice to appeal against Bokhary's sentence was unlikely to result in a happy ending because both outcomes were potentially damaging: the jailing of Bokhary would imply the judicial system had succumbed to public pressure; if she was not jailed, the system would be tarnished by accusations of favouritism.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1930s, when Rowland Brown {{enjoyed his}} [...] "fifteen minutes of fame." [...] the {{atmosphere}} {{had changed in}} a number of important ways. The movie industry was subdued by the establishment of regulatory laws, the rise of unions and guilds, and increasing enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code. The Production Code brought censorship and restriction of content in a time of turmoil that challenged the foundations of American society. The stock market had crashed, taking the roar out of the Twenties, causing widespread unemployment and widening the gap between <b>the</b> <b>Haves</b> and Have-nots.|$|E

In the 21st century, some public school systems are working on an approach for affirmative action that deals with family income rather than race, recognizing that some minority members have been very successful. The Times also indicated that Jackson was being criticized as too involved with middle-class blacks, and for having an unattainable goal of racial unity.|$|E

His administration further claimed that the tax reforms undertaken, including the comprehensive property tax cut was not to benefit the wealthy and <b>the</b> <b>haves,</b> but to correct a wrongful tax according to the market principle. Lee also had to face corruption charges leveled at his administration. [...] Three appointees resigned amid suspicions of corruption, and his top intelligence chief and anticorruption aide faced accusations that they received bribes from The Samsung Group. Both Samsung and Lee denied the charges. [...] Those involved in the allegation of receiving bribes from Samsung group have been cleared of charges after special prosecutory investigation.|$|E
2500|$|The Telegraph {{published}} {{an interview with}} Monáe, talking about her first studio album, in which the journalist Bernadette McNulty said, [...] "I begin to worry {{for a moment that}} Monáe may not just be a humourless science-fiction nerd, but actually an android herself, created in a laboratory as a super-musical cross between James Brown, Judy Garland, André 3000 and Steve Jobs, invented to test the desperate incredulity of music journalists." [...] She also compared Monáe to artists such as Annie Lennox, Lauryn Hill, and Corinne Bailey Rae. Her musical styles have been described as [...] "a soaring orchestral trip enlivened with blockbuster vocals, mysterious imagery and notes of Sixties pop and jazz". The Guardian has noted some of her influences as: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Prince, Outkast, Erykah Badu, James Brown, Grace Jones, Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix, Bernard Herrmann, Funkadelic and the Incredible String Band. Matthew Valnes likens her dancing style in the music video for [...] "Tightrope", to that of James Brown. In an opinion piece for The Quietus, John Calvert places Janelle Monáe within the Afrofuturism movement, pointing out her similarities to Sun Ra and George Clinton. He asserts that Janelle Monáe is innovating the genre. Monáe has stated that she has an alter-ego named Cindi Mayweather who according to Monáe is from the year 2719. In [...] she gave her alter-ego a back-story stating that she was on the run after breaking the law in her home town of Metropolis by falling in love with a human named Anthony Greendown. Monáe explained about Cindi, saying [...] "The Archandroid, Cindi, is the mediator, between the mind and the hand. She's the mediator between <b>the</b> <b>haves</b> and the have-nots, the oppressed and the oppressor. She's like the Archangel in the Bible, and what Neo represents to the Matrix." [...] In her second album, Cindi Mayweather returned to Earth to liberate Metropolitans from the Great Divide, an oppressive oligarchy that used time travel to [...] "suppress freedom and love". Chris Champion of The Observer described Metropolis and The ArchAndroid as [...] "psychedelic soul with a sci-fi twist". Matthew Valnes describes Monáe as innovating a more contemporary Neo-Afrofuturism, where her android role is used as a tool to critique the representation of Black female musicians in the funk genre. Funk music of the 1960's through the 1980's is a prevalent music style influencing Monáe. On the website for Monáe's Wondaland Arts Society Collective, they assert [...] "We believe there are only three forms of music; good music, bad music, and funk." [...] Monáe has also referred to herself as a [...] "funkstress".|$|E

"If you mean, my dear Sir John, {{that which}} {{property}} is most apt to teach, we hold {{it to be}} selfishness; but if you mean that he who has money, as a rule, will also have in formation to guide him aright, I must answer, that experience, which is worth a thousand theories, tells us differently. We find that on questions which are purely between those who have, {{and those who have}} not, <b>the</b> <b>HAVES</b> are commonly united, and we think this would be the fact if they were as unschooled as bears; but on all other questions, they certainly do great discredit to education, unless you admit that there are in every case TWO rights; for, with us, the most highly educated generally take the two extremes of every argument. I state this to be the fact with monikins, you will remember--doubtless, educated men agree much better." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{injustice}} {{of the existing}} set of rules simply appals the Radical. Yet oddly enough, this injustice itself appeals rather to the comparative looker-on than to the heavily-handicapped players in person. They, poor creatures, dragging their log in patience, have grown so accustomed to regarding the world as another man's oyster, that they put up uncomplainingly {{for the most part}} with the most patent inequalities. Perhaps 'tis their want of imagination that makes them unable to conceive any other state of things as even possible--like the dog who accepts kicking as the natural fate of doghood. At any rate, you will find, if you look about you, that the chief reformers are not, as a rule, the ill-used classes themselves, but the sensitive and thinking souls who hate and loathe the injustice with which others are treated. Most of the best Radicals I have known were men of gentle birth and breeding. Not all: others, just as earnest, just as eager, just as chivalrous, sprang from the masses. Yet the gently-reared preponderate. It is a common Tory taunt to say that the battle is one between <b>the</b> <b>Haves</b> and the Have-nots. That is by no means true. It is between the selfish Haves, on one side, and the unselfish Haves, who wish to see something done for the Have-nots, on the other. As for the poor Have-nots themselves, they are mostly inarticulate. Indeed, the Tory almost admits as much when he alters his tone and describes the sympathising and active few as [...] "paid agitators." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Again, the {{exclusive}} tendency of richer people--due, no doubt, {{to the increasing}} refinement of their education, and the widening gulf {{between them and the}} rude violence of the poor--is already leading to the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf--which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits {{on the part of the}} rich--will make that exchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have <b>the</b> <b>Haves,</b> pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in their way, as the Upper-world people were to theirs. As it seemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally enough.|$|E
