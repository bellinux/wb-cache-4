50|$|Following {{administration}} of <b>taurolidine,</b> the antimicrobial and antiendotoxin {{activity of the}} <b>taurolidine</b> molecule is conferred by the release of three active methylol (hydroxymethyl) groups as <b>taurolidine</b> is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis via methylol taurultam to methylol taurinamide and taurine. These labile N-methylol derivatives of taurultam and taurinamide react with the bacterial cell-wall resulting in lysis of the bacteria, and by inter- and intramolecular cross-linking of the lipopolysaccharide-protein complex, neutralization of the bacterial endotoxins which is enhanced by enzymatic activation. This mechanism of action is accelerated and maximised when <b>taurolidine</b> is pre-warmed to 37 °C. Microbes are killed and the resulting toxins are inactivated; the destruction time in vitro is 30 minutes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taurolidine</b> has a {{relatively}} low acute and subacute toxicity.

The total daily dose ranged widely from 0.5 to 50g. The total cumulative dose ranged from 0.5 to 721g. In those patients who received intravenous <b>taurolidine,</b> the daily intravenous dose was usually 15 to 30 g but several patients received up to 40g/day.

50|$|<b>Taurolidine</b> {{demonstrates}} some anti-tumor properties, {{with positive}} results seen in early-stage clinical investigations using {{the drug to}} treat gastrointestinal malignancies and tumors of the central nervous system. More recently, {{it has been found}} to exert antineoplastic activity. <b>Taurolidine</b> induces cancer cell death through a variety of mechanisms. Even now, all the antineoplastic pathways it employs are not completely elucidated. It has been shown to enhance apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis, reduce tumor adherence, downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and stimulate anticancer immune regulation following surgical trauma. Apoptosis is activated through both a mitochondrial cytochrome-c-dependent mechanism and an extrinsic direct pathway. A lot of in vitro and animal data support taurolidine's tumoricidal action. <b>Taurolidine</b> has been used as an antimicrobial agent in the clinical setting since the 1970s and thus far appears nontoxic. The nontoxic nature of <b>taurolidine</b> makes it a favorable option compared with current chemotherapeutic regimens. Few published clinical studies exist evaluating the role of <b>taurolidine</b> as a chemotherapeutic agent. The literature lacks a gold-standard level 1 randomized clinical trial to evaluate taurolidine's potential antineoplastic benefits. However, these trials are currently underway. Such randomized control studies are vital to clarify the role of <b>taurolidine</b> in modern cancer treatment.|$|E

The goals of this study were to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of <b>taurolidine</b> in healthy dogs and the safety of <b>taurolidine</b> in combination with doxorubicin or carboplatin in dogs with osteosarcoma. Methods: Two percent <b>taurolidine</b> was infused into six healthy dogs (150 mg/kg) over a period of two hours and blood samples were taken periodically. One dog received <b>taurolidine</b> with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as its carrier and later received PVP-free <b>taurolidine</b> as did all other dogs in this study.

METHODS: Bloodstream infections among 158 HPN patients with long-term <b>taurolidine</b> catheter locking were analyzed retrospectively. CRBSI-diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, culture results, and absence of other sources of infections. CRBSIs were classified as definitive, probable or possible and exit site/tunnel/port or luminal infections. MICs were determined by broth microdilution. RESULTS: Between January 2009 and April 2011, 14 patients developed at least one luminal CRBSI episode during long-term <b>taurolidine</b> catheter locking (median (range) = 451 (78 - 1394) days). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species or Staphylococcus aureus predominated among CRBSI-causing Gram-positive bacteria. <b>Taurolidine</b> MICs were 512 mg/l or less in 50 % of these isolates (MIC 50). <b>Taurolidine</b> MIC 50 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, the most common CRBSI-causing Gram-negative bacteria, were 256 and 512 mg/l, respectively. <b>Taurolidine</b> MIC 50 among CRBSI-causing Candida albicans were 2048 mg/l.

Results <b>Taurolidine</b> was cytotoxic to osteosarcoma cells and increased the toxicity of doxorubicin and carboplatin in vitro.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: We have {{recently}} {{shown that a}} catheter lock solution containing <b>taurolidine</b> dramatically decreases catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) in patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) when compared to heparin. Since several <b>taurolidine</b> formulations are commercially available, some of which also contain citrate or heparin, {{we were interested in}} the effect of these different locks on growth and biofilm formation of fungal, Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens that are known to impede HPN treatment. METHODS: Clinical isolates obtained during CRBSI of HPN patients were grown in the presence of catheter locks (2 % <b>taurolidine,</b> 1. 34 % taurolidine-citrate, 1. 34 % taurolidine-citrate-heparin, citrate and heparin) or phosphate buffered saline diluted in lysogeny broth medium for bacteria and sabouraud liquid medium for yeasts. Biofilm formation, assessed by crystal violet staining, and growth of clinical isolates were determined by optical density measurements. RESULTS: We found that 12. 5 x diluted solutions of all <b>taurolidine</b> containing formulations completely prevented growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida glabrata.

Firstly in this study the effect of <b>taurolidine</b> in monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine, docetaxel and suramin on viabilitiy and proliferation of 3 different pancreatic cancer cell lines has been evaluated. Deriving from the results of {{the first part of this}} investigation, the combinatory treatment with <b>taurolidine</b> and gemcitabine was choosen to conduct a further analysis of key regulators of apoptosis. Mitochondrial apoptosis was investigated by assessment of anti-apototic protein bcl- 2 and pro-apoptotic protein bax. The influence of <b>taurolidine</b> on c-flip, which is a regulator of death-receptor mediated apoptosis in pancreatic cancer, was also assessed. Materials and Methods: Ductal pancreatic cancer cell lines: AsPC- 1 human, HPAF- 2 (human) and DSL- 6 A (rat). Cells were incubated for 24 h and 72 h with <b>taurolidine</b> (100 μM- 500 μM), or with <b>taurolidine</b> (100 μM and 200 μM) in combination with gemcitabine (100 μM), docetaxel (0, 03 µg and 0, 3 µg) or suramine (10 µg and 100 µg) Proliferation and viability were investigated by cell counting and MTT assay. Apoptosis in general was analyzed by caspase 3 / 7 assay. Expression of bcl- 2, bax and c-flip were assessed by western blot analysis. Results: <b>Taurolidine</b> in monotherapy and combination with different antineoplastic agents inhibited cell growth and viability significantly in all investigated pancreatic cancer cell lines. Combinatory treatment with <b>taurolidine</b> and gemcitabine in a further reduction of proliferation. As revealed by caspase 3 / 7 assay, combinatory treatment with <b>taurolidine</b> and gemcitabine (vs. gemcitabine monotherapy) was highly effective in apoptosis induction. Cell line specific, expression of anti-apoptotic proteins bcl- 2 and c-flip decreased, whereas an increase of pro-apoptotic bax was observed. Conclusion: <b>Taurolidine</b> might be a promising sensitizer for established antineoplastic agents as well as for new death receptor agonistic therapies in pancreatic cancer...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{data have}} {{suggested}} that <b>taurolidine</b> may bear promising disinfectant properties for the therapy of bacterial infections. However, at present, the potential antibacterial effect of <b>taurolidine</b> on the supragingival plaque biofilm is unknown. To evaluate the antibacterial effect of <b>taurolidine</b> on the supragingival plaque biofilm using the vital fluorescence technique and to compare it with the effect of NaCl and chlorhexidine (CHX), 18 subjects had to refrain from all mechanical and chemical hygiene measures for 24  h. A voluminous supragingival plaque sample {{was taken from the}} buccal surfaces of the lower molars and wiped on an objective slide. The sample was then divided into three equal parts and mounted with one of the three test or control preparations (a) NaCl, (b) <b>taurolidine</b> 2 % and (c) CHX 0. 2 %. After a reaction time of 2  min, the test solutions were sucked of. Subsequently, the plaque biofilm was stained with fluorescence dye and vitality of the plaque flora was evaluated under the fluorescence microscope (VF%). Plaque samples treated with NaCl showed a mean VF of 82. 42 [*]±[*] 6. 04 %. <b>Taurolidine</b> affected mean VF with 47. 57 [*]±[*] 16. 60 % significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 001, paired t test). The positive control CHX showed the lowest mean VF values (34. 41 [*]±[*] 14. 79 %; p[*]<[*] 0. 001 compared to NaCl, p[*]=[*] 0. 017 compared to <b>taurolidine).</b> <b>Taurolidine</b> possesses a significant antibacterial effect on the supragingival plaque biofilm which was, however, not as pronounced as that of CHX...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of intraperitoneal instillation of antimicrobial agents in eliminating the bacterial contaminant {{in patients with}} generalized peritonitis remains controversial. We determined the effect of intraperitoneal instillation of <b>taurolidine</b> or imipenem on mortality, and on the concentration of bacteria, endotoxin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in rats with intraperitoneally injected bacteria. Thirty rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with two enteric bacterial strains, followed by either <b>taurolidine,</b> saline, or imipenem, Abdominal fluid and blood were analyzed at different time intervals. The survival rate was highest in the imipenem group (p < 0. 05). The bacterial concentration in abdominal fluid in the <b>taurolidine</b> and imipenem group was lower than in the saline group (p < 0. 005), but the concentration in the imipenem group was lowest (p < 0. 005). The endotoxin concentration in abdominal fluid and plasma in the <b>taurolidine</b> group was lower than {{in the other two}} groups (p < 0. 05). The TNF concentration in abdominal fluid and plasma in the <b>taurolidine</b> group was lower than in the saline group (p < 0. 05), whereas the concentration in the imipenem group was higher (p < 0. 005). We conclude that topically applied <b>taurolidine</b> in rats with intraperitoneally injected bacteria may have a weak antibacterial effect, and lowered concentrations of endotoxin and TNF. Topically applied imipenem had a profound bactericidal activity but induced endotoxin and TNF release...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Malignant gliomas tend to recur in {{the vast}} {{majority}} of cases. Recurrent gliomas may arise from vital tumor cells present in this zone around the resection margin. It appears promising to combine tumor resection with local chemotherapy using an antineoplastic, but non-toxic agent. <b>Taurolidine</b> exerts a selective antineoplastic effect by induction of programmed cell death and has anti-angiogenic activity. Fibrin sealant is completely degradable and firmly adheres to brain tissue, suggesting that it would provide a suitable matrix for <b>taurolidine</b> delivery – a Taurolidine-Fibrin-Sealant-Matrix (TFM) – in the local treatment of brain tumors. The potential of local delivery of <b>taurolidine</b> out of a fibrin sealant matrix was investigated. <b>Taurolidine</b> could be suspended homogeneously in both the thrombin and the procoagulant protein components of the fibrin sealant. The fibrin sealant matrix was a suitable carrier for the suspension o...|$|E
