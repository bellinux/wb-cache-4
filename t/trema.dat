50|$|In the TARDIS, the Doctor and Adric arrive back in N-Space in an {{area known}} as the Traken Union, an empire of peace and harmony. They are {{surprised}} to find a holographic image of the elderly Keeper of Traken appear in the TARDIS, calling on the Doctor's help. The Keeper explains that his title is about to pass on soon to Consul <b>Tremas,</b> giving him access to the powerful Source that is the centre of Traken's technological advancement, but senses evil within him, his wife Kassia, and their daughter Nyssa. The Keeper suspects a connection to Melkur, an evil creature that arrived years ago on Traken but became calcified in a grove in the capital. Melkur has since {{become something of a}} holy symbol, and Kassia has been tasked with talking to it and keeping it clean; that task is soon to be passed on to Nyssa.When the Doctor and Adric land at Traken's capital and visit the Keeper, their presence appears to cause the Keeper to warn the assembled group of a great evil, and though <b>Tremas</b> vouches for them, others, including the Fosters, guardians of the spiritual welfare of the capital, remain cautious about their presence. Soon, bodies in the grove are found, the Doctor and Adric determining they have been killed by some type of plasma weapon. Adric works with Nyssa to identify the energy signature of the plasma as being from a TARDIS, while the Doctor assists <b>Tremas</b> in defusing the conflict over their presence. Unbeknownst to either group, Kassia secretly visits Melkur, who gives her a collar to wear, providing the creature with mind-control over her while promising to keep her husband safe. Kassia is able to convince the Fosters to arrest <b>Tremas,</b> the Doctor, Adric and Nyssa, and uses the situation to convince the other Consul to install her as the next Keeper. When the Keeper dies, Kassia takes the throne, but as the pivotal moment of the ceremony is completed, she disappears, leaving the statue of Melkur in her place, now connected to the Source.|$|R
25|$|Portuguese {{is written}} with 26 {{letters of the}} Latin script, making use of five {{diacritics}} to denote stress, vowel height, contraction, nasalization, and etymological assibilation (acute accent, circumflex, grave accent, tilde, and cedilla).

25|$|The oldest known {{amate paper}} {{dates back to}} 75 CE. It was {{discovered}} {{at the site of}} Huitzilapa, Jalisco.

Rather than being produced from <b>Trema</b> micrantha, from which modern amate is made, the amate found at Huitzilapa is made from Ficus tecolutensis. Iconography (in stone) dating from the period contains depictions of items thought to be paper. For example, Monument 52 from the Olmec site of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán illustrates an individual adorned with ear pennants of folded paper. The oldest known surviving book made from amate paper may be the Grolier Codex, which Michael D. Coe and other researchers have asserted is authentic and dated to the 12th-13th century CE.|$|E

[...] When two adjacent vowels were to be pronounced independently, Sylvius proposed using the diaeresis, called the <b>tréma</b> in French. [...] Sylvius gives the example [...] ( [...] for je trais) as opposed to traï ( [...] for je trahis). Even these groups, however, did not represent true diphthongs (such as the English try [...] ), but rather adjacent vowels pronounced separately without an intervening consonant. [...] As French no longer had any true diphthongs, the diaeresis alone would have sufficed to distinguish between ambiguous vowel pairs. His circumflex was entirely unnecessary.

2500|$|The Master {{has only}} been shown to {{regenerate}} once onscreen. However, the Master does change appearance several times, often circumventing the limitations ordinarily placed upon Time Lords.

He is driven to acquire a new regeneration cycle, but is ultimately able to circumvent the end of his life by possessing the body of <b>Tremas</b> (Antony Ainley) in The Keeper of Traken (1981). Ainley portrays the Master until the conclusion of the classic series, although still plots at several times to obtain a new regeneration cycle. In the 1996 TV movie, the Master is executed but cheats death by possessing a parasitic creature, which in turn possesses a human named Bruce (Eric Roberts), giving the Master another new form.|$|R
