For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. The non-deterministic Turing machine has very little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that non-deterministic time {{is a very important}} resource in analyzing computational problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{justification}} Unicode gives is {{that the}} national standards body in the PRC made unique codepoints for the two variations of the first character 內/内, whereas Korea never made separate codepoints for the unique variants of 全. There is a reason for this that has nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> the domestic bodies view the characters themselves. China went through a process {{in the twentieth century}} that changed (if not simplified) several characters. During this transition, there was a need to be able encode both variants within the same document. Korean has always used the variant of 全 with the 入 (U+5165) radical on top. Therefore, it had no reason to encode both variants. Korean language documents made in the twentieth century had little reason to represent both versions in the same document.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since I have my own studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able {{to live with it}} day after day, and I think that had a lot <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at Stax and Motown".|$|E

2500|$|Plato often {{discusses}} the father-son relationship {{and the question}} of whether a father's interest in his sons has much <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> well his sons turn out. In ancient Athens, a boy was socially located by his family identity, and Plato often refers to his characters in terms of their paternal and fraternal relationships. Socrates was not a family man, and saw himself as the son of his mother, who was apparently a midwife. A divine fatalist, Socrates mocks men who spent exorbitant fees on tutors and trainers for their sons, and repeatedly ventures the idea that good character is a gift from the gods. Plato's dialogue Crito reminds Socrates that orphans are at the mercy of chance, but Socrates is unconcerned. In the Theaetetus, he is found recruiting as a disciple a young man whose inheritance has been squandered. Socrates twice compares the relationship of the older man and his boy lover to the father-son relationship (Lysis 213a, Republic 3.403b), and in the Phaedo, Socrates' disciples, towards whom he displays more concern than his biological sons, say they will feel [...] "fatherless" [...] when he is gone.|$|E

The following week, a request for evidence and documentation supporting Razack's argument was made to Raj Anand, the lawyer representing {{the families of the}} deceased. The lawyer refused to give these documents, calling the demand [...] "ironic" [...] since Razack's report on systemic racism was the only report whose validity was being questioned, and for which supporting evidence was requested, which Anand claimed was a result of systemic racism. The Department of Justice lawyer who made the request, Barnand Brukney, expressed his impression that racism had very little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> the Canadian government handled the Air India Flight 182, telling Razack in court that she [...] "really [...] know what happened in this case."

2500|$|Emotion is a {{large part}} of trauma, {{especially}} near death experiences. The effect emotions have on memory in different instances {{is an integral part of}} the effect of trauma on memory. [...] Emotional events tend to be recalled with more frequency and clarity than memories not associated with extreme emotions. [...] Typically traumatic events, such as physical attack or sexual abuse, are interrelated with strong negative emotions, causing these memories to be very strong and more easily recalled than memories not associated with similar emotions, or even those connected to positive emotions. [...] Emotion's strong connection with memory also has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>how</b> much attention or focus an individual has on the event. [...] If they are heavily emotionally involved in the event, a lot of their attention is directed at what's happening, rendering it a stronger memory. [...] It is also the case with emotionally aroused situations that even if attention is limited, it is more likely that a memory associated with the strong emotion will remain as opposed to some neutral stimulus. [...] Chemically, this is because the emotional and physical stress caused by traumatic events creates an almost identical stimulation in the brain to the physiological condition that heightens memory retention. [...] It excites the neuron-chemical activity centers of the brain that affects memory encoding and recollection. [...] This reaction has been enforced by evolution as learning from high-stress environments is necessary in [...] "fight or flight" [...] decisions that characterize human survival.|$|E
60|$|In {{the evenings}} it was {{customary}} for Sir Henry, Good, and myself to dine, or rather sup, with their Majesties -- not every night, indeed, but {{about three or}} four times a week, whenever they had not much company, or the affairs of state would allow of it. And I am bound to say that those little suppers were quite the most charming things of their sort that I ever had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with.</b> <b>How</b> true is the saying that the very highest in rank are always the most simple and kindly. It is from your half-and-half sort of people that you get pomposity and vulgarity, the difference between the two being very much what one sees every day in England between the old, out-at-elbows, broken-down county family, and the overbearing, purse-proud people who come and 'take the place'. I really think that Nyleptha's greatest charm is her sweet simplicity, and her kindly genuine interest even in little things. She is the simplest woman I ever knew, and where her passions are not involved, one of the sweetest; but she can look queenly enough when she likes, and be as fierce as any savage too.|$|E
