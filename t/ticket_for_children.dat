50|$|The {{attraction}} {{was incredibly}} successful. Ten million 60¢ and 95¢ <b>tickets</b> <b>for</b> <b>children</b> and adults, respectively, {{were collected in}} two half-year seasons and the proceeds were donated to UNICEF. While other attractions had lines out the doors, there seemed to always be a seat available aboard It's a Small World. Its high rider-per-hour capacity was recognized as a valuable innovation and was incorporated indirectly and directly into future attractions. Pirates of the Caribbean had been under construction at Disneyland as a subterranean walk-through. That design was scrapped as concrete was broken out so similar boats could sail past scenes which (because the original walk-through scene length was not shortened) were now different each voyage, another concept which forever influenced attraction design and popularity.|$|R

50|$|From September 1987, {{more than}} 12 {{months before the}} Annual Season Ticket Holder's Railcard was discontinued, a similar scheme began in the Network SouthEast area of London and {{southeast}} England. Annual season <b>tickets</b> issued <b>for</b> journeys within this area became known as Gold Cards, and the season ticket functioned as a Railcard giving various benefits which were broadly {{the same as those}} received by holders of the former Network Card: 34% discounts for themselves and accompanying adults on most off-peak fares, £1.00 flat-fare <b>tickets</b> <b>for</b> <b>children,</b> and First Class Supplement upgrades. The same time restriction (after 10.00am on weekdays; all day at weekends and on public holidays) also applied. When a Gold Card holder is travelling on the route covered by their Gold Card with accompanying adults or children, a separate discounted ticket {{does not have to be}} purchased by the Gold Card holder in order to secure the relevant discounts for the other members of the group.|$|R
50|$|Typically, half-fare <b>tickets</b> (e.g. <b>for</b> <b>children,</b> dogs, and bicycles) {{would be}} created by cutting the ticket in half vertically, return tickets by having a {{diagonal}} cut across the ticket, having the value of half the adult fare. The remaining part was placed in groove in {{the lid of the}} ticket rack above its tube. It could then be used as another child ticket, or counted as a credit.|$|R
30|$|Parental {{influence}} has {{significant impact on}} children’s gambling involvement and problem gambling. Felsher et al. (2003) pointed out that tacit approval was given when parents purchased lottery <b>tickets</b> <b>for</b> their <b>children.</b> Such approval would likely produce more serious children gambling involvement or support already problematic gambling. Parents may overlook {{the fact that they}} are the role models <b>for</b> their <b>children.</b> Children often follow parents’ gambling behavior, develop gambling attitudes and cognitions similar to those of their parents (Oei and Raylu 2004). If parents teach or allow their children to gamble with them at home, such parental behavior often implies gambling is accepted as a family activity.|$|R

25|$|Until 1909 {{the fare}} <b>for</b> <b>children</b> under 12 was <b>for</b> two <b>children</b> {{to travel with}} one adult <b>ticket</b> or <b>for</b> one <b>child</b> to ride two adult stages.

Children under 15 years of age were supplied with books of 30 tickets, each book costing 1/3d.

50|$|The {{laws and}} {{regulations}} for passenger transport did not set any high-reaching goals such as passenger numbers or service levels. The intent of the law was that public transportation is foremost a business venture. The majority of Finnish public transportation has, however, been supported by the government either directly or indirectly. This could be by purchasing transportation or by subsidizing <b>tickets</b> <b>for</b> students, <b>children,</b> or other groups. The current law for public transportation sets in §3 the goal that the system needs to be developed in such way that it can provide public transportation that satisfies the necessary demand in the entire country. An additional goal for highly populated areas (over 50,000 inhabitants) is that the service level for these areas is so high that it promotes and increases the usage of public transportation.|$|R

5000|$|Starting {{with the}} 2011-12 season, the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) instituted a {{modified}} version of this rule. The penalty for a team sanctioned for crowd violence is now a ban on both ticket sales to, and attendance by, males over age 12 (as spectators). Women, and children under age 12 of either sex, are admitted free. The first game under the new rule took place on 20 September 2011, when Fenerbahçe hosted Manisaspor at Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in Istanbul. Over 41,000 women and children attended the match (plus a small number of men who had sneaked into the stadium). The experiment was so successful that the TFF planned to require that teams allocate an unspecified number of free <b>tickets</b> <b>for</b> women and <b>children</b> at all future club matches. Shortly thereafter, the TFF stated that it would reimburse clubs <b>for</b> free <b>tickets</b> given to women and <b>children</b> <b>for</b> regular league games (i.e., games not subject to crowd restrictions), and increased the upper age limit for [...] "children" [...] for the purposes of free ticketing to 15.|$|R
