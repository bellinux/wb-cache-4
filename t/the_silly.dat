5|$|Columbia {{distributed}} Disney's shorts for {{two years}} before the Disney studio entered a new distribution deal with United Artists in 1932. The same year, Disney signed a two-year exclusive deal with Technicolor to utilize its new 3-strip color film process, which allowed for fuller-color reproduction where previous color film processors could not. The result was <b>the</b> <b>Silly</b> Symphony Flowers and Trees, the first film commercially released in full Technicolor. Flowers and Trees was a major success, and all Silly Symphonies were subsequently produced in Technicolor.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of Snow White, work had continued on the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series of shorts. Mickey Mouse switched to Technicolor in 1935, by which time the series had added several major supporting characters, among them Mickey's dog Pluto and their friends Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, Goofy, and Pluto would all be appearing in series of their own by 1940, and the Donald Duck cartoons eclipsed the Mickey Mouse series in popularity. <b>The</b> <b>Silly</b> Symphonies, which garnered seven , ended in 1939.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{when he was}} {{not working}} at American Greetings, Crumb drew many Fritz the Cat strips for his own amusement. Some of these strips would later be {{published}} in Help! and Cavalier magazines and in the underground comix. Fritz also appears briefly in Crumb's graphic novel Big Yum Yum Book: The Story of Oggie and the Beanstalk, drawn in 1964, but not published until 1975. Several characters from the anthropomorphic universe of Fritz the Cat appeared in another Crumb comic strip, <b>The</b> <b>Silly</b> Pigeons, drawn in 1965 and intended for Help! In 1970, Crumb redrew an early Fuzzy the Bunny story written by Charles Crumb in 1952; it was published in Zap Comix #5.|$|E

5|$|Since Alice Comedies in the 1920s, Walt Disney Animation Studios has {{produced}} a series of prominent short films, including the Mickey Mouse cartoons and <b>the</b> <b>Silly</b> Symphonies series. Many of these shorts provided a medium for the studio to experiment with new technologies that they would use in their filmmaking process, such as the synchronization of sound in Steamboat Willie (1928), {{the integration of the}} three-strip Technicolor process in Flowers and Trees (1932), the multiplane camera in The Old Mill (1937), the xerography process in Goliath II (1960), and the hand-drawn/CGI hybrid animation in Off His Rockers (1992), Paperman (2012), and Get a Horse! (2013).|$|E
5|$|To {{improve the}} quality of the music, Disney hired the {{professional}} composer and arranger Carl Stalling, on whose suggestion <b>the</b> <b>Silly</b> Symphony series was developed, providing stories through the use of music; the first in the series, The Skeleton Dance (1929), was drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were several local artists, some of whom stayed with the company as core animators; the group later became known as the Nine Old Men. Both the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series were successful, but Disney and his brother felt they were not receiving their rightful share of profits from Powers. In 1930, Disney tried to trim costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the practice of animating every separate cel in favor of the more efficient technique of drawing key poses and letting lower-paid assistants sketch the in-between poses. Disney asked Powers for an increase in payments for the cartoons. Powers refused and signed Iwerks to work for him; Stalling resigned shortly afterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the Disney Studio would close. Disney had a nervous breakdown in October 1931which he blamed on the machinations of Powers and his own overworkso he and Lillian took an extended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sillies</b> were a Detroit {{punk rock}} band formed early 1977 by auto {{assembly}} line worker Ben Waugh. <b>The</b> <b>Sillies</b> played their first show second-billed to The MC5. Later, they played with bands such as The Dead Boys, The Damned, The Cramps, and toured the United States and Canada. The band regrouped and toured the West Coast of North America in 2002 {{to support the}} release of their [...] "debut" [...] CD America's Most Wanton (Nebula/Scooch Pooch).|$|R
25|$|In the 25th anniversary reunion {{episode of}} I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again, John Cleese {{consents}} {{to appear on}} the show on condition that he be allowed to do <b>the</b> <b>Silly</b> Walk; the other cast members are dubious about the comedic impact of doing the Walk on radio, but they ultimately give in after Cleese puts on a show of hurt feelings. Near the end of the show, Cleese presents <b>the</b> <b>Silly</b> Walk, rendered on radio as a series of loud, slow footsteps.|$|E
25|$|About this time, story {{artists at}} Disney were finding it {{increasingly}} difficult to write material for Mickey. As he had developed into a role model for children, they were limited in the types of gags they could make. This led to Mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing for more emphasis on other characters. In Orphan's Benefit (August 11, 1934) Mickey first appeared with Donald Duck who had been introduced earlier that year in <b>the</b> <b>Silly</b> Symphonies series. The tempestuous duck would provide Disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in Mickey's cartoons.|$|E
25|$|Disney and his {{remaining}} staff continued {{the production of}} the Mickey series, {{and he was able to}} eventually find a number of animators to replace Iwerks. As the Great Depression progressed and Felix the Cat faded from the movie screen, Mickey's popularity would rise, and by 1932 The Mickey Mouse Club would have one million members. At the 5th Academy Awards in 1932, Mickey received his first Academy Award nomination, received for Mickey's Orphans (1931). Walt Disney also received an honorary Academy Award for the creation of Mickey Mouse. Despite being eclipsed by <b>the</b> <b>Silly</b> Symphonies short the Three Little Pigs in 1933, Mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too, until 1935, when polls showed that Popeye was more popular than Mickey. By 1934, Mickey merchandise had earned $600,000.00 a year. In 1935, Disney began to phase out the Mickey Mouse Clubs, due to administration problems.|$|E

500|$|GameSpot was {{relatively}} positive, praising Just Dance for having simplistic gameplay, and remarking that its dance routines were [...] "both fun {{and at times}} downright hilarious". However, GameSpot felt that the game's motion detection system was [...] "frustrating and unrewarding", and also panned the game's graphical quality and lack of career modes or downloadable content. In conclusion, giving the game a 5.5 out of 10, GameSpot felt that Just Dance would appeal best as a multiplayer party game, where players [...] " [...] attempt <b>the</b> <b>silly</b> dances, laugh at each other's mistakes, and sing along to the cheesy pop tunes", but was [...] "water-thin" [...] as a single-player game.|$|E

H.J. Igoe, writing in The Catholic Herald, thinks that [...] "Formby has a common English touch. We warm to the kindly turnip face, the revolving eyes, the mouth like a slashed coconut, <b>the</b> <b>silly</b> little songs... the melodiously tinny voice and twanging banjo. The comedian is the universal works—platoon and bar-room simpleton—mother's boy—the beloved henpeck—the father who cannot hang a picture and underlying his everyday folly there is the sublime wisdom of the ordinary fool who loves and trusts the world. His comedy is earthy, but never lascivious".|$|E

500|$|The rock monster {{climax of}} the film was {{ultimately}} dropped due to difficulties during filming. The monster, dubbed the Rockman, was a large latex rubber suit that breathed fire on command. Effects personnel smoked cigarettes and blew smoke into the suit's tubing, loading it with smoke that it would slowly emit, obscuring some obvious rubber parts. On {{the last day of}} location shooting, the Rockman began suffering mechanical problems; the suit stopped breathing fire, and the desert wind dissipated the smoke. The result, Shatner wrote, was that [...] "our guy in <b>the</b> <b>silly</b> rubber suit ultimately just looked like... well, a guy in a silly rubber suit." [...] With no time to return to the location, Shatner was forced to get wide shots and hope that the setting could be reproduced in the studio, but admitted that it was likely it was not going to work for the film.|$|E
500|$|George Heath, {{editor of}} The Numismatist, {{discussed}} the new pieces: [...] "the mechanical work {{is all that}} could be desired, and {{it is probable that}} owing to the conventional rut in which our mint authorities seem obliged to keep, this is the best that could be done". W.T.R. Martin wrote in the American Journal of Numismatics, [...] "The general effect is pleasing, of the three the Dime is to many the most attractive piece. The head of Liberty is dignified, but although <b>the</b> <b>silly</b> story has been started that the profile is that of a 'reigning belle' of New York, she can hardly be called a beauty; there is a suggestion... of the classic heads on some of the Roman coins, and a much stronger suggestion of the head on the French Francs of 1871 and onward... these coins are an advance on what has hitherto been accomplished, but there is yet a long distance between them and the ideal National coin." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{examining}} the film from a queer theory perspective, author Michele Aaron cites Zero Patience as definitional {{of one of}} the New Queer Cinema's central attitudes, the [...] "def of cinematic convention in terms of form, content and genre."

[...] Feminist academic and AIDS video producer Alexandra Juhasz puts forth the film as [...] "an effective critique of <b>the</b> <b>silly</b> sensationalism used in much reportage of AIDS science [...] fights melodrama and tabloid journalism -- with melodrama and tabloid journalism." [...] Not all such critical commentary has been positive, with openly gay film scholar Robin Wood (who saw the film when someone very close to him was {{in the final stages of}} AIDS) calling the film [...] "misguided on the levels both of conception and execution." ...|$|E
