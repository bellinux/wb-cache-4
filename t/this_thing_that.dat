500|$|Blitz {{believed}} that Hal's stuttering was {{a metaphor for}} his lack of mastery of life and love: [...] "He can't control <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> ought to be so simple... And {{so much of his}} life is like that." [...] Journalist Mark Baumer highlighted the juxtaposition of Hal with the fast-talking debaters, who are at opposite ends of the spectrum with their speech but are both struggling with communication and expression. Blitz said that [...] "Even when [...] can speak incredibly fast and are packing their sentences with tons of SAT words, they still don't know exactly what they're talking about. There is still a question about whether their content of what they're talking about matches up with what they're feeling or trying to express. Whether it's the kid who's talking a million miles an hour, but saying nothing or the kid who isn't able to get out any word at all they're both at the mercy of not knowing how to express what's inside them." ...|$|E
500|$|Various interpretations {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall of The New York Times noted several suggestions made about the feather: [...] "Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being? Forrest Gump's impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?" [...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by {{how we deal with}} the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|E

On the North American Billboard charts, the song became Furtado's first since 2010's [...] "Night Is Young" [...] to not enter the Billboard Hot 100. However, [...] "Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)" [...] reached the top forty of the Pop Songs chart and the top ten of the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Smith felt the underperformance was helped by moving The Spirit Indestructibles release date, [...] "so there’s no need to get <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> supposed to be this club banger intro track and force it up the chart." ...|$|E

500|$|On January 31, 2007, Biden {{took his}} first steps into the presidential campaign, but his {{comments}} about other candidates overshadowed his entrance. Biden especially drew criticism in the popular press for his evaluation of Senator Barack Obama; Biden {{was quoted in the}} New York Observer as saying: [...] "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." [...] The audio of the interview, posted on the Observers website, reportedly includes a significant pause after [...] "African-American" [...] which would drastically change the meaning of the statement. Biden sought to clear up the controversy by apologizing to Obama on the same day and repeated his regret on The Daily Show that same evening: [...] "Look, the other part of <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> got me in trouble is using the word clean. I should have said fresh." [...] Some media observers labeled Biden's announcement a [...] "launch pad disaster." [...] Jesse Jackson telephoned Biden and reported afterward [...] "Senator Biden...assured me that he regrets that his remarks were misinterpreted. He was serious and contrite. To me, this was a gaffe, not a statement about his philosophy or ideology." ...|$|E
500|$|Ottavio's {{marriage}} troubled Alessandro; {{he struggled}} with the burden of chastity and entertained fantasies of marrying a princess. He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he [...] "became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of {{the daughter of an}} Emperor." [...] In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.|$|E

And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart. For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not whole with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father. For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the detestation of the Ammonites. And Solomon did that which was evil {{in the sight of}} The Lord, and went not fully after The Lord, as did David his father. Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the detestation of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the detestation of the children of Ammon. And so did he for all his foreign wives, who offered and sacrificed unto their gods. And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice, and had commanded him concerning <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> he should not go after other gods; but he kept not that which the Lord commanded.” ...|$|E
