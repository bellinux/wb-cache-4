5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of <b>the</b> <b>nozzle</b> is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases <b>the</b> <b>nozzle</b> size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. <b>The</b> <b>nozzle</b> must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into <b>the</b> <b>nozzle</b> for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for <b>the</b> <b>nozzle</b> and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve.

Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E

5|$|One example {{superalloy}} is Inconel 718, {{consisting of}} roughly 50% nickel, 18.6% chromium, 18.5% iron, 5% niobium, 3.1% molybdenum, 0.9% titanium, and 0.4% aluminium. These superalloys are used, for example, in advanced air frame {{systems for the}} Gemini program. Another niobium alloy was used for <b>the</b> <b>nozzle</b> of the Apollo Service Module.

5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959.

The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct the air out over the top or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but {{over the top and}} bottom during forward flight. The idea was that when the flap was positioned in order to provide control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|E

If propellant gas is continuously added to the chamber then these pressures can be maintained for as long as propellant remains.
