40|$|Reperfusion {{therapy for}} ST-elevation acute {{coronary}} syndromes aims at early and complete recanalization of the infarct-related artery {{in order to}} salvage myocardium and improve both early and late clinical outcomes. Myocardial necrosis is usually confirmed and quantified by myocardial enzyme release in plasma. However, over 10 % of patients treated with reperfusion therapy fail to develop an enzyme rise, but do exhibit <b>transient</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>changes,</b> which are consistent with an aborted myocardial infarction. The earlier the reperfusion therapy is instituted, the higher the incidence of aborted infarction. Treatment within an hour after symptom onset may result in 25 % of aborted infarction and is in combination with complete (70 %) ST-segment resolution associated with better survival. This endpoint is easy to define and occurs promptly in time. The faster that effective treatment is initiated, the more likely aborted infarction will occur. Given that mortality, re-infarction, and stroke are declining in incidence, we suggest the introduction of aborted infarction as an endpoint in clinical trials of ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{sought to}} assess the {{incidence}} and clinical relevance of examination data to recurrent ischemia within an international randomized trial. BACKGROUND: Ischemic symptoms commonly recur after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: Patients (n = 40, 848) were prospectively evaluated for recurrent angina and <b>transient</b> electrocardiographic (<b>ECG)</b> or hemodynamic <b>changes.</b> Five groups were developed: Group 1, patients with no signs or symptoms of recurrent ischemia; Group 2, patients with angina only; Group 3, patients with angina and ST segment changes; Group 4, patients with angina and hemodynamic abnormalities; and Group 5, patients with angina, ST segment changes and hemodynamic abnormalities. Baseline clinical and outcome variables were compared among the five groups. RESULTS: Group 1 comprised 32, 717 patients, and Groups 2 to 5 comprised 20 % of patients (4, 488 in Group 2; 3, 021 in Group 3; 337 in Group 4; and 285 in Group 5). Patients with recurrent ischemia were more often female, had more cardiovascular risk factors and less often received intravenous heparin. Significantly more extensive and more severe coronary disease, antianginal treatment, angioplasty and coronary bypass surgery were observed {{as a function of}} ischemic severity. The 30 -day reinfarction rate was 1. 6 % in Group 1, 6. 5 % in Group 2, 21. 7 % in Group 3, 13. 1 % in Group 4 and 36. 5 % in Group 5 (p < 0. 0001); in contrast, the 30 -day mortality rate was significantly lower (p < 0. 0001) in Groups 1, 2 and 3 (6. 6 %, 5. 4 % and 7. 7 %, respectively) than in Groups 4 and 5 (21. 8 % and 29. 1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Postinfarction angina greatly increases the risk of reinfarction, especially when accompanied by <b>transient</b> <b>ECG</b> <b>changes.</b> However, mortality is markedly increased only in the presence of concomitant hemodynamic abnormalities. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Ischemic {{heart disease}} {{involves}} both "structural" and/or "functional" disorders of the coronary circulation. Structural atherosclerotic {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) is well recognized, with established diagnostic and treatment strategies.

Vasospastic angina encompasses "functional CAD" attributable to coronary artery spasm and this "state of the art" consensus statement reviews contemporary aspects of this disorder. Patients with vasospastic angina typically present with angina at rest that promptly responds to short-acting nitrates and is associated with <b>transient</b> ischemic <b>ECG</b> <b>changes.</b> Although spontaneous episodes may be documented, provocative spasm testing may be required to confirm the diagnosis. It is important to diagnose vasospastic angina because it may be associated with major adverse events that can be prevented with the use of appropriate vasodilator therapy (eg, calcium-channel blockers) and the avoidance of aggravating stimuli (eg, smoking).

40|$|Dolasetron (Anzemet) {{overdose}} is uncommon, and, to our knowledge, this is {{the only}} case report of an intentional overdose. Dolasetron (dolasetron mesylate) is a selective 5 ‐hydroxytryptamine 3 antagonist derived from pseudopelletierine, and is used in the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting. <b>Transient</b> and asymptomatic <b>ECG</b> <b>changes,</b> including QRS widening and PR and QTc prolongation, have been reported in therapeutic doses.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Elderly {{patients}} represent {{one-third of}} all admissions for non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) in the coronary care units. Despite their high-risk characteristics and worse outcomes, compared with younger patients, the elderly receive less aggressive treatments, also due to less clear evidence regarding the most effective treatment strategy. PURPOSE: The Italian Elderly ACS study includes patients older than 74 years of age with NSTEACS in a multicenter randomized clinical trial, comparing an early aggressive and an initially conservative approach. Patients not enrolled due to specific exclusion criteria or any other reason will be enrolled in a Registry. CENTERS: Centers with on-site interventional cathlab and centers without on-site cathlab refering patients to a cathlab within a consolidated percutaneous coronary intervention network. PATIENTS: Patients admitted within 48 h {{of the most recent}} ischemic symptoms are eligible if they show <b>transient</b> ischemic <b>ECG</b> <b>changes</b> and/or CKMB/Tn elevation. Patients with secondary ischemia, ongoing ischemia, or heart failure, despite optimal therapy or recent coronary intervention, serum creatinine more than 2. 5 mg/dl, high bleeding risk, and severe concomitant disease, are excluded from the study. DESIGN: Central randomization to a systematic early aggressive approach (coronary angiography within 48 h of admission and, when indicated, coronary revascularization) or an initially conservative approach (optimal medical therapy with coronary angiography in selected cases with refractory ischemia). Follow-up will include patient visits and ECG at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year, post randomization. PRIMARY END POINT: The composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial (re) infarction, disabling stroke, and rehospitalization for cardiovascular diseases or severe bleeding within 6 months. SAMPLE SIZE: Expected primary end point rates of 30 % in the conservative arm vs. 20 % in the invasive arm. According to these estimates, with two-tailed alpha of 0. 05, power will be 80, 85, or 90 % with 252, 289, and 338 patients per group, respectively.

40|$|Objective: Electrocardiographic (<b>ECG)</b> <b>changes</b> {{and chest}} {{symptoms}} suggestive of myocardial ischemia {{have been reported}} in healthy women during cesarean section under regional anesthesia. This study aimed to determine the incidence of <b>ECG</b> <b>changes</b> and find any relation between the changes and subjective chest symptoms, hemodynamic variables, oxytocin, and ephedrine administration. Materials and Methods: <b>ECG</b> <b>changes</b> were recorded in 237 term parturients during elective cesarean section done under spinal anesthesia. ST-T depression of ≥ 1 mm and elevation of ≥ 2 mm for at least 1 -min were considered as significant. Timing of hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, <b>ECG</b> <b>changes,</b> and chest symptoms were recorded. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the association between ST changes and subjective chest symptoms, hemodynamic variables, oxytocin, or ephedrine administration. Results: Of 237 patients, 71 (30 %) had significant ST-T depression, and 83 (35 %) complained of chest symptoms (pressure, squeezing, pain, or dyspnea). Of 71, 42 had chest symptoms. Chest symptoms were also experienced by 30 (18 %) patients where no <b>change</b> in <b>ECG</b> was seen (166 / 237). The changes were more commonly noted at delivery or 3 - 10 min after oxytocin administration. No correlation was found between <b>ECG</b> <b>changes</b> and chest symptoms, hemodynamic variables, and ephedrine, but there was moderate positive relation with oxytocin. Conclusion: Chest symptoms and <b>ECG</b> <b>changes</b> consistent with myocardial ischemia were observed in about 1 / 3 healthy parturients during cesarean section.

The primary endpoint was fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) event and the secondary was fatal or nonfatal CVD event. In our study, 2, 236 fatal CVD and 3, 849 fatal or nonfatal CVD events occurred during a median of 11. 9 and 9. 8 years of follow-up.
