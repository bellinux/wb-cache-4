In 1987, Malaysia and other neighbouring countries saw a sudden {{increase in the number}} of Vietnamese refugees landing in Malaysia. At an ASEAN summit in June 1987, member countries chastised the Vietnamese government for not having sufficiently addressed the refugee problem.|$|E

Additionally, the Oakridge yard was home to many retired coaches, including E901/902 trolleys, New Flyer D40s, and other vehicles. In Spring of 2008, as part of a re-organization and expansion at Burnaby <b>Transit</b> <b>Centre,</b> Oakridge took over many of the tasks formerly located at the other facility. The Community Shuttle Service was one of the groups moved making Oakridge an active <b>transit</b> <b>centre</b> once again. However, in September 2016, the shuttle operations were shifted to the new Hamilton <b>Transit</b> <b>Centre.</b> The property has since been sold for $440 million to a developer.|$|E
