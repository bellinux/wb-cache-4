5|$|M-102 {{was first}} {{designated}} along 8Mile Road from US10 (Woodward Avenue, now M-1) to US25 (Gratiot Avenue, now M-3) in late 1928 or early 1929. In 1939, the eastern terminus was moved as M-102 was extended along 8Mile and Vernier Roads <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> Grosse Pointe Shores at M-29 (Jefferson Avenue). The highway was extended {{in the early}} 1940s from Woodward westward to US16 (Grand River Avenue, now M-5).|$|E

5|$|A {{rerouting}} of trunklines in 1941 lead to {{the creation}} of a Business US12 (BUS US12). M-96 ran concurrently with BUS US12 and M-37 was truncated to end at M-96. US12 was rerouted between Galesburg and Kalamazoo in 1954, and M-96 was extended along the former US12 routing <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> Kalamazoo. M-96 was rerouted in downtown Battle Creek to one-way streets in 1958, and BUS US12/M-96 was extended by the end of the decade when the I-94/US12 freeway was completed in the area. BUS US12 was redesignated as Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) in 1960 and M-96 was shortened to end at BL I-94/M-78 running on Capital Avenue. M-37 was reextended in 1961 in Battle Creek to a concurrent routing with M-96 in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Both teams' {{responses}} to Liverpool's third goal {{were to make}} substitutions in the final quarter of the game. Liverpool defender Rob Jones was swapped for striker Ian Rush and Newcastle's Darren Peacock was changed for Steve Howey in order to tighten up the Newcastle defence. As the match looked likely <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> a draw, in stoppage time Rush and John Barnes began to play a series of one-twos towards the Newcastle end. Barnes passed the ball to Collymore in a space on the left flank; Collymore kicked it past Srníček to score his second goal of the game, which prompted jubilant scenes in the Liverpool Kop. In contrast, Keegan slumped over the advertising hoardings in distress.|$|E

5|$|Celtic faced Yugoslavia (now Serbian) side Vojvodina Novi Sad in the quarter-finals, {{and lost}} {{the first leg}} 1–0 after a goal from Milan Stanić; this was Celtic's only defeat of the competition. The tie {{looked like it was}} going <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> a draw after Chalmers had given Celtic a 1–0 lead in the second leg. This would have {{resulted}} in the teams from having to go to Rotterdam for a replay. However, in the 90th minute captain Billy McNeill scored to give Celtic the victory. In the semi-finals, Czechoslovakian side Dukla Prague were beaten 3–1 in Glasgow, Johnstone put the hosts in front, before Stanislav Štrunc equalised. A second half brace from Willie Wallace gave Celtic the victory. The teams then drew 0–0 in Prague, which meant Celtic progressed to the final.|$|E
5|$|Cidade do Galo ("Rooster City"), the club's main {{training}} facility since 2001, has been lauded {{as the best}} in Brazil and {{is considered one of}} the best in the world; it hosted the Argentina national football team at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Other facilities owned by the club include Vila Olímpica ("Olympic Village"), the old training grounds opened in 1973 that hosted the Seleção in its preparation for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and Labareda, a leisure and health club in Belo Horizonte. In 2015, Daniel Nepomuceno, the club president, announced that Atlético had a four-year project to build a new stadium in Belo Horizonte, with a 45,000 capacity. In 2017, the club's Deliberative Council approved the project to build the new stadium, in northeastern Belo Horizonte.

5|$|Coming in at 7/173, Meckiff top-scored with 55—his only {{first-class}} 50—as Victoria batted {{first and}} made a late recovery to end with 244. Meckiff took 3/65, including the wickets of Test players Bill Watson and Richie Benaud as New South Wales responded with 281. In the Victorian second innings Meckiff managed only 8 as Victoria left their opponents a target of 161 runs for victory. The paceman took 4/56 and claimed the final wicket, removing Test opener Jim Burke caught for 8 as New South Wales mustered 160, causing the match <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> the first tie in Shield history. Burke had returned to bat after being injured earlier in the innings, while New South Wales captain Ian Craig, who had been ill, hauled himself {{out of bed in}} an attempt to salvage the match after his team had fallen to 7/70. Meckiff's other victims in the final innings included Test players Alan Davidson and Johnny Martin.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route15, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} initially extended from Hornell {{in the south}} to Caledonia in the north via Dansville and Mount Morris. Also assigned at this time was Route16, which went from Cuba to Rochester via Le Roy and Caledonia. Much of Route15 followed modern NY36; however, from Dansville to Mount Morris, it used what is now NY63 and NY408 instead. Route16, meanwhile, followed current NY36 from Caledonia to Mumford. From Jasper to Hornell, modern NY36 was part of the cross-state Route4. On March1, 1921, Route16 was truncated <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> Le Roy. Its former routing north of Caledonia became part of Route15.|$|E

These plans were thwarted by {{the outbreak of the}} war. Neubronner had to provide all his pigeons and equipment to the military, which tested them in the battlefield with satisfactory results, but did not employ the technique more widely.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, M-69 {{started at}} the state line south of Crystal Falls. It ran north through Crystal Falls, where it intersected M-12, <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> Covington at an {{intersection}} with M-28. This roadway was redesignated {{with the creation of}} the U.S. Highway System in 1926. US2 replaced M-69 south and M-12 west of Crystal Falls. US102 replaced M-69 north of Crystal Falls, and the latter designation was reused on the section of M-12 east of town. Where the roadway intersected M-45 (now M-95) in Sagola, M-69 joined it to Randville and then replaced M-90 east to Foster City by 1927. By 1930, the highway was extended through Menominee County into Delta County to end at an intersection with US2/US41 east of Bark River. This extension gave M-69 its current routing.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, {{this version}} of M-64 was renumbered M-9. In 1934, M-9 {{traveled}} on Pioneer Road in Hillsdale County, from the Ohio border before turning west on Burt Road, north on Clark Road, west on Montgomery Road then north onto Hillsdale Road. During this time a loop was planned to continue north {{from the corner of}} Pioneer and Burt Roads to Montgomery Road where it turned west and met back up with M-9 at Clark Road. This short loop was designated M-158, however later in the year the routing of M-9 was shifted onto the M-158 alignment, eliminating that route. By the middle of 1936, the highway was extended northward <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> Lansing. The M-9 designation was replaced with M-99 in 1940.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, {{the first}} {{segment of the}} current routing of M-65 was designated. At the time, the road ran from an {{intersection}} with US23 and M-55 near Whittemore and ran north to Hale. US23 was moved from its inland routing to follow a shoreline alignment along Saginaw Bay around 1932. The former route through Twinning and Whittemore became an extension of M-65 {{as a part of}} these changes. By 1936, the highway was lengthened northwards <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> Glennie; a second segment was also added that ran north from the Alcona–Alpena county line to Lachine. Around the end of the decade, US23's routing was moved in another location to follow the lakeshore; this time the highway was rerouted between Alpena and Rogers City. M-65 was extended northwards from Lachine through Posen to terminate at M-91 downtown Rogers City. By 1945, this northernmost segment downtown was redesignated Business US23, and M-65 was truncated to its junction with US23 southeast of town.|$|E

5|$|In Toronto, {{engineers}} and surveyors were examining the four-lane bypass, while planners set about designing {{a way to}} handle the commuter highway. In 1963, transportation minister Charles MacNaughton announced the widening of Highway401 in Toronto from four to a minimum of 12lanes between Islington Avenue and Markham Road. The design {{was taken from the}} Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago, which was widened into a similar configuration around the same time. Construction began immediately. While the plan initially called for construction <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> 1967, it continued for nearly a decade. At least four lanes were always open during the large reconstruction project, which included complex new interchanges at Highway27, Highway400, the planned Spadina Expressway and the Don Valley Parkway. The system was completed in 1972, along with the Highway27 (renamed Highway427) bypass between the QEW and Pearson Airport. Most of the interchanges in Toronto were reconstructed as partial cloverleafs and a continuous lighting system was installed.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, US9W was truncated to Albany while US9 was rerouted {{to follow a}} new stretch between Albany and Round Lake. The former routing of both routes along the Hudson River between Albany and Mechanicville, {{as well as the}} entirety of NY58 and the portion of NY30 from Schuylerville to Glens Falls was integrated into the new NY32, which followed its current routing between Harriman and the Stillwater community of Bemis Heights and from Schuylerville to Glens Falls. Between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville, NY32 followed what is now US4 along the Hudson River while the former routing of NY30 between the two locations became NY32A. At the same time, US4, which previously ended in Glens Falls, was rerouted south of Hudson Falls <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> East Greenbush. From Northumberland to Waterford, the route used what is now NY32.|$|E
