It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E
5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E

500|$|After {{seeing the}} first three episodes, Maxwell Zachs called the series [...] "a disappointment".

500|$|Several {{explanations}} for his disappearance are current. One {{is related to}} the death of the president of Italy's state-owned oil and gas conglomerate ENI, Enrico Mattei. Another is that De Mauro had discovered drug trafficking between Sicily and the United States. A third explanation links his disappearance with the Golpe Borghese, a planned right-wing coup d'état (the plan failed in December 1970). Apparently De Mauro was convinced that he had got hold of a story of a lifetime. Before his disappearance he told colleagues at the newspaper L'Ora, [...] "I have a scoop <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> shake Italy." ...|$|E

500|$|The game itself {{includes}} a filter that players can activate with a password so that violent or sexually explicit content is censored. When the filter is in place, the screen blurs {{during the most}} violent sections, so the player can hear the action but cannot see it. Sierra officials believed {{it was the first}} CD-ROM adventure game that self-censored upon command. Sierra producer Mark Seibert said: [...] "There are some pretty gruesome things, and we're concerned about how <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> impact parents who want to buy a good game with a good story line." [...] But Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the censoring option was [...] "unlikely to stop any computer-literate 10-year-old" [...] and by scrambling portions of the videos that might be considered offensive, [...] "the censorship option actually makes the explicit scenes seem even worse than they really are".|$|E
500|$|In September 1970, De Mauro {{was again}} {{investigating}} the case, upon {{request of the}} movie director Francesco Rosi for the movie Il caso Mattei (The Mattei Affair), which would be released in 1972. He was convinced that Mattei's aircraft had been sabotaged and looked into possible links of the Mafia with the crash. Two days before his disappearance, De Mauro interviewed Graziano Verzotto, a Christian Democrat politician and former right-hand man of Mattei on Sicily. Verzotto had been head of public relations of ENI and knew De Mauro quite well. Verzotto also knew Mafia boss Giuseppe Di Cristina quite well; he had been best man at De Cristina’s wedding. Verzotto had been with Mattei on his airplane the day before it crashed. De Mauro was convinced that he had got hold of {{a story of a}} lifetime. Before his disappearance he told colleagues at the newspaper L'Ora, “I have a scoop <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> shake Italy.” ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{revolved}} around themes of evolution, {{as well as}} her paranoias represented on The Fame Monster. While developing the tour Gaga spoke about original sin and demons inside human beings; [...] "So we talked about growth, and that led us into this kind of scientific space, and we started talking about evolution and the evolution of humanity and how we begin as one thing, and we become another." [...] This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was [...] "another level from where we were with the Fame Ball. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." [...] Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that {{she did not want to}} use any of the things that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was [...] "the great lost tour", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.|$|E

And really not have anything <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> overshadow that. She's trying to grow {{as an artist and}} along the way she's taking all kinds of risks {{and a lot of times}} people let those things overshadow her ability and her talent. I wanted to bring it all back as a sort of bookend to this album". The video begins with a close-up scene of Aguilera and zooms out to her wearing a slip and sitting in an abandoned prop room. In one continuous black and white shot, Aguilera walks through several rooms, exits the building, and finally lays on a light box. The video was filmed at a deserted theater in downtown Los Angeles. It was inspired by neorealist works. The video was nominated for three 2004 MTV Video Music Awards: Best Female Video, Viewer's Choice, and Best Cinematography.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{finally decided}} {{to go on the}} tour, time was short and she had to prepare the show within three months. Auditioning for the dancers started around March 2001. Jamie King was signed up as the {{creative}} director and the choreographer of the show. King {{said in an interview that}} the tour [...] "was so hectic that I suffered from depressions and fell considerably ill." [...] Rehearsals continued for thirteen hours a day, five days a week, with more and more dancers joining for the show. In the end, ten dancers and two backup singers were used. Madonna had her guitarist Monte Pittman teach her to play the instrument, and she played both acoustic and electric guitar live in the show. French house music expert Stuart Price, who had worked with Madonna on remixes of her album Music, was signed as bassist and keyboards player. Clair Brothers Audio support was roped in for providing a mixture of high-tech techno sound and fusion of acoustic and trance. Madonna clarified: [...] "I don't see the point of doing a show unless you offer something <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> mind-boggle the senses. It's not enough to get on stage and sing a song. It's all about theatre and drama and surprises and suspenses." ...|$|E
