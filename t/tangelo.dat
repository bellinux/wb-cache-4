40|$|The {{mandarin}} horticultural {{group is}} an important component of world citrus production for the fresh fruit market. This group formerly classified as C. reticulata is highly polymorphic and recent molecular studies have suggested that numerous cultivated mandarins were introgressed by C. maxima (the pummelos). C. maxima and C. reticulata are also the ancestors of sweet and sour oranges, grapefruit, and therefore of all the "small citrus" modern varieties (mandarins, tangors, <b>tangelos)</b> derived from sexual hybridization between these horticultural groups. Recently, NGS technologies have greatly modified how plant evolution and genomic structure are analyzed, moving from phylogenetics to phylogenomics. The objective of this work was to develop a workflow for phylogenomic inference from Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) data and to analyze the interspecific admixture along the nine citrus chromosomes for horticultural groups and recent varieties resulting from the combination of the C. reticulata and C. maxima gene pools. A GBS library was established from 55 citrus varieties, using the ApekI restriction enzyme and selective PCR to improve the read depth. Diagnostic polymorphisms (DPs) of C. reticulata/C. maxima differentiation were identified and used to decipher the phylogenomic structure of the 55 varieties. The GBS approach was powerful and revealed 30, 289 SNPs and 8, 794 Indels with 12. 6 % of missing data. 11, 133 DPs were selected covering the nine chromosomes with a higher density in genic regions. GBS combined with the detection of DPs was powerful for deciphering the "phylogenomic karyotypes" of cultivars derived from admixture of the two ancestral species after a limited number of interspecific recombinations. All the mandarins, mandarin hybrids, <b>tangelos</b> and tangors analyzed displayed introgression of C. maxima {{in different parts of the}} genome. C. reticulata/C. maxima admixture should be a major component of the high phenotypic variability of this germplasm opening up the way for association studies based on phylogenomics...|$|R

5000|$|The Minneola <b>tangelo</b> (sometimes misspelled [...] "Mineola") is a {{cross between}} a Duncan {{grapefruit}} and a Dancy tangerine, and was released in 1931 by the USDA Horticultural Research Station in Orlando. It is named after Minneola, Florida. Most Minneola tangelos are characterised by a stem-end neck, which tends to make the fruit appear bell-shaped. Because of this, it is also called the Honeybell in the gift fruit trade, where {{it is one of the}} most popular varieties. A true Honeybell <b>Tangelo</b> is a hybrid-cross between Thompson tangerine and a pomelo, hence the name <b>Tangelo</b> released by the USDA. Both Minneolas and Honeybells are usually fairly large, typically 3-3½ inches in diameter; the Honeybells tend to be larger and sweeter. The peel colour, when mature, is a bright-reddish-orange colour. The rind of the Minneola is relatively thin, while the rind of the Honeybell is slightly thicker. Both the Minneola and Honeybell <b>Tangelo</b> peel rather easily. Both are very juicy. Both the Minneola and the Honeybell are not strongly self-fruitful, and yields will be greater when interplanted with suitable pollenisers such as Temple tangor, Sunburst tangerine, or possibly Fallglo tangerine. It tends to bear a good crop every other year. In the Northern Hemisphere the fruit matures in the December-February period, with January being the peak.|$|E

40|$|Alternaria rot {{of citrus}} {{is a serious}} problem in citrus {{production}} world wide. In Arizona, the disease is most commonly found in Minneola <b>tangelos</b> and navel oranges grown in Maricopa County. Alternaria rot occurs primarily as a stem-end rot on fruit held in cold storage. However, under optimum conditions the disease occurs as a stylar-end rot in the orchards. In Arizona, the disease can significantly reduce yield, and annual fruit losses have been estimated at 0. 5 box per tree. In terms of fruit quality, this disease can be a serious problem for the fresh fruit market {{as well as for the}} processing industry because only a small amount of rot imparts a bitter flavor and small black fragments of rotted tissue spoil the appearance of the juice. The application of fungicides is the most common tactic used to reduce losses to this disease. However, to date, no consistent reduction in disease has been achieved through chemical applications.
