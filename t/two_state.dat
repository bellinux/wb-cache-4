These streets carried both highways around the downtown business district in this arrangement until November 2009.|$|E
5|$|During the war, <b>two</b> <b>state</b> {{elections}} were held, in 1941 and 1944. In the 1941 election, {{there was a}} significant decrease in the independent vote, and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. This was in large part due to the LCL's shift to the right on social issues to usurp the independents' appeal. In 1942, compulsory voting (but not enrolment) was introduced, and first took effect at the 1944 election, with an increase in voter turnout from 51% to 89%. Again Playford won with a one-seat LCL majority, hanging on {{with the help of the}} malapportioned electoral system.|$|E

The family was forced to move, but was held together by the perseverance of Dodd's mother. During the next three seasons, the Kingsport Indians were very successful, gaining <b>two</b> <b>state</b> titles. They were helped by Dodd, who moved from receiver to quarterback and kicker. In 1926, Bobby Dodd graduated and {{was admitted to the}} University of Tennessee with a football scholarship.|$|E
5|$|While {{the border}} on land was firmly {{set in the}} early 20th century, the <b>two</b> <b>states</b> were still in {{disagreement}} {{on the path of}} the border to the east, in Lake Erie. In 1973, the <b>two</b> <b>states</b> finally obtained a hearing before the United States Supreme Court on their competing claims to the Lake Erie waters. In Michigan v. Ohio, the court upheld a special master's report and ruled that the boundary between the <b>two</b> <b>states</b> in Lake Erie was angled to the northeast, as described in Ohio's state constitution, and not a straight east–west line. One consequence of the court decision was that tiny Turtle Island just outside Maumee Bay and originally treated as being wholly in Michigan, was split between the <b>two</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R

M-123 also has a rare signed concurrency with a County-Designated Highway in Michigan; in Trout Lake, there is a concurrency with H-40. All of M-123 north of M-28 is a Scenic Heritage Route within the Michigan Heritage Route system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{description}} of the nucleon and Roper resonance in a quark-diquark approach is presented. We show that <b>two</b> <b>states</b> with the quantum number of the nucleon can appear in the ground state of the spatial configuration, when {{there are two types}} of diquarks: scalar-isoscalar and axialvector-isovector diquarks. The mass difference between the <b>two</b> <b>states</b> is generated by the mass difference between the two diquarks, which is due to the spin-spin interaction between the two quarks in the diquarks. The <b>two</b> <b>states</b> are then identified with the nucleon and Roper resonance...|$|R
50|$|Historically, Northeastern California has {{had strong}} ties to Nevada, with the exact {{boundary}} between the <b>two</b> <b>states</b> in some dispute. Residents of portions of near Susanville, California, tried {{to break away from}} California in 1856, first by declaring themselves part of the Nataqua Territory and then through annexation to Nevada. The <b>two</b> <b>states</b> further squabbled over ownership of Susanville in 1863. The town of Aurora, Nevada, was temporarily the county seat of both Mono County, California, and Esmeralda County, Nevada. Finally, the line between the <b>two</b> <b>states</b> was settled by a survey in 1872.|$|R
5|$|The {{athletic}} {{program has}} fielded several {{teams that have}} placed fourth or higher in state tournaments. In the 2014-2015 school year the girls' volleyball team and the girls' basketball team both won IHSA state titles, which makes Benet only the second school in IHSA history and the first large (4A) school to win titles for both these sports in the same season. The boys' basketball team has broken <b>two</b> <b>state</b> records, including a 102 home-game winning streak. In the 2015-2016 year the boys' basketball team ended up getting second in the state, with the girls taking first, {{along with many other}} state titles in other sports.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner product}} between <b>two</b> <b>state</b> vectors {{is a complex}} number known as a {{probability}} amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, {{the probability that a}} system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator—which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must be real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.|$|E

It is planned to replace all the current buildings, which date back to 1951.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} biological phenomena, a new mathematical field was proposed by T. Kitagawa in 1970 and it was named biomathematics. T. Kitagawa and M. Yamaguchi discussed cell spaces which are one of approaches to establish biomathematics. More than <b>two</b> <b>states</b> are introduced in the cell space. By algebraic methods, in a cell space with four or <b>two</b> <b>states</b> it is proved that a set of all configurations is a vector space {{and a set of}} all possible stable configurations is a vector subspace. Thus, in the cell space with four or <b>two</b> <b>states</b> any stable configuration is represented by a superposition of elementary stable configurations. Furthermore, it is proved that in the cell space with <b>two</b> <b>states,</b> there exists one to one correspondence between the set of stable configurations and the set of garden of Eden configurations. The invariant boundary is introduced in the cell space with <b>two</b> <b>states,</b> which generate some variant cell subspaces whose configuration oscillates among definite configurations.

5|$|In 1929–30, ill-health {{restricted}} Jackson to {{just five}} first-class matches and five innings for Balmain. Despite his health, Jackson {{had a successful}} season, and scored 168 not out against Arthur Gilligan's English team, which toured Australia briefly en route to New Zealand. He {{was seen as an}} automatic selection for the 1930 Ashes tour of England. He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial, an innings regarded by many as the best he had ever played. Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia, missing the next <b>two</b> <b>state</b> matches. His health problems continued after an operation to remove his tonsils; a procedure that was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered any problems with his tonsils. Bill Ponsford had suffered from tonsillitis during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences. Complications resulting from the operation saw Jackson lose a stone (6.4 kilograms) in weight.|$|E

That same year, he engaged in a dialogue with Pope Paul VI as part of the pontiff's ostpolitik; the result was greater openness for the Roman Catholic Church in Eastern Europe. In 1971 Podgorny went on <b>two</b> <b>state</b> visits, the first to the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the second to North Vietnam; Kosygin went on a visit to Canada while Brezhnev visited Yugoslavia.
