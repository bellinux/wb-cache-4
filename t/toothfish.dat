5|$|The {{passing of}} the Antarctic Conservation Act (1978) in the U.S. brought several {{restrictions}} to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays {{a large role in}} the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of <b>toothfish</b> has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000tonnes (35,300short tons) in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{commercial}} fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries targeting more valuable {{species such as}} southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), swordfish (Xiphius gladius), and Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus eleginoides), including vessels operated by Japan, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of catch per unit effort (CPUE) for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though it is uncertain whether this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits. New Zealand has reported annual catches of 150–300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|Type D was {{identified}} based on photographs of a 1955 mass stranding in New Zealand and six at-sea sightings since 2004. The first video record {{of this type}} in life happened between the Kerguelen and Crozet Islands in 2014. It is immediately recognizable by its extremely small white eye patch, narrower and shorter than usual dorsal fin, bulbous head (similar to a pilot whale), and smaller teeth. Its geographic range appears to be circumglobal in subantarctic waters between latitudes 40°S and 60°S. And although nothing {{is known about the}} type D diet, it is suspected to include fish because groups have been photographed around longline vessels, where they reportedly prey on Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus eleginoides).|$|E
5|$|Scientists and conservationists (most {{importantly}} BirdLife International {{and their}} partners, {{who run the}} Save the Albatross campaign) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting longline bait at night, dyeing the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch. For example, a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species. The use of some of these techniques in the Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black-browed albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 the South Georgia {{government}} was {{cited by the}} Marine Stewardship Council for its sustainable Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> fishery, certifying that South Georgia met the MSC's environmental standards. The certificate places limits on the timing and quantity of Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> that may be caught.|$|E
25|$|Between 1 July 1998 and 30 June 1999, {{fisheries}} landed 119,898 tonnes, {{of which}} 85% consisted of krill and 14% of Patagonian <b>toothfish.</b> International agreements came into force in late 1999 to reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, {{which in the}} 1998–99 season landed five to six times more Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> than the regulated fishery.|$|E
25|$|Increased solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation {{resulting from the}} Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) {{by as much as}} 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for <b>toothfish</b> causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.|$|E
25|$|Another {{abundant}} fish {{group is}} the Notothenia genus, which like the Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> have antifreeze in their bodies.|$|E
25|$|Another {{on-going}} {{concern is}} overfishing of the Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> and the albatross population is monitored. The {{waters of the}} Crozet Islands are patrolled by the French government.|$|E
25|$|Deepwater benthopelagic {{fish are}} robust, muscular {{swimmers}} that actively cruise the bottom searching for prey. They often live around features, such as seamounts, which have strong currents. Commercial examples are the orange roughy and Patagonian <b>toothfish.</b>|$|E
25|$|In October 1997, the Anzac {{conducted}} Operation Dirk {{supported by}} HMAS Westralia targeting illegal fishing {{vessels in the}} Southern Ocean catching the Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> around Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the Australian Fisheries Zone with the Salvora and the Aliza Glacial apprehended boarded by Clearance divers.|$|E
25|$|Robust benthopelagic {{fish are}} muscular {{swimmers}} that actively cruise the bottom searching for prey. They may live around features, such as seamounts, which have strong currents. Examples are the orange roughy and Patagonian <b>toothfish.</b> Because these fish were once abundant, and because their robust bodies are good to eat, these fish have been commercially harvested.|$|E
25|$|Fishing {{takes place}} around South Georgia and in {{adjacent}} waters in some {{months of the}} year, with fishing licences sold by the territory for Patagonian <b>toothfish,</b> cod icefish and krill. Fishing licences bring in millions of pounds a year, most of which is spent on fishery protection and research. All fisheries are regulated and managed {{in accordance with the}} Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) system.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Te Kaha pursued Patagonian <b>Toothfish</b> poachers in the Ross Dependency, {{participated in}} the INTERFET {{multinational}} deployment to East Timor, and operated {{as part of the}} Multinational Interception Force in the Persian Gulf. The New Zealand frigates served periods as guardship at the Solomon Islands capital of Honiara during 2000 and 2001. In 2002, Te Kaha returned to the Persian Gulf, this time as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, after a four-month flag-showing deployment in Asian waters. The frigate was replaced in the Gulf by Te Mana in early 2003.|$|E
25|$|Many {{deep sea}} fish are at risk, such as orange roughy, Patagonian <b>toothfish,</b> and sablefish. The deep sea is almost {{completely}} dark, near freezing and has little food. Deep sea fish grow slowly because of limited food, have slow metabolisms, low reproductive rates, and many don't reach breeding maturity for 30 to 40 years. A fillet of orange roughy {{at the store}} is probably at least 50 years old. Most deep sea fish are in international waters, {{where there are no}} legal protections. Most of these fish are caught by deep trawlers near seamounts, where they congregate because of food. Flash freezing allows the trawlers to work for days at a time, and modern fishfinders target the fish with ease.|$|E
500|$|An older study, {{examining}} whales {{captured by}} the New Zealand whaling fleet in the Cook Strait region, found a 1.69:1 ratio of squid to fish by weight. Sperm whales sometimes take sablefish and <b>toothfish</b> from long lines. Long-line fishing operations in the Gulf of Alaska complain that sperm whales {{take advantage of their}} fishing operations to eat desirable species straight off the line, sparing the whales the need to hunt. However, the amount of fish taken is very little compared to what the sperm whale needs per day. Video footage has been captured of a large male sperm whale [...] "bouncing" [...] a long line, to gain the fish. Sperm whales are believed to prey on the megamouth shark, a rare and large deep-sea species discovered in the 1970s. In one case, three sperm whales were observed attacking or playing with a megamouth.|$|E
500|$|On 12 April 2001, an SASR troop {{conducted}} a boarding {{of the fishing}} vessel South Tomi using two RHIBs launched from the South African Navy vessel SAS Protea in international waters [...] south of Cape Agulhas, South Africa. On 29 March, the Togo registered South Tomi fled the AFMA fisheries patrol vessel Southern Supporter after being detected poaching Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> near Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the Southern Ocean. The South Tomi fled towards Africa with the South African government agreeing to a request to provide a South African Navy vessel for an intercept. The SASR troop was flown on a commercial flight to South Africa. South Tomi was boarded after a pursuit of [...] by the Southern Supporter. In August 2001, the SASR {{was involved in the}} Tampa affair when its counter-terrorist squadron was ordered to Christmas Island and to board the MV Tampa once it illegally entered Australian waters. While the members of the SASR involved did what they could to improve conditions on the Tampa, the use of an elite military unit to prevent asylum seekers landing in Australia was not supported by all members of the regiment and remains controversial. Less controversial was the SASR's involvement in the boarding of a North Korean freighter, the MV Pong Su—which was suspected of drug smuggling—off Newcastle on 20 April 2003 [...]|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two species}} from the Dissostichus genus, the Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus mawsoni) and the Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus eleginoides). These two species {{live on the}} {{seafloor}} [...] deep, and can grow to around [...] long weighing up to , living up to 45 years. The Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> lives close to the Antarctic mainland, whereas the Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> lives in the relatively warmer subantarctic waters. Due to the low water temperatures around the mainland, the Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> has antifreeze proteins in its blood and tissues. <b>Toothfish</b> are commercially fished, and overfishing has reduced <b>toothfish</b> populations.|$|E

2500|$|The world's largest invertebrate, {{the colossal}} squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni), roams the deep {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean where it is {{believed}} to be an ambush predator of prey such as chaetognatha, large fish such as the Patagonian <b>toothfish,</b> and other squid. It is thought to have a slow metabolic rate, needing only around [...] of prey daily. [...] A single 5kg Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> provides enough nourishment for a 500kg colossal squid to survive for 200 days. [...] These estimates of its energetic demands suggest it is a slow-moving ambush predator which uses its large eyes primarily for predator detection rather than active hunting.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two species}} from the Dissostichus genus, the Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus mawsoni) and the Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus eleginoides). These two species {{live on the}} {{seafloor}} 100 - 3000 m deep, and can grow to around 2 m long weighing up to 100 kg, living up to 45 years. The Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> lives close to the Antarctic mainland, whereas the Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> lives in the relatively warmer subantarctic waters. Due to the low water temperatures around the mainland, the Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> has antifreeze proteins in its blood and tissues. <b>Toothfish</b> are commercially fished, and overfishing has reduced <b>toothfish</b> populations.|$|E
50|$|The Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus eleginoides) and Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> (Dissostichus mawsoni) was {{one measure}} that ensured {{reductions}} in illegal fishing for <b>toothfish</b> {{and reduced the}} scope for trade in illegally caught fish. The CDS is an innovative online catch document information system (DCD: Dissostichus Catch Document) developed to identify legal <b>toothfish</b> harvested, which tracks <b>toothfish</b> {{from the point of}} landing throughout the trade cycle to point of sale. The CDS requires verification and authorisation by national authorities at regular intervals in the trade cycle. Identification of the origin of <b>toothfish</b> entering the ports and markets of CDS Parties is essential.|$|E
50|$|The Ross Sea fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 88.1 and 88.2) was {{the second}} <b>toothfish</b> fishery to be {{independently}} evaluated and certified by the MSC as sustainable and well managed (in 2010).

5000|$|Several {{other ships}} fishing {{illegally}} for <b>toothfish</b> were also {{put out of}} action by Operation Icefish.

5000|$|Due to the {{challenges}} that faced <b>toothfish</b> management in the 1990s and early 2000s (e.g., IUU fishing, mislabelling, and inadequate data for management), consumer seafood guides such as Seafood Watch placed <b>toothfish</b> of both species (Chilean seabass) on their red, or “avoid”, list; however, in light of up-to-date, internationally peer-reviewed scientific information, in April 2013, Seafood Watch upgraded the Ross Sea Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> fishery to a [...] "good alternative". Following a comprehensive review in 2012 the Monterey Bay Aquarium revised its rating of Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> to 'good alternative'.|$|E

50|$|The Macquarie Island <b>toothfish</b> {{fishery is}} within the Australian EEZ, and is {{situated}} outside the CCAMLR Convention Area within FAO Statistical Area 81, though it is managed in a complementary way with the conservation measures adopted by CCAMLR. In May 2012, this was the fourth <b>toothfish</b> fishery to gain MSC certification. There are 2 Australian companies that are allocated to catch 410t of <b>toothfish</b> in 2014/15.|$|E
5000|$|Over the {{continental}} shelf, Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> feed on shrimp (Nauticaris spp.) and small fish, principally another neutrally buoyant nototheniid, the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum). This loosely schooling species {{is also a}} major prey of Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis). [...] Therefore, competition for prey among <b>toothfish</b> and these other mesopredators (middle trophic level predators) could be very important. The large Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> are eaten by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), killer whales (Orcinus orca), Weddell seals and possibly colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni). <b>Toothfish</b> that are dwelling on the bottom, particularly those caught during the summer on {{the continental}} slope, eat mainly grenadiers (Macrouridae) but also feed on other smaller fish species and skates (Raja spp.). Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> have been caught to depths of 2200m, though based on commercial fishing effort, few occur that deep.|$|E
50|$|The Coalition of Legal <b>Toothfish</b> Operators, Inc. (COLTO) is a <b>toothfish</b> fishing {{industry}} body whose members represent over 90% {{of the legal}} <b>toothfish</b> catch worldwide. Six of the fisheries that are fished by COLTO members are now independently certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) as sustainable and well managed fisheries, and one more fishery (Crozet Islands, France: 3% of world catch) is currently undergoing full assessment against the independent MSC standards. Commercial fishing of Patagonian and Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> is managed by CCAMLR around most of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions, however a fishery that lies within a nation’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is managed by that nation, taking into account management recommendations and approaches by CCAMLR.|$|E
50|$|The Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> has a lightweight, {{partially}} cartilaginous skeleton, lacks a swim bladder, and has fatty deposits which {{act as a}} {{stored energy}} source, particularly during spawning. This fat also makes large <b>toothfish</b> neutrally buoyant. Many <b>toothfish</b> caught over the seamounts are very depleted of fat, and this is thought perhaps {{to be related to}} spawning and spawning migration, which are energy-demanding activities. It is not known what happens to these fat-depleted fish, including whether they reach, or how long it takes them to reach, breeding condition again; this ostensibly occurs upon returning to continental slope waters. Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> have vision and lateral line systems well adapted to find prey in low light levels. Since ice covers the surface of the ocean where Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> occur even in summer, these sensory specializations likely evolved to enable survival in the reduced light levels found under ice and in the Antarctic winter, as well as at deep depths. Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> also have a very well developed sense of smell, which is why they are easily caught by baited hooks and also scavenge the remains of penguins killed by other predators.|$|E

50|$|Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> spawn in {{deep water}} (around 1,000m) during the austral winter, {{producing}} pelagic eggs and larvae. Larvae switch to a demersal habitat at around 100m (1 year old) and inhabit relatively shallow water (<300m) until 6-7 years of age, when they begin a gradual migration into deeper water. As juveniles in shallow water, <b>toothfish</b> are primarily piscivorous, consuming the most abundant suitably sized local prey. With increasing size and habitat depth, the diet diversifies and includes more scavenging of squid, fish, and crustaceans. In turn, <b>toothfish</b> constitute {{a small part of}} the diets of sperm whales, southern elephant seals, and colossal squid.|$|E
