5|$|OutRun Online Arcade {{features}} four {{modes of}} play: OutRun, Time Attack, Continuous Race, and Heart Attack. In OutRun mode, the player drives through five of fifteen stages, selecting them en route. The Continuous mode {{is similar to}} OutRun mode, but instead the player must drive through all fifteen stages. As in previous games in the series, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> limit that is extended upon passing checkpoints. Time Attack mode has the player race a ghost car over a pre-selected set of stages while timed. Time checks are presented to the player at various points on each stage.|$|E
5|$|Players {{choose a}} course, a car, a {{transmission}} (automatic or six-speed manual), and a song. The cars {{vary in their}} specifications: some have a high top speed, others excel at acceleration or turning, and others present a balance. Certain cars are named after other Namco games such as Solvalou, Mappy, Bosconian, Nebulasray, and Xevious. The racetrack can be observed from the first-person perspective or, for the PlayStation version, from the third-person perspective. Namco's NeGcon controller {{can be used to}} play. Because the game is an arcade-style racing game, collisions do no damage, and merely slow the player down. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> limit, which ends the race if counted down to zero.|$|E

25|$|Androgens may {{modulate}} the {{physiology of}} vaginal tissue {{and contribute to}} female genital sexual arousal. Women's level of testosterone is higher when measured pre-intercourse vs pre-cuddling, as well as post-intercourse vs post-cuddling. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> lag effect when testosterone is administered, on genital arousal in women. In addition, a continuous increase in vaginal sexual arousal may result in higher genital sensations and sexual appetitive behaviors.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} this whistle {{has only two}} stages. The sound field was {{measured}} and clearly indicated a dipole whose axis was aligned with the jet axis. Since there were no reflecting surfaces near the source, the data also indicated that a weaker radial dipole component also existed. Such a field can only exist if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> delay at a distant point between each of the force components.|$|E
25|$|For DSA, {{the same}} {{sequence}} of a projection is acquired without {{and then with}} contrast agent injection through the vessels under investigation. The first image is subtracted from the second to remove background structures such as bones {{as completely as possible}} and show the contrast-filled vessels more clearly. As <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> lag between the acquisition of the first and the second image, motion correction algorithms are necessary to remove movement artifacts.|$|E

25|$|In {{recognized}} competitions, {{all players}} {{are required to}} record all the moves of both players in order to resolve disputes about whether a player has made an illegal move and what the position should now be. In addition, if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> limit rule that requires each player to complete a specified number of moves in a specified time, {{as there is in}} most serious competition, an accurate count of the moves must be kept. All chess coaches strongly recommend the recording of one's games so that one can look for improvements in one's play. The algebraic and descriptive notations are also used in books about chess.|$|E
25|$|Tomislav's ancestry is not known, but he {{probably}} hailed from the House of Trpimirović. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> difference of {{almost twenty years}} between the first attestation of Tomislav's name and the last mention of Muncimir, his predecessor as the Duke of Croatia. The historical records of him are scarce, but {{it is assumed that}} {{he was the son of}} Muncimir. Tomislav succeeded Muncimir, son of Trpimir I, on the throne of the Duchy of Croatia, either directly in about 910, which is the most widely accepted view, or after the rule of different figures following Muncimir's death. In any case, Tomislav gained the throne of Croatia at some time between 910 and 914. In Historia Salonitana ("History of Salona"), a chronicle from the 13th century written by Thomas the Archdeacon from Split, Tomislav was mentioned as the Duke of Croatia in 914.|$|E
25|$|A game of bowling {{consists}} of ten frames. In each frame, the bowler {{will have two}} chances to knock down as many pins as possible with their bowling ball. In games {{with more than one}} bowler, as is common, every bowler will take their frame in a predetermined order before the next frame begins. If a bowler is able to knock down all ten pins with the first ball, they are awarded a strike. If the bowler is able to knock down all 10 pins with the two balls of a frame, it is known as a spare. Bonus pins are awarded for both of these, depending on what is scored in the next two balls (for a strike) or one ball (for a spare). The bowler is allowed to throw two extra balls for achieving a strike in the tenth frame, or one extra ball for achieving a spare. This allows for a potential of 12 strikes in a single game, and a maximum score of 300 pins, a perfect game. The player with the highest pinfall at the end of ten frames wins. Although, if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> limit and if time runs out before the end of ten frames bowling stops, and the person with the highest pinfall wins the game.|$|E
