5|$|Food {{power is}} an {{integral}} part of the politics of food. The idea of food power is used in embargoes, employment, and food politics. In order for a nation to utilize food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. On the smaller scale, particularly in some African countries, food power has been used as a weapon by opposing sides in internal wars and conflicts against <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Judenrats {{has been}} controversial. Both Raul Hilberg and Hannah Arendt, early historians of the Holocaust, argued that {{without the help of}} the Judenrats, the Germans would have been {{hampered}} in their extermination efforts. Arendt went further and condemned those Jews who served as leaders in the ghettos for helping destroy <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b> More recent historians have recognized that the situation facing the Jewish leaders was more complex – they faced conflicting sets of goals and had essentially no power to change the demands the Germans made of them.|$|E
25|$|His {{two main}} {{findings}} are that leaders actually do not lie {{very much to}} other countries, and that democratic leaders are actually more likely than autocrats to lie to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b> Thus, he starts his book by {{saying that it is}} not surprising that Saddam Hussein did not lie about having WMD—he truthfully said he had none—but that George Bush and some of his key advisors did lie to the American people about the threat from Iraq. Mearsheimer argues that leaders are most likely to lie to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> in democracies that fight wars of choice in distant places. He says that it is difficult for leaders to lie to other countries because there is not much trust among them, especially when security issues are at stake, and you need trust for lying to be effective. He says that it is easier for leaders to lie to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> because there is usually a good deal of trust between them.|$|E

25|$|According to Thomas L. Friedman, the Phalangist Damouri Brigade, which {{carried out}} the Sabra and Shatila {{massacre}} during the 1982 Lebanon War sought revenge {{not only for the}} assassination of Bashir Gemayel, but also for what he describes as past tribal killings of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> by Palestinians, including those at Damour.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) made {{efforts to}} improve the portrayals of Aboriginal people in its {{television}} dramas.

25|$|For the United States, piracy {{is one of}} the offenses {{against which}} Congress is {{delegated}} power to enact penal legislation by the Constitution of the United States, along with treason and offenses against the law of nations.

25|$|Political {{tensions}} ran so {{high that}} {{a small group of}} white Democrats in 1898 planned to take over the Wilmington government if their candidates were not elected. In the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898, more than 1,500 white men attacked the black newspaper and neighborhood, killed numerous men, and ran off the white Republican mayor and aldermen. They installed <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> and elected Alfred M. Waddell as mayor, in the only coup d'état in United States history.|$|E

25|$|Mearsheimer wrote a {{book that}} {{analyzes}} lying in international politics. He argues in Why Leaders Lie (Oxford University Press, 2011) that leaders lie to foreign audiences as well as <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> {{because they think it}} is good for their country. For example, he maintains that President Franklin D. Roosevelt lied about the Greer incident in September 1941, because he was deeply committed to getting the United States into World War II, which he thought was in America's national interest.|$|E

50|$|The {{emphasis}} of the programme for 2008 through 2012 was the appropriation of the various cultural heritages by <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>peoples,</b> through education and knowledge. This project also provided a framework and facilitated the development of best practices for cultural preservation. Euromed IV involved partners from the European Union and several Mediterranean Partner Countries including Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Tunisia.|$|R
25|$|In the 1930s some {{attempts}} were made to secure business loans for the clearance of the West End and Over-the-Rhine, but all failed {{due to the lack of}} local financing. By the 1950s, the city leaders ruled out slum clearance, believing it too closely resembled the abuses of social engineering committed by the Nazi and Soviet governments against <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b> Instead, with the evolution of civic theories and appreciation for historic architecture, they began to reconsider Over-the-Rhine as a historic area worth preserving.|$|E
25|$|The {{terms of}} the {{treaties}} under which the various protectorates were created north or south of the Zambezi provided for the rulers that signed them to retain significant powers over <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b> Despite this, the British South Africa Company either ended the powers of traditional rulers through warfare or eroded them by encouraging its own officials to take most of them over. By {{the end of the}} first decade of the 20th century, those traditional rulers that remained were restricted to largely ceremonial roles only.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the 19th century was characterized by economic changes, including the first factories in the city. The greatest influence on Ungvar among the political events of the 19th century {{was made by the}} Hungarian Revolution of 1848-1849, during which the native Hungarian nobility sought both get free of the Austrian Empire and to have authority over <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b> 27 March 1848 was officially celebrated in the city as the overthrow of the monarchy in Hungary. It is now celebrated in Hungary on the 15th of March.|$|E

50|$|Tripoli and its {{surrounding}} suburbs all lie within the Tripoli sha'biyah (district). In accordance with Libya's former Jamahiriya political system, Tripoli comprises Local People's Congresses where, in theory, the city's population discuss different matters and elect <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people's</b> committee; at present there are 29 Local People's Congresses. In reality, the former revolutionary committees severely limited the democratic process by closely supervising committee and congress elections at the branch and district levels of governments, Tripoli being no exception.|$|R
25|$|After the Sarajevo assassination, {{more than}} 30 {{citizens}} of Bečkerek were accused by the Austria-Hungary’s authorities of high treason. Among them was Dr. Emil Gavrila, who together with Svetozar Miletić and Jaša Tomić, {{worked very hard}} on the cultural and social strengthening of Serbs. The Serbs recruited in the Austria-Hungary’s army began soon to desert, {{so that they would}} not fight against <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b> 7000 of them formed volunteer detachments (people were from Banat and Srem) at the Eastern front and fought at Dobruja, but 79 of them fought on the Salonice front, too.|$|E
25|$|As {{the end of}} the war neared, {{the prisoners}} began to worry about their future {{position}} in Japanese society. A Press article stated that to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> they were considered dead. In September 1944 the prisoners told a neutral inspector that provision needed to be made for them to return as honourable citizens, or that they be given asylum on a Pacific island. They said if something could not be done mass suicide might result. After {{the end of the}} war they also worried that they could be attacked in New Zealand over the conditions of Japanese prisoner of war camps.|$|E
25|$|Guevara, {{who viewed}} {{the capture of}} the armored train as a priority, {{successfully}} mobilized the tractors {{of the school of}} Agronomy at the university to raise the rails of the railway. The train was therefore derailed as it transported troops away from the Capiro hill. The officers within tumbled out asking for a truce. At this, ordinary soldiers, whose morale was very low, began to fraternize with the rebels, saying that they were tired of fighting against <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b> Shortly afterwards the armored train was {{in the hands of the}} rebels and its 350 men and officers were transported as prisoners.|$|E
50|$|For nearly 200 {{years the}} Iroquois were a {{powerful}} factor in North American colonial policy-making decisions. Alignment with Iroquois offered political and strategic advantages to the colonies but the Iroquois preserved considerable independence. Some {{of their people}} settled in mission villages along the St. Lawrence River, becoming more {{closely tied to the}} French. While they participated in French raids on Dutch and later English settlements, where some Mohawk and other Iroquois settled, in general the Iroquois resisted attacking <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>peoples.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Pacific Plan is very {{different}} from earlier initiatives of the Pacific Islands Forum. ¹ The difference lies principally in the challenge it presents to Australia and New Zealand to engage with Forum island countries (FICs) as equal partners in Pacific development rather than as honorary members on the sidelines. It equally presents a challenge to island countries to acknowledge the problems older strategies for development have created for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>peoples.</b> If both challenges are not addressed they will undermine the Pacific Plan...|$|R
50|$|As {{there is}} a huge {{intermarriage}} and connection between peoples in both countries, culture spread are not an unusual thing in Malaysia despite national sentiments issue and accusation by neighbouring Indonesia over the alleged stealing of culture. For example, most Indonesian influenced food heritage such as Amplang, Ayam penyet, Bakso, Botok botok, Bubur pedas, Lontong, Nasi kuning, Pecal, Rempeyek, Rendang, Soto, Telur pindang and Tempeh are very popular in Malaysia since been introduced by <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>peoples</b> even before the colonial period when the cultural exchange was happen.|$|R
25|$|What {{happens to}} the Kaunians in the Darkness series is the {{equivalent}} to the Holocaust, where Kaunians under Algarvian control are systematically stripped of their rights and violence against them is ignored by the authorities. Eventually, Algarve, facing a desperate stalemate against Unkerlant, begins slaughtering Kaunians en masse to fuel vast quantities of death-energy-powered sorcery {{in an attempt to}} break the impasse. Mezentio's official aim is not to exterminate Kaunians but to win the war, thus Kaunians are provided with adequate food to keep them alive until they need to be sacrificed for the war effort. Unkerlant responds to these magical attacks by sacrificing <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> to attack Algarve in the same way.|$|E
25|$|The {{most obvious}} example of Russian {{support to the}} Abkhaz side in 1993 was the bombing of Georgian-held Sukhumi by Russian fighter-bombers. The Russian Defence {{minister}} Pavel Grachev consistently denied it, but after Georgians succeeded in bringing down one SU-27 fighter-bomber and UN experts identified the dead pilot as Russian it became irrefutable. Nevertheless, some equipment {{was turned over to}} Georgia according to the previous agreements in 1993. Russian general Grachev claimed that Georgian side has painted the aircraft to resemble Russian Air Force aircraft and bombed their own positions, killing hundreds of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> in Eshera and Sukhumi. This statement raised anger and utter contempt among Georgians toward the Russian side.|$|E
25|$|Carrington departs for the Space Centre, {{where he}} aims to unmask the alien ambassadors before {{the eyes of}} the world on an {{international}} TV hookup – and then call on the powers of the Earth to blast their spaceship from the skies. No one else knows what Carrington intends to say on TV: his plan calls for a surprise revelation of the alien nature of the space-suited figures. But the Doctor manages to send a radio message, and the Brigadier and UNIT soldiers rescue he and Liz, and also apprehend Reegan and his thugs. They race to the Space Centre where the Brigadier arrests Carrington before he can make his broadcast. He is taken away, protesting that he was only performing his moral duty. The Doctor arranges for Ralph Cornish and Liz to return the ambassadors to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people,</b> so that the three human astronauts can be released.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, the Constitutional Treaty was {{overwhelmingly}} {{rejected by}} the citizens of France and the Netherlands in two national referendums. In response, the heads of state decided to override their national democracies and adopt 95% {{of the content of}} the rejected treaty and name it the Treaty of Lisbon in an effort to subvert <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>peoples.</b> It was not put to the citizens for public approval except in Ireland where it was intiially rejected in June 2008 by the Irish electorate, a decision which was reversed in a second referendum in October 2009.|$|R
5000|$|Abu Isa {{believed}} {{that he was the}} last of five heralds from God announcing the imminent arrival of the messiah. Never did he claim to be the Messiah himself, but some of his followers felt that he would return after his death and bring the End Times. He made some minor alterations to the general set of Rabbinic laws and his followers became ascetic in their manners. The most radical of the Isawite beliefs was the acceptance of both Jesus and Muhammad as true prophets, but only to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>peoples.</b>|$|R
50|$|When the Japanese formed <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>people's</b> {{representative}} council for Aceh, Nyak Arif {{was chosen as}} its head. In 1943 he went to Japan with 14 other Sumatran leaders and brought before Emperor of Japan Hirohito; he reportedly refused to bow before the emperor in the Japanese tradition, although he did agree to nod. Upon returning to Aceh, he and Teuku Hasan delivered a speech permeated with subtle sarcasm about the greatness of the Empire of Japan. In 1944 Nyak Arif was chosen to be deputy chief of the People's Representative Council of Sumatra.|$|R
