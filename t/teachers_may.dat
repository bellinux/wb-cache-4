5|$|Primary school {{teachers}} are general {{teachers who have}} received their training at either the University of Iceland or the University of Akureyri. The typical course lasts three years. Lower secondary <b>teachers</b> <b>may</b> also be trained at the University of Iceland. A BA or BS degree is required in this situation. The courses {{are designed to be}} both academic and practical. Municipalities are responsible for the employment of teachers. Optional in-service teacher training courses are offered on an annual basis.|$|E

25|$|Conversely, perverse {{learning}} {{results in}} stagnating performance levels within an organization because it leads individuals {{to focus on}} improving their outcome in performance measures, rather than their actual performance. For example, <b>teachers</b> <b>may</b> often dedicate their efforts towards improving their students' test scores rather than their teaching style. Similar to positive learning, perverse learning leads to a decreased variability in measured performance levels, but this performance improvement is artificial.|$|E
30|$|A <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> want to {{know how}} many {{students}} made the same mistake in an exercise. If most students make the same mistake, the <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> well want to give instruction to the whole class. If a small number of students make the same mistake, the <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> well want to give specific instruction only to those students.|$|R

25|$|In regards, to education, caring {{refers to}} the {{relationship}} between student and teacher, not just the person who cares. As educators respond to the needs of students, <b>teachers</b> <b>may</b> see the need to design a differentiated curriculum because as teachers work closely with students, we will be moved by their different needs and interests. The claim to care must not be based on a one time virtuous decision but an ongoing interest in the student’s welfare.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Education {{recruited}} 20,000 {{new teachers}} in 2005 {{and continued to}} implement teacher trainings. Teachers tend to be underpaid, inadequately trained and overworked (sometimes teaching two or three shifts a day). Some <b>teachers</b> <b>may</b> reportedly demand payment or bribes directly from their pupils. Other factors, such {{as the presence of}} landmines, lack of resources and identity papers, and poor health prevent children from regularly attending school. Although budgetary allocations for education were increased in 2004, the education system in Angola continues to be extremely under-funded.|$|E
25|$|Interpretation is {{sometimes}} listed by voice teachers as a fifth physical process even though strictly speaking {{it is not}} a physical process. The {{reason for this is that}} interpretation does influence the kind of sound a singer makes which is ultimately achieved through a physical action the singer is doing. Although <b>teachers</b> <b>may</b> acquaint their students with musical styles and performance practices and suggest certain interpretive effects, most voice teachers agree that interpretation can not be taught. Students who lack a natural creative imagination and aesthetic sensibility can not learn it from someone else. Failure to interpret well is not a vocal fault, even though it may affect vocal sound significantly.|$|E

25|$|Sweelinck {{was born}} in Deventer, Netherlands, in April or May 1562. He was the eldest son of organist Peter (or Pieter) Swybbertszoon and Elske Jansdochter Sweeling, {{daughter}} of a surgeon. Soon after Sweelinck's birth, {{the family moved to}} Amsterdam, where from about 1564, Pieter Swybbertszoon served as organist of the Oude Kerk (Sweelinck's paternal grandfather and uncle also were organists). Jan Pieterszoon must have received first lessons in music from his father. Unfortunately, his father died in 1573. He subsequently received general education under Jacob Buyck, Catholic pastor of the Oude Kerk (these lessons stopped in 1578 after the Reformation of Amsterdam and the subsequent conversion to Calvinism; Buyck chose to leave the city). Little is known about his music education {{after the death of his}} father; his music <b>teachers</b> <b>may</b> have included Jan Willemszoon Lossy, a little-known countertenor and shawm player at Haarlem, and/or Cornelis Boskoop, Sweelinck's father's successor at the Oude Kerk. If Sweelinck indeed studied in Haarlem, he was probably influenced to some degree by the organists of St.-Bavokerk, Claas Albrechtszoon van Wieringen and Floris van Adrichem, both of whom improvised daily in the Bavokerk.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{educational}} setting, a PLC may include people from multiple {{levels of the}} organization who are collaboratively and continually working together {{for the betterment of}} the organization. Peter Senge believes [...] "it is no longer sufficient to have one person learning for the organization". A major principle of PLCs is that people learn more together than if they were on their own, if conditions are right. <b>Teachers</b> <b>may</b> promote the idea of team learning to students in their classrooms, but <b>teachers</b> <b>may</b> not practice team learning in their professional lives; PLCs aim to help teachers practice the team learning that they preach. Senge suggests that when teams learn together there are beneficial results for the organization. Some school improvement evaluators have even claimed that [...] "high-quality collaboration has become no less than an imperative".|$|E
2500|$|Aside from students, {{teachers}} and school staff also face their own obstacles in working with refugee students. They have concerns {{about their ability to}} meet the mental, physical, emotional, and educational needs of students. One study of newly arrived Bantu students from Somalia in a Chicago school questioned whether schools were equipped to provide them with a quality education that met the needs of the pupils. The students were not aware of how to use pencils, which caused them to break the tips requiring frequent sharpening. <b>Teachers</b> <b>may</b> even see refugee students as different from other immigrant groups, {{as was the case with}} the Bantu pupils. <b>Teachers</b> <b>may</b> sometimes feel that their work is made harder because of the pressures to meet [...] state requirements for testing. With refugee children falling behind or struggling to catch up, it can overwhelm {{teachers and}} administrators.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Teachers</b> <b>may</b> probe {{students}} about their kōan practice using sassho, [...] "checking questions" [...] to validate their satori (understanding) or kensho (seeing the nature).

The checking questions serve to deepen the insight of the student, but also to test his or her understanding.|$|E
2500|$|Another issue <b>teachers</b> <b>may</b> {{have with}} {{deterring}} cheating {{is that they}} may decide {{that it is not}} their job.

For example, if the science teacher majored in chemistry, this certified <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> teach chemistry rather than general science.

5000|$|Teacher In Role: This {{strategy}} {{is key to}} involving teacher participation. This strategy can take on many forms. The <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> take {{on the role of}} a character or figure from the event, scene or story. The primary objective of this {{strategy is}} to allow students to ask questions and help discover answers to any unresolved issues. The <b>teacher</b> <b>may</b> also choose to immerse themselves in the scene and take on a role while interacting with other characters. The primary role in this situation is to further the evolving drama.|$|R
2500|$|Compulsory {{military}} service was instituted in 1995. Officially, conscripts, male and female, must serve for 18 months (although {{a human rights}} inquiry stated that it lasts for decades, and sometimes life), which includes 6 months of military training and 12 months doing [...] "national reconstruction".

2500|$|The federal {{government}} of the United States has mandated high-stakes testing {{as part of the}} No Child Left Behind Act, signed into law in 2002. Schools and teachers are held accountable for the results. According to Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, co-authors of Freakonomics, teachers are known to [...] "teach to the test": while not teaching the actual answers, they teach the questions and similar ones, and they neglect any topic that will not be tested on. Levitt also states that <b>teachers</b> <b>may</b> inflate the results of tests given in their classroom. Teachers and librarians can have a significant proactive impact on doing honest work.|$|E
2500|$|Steiner {{considered}} children's cognitive, {{emotional and}} behavioral development to be interlinked. When students in a Waldorf school are grouped, it is generally not by a singular focus on their academic abilities. Instead Steiner adapted {{the idea of the}} classic four temperaments – melancholic, sanguine, phlegmatic and choleric – for pedagogical use in the elementary years. Steiner indicated that teaching should be differentiated to accommodate the different needs that these psychophysical types represent. For example, [...] "cholerics are risk takers, phlegmatics take things calmly, melancholics are sensitive or introverted, and sanguines take things lightly". Today Waldorf <b>teachers</b> <b>may</b> work with the notion of temperaments to differentiate their instruction. Seating arrangements and class activities may be planned taking into account the temperaments of the students but this is often not readily apparent to observers. Steiner also believed that teachers must consider their own temperament and be prepared to work with it positively in the classroom, that temperament is emergent in children, and that most people express a combination of temperaments rather than a pure single type.|$|E
