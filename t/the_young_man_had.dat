5|$|Gielgud's first {{substantial}} engagement {{came through}} his family. In 1922 his cousin Phyllis Neilson-Terry {{invited him to}} tour in J.B. Fagan's The Wheel, as understudy, bit-part player and assistant stage manager, an invitation he accepted. A colleague, recognising that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> talent but lacked technique, recommended him to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Gielgud was awarded a scholarship to the academy and trained there throughout 1923 under Kenneth Barnes, Helen Haye and Claude Rains.|$|E
25|$|In one of {{his later}} essays, Nour attested that his only son, whom the Russian Civil War had caught at Odessa, {{was a victim of}} the Soviet Russian-organized shootings of Romanian hostages. According to Nour's account, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> died in a mass {{execution}} ordered by Commissar Béla Kun, after being made to dig his own grave. Despite such claims of loyalty, Nour {{is said to have been}} the focus of official investigation during a clampdown on wartime Germanophiles.|$|E
25|$|The Tosefta to this {{treatise}} {{is divided}} into six chapters. Noteworthy is the story it narrates of the high priest Simon the Just, who never partook of the sacrifice offered by a Nazarite, {{with the exception of}} that offered by a handsome youth from the south, since in this case he could assume that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> made his vow with the best intentions and acceptably to God. When Simon asked why he had decided to clip his hair, the youth replied that on beholding his image in a pool he had become vain of his own beauty, and had therefore taken the Nazaritic vow to avoid all temptations (4:7).|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 23 March 1935, Rattenbury was {{discovered}} in his sitting room with severe head injuries. He had sustained a series of blows with a carpenter's mallet, the blows savage enough to remove the back of his skull; he died four days later. His wife confessed, but Stoner admitted to the housekeeper that it was actually he who had carried out the deed. Alma Rattenbury and Stoner were both charged, although Alma was to retract her confession after her elder son Christopher visited her in prison. Stoner was convicted and sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment following the submission to the Home Secretary of a petition signed by over 300,000 people who felt that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been manipulated into committing murder by the older woman. Alma, represented by Ewen Montagu, was acquitted of murder and of being an accessory after the fact but committed suicide a few days later on 4 June 1935, stabbing herself six times in the breast with a dagger before throwing herself into the River Stour at Christchurch.|$|E

500|$|In 1931, the relics were {{recovered}} by Wilson-Claridge during an archaeological excavation; their identity {{was confirmed by}} Dr. T. E. A. Stowell, an osteologist. In 1970, examinations performed on the relics suggested that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> died {{in the same manner}} as Edward. [...] Wilson-Claridge wanted the relics to go to the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. His brother, however, wanted them to be returned to Shaftesbury Abbey. For decades, the relics were kept in a cutlery box in a bank vault at the Midland Bank in Woking, Surrey because of the unresolved dispute about which of two churches should have them.|$|E

500|$|The defence {{began to}} present its {{psychiatric}} {{evidence on the}} third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed [...] "poor [...] ", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having [...] "giggled" [...] at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then [...] "felt fuzzy" [...] when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: [...] "It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out." [...] The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate [...] "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days after}} the remains had been {{identified}} as those of Mary Fleszar, a young man claiming {{to be a friend}} of the Fleszar family arrived at the funeral home holding Fleszar's body prior to her scheduled burial. This individual had asked for permission to take a photograph of the body as it lay in the coffin as a keepsake for her parents. When informed his request was impossible, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> replied: [...] "You mean you can't fix her up enough so I could just get one picture of her?" [...] Sternly informed a second time he {{would not be allowed to}} view the body, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> wordlessly exited the funeral home.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to these disclosures, Kellogg was able to name three of the individuals depicted in the Polaroids as being Todd Stoops, Robert Sheldon, and Larry Wayne Pearson. These investigators would shortly discover Berdella had paid a $30 fee to secure a bond for Pearson in June 1987, and that no further records existed to indicate Pearson was still alive. Nonetheless, investigators did discover that, in August 1987, Berdella had filed an assault report from a hospital room in which he alleged a man named [...] "Larry Person" [...] had deeply bitten his penis during oral sex, causing a serious laceration. An interview with Robert Sheldon's employers at a Kansas City manufacturing plant had confirmed <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been a reliable employee of theirs, {{but that he had}} suddenly ceased attending work in April 1985.|$|E

2500|$|Nilus of Sinai (d. c.430), in his Letter to Heliodorus Silentiarius, records {{a miracle}} in which St. Plato of Ankyra {{appeared}} to a Christian in a dream. The Saint was recognized because <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> often seen his portrait. [...] This {{recognition of a}} religious apparition from likeness to an image was also a characteristic of pagan pious accounts of appearances of gods to humans, and was a regular topos in hagiography. [...] One critical recipient of a vision from Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki apparently specified that the saint resembled the [...] "more ancient" [...] images of him – presumably the 7th century mosaics still in Hagios Demetrios. [...] Another, an African bishop, had been rescued from Arab slavery by a young soldier called Demetrios, who {{told him to go}} to his house in Thessaloniki.
