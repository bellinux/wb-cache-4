5|$|On 6 March 1953, Stalin's {{death was}} announced, {{as was the}} new leadership. Malenkov was <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council of Ministers, with Beria (who {{consolidated}} his hold over the security agencies), Kaganovich, Bulganin, and former Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov as first vice-chairmen. Those members of the Presidium of the Central Committee who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted. Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party's Central Committee. The New York Times listed Malenkov and Beria first and second among the ten-man Presidium—and Khrushchev last.|$|E
5|$|Following Nikolai Podgorny's {{removal from}} office, rumours started {{circulating}} within the top circles, {{and on the}} streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health. During one of Kosygin's spells on sick leave, Brezhnev appointed Nikolai Tikhonov, a like-minded conservative, to the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers; through this office Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a backup role. For example, at a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, not Kosygin. Following Kosygin's resignation in 1980, Tikhonov, {{at the age of}} 75, was elected <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council of Ministers. At the end of his life, Kosygin feared the complete failure of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985), believing that the sitting leadership was reluctant to reform the stagnant Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|The third, and final, London season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson took {{the title role}} in Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be reversed, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Olivier's Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline and madness {{towards the end of the}} play some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic James Agate suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of Cyrano, Richardson was knighted, to Olivier's undisguised envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame.|$|E

500|$|In later life, Wu {{became more}} outspoken. She protested the {{imprisonment}} in Taiwan of relatives of physicist Kerson Huang in 1959, {{and of the}} journalist Lei Chen in 1960. In 1964, she spoke out against gender discrimination at a symposium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. [...] "I wonder", she asked her audience, [...] "whether the tiny atoms and nuclei, or the mathematical symbols, or the DNA molecules have any preference for either masculine or feminine treatment."

500|$|When Alexei Kosygin {{resigned}} in 1980 Tikhonov, {{at the age}} of 75, was elected <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council of Ministers. During his five-year term as premier Tikhonov refrained from reforming the Soviet economy, despite all statistics from that time showing the economy was stagnating. Tikhonov presented the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–85) at the 26th Party Congress, and told the delegates that the state would allocate nine million rubles for mothers who were seeking parental leave. In his presentation to the congress, Tikhonov admitted that Soviet agriculture was not producing enough grain. Tikhonov called for an improvement in Soviet–US relations, but dismissed all speculations that the Soviet economy was in any sort of crisis. Despite this, Tikhonov admitted to economic [...] "shortcomings" [...] and acknowledged the ongoing [...] "food problem"; other topics for discussion were the need to save energy resources, boost labour productivity and {{to improve the quality of}} Soviet produced goods. Early in his term, in January 1981, Tikhonov admitted that the government's demographic policy was one of the weakest areas of his cabinet. In reality, however, he along with many others, were beginning to worry that not enough Russians were being born. The Era of Stagnation reduced the birth rate, and increased the death rate of the Russian population.|$|E
