5|$|An {{octagonal}} baptistry {{connected to}} the near <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> Saint Mary Magdalene in the gospel transept was constructed in 1853. Inside the baptistry is an earlier image of San Juan Bautista, a baptismal font and an unusual retablo built in 1852 housing the Santo Entierro in a glass coffin and the Nuestra Señora de los Dolores in the central niche.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Altar</b> <b>of</b> Forgiveness {{is located}} {{at the front of the}} central nave. It is the first aspect of the {{interior}} that is seen upon entering the cathedral.

5|$|Based {{on their}} {{similarity}} to <b>the</b> <b>Altar</b> <b>of</b> the City Patrons, art historians have attributed other paintings to Lochner, although a number have {{questioned whether the}} diary entry was authentically made by Dürer. Documentary evidence linking the paintings and miniatures with the historical Lochner has also been challenged, most notably by the art historian Michael Wolfson in 1996. In either case, the extent of Lochner's direct hand, {{as opposed to those}} of workshop members or followers, is debated. Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451, the year of his death.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} returned briefly, {{creating the}} White Throne member, but encroaching seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of clay and silt {{mark the end}} of this formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation make up the capstone of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on <b>the</b> <b>Altar</b> <b>of</b> Sacrifice is a famous example).

In 450, in an attempt to impose Zoroastrianism on Armenians, Sasanian King Yazdegerd II built a fire temple inside the cathedral. The pyre of the fire temple was unearthed under <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> the east apse during the excavations in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th century {{religious}} hermits started inhabiting {{the caves}} on Mount Carmel, {{and in the}} 13th century they formed a new Catholic monastic order, the Carmelites. Under Muslim rule, the church which they had built on Mount Carmel {{was turned into a}} mosque, later becoming a hospital. In the 19th century, it was restored as a Carmelite monastery, the Stella Maris Monastery. <b>The</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> the church as we see it today, stands over a cave associated with Prophet Elijah.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the National Board of Antiquities {{claimed the}} relic {{as its own}} {{on the basis of}} the Finnish law on ancient objects, though it was contradicted by the Lutheran Cathedral Parish of Turku. However, the Board {{ultimately}} had the relic relocated to the Cathedral of Saint Henry in Helsinki, the oldest church in the modern Catholic Diocese of Finland, because Catholics still actively venerate the relic as sacred. Since then, it has been located inside <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Luxury {{items were}} in high demand among the {{increasingly}} prosperous nobility, {{and to a lesser}} degree among the wealthy town merchants. Brick and stone residential buildings became common, but only in cities. The mature Gothic style was represented not only in architecture, but also in sacral wooden sculpture. <b>The</b> <b>Altar</b> <b>of</b> Veit Stoss in St. Mary's Basilica in Kraków {{is one of the most}} magnificent art works of its kind in Europe.|$|E
5|$|To Cairano, also, is {{attributed}} <b>the</b> <b>Altar</b> <b>of</b> San Girolamo {{in the church}} of St Francis. One of the critical issues of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia {{is the lack of}} historical sources on its origin. Certainly the altar was carved after 1506, given its high quality and artistic originality, indeed the highest level of art in the Brescian period, and evokes several features of Cairano's earlier work on the Loggia and front-yard of San Pietro's church in Oliveto.|$|E
5|$|Before {{they were}} {{destroyed}} in the Revolution, {{the remains of the}} king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below. Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather than death, while Henry is posed strikingly, with his head thrown back. From 1583, Pilon also sculpted two later gisants of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes. In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> the chapel. Pilon's four bronze statues of the cardinal virtues stand at the corners of the tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall Bontemps' work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.|$|E

5|$|Bregowine died in 764 and was {{originally}} {{buried in the}} baptistry in Canterbury, but his remains were moved to the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in 1123. This followed an attempt in around 1121 to remove his remains to another monastery, which came to nothing. The remains were placed by <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> St Gregory in the south transept, after having been briefly placed in the north transept. Bregowine was later considered a saint, with a feast day of 26August, although Florence of Worcester, a 12th-century writer, recorded his death date as 24August. Other sources record the death date as 25August. His life was later written by Eadmer in the 12thcentury.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} protect {{themselves}} and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (Alfkors, Älvkors or Ellakors), which was carved into buildings or other objects. It existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram {{and it was still}} frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in {{order to protect}} against elves. The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate. This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver, from nine different sources of inherited silver. In some locations it also had to be on <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> a church for three consecutive Sundays.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, May 25, 1941, {{ground was}} broken for Mount St. Peter Church. The event was celebrated by the priests of St. Peter's {{congregation}} and about two thousand {{people showed up}} to watch. The cornerstone was blessed on Sunday, September 7, 1941, by Reverend Alfred Koch, who was the Arch Abbot of St. Vincent in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Many other priests from the area were also present. Father Paul Tomlinson of St. Peter's Church in Pittsburgh delivered the sermon in English and Archabbot Koch closed the ceremony with the Pontifical Benediction in Italian. The large red cornerstone was made of granite and was fitted with an iron box. The box contained the memorial reports of the congregation, newspapers, American and Papal coins, and medals of the church. The cornerstone was placed {{so that it can}} be seen from inside the church. It is located by <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> the Sacred Heart.|$|E

5|$|After {{his final}} return to Northumbria Wilfrid retired to the monastery at Ripon, {{where he lived}} until his death {{during a visit to}} Oundle, at the age of 75. A little over a year before his death in either 709 or 710 Wilfrid {{suffered}} another stroke or seizure, which led him to make arrangements for the disposition of his monasteries and possessions. He was buried near <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> his church in Ripon. Bede records the epitaph that was placed on the tomb. Wilfrid was succeeded at Hexham by Acca of Hexham, a protégé who had accompanied him to Rome in 703. The monastery at Ripon celebrated the first anniversary of Wilfrid's death with a commemoration service attended by all the abbots of his monasteries and a spectacular white arc was said to have appeared in the sky starting from the gables of the basilica where his bones were laid to rest.|$|E
5|$|After {{the western}} {{portion of the}} Cuchumatanes fell to the Spanish, the Ixil and Uspantek Maya were {{sufficiently}} isolated to evade immediate Spanish attention. The Uspantek and the Ixil were allies and in 1529, {{four years after the}} conquest of Huehuetenango, Uspantek warriors were harassing Spanish forces and Uspantán was trying to foment rebellion among the K'iche'. Uspantek activity became sufficiently troublesome that the Spanish decided that military action was necessary. Gaspar Arias, magistrate of Guatemala, penetrated the eastern Cuchumatanes with sixty Spanish infantry and three hundred allied indigenous warriors. By early September he had imposed temporary Spanish authority over the Ixil towns of Chajul and Nebaj. The Spanish army then marched east toward Uspantán itself; Arias then received notice that the acting governor of Guatemala, Francisco de Orduña, had deposed him as magistrate. Arias handed command over to the inexperienced Pedro de Olmos and returned to confront de Orduña. Although his officers advised against it, Olmos launched a disastrous full-scale frontal assault on the city. As soon as the Spanish began their assault they were ambushed from the rear by more than two thousand Uspantek warriors. The Spanish forces were routed with heavy losses; many of their indigenous allies were slain, and many more were captured alive by the Uspantek warriors only to be sacrificed on <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> their deity Exbalamquen. The survivors who managed to evade capture fought their way back to the Spanish garrison at Q'umarkaj.|$|E

As {{they are about to}} enter the bus, the girl's mother is seen {{screaming}} in tears for her daughter to return to her. She hesitates, and then continues with her lover onto the transport. The scene once again focuses on Carey, who is standing {{in the midst of a}} torrential downpour, singing to the heavens. As she reaches the song's climax, Carey, now dry and dressed in a long black gown, is shown singing at <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> a church. As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. She stares at an elderly couple in the first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey. Their faces rejuvenate to show them as a young couple, as their photo is taken and placed into the family album from the beginning of the video.|$|E
