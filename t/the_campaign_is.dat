5|$|In 756, Óengus {{is found}} campaigning {{alongside}} Eadberht of Northumbria. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> reported as follows: In {{the year of}} the Lord's incarnation 756, king Eadberht in the eighteenth year of his reign, and Unust, king of Picts led armies to the town of Dumbarton. And hence the Britons accepted terms there, {{on the first day of}} the month of August. But on the tenth day of the same month perished almost the whole army which he led from Ouania to Niwanbirig.|$|E
5|$|In the epilogue, {{one month}} after the events of the Campaign, the ODST squad has been keeping guard over the Engineer. Sergeant Major Avery Johnson arrives, informing the Engineer that he intends to ask it {{everything}} it knows about the Covenant—and what they are looking for—setting the stage for Halo 3. If <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> completed on the Legendary difficulty level, a scene shows the Prophet of Truth overseeing the excavation of a Forerunner artifact buried beneath the Superintendent's data core.|$|E
5|$|Under his term, the {{environment}} of the city greatly improved. Hsu started a program of having the city's garbage trucks ring out brief English lessons in 2002. He promoted the use of eco-friendly chopsticks by requiring government officials and teachers to use their own reusable chopsticks when dining, expressing that the goal of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> to reduce the use of disposable chopsticks by 100,000 pairs per day.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} post mortems of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>were</b> written, all highly {{critical}} of <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> run and of its major backers failure {{to deal with these}} issues.|$|R
5000|$|Popularly {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> Border <b>Campaign,</b> it <b>was</b> also {{referred to}} as the [...] "Resistance Campaign" [...] by some Irish republican activists. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> a military failure, but for some of its members, <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> justified as it had kept the IRA engaged for another generation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> very successful, but {{was also}} criticised. In fact no {{rainforest}} was acquired by WWF or Krombacher. Rather, existing nature reserve were supported. Accordingly, a German court decided <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> partly anticompetitive.|$|R
5|$|In early 766 a {{prisoner}} exchange {{took place between}} the two states in western Cilicia, followed by a resumption of large-scale hostilities. In August 766, a large Abbasid army, comprising many different national contingents, under al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba and al-Abbas ibn Muhammad, the brother of Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775), invaded Byzantine territory from Upper Mesopotamia and made for Kamacha. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> dealt with briefly by Muslim historians such as al-Tabari, but is fully recorded in a contemporary Syriac Christian source, the so-called Zuqnin Chronicle, written by a monk of the Zuqnin Monastery near Amida.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{spent most}} of 1759 {{conducting}} escort missions and constructing roads and forts. During this time, Virginia's forces were taken from George Washington and put {{under the control of}} Colonel William Byrd. In July 1760, Scott was named the fifth captain of a group of Virginia troops that Byrd led on an expedition against the Cherokee in 1760. Scott's exact role in <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> not known. The expedition was a success, and Virginia Governor Francis Fauquier ordered the force disbanded in February 1762; Scott had left the army at some unknown date prior to that.|$|E
5|$|The Ulm Campaign was {{a series}} of French and Bavarian {{military}} maneuvers and battles to outflank and capture an Austrian army in 1805 during the War of the Third Coalition. It took place in the vicinity of and inside the Swabian (then Bavarian) city of Ulm. The French Grande Armée, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, comprised 210,000 troops organized into seven corps, and hoped to knock out the Austrian army in the Danube before Russian reinforcements could arrive. Through rapid marching, Napoleon conducted a large wheeling maneuver that captured an Austrian army of 23,000 under General Mack on 20 October at Ulm, bringing the total number of Austrian prisoners in the campaign to 60,000. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece and was influential {{in the development of the}} Schlieffen Plan in the late 19th century.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> {{planned to}} be a major affair. Wasif was to command upwards of ten {{thousand}} troops, consisting of the regular army, the mawlās and the shākiriyyah. In addition, a recruitment drive to gain volunteers for <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> ordered by al-Muntasir. On March 13, 862 a proclamation announcing <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> issued; it characterized the upcoming expedition as a holy war and extolled Wasif as a fine leader and a loyal servant of the caliph.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> derided {{by journalists}} and {{political}} scientists as boring {{in part because}} much of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> before Labour Day when many families were still taking summer holidays and also because the overall aspects of the two main parties were similar.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} several {{missions}} that the player has to complete while fighting enemies and completing objectives. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to exploring areas and recovering {{items such as}} keycards, explosives or laptop computers, which are useful to hack into electronic devices. The player can pick up new weapons, health and ammunition dropped by enemies if necessary. The game also features several mini-games, including a driving level and a sniper mission, as well as numerous boss battles that the player has to defeat in order to progress through the next level. By beating any of these mini-games, the player can access them in the game's extras menu.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of Egypt is sometimes explained by Zenobia's desire to secure an alternative trade {{route to the}} Euphrates, which was cut {{because of the war}} with Persia; This theory ignores the fact that the Euphrates route was only partially disrupted, and overlooks Zenobia's ambition. The date of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> uncertain; Zosimus placed it after the Battle of Naissus and before Claudius' death, which sets it in the summer of 270. Watson, emphasizing the works of Zonaras and Syncellus and dismissing Zosimus' account, places the invasion in October 270 (after Claudius' death). According to Watson, the occupation of Egypt was an opportunistic move by Zenobia (who was encouraged by the news of Claudius' death in August). The appearance of the Palmyrenes on Egypt's eastern frontier would have contributed to unrest in the province, whose society was fractured; Zenobia had supporters and opponents among local Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 732, Marwan led 40,000 men north into Khazar lands. The {{accounts}} of this campaign are confused: Ibn A'tham records that he reached Balanjar and returned to Derbent with much captured livestock, but <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> described in terms strongly reminiscent of Maslama's expeditions in 728 and 731, and its veracity is open to doubt. Ibn Khayyat {{on the other hand}} reports that Marwan led a far more limited campaign on the country immediately to the north of Derbent and then retired there to spend the winter. Marwan was more active in the south, where he raised Ashot III Bagratuni to the position of presiding prince of Armenia, effectively granting the country broad autonomy in exchange for the service of its soldiers alongside the Caliphate's armies. This unique concession points, according to Blankinship, to the worsening manpower crisis faced by the Caliphate. At about the same time, the Khazars and Byzantines strengthened their ties and formalized their alliance against their common enemy with the marriage of Constantine V to the Khazar princess Tzitzak.|$|E
50|$|The {{initiator}} of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> Gunther Thielen, CEO of Bertelsmann AG. It {{ran from}} September 26, 2005 to January 31, 2006. The core of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> a 2-minute TV spot, which was broadcast simultaneously {{at the start}} of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> on almost all TV channels in the country. Additional advertisements in the print media, flyers, and outdoor and online media were used. The media cost was around 30 million Euros. All of the supporting corporations received no income for their contributions. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> relaunched on December 15, 2007.|$|R

5|$|The Mauritius {{campaign}} of 1809–1811 {{was a series}} of amphibious operations and naval actions fought to determine possession of the French Indian Ocean territories of Isle de France and Île Bonaparte during the Napoleonic Wars. The campaign lasted from the spring of 1809 until the spring of 1811, and saw both the Royal Navy and the French Navy deploy substantial frigate squadrons with the intention of disrupting or protecting trade from British India. In a war in which the Royal Navy was almost universally dominant at sea, <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> especially notable for the local superiority enjoyed by the French Navy in the autumn of 1810 following the British disaster at the Battle of Grand Port, the most significant defeat for the Royal Navy in the entire conflict. After their victory, the British used the original Dutch name of Mauritius for Isle de France. In 1814, Île Bonaparte was returned to France, who eventually renamed it La Réunion.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> {{carried out}} {{in a similar fashion}} to Shogun: Total War, but {{features}} many enhancements. The game is set mainly in Europe, but also features the Middle East and North Africa. Production can occur in every province, with the player building from one of the hundreds of connected buildings and units in the game's technology tree. Income to develop provinces and armies comes from taxation of the provinces and trade with neighbouring provinces. There is no specific technology research, but several advances, such as gunpowder, do become available over time. Castles provide the basis for more developed construction in the game, with players having to upgrade to the next castle level to be able to build more advanced buildings; upgrades such as a curtain wall and guard towers can be added to individual castles. Many buildings have economic functions, such as trading posts that generate money, while others are military buildings and allow the training of more advanced unit types. Whilst there are many common unit types, several unique units are available. These units are either restricted to a single faction or are dependent on the control of a particular province. Each unit possesses different strengths and weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} 14 {{missions}} {{in which the}} player plays as Joanna Dark. Each mission provides a number of objectives that the player has to complete to progress. To successfully clear a mission, the player must complete all primary objectives, and if Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player will have to start the level again. The missions also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, a device called Datathief allows the player to hack into electronic devices, while another called Loctopus {{can be used to}} open locked doors. Stealth is another important element of the gameplay, as the player is often given the freedom to kill enemies without being detected by sneaking up behind them. Unlike the original Perfect Dark, every mission contains a single checkpoint at which the player may restart if Joanna is killed or loses beyond that checkpoint. However, checkpoints are removed as the player plays through a higher difficulty. There are four difficulty settings through which a mission can be played: Agent, Secret Agent, Perfect Agent, and an extra one called Dark Agent, which becomes available once the player completes the entire game on Perfect Agent. As the player plays on higher difficulties, the game adds more objectives and makes enemies tougher to increase the challenge.|$|E
50|$|Right {{from the}} {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> there <b>was</b> a lot of criticism. The major complaint was that the tone of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> resembled campaigns from National Socialist times. For many <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> too nationalistic.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> {{regarded}} to {{have been}} the gravest threat to the Scottish kingdom since John, King of England's (d. 1216) northern campaigning and invasion in 1216. Although Óláfr's restoration on Mann was claimed as a success by the Norwegians, it was probably accepted gladly by the Scots as well; considering Óláfr's familial relationship with Alexander's protégé Ferchar and the consolidation of the Crovan dynasty after years of chaos. Óláfr consequently ruled the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles peacefully until his death, seven years later. At some point during his reign, he is known to have granted certain commercial rights and protections to the monks of the monastery of Holm Cultram. The chronicle states that he died on St Patrick's Isle on 21 May 1237 and was buried at St Mary's Abbey, Rushen. There is a possibility that a coffin-lid or grave-slab found at Rushen may be associated with Óláfr, or of two of his sons who are known {{to have been}} buried there (Rögnvaldr and Magnús).|$|E
