5|$|In his Natural History 9.4.9-11, Pliny the Elder {{describes}} numerous {{sightings of}} mermaids {{off the coast}} of Gaul, noting that their bodies were covered all over in scales and that their corpses frequently washed up on shore. He comments <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> of Gaul even wrote a letter to Emperor Augustus to inform him.|$|E
5|$|In {{three of}} the {{previous}} five years, the legislature had {{failed to meet the}} June 30 deadline. On each of those occasions an agreement had been reached by the morning of July 2. Aides to Corzine claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> felt {{he had no choice but}} to order the shutdown under the state's Constitution.|$|E

5|$|October 20, 1639 – Two Spanish ships {{ground out}} in a hurricane; the {{occupants}} are brought ashore, and charged monthly accommodation fees until their departure the following February.

5|$|The fifth Article {{similarly}} {{defines the}} structure and powers of the executive branch. The Governor of Virginia is invested as the chief executive, though §1 of Article V, provides <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> may not run for successive terms. The offices of lieutenant governor and attorney general are established as supporting elected constitutional positions.|$|E
5|$|Each {{iteration}} of the Kentucky Constitution {{has provided}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> receive a salary. Under {{the first three}} constitutions, the governor's salary could not be increased or reduced {{while he was in}} office; this provision was extended to all public officials in the present constitution. The governor's salary is set by law, and is equal to $60,000 times the increase in the consumer price index between January 1, 1984, {{and the beginning of the}} current calendar year. In 2014, the governor's salary was $186,730.|$|E
5|$|In {{all four}} Kentucky constitutions, the first power {{enumerated}} {{to the governor}} is to serve as commander-in-chief of the state's militia and military forces. In 1799, a stipulation was added <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> would not personally lead troops on the battlefield unless advised {{to do so by}} a resolution of the General Assembly. Such a case occurred in 1813 when Governor Isaac Shelby, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, was asked to lead a band of Kentucky troops to aid William Henry Harrison at the Battle of the Thames. For his service, Shelby received the Thanks of Congress and the Congressional Gold Medal.|$|E

In June of <b>that</b> year, <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> also stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monastery at Çarpanak Island and Varagavank would be renovated [...] "in the near future."

5|$|The 47 districts {{from which}} Senators are elected are apportioned every ten {{years on the}} basis of population. Maryland's {{constitution}} explicitly defines the process for the drawing of these districts, requiring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> make a recommendation of a new electoral map and submit it for legislative approval. As of 2005, there were approximately 112,000 people in each district. Each Senate district also elects three Delegates, and incumbent Senators and Delegates will often run jointly as members of incumbent slates in their districts. It is rare, however, for an incumbent to be challenged.|$|E
5|$|While {{awaiting}} his execution, Bonnet {{wrote to}} Governor Johnson, begging abjectly for clemency and promising {{to have his}} own arms and legs cut off as assurance {{that he would never}} again commit piracy. Charles Johnson wrote that Bonnet's visibly disintegrating mind moved many Carolinians to pity, particularly the female population, and London papers later reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> delayed his execution seven times. Bonnet was eventually hanged at White Point Garden, in Charles Town, on 10December 1718.|$|E
5|$|With the Conservatives {{leading in}} the polls, Diefenbaker wanted a new election, hopeful that his party would gain a {{majority}} of seats. It was then Canadian constitutional practice <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> General could refuse a dissolution early in a parliament's term, unless the government had been defeated in the House, or was winning divisions by {{only a handful of}} votes. Diefenbaker sought a pretext for a new election.|$|E

50|$|From the {{earliest}} days, {{the chief of}} a province had acted both as governor and judge. He also engaged in trade, {{of which he had}} a monopoly. With the duties of three men to perform, it was not strange <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governors</b> were often poor rulers. They knew little of the law and therefore they sent all the important cases to Manila. For this reason there were often long delays in processing cases. Sometimes it required years to get justice and this encouraged the strong to oppress the weak. Clavería therefore ordered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governors</b> be men of two years experience in the law.|$|R
50|$|On September 19, ABC News {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor's</b> {{staff had}} authorized Monegan's trip, scheduled for July 22, 2008. ABC posted a travel authorization, signed by Nizich, Palin's Chief of Staff, on June 19, 2008, for the trip.|$|R
5|$|Although {{setting the}} state budget is a {{legislative}} function in many states, Kentucky governors are required by statute to present a proposed biennial budget to the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor's budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans {{took control of the}} state senate {{for the first time in}} 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly failed to pass a budget before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and pass a budget. In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> had no authority to expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators failed to pass a budget in the future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado {{despatched}} his lieutenant Baltasar Guerra {{to pacify}} the rebel Chiapanecas and Zoques, and the victorious conquistadores in turn demanded encomiendas. The general instability continued, but the Mazariegos family managed {{to establish a}} power base in the local colonial institutions. In 1535, the Mazariegos faction succeeded in having San Cristóbal de los Llanos declared a city, with the new name of Ciudad Real. They also managed to acquire special privileges from the Crown in order to stabilise the colony, such as an edict that specified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> of Chiapa must govern in person and not through a delegated representative. In practise, the quick turnover of encomiendas continued, since few Spaniards had legal Spanish wives and legitimate children who could inherit. This situation would not stabilise until the 1540s, when the dire shortage of Spanish women in the colony was alleviated by an influx of new colonists. At around the same time, the Audiencia de los Confines intervened, appointing judges to exert greater control over the allocation of encomiendas.|$|E
5|$|During the 1988 {{legislative}} session, Governor Wilkinson {{proposed an}} amendment to the Kentucky Constitution that would allow state officials, including the sitting incumbents, to succeed themselves in office once. As presiding officer in the Senate, Jones insisted that any such measure also include a runoff provision if a candidate did not receive a majority of votes in the party primary. Wilkinson opposed this provision, and the measure died in the state senate. Wilkinson's proposed education program also failed in the session, and Jones suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> should build a consensus among legislators before including the program on the agenda of a special legislative session, which Wilkinson had proposed for January 1989. After the 1988 session, Wilkinson called Jones a backstabber and accused him of sabotaging the succession amendment. The two did not meet for six months following the session.|$|E
50|$|CNAS has {{suggested}} that one way to contain future military costs would be to fold heavy army units into the National guard and reserves, but military officials have responded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governors</b> would rather have light units, that are better suited to their emergency needs.|$|R
50|$|However, it {{was during}} the {{administration}} of Gov. Lino Chatto <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Governor's</b> Mansion gained prominence. He spearheaded <b>the</b> renovation program <b>that</b> added manicured lawns and fountains. After the EDSA People Power Revolution, it was renamed by Gov. David Tirol as the People's Mansion.|$|R
50|$|Allen's firing {{brought a}} {{significant}} backlash against Thornburgh from the African-American community and various civil rights groups. Some asserted that Allen {{was held to}} a different standard because of her skin color, gender, or both; others charged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Governor's</b> actions were politically motivated.|$|R
5|$|Husayn Pasha's replacement, Uthman Pasha al-Kurji, {{who took}} office in 1760, sought to {{retrieve}} control of Haifa from Zahir. Uthman Pasha requested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> of Sidon, Nu'man Pasha, recapture the port city on his behalf, to which Nu'man Pasha complied, dispatching 30 Maghrebi soldiers on a vessel captained by a Frenchman on 20 May 1761. The effort was a meager attempt and upon arrival, Zahir had the ship confiscated and its soldiers arrested, while the French captain paid a fine. The issue over Haifa's annexation was smoothed over {{with the assistance of}} an Istanbul-based Ottoman official and friend of Zahir, Yaqub Agha. Yaqub had a high-ranking official named Sulayman Agha intervene in the matter and revoke Uthman Pasha's orders.|$|E
5|$|In July 1826, Isaac Desha, free on bail while {{awaiting}} a third trial and apparently {{in a highly}} intoxicated state, attempted suicide by cutting his own throat. Physicians saved his life by reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube. He recovered, and in June 1827, faced a third trial. During the June term of the court, Desha's lawyers used a number of peremptory challenges to again prevent the court from empaneling a jury. The judge ordered him held without bail until the next session of the court, but Governor Desha, who {{was present at the}} proceedings, stood and issued a pardon for his son, as well as lambasting the judge in a lengthy impromptu speech. Some accounts hold <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> immediately resigned upon granting the pardon, but the official records reflect no such action.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 July around 900 people formed outside the Bastille, {{primarily}} working-class members of the nearby faubourg Saint-Antoine, but also including some mutinous soldiers and local traders. The crowd had gathered {{in an attempt to}} commandeer the gunpowder stocks known to be held in the Bastille, and at 10:00 am de Launay let in two of their leaders to negotiate with him. Just after midday, another negotiator was let in to discuss the situation, but no compromise could be reached: the revolutionary representatives now wanted both the guns and the gunpowder in the Bastille to be handed over, but de Launay refused to do so unless he received authorisation from his leadership in Versailles. By this point it was clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> lacked the experience or the skills to defuse the situation.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the war, Rome created a new {{province}} of Africa, and Utica became its capital, which meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor's</b> residence was there along with a small garrison.

50|$|The National Penitentiary {{was indeed}} {{subsequently}} {{built on the}} Millbank site, but to a design by William Williams that owed little to the Panopticon, beyond <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor's</b> quarters, administrative offices, and chapel were placed at {{the centre of the}} complex. It opened in 1816.|$|R
