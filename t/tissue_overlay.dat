40|$|International audienceIn Arabidopsis, {{lateral root}} {{primordia}} (LRPs) originate from pericycle cells located {{deep within the}} parental root and have to emerge through endodermal, cortical, and epidermal <b>tissues.</b> These <b>overlaying</b> <b>tissues</b> place biomechanical constraints on the LRPs {{that are likely to}} impact their morphogenesis. This study probes the interplay between the patterns of cell division, organ shape, and <b>overlaying</b> <b>tissues</b> on LRP morphogenesis by exploiting recent advances in live plant cell imaging and image analysis. Our 3 D/ 4 D image analysis revealed that early stage LRPs exhibit tangential divisions that create a ring of cells corralling a population of rapidly dividing cells at its center. The patterns of division in the latter population of cells during LRP morphogenesis are not stereotypical. In contrast, statistical analysis demonstrated that the shape of new LRPs is highly conserved. We tested the relative importance of cell division pattern versus <b>overlaying</b> <b>tissues</b> on LRP morphogenesis using mutant and transgenic approaches. The double mutant aurora 1 (aur 1) aur 2 disrupts the pattern of LRP cell divisions and impacts its growth dynamics, yet the new organ's dome shape remains normal. In contrast, manipulating the properties of <b>overlaying</b> <b>tissues</b> disrupted LRP morphogenesis. We conclude that the interaction with <b>overlaying</b> <b>tissues,</b> rather than the precise pattern of divisions, is most important for LRP morphogenesis and optimizes the process of lateral root emergence...|$|R

While mucosal immunity to ricin correlates with secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody levels in vivo, the potential of IgA to protect epithelial cells from ricin in vitro has not been examined due to the unavailability of well-defined antitoxin IgA antibodies. Here we report the characterization of four monoclonal IgA antibodies (IgA MAbs) produced from the Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes of BALB/c mice immunized intragastrically with ricin toxoid. Two IgA MAbs (33 G 2 and 35 H 6) were active against ricin's lectin subunit (RTB), and two (23 D 7 and 25 A 4) reacted with the toxin's enzymatic subunit (RTA). All four IgA MAbs neutralized ricin in a Vero cell cytotoxicity assay, blocked toxin-induced interleukin- 8 release by the human monocyte/macrophage cell line 28 SC, and protected polarized epithelial cell monolayers from ricin-mediated protein synthesis inhibition. 33 G 2 and 35 H 6 reduced ricin binding to the luminal surfaces of human intestinal epithelial cells to undetectable levels in <b>tissue</b> section <b>overlay</b> assays, whereas 23 D 7 {{had no effect on}} toxin attachment. 23 D 7 and 25 A 4 did, however, reduce ricin transcytosis across MDCK II cell monolayers, possibly by interfering with intracellular toxin transport.

The jaws of these stingrays are composed of a previously undescribed form of cartilage. This tissue, ‘trabecular cartilage’, has mineralized struts which run through the central hyaline core. The struts, or trabeculae, are hollow tubes, made of calcified blocks, arranged as in a brick chimney. They serve to prevent buckling and bending of the jaws while prey is being crushed. The struts are present in late term embryos, indicating that feeding on hard prey does not cause them to form.

We employ computational models to examine the impact of phase aberration on tissue ablation. Thompson and Roberts have recently studied the effects of phase aberration on ultrasound focusing in aerospace engine materials such as titanium alloy, and have developed a computational model to examine these effects. The ultrasound beam observed after transmission through the fused quartz (homogeneous) and that observed after transmission through the titanium (inhomogeneous) demonstrate the severe beam wavefield amplitude distortion introduced by the velocity inhomogeneity‐induced phase aberration. We study applicability of this approach to model phase aberration in inhomogeneous tissues and its effect on HIFU dose distribution around the focus. It is hypothesized that the ill‐effects of phase aberration accumulate during propagation through intervening tissue in which field intensities are substantially lower than that in the focal zone, and it is therefore appropriate to use a linear acoustic model to describe the transport of energy from the transducer to the volume targeted for ablation.

This study determines how the relative cholesterol content, which is calculated from Raman spectra collected at the luminal surface of an artery, is related to its depth in an intact arterial wall. Raman spectra of human atherosclerotic plaques were measured after thin tissue layers were successively placed on them. From these spectra, relative cholesterol contents were calculated and used to determine how cholesterol signal strength is attenuated by <b>overlaying</b> <b>tissue.</b> Then, intact artery samples (n = 13) were examined spectroscopically, sectioned and stained specifically for cholesterol. Images of these sections were digitized, and image intensities were related to cholesterol content.

A decaying exponential curve was fit to the layer study data (r 2 = 0. 97) and showed that ~ 300 μm of tissue attenuates cholesterol signals by 50 %. In intact plaques, the spectroscopically- determined cholesterol amounts correlated strongly and linearly with those determined by digital microscopy (r 2 = 0. 94). With Raman spectroscopy techniques, the cholesterol content of a lesion can be determined by properly accounting for its depth into an arterial wall.

40|$|Rise of {{atmospheric}} CO 2 {{is one of}} the main causes of global warming. Catastrophic climate change can be avoided by reducing emissions and increasing sequestration of CO 2. Trees are known to sequester CO 2 during photosynthesis, and then store it as wood biomass. Thus, breeding of trees with higher wood yield would mitigate global warming as well as augment production of renewable construction materials, energy, and industrial feedstock. Wood is made of cellulose-rich xylem cells produced through proliferation of a specialized stem cell niche called cambium. Importance of cambium in xylem cells production makes it an ideal target for the tree breeding programs; however our knowledge about control of cambium proliferation remains limited. The morphology and regulation of cambium are different from those of stem cell niches that control axial growth. For this reason, translating the knowledge about axial growth to radial growth has limited use. Furthermore, genetic approaches cannot be easily applied because <b>overlaying</b> <b>tissues</b> conceal cambium from direct observation and complicate identification of mutants. To overcome the paucity of experimental tools in cambium biology, we constructed a Boolean network CARENET (CAmbium REgulation gene NETwork) for modelling cambium activity, which includes the key transcription factors WOX 4 and HD-ZIP III as well as their potential regulators. Our simulations predict that: (1) auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, and brassinosteroids act cooperatively in promoting transcription of WOX 4 and HD-ZIP III; (2) auxin and cytokinin pathways negatively regulate each other; (3) hormonal pathways act redundantly in sustaining cambium activity; (4) individual cambium cells can have diverse molecular identities. CARENET can be extended to include components of other signalling pathways and be integrated with models of xylem and phloem differentiation. Such extended models would facilitate breeding trees with higher wood yield...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to use the concept of {{calculated}} thermal dose to predict the necrosed tissue volume, and to evaluate the near-field heating due to application of multiple pulses to cover a large volume. In addition, <b>overlaying</b> <b>tissue</b> damage caused by sonicating a highly-perfused tissue seated only a few cms deep was evaluated. The thermal dose distribution during focused ultrasound exposure was calculated based on numerical models used for calculating ultrasound power distributions and the resulting temperature distributions in tissue. In vivo experiments in dogs and rabbits were conducted to obtain the reliability of the predictions. It was found that the lesion intensity threshold was almost independent of the frequency for transducers with an F-number of 1. It was found that the lesion size was practically perfusion independent for pulses 5 s or shorter. The lesion size increased with increasing pulse duration, acoustical power, and F-number, but decreased with increasing frequency at a constant focal intensity. The results shown in this dissertation can be used as a guide for selection of transducer parameters for ultrasonic surgery. The temperature elevation in the near-field was elevated. It was found that significant delays (20 s or longer) between the pulses must be introduced in order to avoid unwanted tissue damage in front of the focal zone. In addition, decreasing the pulse duration and F-number reduced the temperature elevation in front of the focus. It was shown that the damage to surrounding tissues when sonicating a highly-perfused tissue (such as kidney) seated a few cms deep, can be avoided by using transducer with an F-number of 0. 8 and a frequency of about 1 MHz. The heating of the surrounding tissues can be reduced more by correct selection of the pulse duration and power. The tissue necrosis due to ultrasound was monitored using MRI imaging.

40|$|In the {{interest}} of understanding {{the development of a}} multicellular organism, subcellular events must be seen {{in the context of the}} entire three-dimensional tissue. In addition, events that occur within a short period of time can be of great importance for the relatively long developmental process of the organ. Thus, it is required to capture subcellular events in a larger spatio-temporal scale context, which has been up to now a technical challenge. In developmental biology, light microscopy has always been an important tool. The dilemma of light microscopy, in particular fluorescence microscopy, is that molecules receive high light intensities that might change the conformation of molecules, which can have signaling or toxic effects. In Light Sheet-based Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM), the energy required for a single recording is reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to other fluorescence microscopy techniques. During the last ten years, LSFM has emerged as a preferred tool to capture all cells during embryogenesis of the zebrafish Danio rerio, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster or recently the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum for a period of several days. The motivation of this work was to gain new insights in developmental related processes of plant organs. The aim of this work was to establish a protocol for imaging plant growth over a long period of time using LSFM and perform comprehensive analyses at the cellular level. Plants have to cope with a variety of environmental conditions, therefore the conditions inside the microscope chamber had to be brought under control. The sample preparation methods and the standardized conditions at a physiological level allowed the study of gravity response, day-night rhythms, organ shape development as well as the intracellular dynamic events of the cytoskeleton and endosomal compartments in an unprecedented manner. Several of these projects were successfully published in collaborations with Prof. Jozef Šamaj (Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic), Prof. Niko Geldner (University of Lausanne, Switzerland), Prof. Malcom Bennett (University of Nottingham, UK) and Dr. Jürgen Kleine-Vehn (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Austria). The main part of my work focused on the formation of lateral roots in Arabidopsis thaliana and was conducted in close collaboration with Dr. Alexis Maizel (University of Heidelberg, Germany). Previously, most experiments that describe lateral root formation have been performed on a small number of cells and for short periods of time. Capturing the complete process of lateral roots is an ambitious goal, because first, the primordium of a lateral root is located deep inside the primary root and imaging quality is impaired due to scattering of the <b>overlaying</b> <b>tissue.</b> Second, the process takes about 48 h, i. e. the plant has to be kept healthy for the whole period. Third, the amount of excitation light required for the spatio-temporal might have phototoxic effects that lead to a stop of growth at least in conventional microscopic techniques. In Arabidopsis embryogenesis, the sequence of cell divisions is relatively invariant. However, whether lateral root organogenesis follows particular cell division patterns has been unknown. The complete process of lateral root formation was captured from the first cell division until after the emergence from the main root. Images of a nuclei marker and a plasmamembrane marker were recorded every 5 min for a time period of up to 64 h. The positions and cell divisions of all cells were tracked manually. In collaboration with Alexander Schmitz (Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, Germany) and Dr. Jens Fangerau (University of Heidelberg, Germany), comprehensive analyses of the data were performed. A lateral root forms from initially 8 - 15 founder cells, arranged in a patch of 5 - 8 parallel files. The occurrence of new cell layers by periclinal divisions, as well as the sequence of layer generation was conserved and resembles the sequence suggested by Malamy and Benfey in 1997. Besides this stereotyped occurrence of periclinal divisions, radial divisions were found to appear stochastically, following no particular pattern. A large variability was also found in the contribution of founder cells and cell files to the final lateral root. In summary, the results suggest that a stereotyped pattern of cell divisions at particular developmental stages and a dynamically adapted control of cell divisions exist in parallel. Both properties allow a controlled but flexible development of the organ according to variations in cell topology and mechanical properties of the surrounding tissue. This work shows that LSFM, the sample preparation methods and controlled environmental conditions allow to capture and analyse the development of plants over several days at high resolution in an unprecedented manner...|$|R
40|$|Soft tissues are {{sensitive}} to prolonged compressive loading, eventually leading to tissue necrosis {{in the form of}} pressure ulcers [1]. Pressure ulcers can occur in situations where people are subjected to sustained mechanical loads, such as when bedridden, sitting in a wheelchair or from wearing prostheses. Pressure ulcers severely affect the patient's quality of life, since the ulcers are painful, difficult to heal and often prolong hospitalization periods. Despite considerable attempts to prevent pressure ulcers, prevalence figures remain unacceptably high. In a prevalence study involving more than 16, 000 patients in the Netherlands, a mean prevalence of 23. 1 % in health care institutions was reported [6]. Pressure ulcers are often classified in four different stages, ranging from discoloration of intact skin (Stage I) to full thickness skin loss involving tissue damage that extends to underlying bone involving both fat and muscle tissues (Stage IV). Although this classification is widely used in clinical practice, it does not necessarily relate to the origin of the ulcers. Depending on the nature of loading, pressure ulcers can either initiate superficially at the skin [15][33], or initiate in deeper layers such as muscle tissue [14][18][20][28]. The present study focuses on deep pressure ulcers that initiate in muscle tissue, since deeper ulcers are more harmful and show more extensive ulceration. In addition, muscle tissue is more susceptible to the development of pressure ulcers [2][23] and, hence, deep ulcers develop at a faster rate than superficial ulcers, making them particularly dangerous [2][14]. Yet, these deep ulcers are difficult to prevent and identify, since they are rarely visible at the skin surface at the time of initiation. As such, the four stage classification scheme can be misleading, since it does not represent an ordinal scale. In literature, a number of theories have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of pressure ulcers. These theories suggest that compression of a tissue can lead to localized ischaemia, impaired interstitial fluid flow and/or insufficient lymphatic drainage. Furthermore, relieving the tissue after sustained compression may lead to reperfusion injury. Recently, it was demonstrated that the deformation of cells due to external loading of the tissue can directly induce cell damage [8]. The primary cause of deep pressure ulcers is the external load applied at the patient support interface, resulting in compression of the tissue between the skin surface and the bony prominences. However, the externally applied load is not indicative of the local mechanical conditions in underlying muscle tissue (for example expressed in terms of stresses and strains), and thus not directly related to tissue damage [12][24][30]. In particular, when a tissue is compressed against an irregularly shaped bony prominence, the local mechanical condition within the muscle tissue may well exceed the measured loading condition at the skin interface. Therefore, the local mechanical loading condition could prove a more reliable predictor for the onset of tissue damage in these deeper tissue layers. When considering the local mechanical tissue condition, it should be noticed that an averaged mechanical condition associated with a small volume within the tissue, is not representative of the mechanical condition experienced at the cellular level. This is due to the heterogeneity of the microstructure [10][17][31]. Since tissue damage initiates with local cellular damage [7][11][20][23], it is necessary to consider this microstructure. In addition, the microstructural behavior must be considered since it inevitably determines the macroscopic constitutive behavior of the tissue. For example, when cell damage occurs, the microstructure is likely to change, which will be reflected in the macroscopic behavior of the tissue. In this case, {{it is not possible to}} describe the macroscopic behavior with a conventional constitutive law [10][21]. Since local mechanical conditions are difficult to measure experimentally, theoretical and numerical models have been developed, which relate externally applied pressures to the local mechanical condition within a tissue. In a theoretical model based on dimensional analyses, Sacks [27] derived a relationship between tolerable external pressure and duration of pressure. The rationale behind this analysis was that there is a definable pressure that causes a pressure ulcer, which is a function of both tissue properties and the blood flow through the tissue. The model did not take into account the local geometry of, for example, a bony prominence, leading to load distributions in the tissues. Zhang and coworkers [33] performed a theoretical analysis on the stress distribution within the tissue after application of shear and normal forces at the skin. To allow calculation of an analytical solution, both skin and muscle tissue were assumed to behave as linear, isotropic elastic materials. This model demonstrated that the highest stress concentrations were found within deeper layers of the soft tissue. To analyze more complex geometries and material behavior, the use of computer models, in particular the finite-element (FE) approach, is indispensable. Chow and Odell [12] and Todd and Tacker [30] developed finite element models of the human buttocks. In the model of Todd and Tacker [30], seated positions were simulated, thereby manipulating boundary conditions of the model. The authors concluded that there is no clear correlation between interface pressure and the local mechanical conditions. Oomens and coworkers [24] created a FE model of a human subject sitting on a cushion, which incorporated three different <b>tissue</b> layers <b>overlaying</b> the human ischial tuberositas, muscle, fat and skin. These soft tissues were modeled as nonlinear viscoelastic materials. Despite the uncertainties in material properties, the high peak stresses were consistently found near the bone prominences and in the fat layer. Furthermore, models based on mixture theory have been proposed to examine the transient biomechanical response of a skin layer as a result of tissue fluid flow within the tissue [22][33]. The numerical models described in literature focus on determination of local mechanical conditions in skin and underlying tissues in terms of homogenized tissue stresses and strains [12][22][25][30][32][33]. However, from the previous discussion it is clear that a microstructural analysis is required to determine the mechanical conditions that a cell experiences. Moreover, knowledge of the local mechanical condition alone is not sufficient to predict tissue damage initiation and evolution. Also the loading history of the tissue is essential, since the time that a tissue is subjected to a sustained compression is a major determinant of tissue damage [26]. A second aspect that, to date, has received relatively little attention, is the tissue tolerance against compression. Different tissues, such as skin, fat and muscle, may have a different tolerance level, which in turn may be patient dependent. The objective of the present study is to illustrate that prediction of pressure ulcer initiation on the basis of external load measurements is inadequate. By considering local load-time threshold curves, it is illustrated which variables quantitatively influence the threshold curves and, therefore, should be considered for the prediction of damage initiation. To this end, a numerical model was developed, which is based on a multilevel FE approach. This model can relate external loads applied to the skin, to the local mechanical conditions at the cell level. With this model, simulations were performed in which muscle tissue is compressed against a bony prominence. As a starting point, the model focuses on the role of cell deformations on cell damage. The model incorporates both the time aspect and a tissue tolerance level for damage in the form of a damage law that was derived from in vitro experiments [9]. A parameter study was performed to illustrate the effect of the cell tolerance and cell stiffness on the macroscopic tissue damage evolution...|$|R
