Most thankas are relatively small, comparable in size to a Western half-length portrait, but some are extremely large, several metres in each dimension; these were designed to be displayed, typically for very brief periods on a monastery wall, as part of religious festivals. Most thankas were intended for personal meditation or instruction of monastic students. They often have elaborate compositions including many very small figures. A central deity is often surrounded by other identified figures in a symmetrical composition. Narrative scenes are less common, but do appear.|$|E

40|$|Madder (Rubia tinctorum L.) {{has been}} widely used as a red dye {{throughout}} history. Acid-sensitive colorants present in madder, such as glycosides (lucidin primeveroside, ruberythric acid, galiosin) and sensitive aglycons (lucidin), are degraded in the <b>textile</b> <b>back</b> extraction process; in previous literature these sensitive molecules are either absent or present in only low concentrations due {{to the use of}} acid in typical <b>textile</b> <b>back</b> extraction processes. Anthraquinone aglycons alizarin and purpurin are usually identified in analysis following harsh back extraction methods, such those using solvent mixtures with concentrated hydrochloric acid at high temperatures. Use of softer extraction techniques potentially allows for dye components present in madder to be extracted without degradation, which can potentially provide more information about the original dye profile, which varies significantly between madder varieties, species and dyeing technique. Herein, a softer extraction method involving aqueous glucose solution was developed and compared to other back extraction techniques on wool dyed with root extract from different varieties of Rubia tinctorum. Efficiencies of the extraction methods were analysed by HPLC coupled with diode array detection. Acidic literature methods were evaluated and they generally caused hydrolysis and degradation of the dye components, with alizarin, lucidin, and purpurin being the main compounds extracted. In contrast, extraction in aqueous glucose solution provides a highly effective method for extraction of madder dyed wool and is shown to efficiently extract lucidin primeveroside and ruberythric acid without causing hydrolysis and also extract aglycons that are present due to hydrolysis during processing of the plant material. Glucose solution is a favourable extraction medium due to its ability to form extensive hydrogen bonding with glycosides present in madder, and displace them from the fibre. This new glucose method offers an efficient process that preserves these sensitive molecules and is a step-change in analysis of madder dyed textiles as it can provide further information about historical dye preparation and dyeing processes that current methods cannot. The method also efficiently extracts glycosides in artificially aged samples, making it applicable for museum textile artefacts...|$|R

U otvorenim pitanjima o restauriranju autentičnih vrijednosti naspram restauriranju značenja, otvorila se i rasprava u kojoj su se sučelile tradicionalna – tzv „klasična“ i suvremene teorije restauriranja. „Klasična teorija restauriranja” oslonjena na objektivnost, istinitost i autentičnost potvrđene znanstvenim istraživanjima i danas je dominantna u konzerviranju-restauriranju, ali se sve više razvijaju i alternativne suvremene teorije koje su nastale na kritici baš tih postavki. In the {{development}} of conservation thought, the theories {{that have been developed}} throughout the 19 th and {{the first half of the}} 20 th century are considered “classic”, as they share an important common principle: it is the em-phasis which is laid on authenticity, i. e. the Truth which is transmitted to the future. The value of each theory is measured by the number of problems it solves. The “classic theory of conservation” is based upon objectivity, truthfulness and authenticity, and is nowadays dominant, with an ever-increasing influence of science in the field. Its conclusions, that conserva-tion must be dominated by the truth, which is further determined and confirmed by scientific methods, are considered to be the cannon. However, a series of younger authors have developed some alternative contemporary theories. Contrary to the “classic”, the “contemporary theory of conservation” does not insist on truthfulness or authenticity of an artefact. It postulates that each conservation effort necessarily alters the artefact, as the conserva-tors change or even impair authenticity. Contemporary theorists argue that conservation modifies the pre-existingauthentic reality of an artefact. Therefore, the process of conservation cannot be objective, as it is the conservators who choose the artefact to be presented in the condition that they are able to give it. A good example for examining the tenets of classic and contemporary theories of conservation, in other words for illustrating the changes taking place in the contemporary theories of conservation, is the chasuble marked as “C 035 from the parish church in Motovun”, which has already been discussed in professional and scientific publications. The conservation treatment was performed in 2009 at the Department for Textiles, Paper and Leather of the Croatian Conservation Institute in Zagreb. The chasuble’s conservation procedure was conducted through exemplary specialist treatments which have already been presented and published. According to the comprehensive documentation of the treatments, it is clear that within the textile layers of the chasuble, there have been detected and identified the traces of lining the Renaissance embroidery with paper, which is a well-known procedure in the technology of embroidery production. In the course of the conservation treatment, the chasuble was physically partitioned, which made it necessary to distinguish two artefacts. One of these was analyzed in detail and valorized; it is the textile portion of the chasuble, which was the primary point of interest and the motive for the strategically planned treatment. The other object was to an extent a complete surprise, although it is not uncommon in conservation practice to encounter similar cases of paper inlays in between the historical layers of textile. It is precisely these paper inlays that have changed their function and “value”, embedded as a different/support material into the <b>textile</b> <b>backing</b> for the embroidery. Here we have two types of material and two semantic levels of identifying-recognizing: a decorative piece of liturgical vestment, designed in a recognizable way from a specific type of textile, which is at the same time adorned with artistically designed embroidery and by way of cutting the written fragments that are shaped to fit the format and the form of the embroidery. These pieces of paper had long ago, when they were inlayed into the chasuble, lost their original material and non-material (communicational) traits and functions, so it is indeed not possible to restore the former unity of the presumed pieces of paper. What has, in terms of the theory of conservation, been achieved by returning the conserved paper inlays into the interior of the chasuble as a conserved liturgical textile artefact? This kind of presentation has, not without dilemmas, been motivated by the ECCO Professional Guidelines. What has been gained is the integrity of the authentic historical layering and the documentary character of the treatment. What has been lost? Most probably the possibility to subsequently analyze and investigate the written fragments, which could lead to a better understanding of the context, in addition to uncovering potential, to us yet unfamiliar values. Was it possible in the first place to rehabilitate the authentic historical function of the paper as the embroidery backing? And can those fragments, due to the damage to the paper, be appropriate for the conserved textile? What about the condition of the 16 th-century paper – can a re-contamination be predicted? What has remained authentic after the conservation and what is an addition? The complex issue of presenting the Motovun chasuble has clearly introduced us to new conservation assignments. The ECCO Professional Guidelines have been selected as starting point for the conservation treatment proposal. With respect to the Guidelines, a question can be raised, of whether the return of the paper fragments to the chasuble has really interfered with its historical value? To put it simply, it is impossible to return to the historical condition prior to the conservation treatment, by re-utilizing the conserved paper fragments and using them as starting point, as the original, authentic condition has indeed been altered. Has the conserved chasuble become redesigned with the use of the existing old elements that have been re-inlayed, but at the same time with the new elements (the thread and other materials used) ...|$|E

Less glamorous and more tribal than the many more studied luxury textiles, a mysterious group of thirty-six early painted tapestries and twenty-one carpets - all woolen - forms the focus of this study. They have been kept in Kyoto since the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as part of the local Gion Festival floats' decorations and have until recently been understood as ink-painted tapestries from Korea and regional wool-pile carpets from western China. Indeed, the Japanese notion of the tapestries as Korean made perfect sense in so far as the Japanese having acquired them largely from Korea in centuries past. 2 In this context, it is worthwhile to mention Thomas Cole, who argues for a change in focus on Tibetan rugs from the conventional references to both Chinese and Buddhist influence. Instead, he suggests that the Tibetan weaving tradition should be viewed in a Central Asian tribal context. 1 Similarly, Gonick looks for the provenance beyond Korea and successfully traces all of these <b>textiles</b> <b>back</b> to Gansu in China. This new provenance is a significant contribution of her study. Another is contextualizing the textiles within the Manichaean religion and the material culture it gave rise to.

HPLC {{has been used to}} build a fingerprint of each dye plant profile and thus used to compare to the profiles of <b>back</b> extraction from <b>textiles</b> for natural dye identification in historical artefacts. The use of solid phase extraction is compared to extraction methods with no purification step which is favourable for anthraquinone dyes but results in a major loss of glycosidic compounds when using yellow dyestuffs. Supported by 1 H and 13 C NMR data, the conclusive X-ray crystal structure of the natural dye ruberythric acid is presented which has never been achieved prior to this research. In a collaboration with food science two of the main components of chamomile are fully characterised by 1 D and 2 D, 1 H and 13 C NMR. These compounds are usually referred to as ferulic acid derivatives in the literature but their actual structure is reported herein. The thesis also discusses the relative dye uptake of anthraquinone compounds onto wool textiles which were measured by HPLC. Sorption isotherms for the main anthraquinones in madder; ruberythric acid, pseudopurpurin and alizarin are compared for more in-depth understanding on the method of adsorption of these compounds. Herein the glycosidic compounds in madder are shown to have a higher adsorption capacity than the aglycons. Ruberythric acid is shown to follow a Tempkin isotherm with the highest degree of correlation but both alizarin and ruberythric acid show good fitting with the Freundlich isotherm also. Pseudopurpurin was shown to follow a Freundlich isotherm with the highest degree of linearity but did also show some fitting to the Langmuir isotherm. The isotherms allow data to be collected on the energy of adsorption and draw conclusions on the effect the functional groups have on the dyeing capability which is studied herein {{for the first time on}} individual anthraquinone components. iii Studies were carried out on the acid-sensitive colorants present in madder which are degraded in the <b>textile</b> <b>back</b> extraction process. Anthraquinone aglycons alizarin and purpurin are usually identified in analysis following harsh back extraction methods, such as those using solvent mixtures with concentrated hydrochloric acid at high temperatures.

Looking at maps has expanded my ideas of narrative. I like Margaret Atwood’s definition of narrative. She says it’s “one damn thing after another” with the operative word being “after. ” But, she stresses that events occur in relation to one another. This does not necessarily evoke a linear progression, the thread of the story so to speak, but rather a broad building up. I think maps appeal to me as a narrative vehicle because they evoke a territory and a sense of passage, of time and events within geography.

Each country is represented by its characteristic shape and flag alternately stretched or condensed to fit the shape. Descriptions both in books and on the web, vary between calling the technique embroidery or tapestry - to a textile person a specific practice - yet to the art world not important to distinguish. These maps contain the personal narrative of Boetti for whom Afghanistan was a beloved place, the story of the embroiderers –some of whom worked on these maps in refugee camps– and the more readily apparent narratives of nations’ identities and evolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{collection}} holds {{personal and}} official papers, photographs, documents, correspondence, memoirs and notes pertaining to {{four generations of}} the Altmann family. Topics of the collection are, among others, {{the lives of the}} family members in Austria-Hungary, in pre-war Austria, during the emigration process, and in the United States. Part of the material focuses on the family’s genealogy. Bernhard Altmann was born in 1888 in Przemyśl, Galizia, Austria (today Przemyśl, Poland), the son of Karl Chaskel Altmann and Karoline Keile Altmann. Karl Chaskel Altmann was born in Bachory (close to Oleszyce, Galizia) in 1864, the son of Moses Altmann; he was one of many members of the Altmann family engaged in the textile industry. Bernhard Altmann became a textile manufacturer in Vienna, where he and his family – his first wife Nelly Cornelia Altmann and several siblings –¬ lived, until they had to flee Vienna after the “Anschluss” in March 1938. Bernhard Altmann entered the Viennese textile business in 1915. 1919 he established his first company, which expanded in Vienna as well as in various other places, among others in Moscow and Paris and had grown to more than 1000 employees {{by the time it was}} “Aryanized” in 1938. Some of the family members were engaged in textile companies by Bernhard Altmann in Vienna and Liverpool. Bernhard Altmann, who fled to Liverpool via Paris in 1938, supported several family members in escaping Vienna in 1938, among them his wife Nelly and his brothers Max, Julius and Fritz with their families. After having fled Austria, Bernhard Altmann lived in England; in the United States, where he started successful cashmere <b>textile</b> companies; <b>back</b> in Austria; and in Switzerland, where he died in Zurich in 1960.

40|$|For decades, {{conventional}} amour shield {{is mainly}} oriented on metallic materials which are today well-known. Since {{the use of}} non conventional threats as IEDs, performances of those protections are required to be upgraded. The expected improvements that manufacturers are looking for are mainly oriented to the weight reduction which is the key parameter to reduce the fuel consumption, increase the payload, and offer more manoeuvrability to vehicles [1]. However, the difficulty is to reduce as cautiously as possible the total mass of the protection solution while ensuring {{the safety of the}} vehicle. One of the possible solutions is to use new combinations of materials, able to be more efficient against new threats and lighter than the traditional steel armour. It is in this context that the combination between some well-known ballistic alloys and textile composite material appear as a high potential solution for armour plated protection. Indeed, used as a <b>backing,</b> <b>textile</b> composite material present some interesting properties such as a very low density compared with steel and good behaviour in term of ballistic efficiency. This study proposes to test and compare the behaviour and efficiency of three different textile composite backings...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} dyed flax fibers {{have been}} found in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia and date back to 34,000 BC.More evidence of <b>textile</b> dyeing dates <b>back</b> to the Neolithic period at the large Neolithic settlement at Çatalhöyük in southern Anatolia, where traces of red dyes, possibly from ocher, an iron oxide pigment derived from clay, were found. In China, dyeing with plants, barks, and insects has been traced back more than 5,000 years. Early evidence of dyeing comes from Sindh province in Pakistan, where a piece of cotton dyed with a vegetable dye was recovered from the archaeological site at Mohenjo-daro (3rd millennium BCE). The dye used in this case was madder, which, along with other dyes such as indigo, was introduced to other regions through trade. Natural insect dyes such as Cochineal and kermes and plant-based dyes such as woad, indigo and madder were important elements of the economies of Asia and Europe until the discovery of man-made synthetic dyes in the mid-19th century. The first synthetic dye was William Perkin's mauveine in 1856, derived from coal tar. Alizarin, the red dye present in madder, was the first natural pigment to be duplicated synthetically in 1869, a development which led to the collapse of the market for naturally grown madder. The development of new, strongly colored synthetic dyes followed quickly, and by the 1870s commercial dyeing with natural dyestuffs was disappearing.|$|R

Although the Netherlands this piece Bailiwick {{as a former}} part of Staats-Brabant claimed back, the city of Lommel had already sworn his allegiance to the Belgian government.On April 19, 1839 finally became the definitive peace treaties signed by Belgium and the Netherlands. That same year Maaseik was created as a new administrative district and Lommel was added thereto.This will be a radical change {{in the history of}} Lommel: the traditional Brabantse place is now called Limburg place and is the only piece Meierij, located in Belgium. Although Lommel legally to Limburg counts, the rest of Limburg will remain {{in the eyes of the}} real Lommelsen still: [...] Liege [...] or [...] "Liège country". The Meierijse history of Lommel remains at least live on in the many descriptions.On the market square stands a statuette of a teut, a typical historic phenomenon in the region. Teuten were itinerant merchants and craftsmen from the 16th to 20th centuries with their merchandise (copper, <b>textiles,</b> pottery ...) marched <b>back</b> to the Netherlands, Germany, France and Luxembourg.Lommel, especially the district of Barrier during the Second World War, a pivotal role in Operation Market Garden. By the conquest of Joe's Bridge, bridge no. 9 on the Kempisch Channel, the Irish Guards on September 10, 1944, the British forces possessed a bridgehead towards the Netherlands. On September 17, 1944 she crossed the Dutch border.|$|R
