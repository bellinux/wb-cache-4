Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city permit. An example is the city of Glendale, California: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the California sycamore, the coast live oak, mesa oak, valley oak, scrub oak, California bay. Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit. Within the permit they have to provide detailed information {{about the number of}} trees affected, trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> submit photographs of the site, and a site plan sketch.|$|E

25|$|Research {{in writing}} {{development}} has been limited in psychology. In the research that has been conducted, focus has generally centred {{on the development of}} written and spoken language and their connection. Spoken and written skills could be considered linked. Researchers believe that children's spoken language influences their written language. When a child learns to write they need to master letter formation, spelling, punctuation and <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> gain an understanding of the structure and the organisational patterns involved in written language.|$|E

25|$|Historians {{have also}} noted {{population}} densities seem {{to concentrate on}} coastlines and that states with large coasts benefit from higher average incomes compared to those in landlocked countries. Coastal living has proven advantageous for centuries as civilizations relied on the coastline and waterways for trade, irrigation, and as a food source. Conversely, countries without coastlines or navigable waterways are often less urbanized and have less growth potential due to the slow movement of knowledge capital, technological advances, and people. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> rely on costly and time consuming over-land trade, which usually results in {{lack of access to}} regional and international markets, further hindering growth. Additionally, interior locations tend to have both lower population densities and labor-productivity levels. However, factors including fertile soil, nearby rivers, and ecological systems suited for rice or wheat cultivation can give way to dense inland populations.|$|E
25|$|At most {{international}} events, {{each country}} may send {{one to a}} maximum of three entries per discipline. Consequently, even if a skater has a high season's best, he or she may not be sent to major events if their country has many good skaters in their discipline. Some skaters have tried to circumvent this by switching to another country. In response, the ISU introduced rules barring skaters from international events for a certain period of time. In the 2010 regulations, it was 24 months or more from the date of the last ISU Championship. In the 2012 regulations, the minimum was 18 months for singles and 12 months for pairs/ice dancers from the date of their last ISU Championships (Worlds, Europeans, Four Continents, Junior Worlds) and 12 months if they competed in some other international competition. Competitors may sit out for much longer because <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> obtain a release from their previous federation. The ISU has set no limit to how long a country may hold skaters.|$|E

500|$|Horses are non-ruminant herbivores {{of a type}} {{known as}} a [...] "hindgut fermenter." [...] Horses have only one stomach, as do humans. [...] However, unlike humans, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> utilize plant fiber (largely cellulose) that comes from grass and hay. Ruminants like cattle are foregut fermenters, and digest fiber in plant matter by use of a multi-chambered stomach, whereas horses use {{microbial}} fermentation {{in a part of}} the digestive system known as the cecum (or caecum) to break down the cellulose.|$|E
2500|$|Of course, {{the reason}} why {{children}} need to learn the sound distinctions of their language is because then <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn the meaning associated with those different sounds. Young children have a remarkable ability to learn meanings for the words they extract from the speech they are exposed to, i.e., to map meaning onto the sounds. Often children already associate a meaning with a new word after only one exposure. This {{is referred to as}} “fast mapping”.|$|E

2500|$|Amharic has {{traditionally}} been the Ethiopian lingua franca but there are about 90 different Ethiopian languages or dialects. Primary schools taught children in Amharic until 1994, when the government promoted use of ethnic languages as the medium of instruction. Children whose mother tongue is not Amharic are still disadvantaged since <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn Amharic. Amharic shares the Ge'ez script with other Semitic languages such as Tigrinya (Tegrigna), the Gurage languages and related Harari [...] Afan Oromo is the mother-tongue of {{about a third of}} Ethiopians and it, together with Wolaytta, Afar, Sidama and Somali use a Latin script. This can cause interference with learning English because the sounds represented differ from those used in English.|$|E
