25|$|Some months after, dragged to the gibbet at {{the tail}} of a mule, the black met his voiceless end. The body was burned to ashes; but for many days, the head, that hive of subtlety, fixed on a pole in the Plaza, met, unabashed, <b>the</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whites; and across the Plaza looked towards St. Bartholomew's church, in whose vaults slept then, as now, the {{recovered}} bones of Aranda: and across the Rimac bridge looked towards the monastery, on Mount Agonia without; where, three months after being dismissed by the court, Benito Cereno, borne on the bier, did, indeed, follow his leader.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{art critic}} Leo Steinberg {{in his essay}} The Philosophical Brothel posited a wholly {{different}} explanation for {{the wide range of}} stylistic attributes. Using the earlier sketches—which had been ignored by most critics—he argued that far from evidence of an artist undergoing a rapid stylistic metamorphosis, the variety of styles can be read as a deliberate attempt, a careful plan, to capture <b>the</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viewer. He notes that the five women all seem eerily disconnected, indeed wholly unaware of each other. Rather, they focus solely on the viewer, their divergent styles only furthering the intensity of their glare.|$|E

In an experiment, we evaluated <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> seeing <b>the</b> <b>gaze</b> location <b>of</b> an expert programmer when describing two algorithms {{to a group of}} novice programmers. Here we focus on an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global fixational measures.

Between 1863 and 1865, it was remodelled by Possidónio da Silva {{in order to provide}} a Royal sitting room in the tastes of Queen Maria Pia. Avant-garde for its time it included visual effects that proportioned the space, including two grand mirrors on opposite walls (one over the fireplace and the other between two windows) and a Romanesque arch opening that extends <b>the</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blue Room into the neighbouring Gabinete de Carvalho annex.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gorgon (1992): a poem-film for BBC {{television}} by British poet Tony Harrison. The film {{examines the}} politics of conflict in the 20th century using the Gorgon as a metaphor. The imaginary narration {{of the film is}} done through the mouth of Jewish poet Heinrich Heine. The film describes the connection between the Corfu Gorgon at the Artemis Temple of Corfu and Kaiser Wilhelm II. Harrison concludes his 1992 film-poem by making a proposal that in the 1994 European Union summit in Corfu, Heine's statue be returned to Corfu on time to preside over the new Europe so that EU can keep its eyes open and not turn to stone from the Gorgon's gaze.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect, pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a different way of telling a story. I wanted <b>the</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child on his future to meet <b>the</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old man he has become on his past. I wanted to talk about complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E

500|$|The Netherlandish artists {{moved away}} from the profile view – popularised during the Italian Quattrocento – towards the less formal but more {{engaging}} three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer. <b>The</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sitter rarely engages the viewer. Van Eyck's 1433 Portrait of a Man is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer. [...] Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits {{or in the case of}} potential betrothals, when the object of the work is to make the sitter as attractive as possible. In these cases the sitter was often shown smiling, with an engaging and radiant expression designed to appeal to her intended.|$|E

It starts with the little boy trying to go inside a peep show, where Madonna is the star performer, but gets rebuffed by an old man at the ticket booth. Inside Madonna starts singing the song from the center of a carousel that revolves to display her to <b>the</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> customers who are sitting safely in their cubicles. Madonna is dressed in a black bustier, spike heels, fishnets, revealing her new slimmed down body at that time. She begins the video wearing a black wig which she subsequently removes, revealing her short bleached hair. The bluish and dark lighting reveals her look as a mix of actresses Marlene Dietrich in the movie The Blue Angel as well as Liza Minnelli as the character Sally Bowles in the Bob Fosse-directed musical film, Cabaret.|$|E

2500|$|The {{significance}} of the war for oppressed classes as well as subject populations was clear too to the Socialist thinker Rosa Luxemburg: [...] "The Russo–Japanese War now gives to all an awareness that even war and peace in Europe – its destiny – is not decided between the four walls of the European concert, but outside it, in the gigantic maelstrom of world and colonial politics. And it's in this that the real meaning of the current war resides for social-democracy, even if we set aside its immediate effect: the collapse of Russian absolutism. This war brings <b>the</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international proletariat back to the great political and economic connectedness of the world, and violently dissipates in our ranks the particularism, the pettiness of ideas that form in any period of political calm."

This is explained by its original positioning in the church {{on the right side}} of the altar. Viewing the painting from a side angle allows the perspective of the tiled floor and <b>the</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disciples towards Jesus to emphasise his status as the main subject of the painting.

In the background there is a portal above Jesus that opens up to a room where the last supper takes place. The opening to the left shows buildings with elaborate and fantastic architecture. The architecture is based closely on designs by Sebastiano Serlio.|$|E
