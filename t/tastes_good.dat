500|$|Future R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company {{president}} Bowman Gray Jr. was {{in charge}} of marketing Winstons, which were a new addition to the R.J. Reynolds line in 1954. Gray listened to advertising employees from the William Esty Co., and the slogan [...] "Winston <b>tastes</b> <b>good</b> like a cigarette ought to" [...] was considered, then replaced by the more succinct [...] "Winston <b>tastes</b> <b>good</b> like a cigarette should." ...|$|E
500|$|During the campaign's {{long run}} in the media, many criticized the slogan as grammatically {{incorrect}} and that it should say, [...] "Winston <b>tastes</b> <b>good</b> as a cigarette should." [...] Ogden Nash, in The New Yorker, published a poem that ran [...] "Like goes Madison Avenue, like so goes the nation." [...] Walter Cronkite, then hosting The Morning Show, refused to say the line as written, and an announcer was used instead.|$|E

500|$|In {{the radio}} and {{television}} advertisements, the slogan is presented in a singsong fashion with a noticeable two-beat clap near the end, so the jingle would sound like Win-ston <b>tastes</b> <b>good</b> like a (clap clap) cigarette should. The [...] "clap" [...] noise was sometimes substituted for actors in the commercials knocking twice against a truck carrying Winston cigarettes, or an actor flicking his lighter twice to the same conceit.|$|E
500|$|... "Winston <b>tastes</b> <b>good</b> like a {{cigarette}} should" [...] is an enduring slogan {{that appeared in}} newspaper, magazine, radio, and television advertisements for Winston cigarettes from the brand's introduction in 1954 until 1972. It {{is one of the}} best-known American tobacco advertising campaigns. In 1999, Advertising Age ranked the jingle eighth-best out of all the radio and television jingles that aired in the United States in the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1961, a small furor enveloped the {{literary}} and journalistic communities in the United States when Merriam-Webster published its Third New International Dictionary. In the dictionary, the editors refused to condemn the use of [...] "like" [...] as a conjunction, and cited [...] "Winston <b>tastes</b> <b>good</b> like a cigarette should" [...] {{as an example of}} popular colloquial use. After publication of Webster's Third, The New York Times called the edition [...] "bolshevik," [...] and the Chicago Daily News wrote that the transgression signified [...] "a general decay in values." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1970 and 1971, Winston {{sought to}} revamp its image and chose {{to respond to}} many grammarians' qualms with the slogan, [...] "What do you want, good grammar or good taste?" [...] Mad {{magazine}} published a parody of this on the back cover of its January 1971 issue; set in a cemetery, it featured four tombstones with epitaphs written {{in the past tense}} ("Winston tasted good like a cigarette should've" [...] "You mean as a cigarette should've'" [...] "What did you want, good grammar or good taste?" [...] "I wanted to live a lot longer than this!"). With the new slogan in wide use, [...] "Winston <b>tastes</b> <b>good</b> like a cigarette should" [...] was retired permanently in 1972.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} famous {{television}} jingles of the era came from an advertisement for Winston cigarettes. The slogan [...] "Winston <b>tastes</b> <b>good</b> like a cigarette should!" [...] proved to be catchy, and is still quoted today. When used to introduce Gunsmoke (gun = smoke), two gun shots were heard {{in the middle of the}} jingle just when listeners were expecting to hear the word [...] "cigarette". Other popular slogans from the 1960s were [...] "Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch!," [...] which was used to advertise Tareyton cigarettes, and [...] "I'd Walk a Mile for a Camel".|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, in the 1950s and 1960s, {{cigarette}} brands {{were frequently}} sponsors of television programs. One {{of the most}} famous television jingles of the era came from an advertisement for Winston cigarettes. The slogan [...] "Winston <b>tastes</b> <b>good</b> like a cigarette should!" [...] proved to be catchy. Another popular slogan from the 1960s was [...] "Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch!," [...] which was used to advertise Tareyton cigarettes. America's first regular television news program, Camel News Caravan, was sponsored by Camel Cigarettes and featured an ashtray on the desk in front of the newscaster and the Camel logo behind him. The show ran from 1949 to 1956.|$|E
2500|$|Another of {{his network}} {{assignments}} was The Morning Show, CBS' short-lived challenge to NBC's Today in 1954. His on-air duties included interviewing guests and chatting with a lion puppet named Charlemane about the news. He considered this discourse with a puppet as [...] "one of the highlights" [...] of the show. He added, [...] "A puppet can render opinions on {{people and things}} that a human commentator would not feel free to utter. I was and I am proud of it." [...] Cronkite also angered the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the show's sponsor, by grammatically correcting its advertising slogan. Instead of saying [...] "Winston <b>tastes</b> <b>good</b> like a cigarette should" [...] verbatim, he substituted [...] "as" [...] for [...] "like." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} some {{historical}} anecdotes that have related to food and wine pairing before modern times. One anecdote often attributed to British wine merchants is [...] "Buy on an apple and sell on cheese" [...] meaning that if a wine <b>tastes</b> <b>good</b> when paired with a raw, uncooked apple it must be truly good and pairing any wine with cheese will make it more palatable to the average consumer and easier to sell. The principles behind this anecdote lies in the food pairing properties of both fruit and cheeses. Fruits that are high in sugar and acidity (such as the malic acid in green apples) can make wines taste metallic and thin bodied. In contrast, hard cheeses such as cheddar can soften the tannins in wines and make them taste fuller and fruitier.|$|E

2500|$|Taste can be {{objective}} {{in terms of}} the five tastes (sweet, salt, sour, bitter, and savory) {{but it can also be}} subjective in terms of what we deem [...] "good" [...] and [...] "bad." [...] Taste is [...] "subjective, objective, and qualitative". In terms of it being a philosophical concept, taste is hard to define because it is essentially subjective when pertaining to the personal preferences of individuals i.e. [...] "'de gustibus non est disputandum' (there is no disputing taste)". We cannot tell someone they do not think something <b>tastes</b> <b>good</b> because we do not agree, and vice versa. In order to evaluate taste in this context, we must explore all the ways in which taste can be defined. According to Alan Weiss, taste fulfills the purpose of six functions: taste is the tool in which we use to define flavor; it is also flavor and how we categorize flavor (sweet or salty); it is the preference, we as the tastemakers, place on specific flavors and our demand for those flavors; it is whether we choose to like or dislike a certain taste and therefore allow it into our general society of acceptable tastes or exile it; it is the value in which we place on certain taste (one might believe one's taste in Bach or Rothko earns one capital); and lastly, with good judgement comes good taste and therefore, one with expressively good taste are expected to have good judgement, just as those in bad taste are expected to be in bad judgement ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not just now," [...] said Wisk. [...] "I don't want to rob you, {{and it is}} {{foolish to}} eat more than one needs, just because the food <b>tastes</b> <b>good.</b> But if I get very hungry, perhaps I'll ask you for another bite." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Matilda Pitman smiled. Even eighty-odd is {{sometimes}} vulnerable in vanity. [...] "I've heard that children and fools tell the truth," [...] she said. [...] "I {{was used to}} compliments when I was young--but they're scarcer when you get as far along as I am. I haven't had one for years. It <b>tastes</b> <b>good.</b> I s'pose now, you monkey, you wouldn't give me a kiss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} keep Fortune outside, Roustem,' said she, in a peculiarly sweet musical voice. 'The Emperor {{is not very}} fond of dogs, and if we intrude upon his {{quarters}} we cannot do less than consult his <b>tastes.</b> <b>Good</b> evening, Monsieur de Talleyrand! Madame de Remusat and I have driven all along the cliffs, and we have stopped as we passed {{to know if the}} Emperor is coming to Pont de Briques. But perhaps he has already started. I had expected to find him here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Men often escape {{with less}} than their deserts;" [...] Maso drily answered. [...] "Well, fortune, or the saints, or Calvin, or {{whatever}} power most suits your <b>tastes,</b> <b>good</b> friends, has at length put a roof over our heads,--an honor that rarely arrives to most of us, if I may judge by appearances and some little knowledge of the different trades we follow. Thou wilt have a fair occasion to suffer Policinello to rest from his uneasy antics, Pippo, while his master breathes the air through a window {{for the first time}} in many a day, as I will answer." ...|$|E
