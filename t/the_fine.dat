40|$|By {{removing}} <b>the</b> primary <b>fines</b> from an oxygen-delignified mill birch pulp, a fiber fraction {{was obtained}} having low metals content and no extractives. After DEDeD bleaching the fiber fraction had somewhat higher brightness and better brightness stability than the birch pulp containing <b>the</b> primary <b>fines.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fines</b> fraction was enriched with lignin, extractives, xylan, and metals. Bleaching <b>the</b> <b>fines</b> fraction in a QQP sequence {{did not affect}} the extractives, whereas a ZeQP sequence clearly reduced the extractives content. In a biorefinery concept, <b>the</b> <b>fines</b> fraction could be utilized as a source of xylan, fatty acids, sterols, and betulinol.

40|$|The {{specific}} energy consumption and <b>the</b> <b>fining</b> {{performance of a}} continuous model fining space were defined {{for the evaluation of}} the glass-fining process in the space. A horizontal rectangular channel with a uniform isothermal flow of the molten glass and the experimentally obtained values of the bubble-growth rates − measured under different physicochemical conditions − were applied to calculate <b>the</b> <b>fining</b> times and, consequently, <b>the</b> <b>fining</b> performance of <b>the</b> channel. The fundamental significance of the temperature and the optimal concentration of <b>the</b> <b>fining</b> agent were confirmed by the calculations. The bubble-growth rate was proved to be a crucial quantity determining the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>fining</b> process, and its values can be used for a comparison of <b>the</b> <b>fining</b> abilities of different glasses.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{different}} types of fines to adsorb colloidal extractives and whether this adsorption is influenced by pH and the addition of NaCl, have been measured. In order to produce <b>the</b> different <b>fines,</b> chips from Norway spruce were refined in a pilot refiner. This was executed four successive times, producing different types of <b>fines.</b> Most of <b>the</b> <b>fines</b> were removed from the pulp by washing before further refining. <b>The</b> <b>fines</b> were washed and centrifuged before the adsorption measurements. A colloidal dispersion of extractives was produced by extracting TMP with acetone, and rapidly mixing this extract with water. After the acetone had been removed, the colloidal dispersion was added to <b>the</b> <b>fines</b> and <b>the</b> adsorption isotherms were measured. Below pH 5 there was clear adsorption of the colloids to <b>the</b> <b>fines,</b> which was not seen between pH 5 and 8. The adsorption at pH 3 was strongly influenced by the addition of NaCl. A rough estimation of the specific surface of <b>the</b> <b>fines</b> indicated that <b>the</b> different <b>fines</b> had similar abilities to adsorb the colloidal wood resin per square meter...|$|R
