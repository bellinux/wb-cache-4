40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} data communication over the reliable Transport Control Protocol (TCP), in a low capacity wireless networking environment. We make an emphasize on studying effects of TCP parameters, and TCP's flow control scheme on end to end performance. Our tests were carried out mainly over a GSM - Internet link. The main feature of such a networking system, is a wide disparity in data link capacity over the transmission path. Our results show that in such a system TCP's slow start and congestion avoidance algorithms {{in the case of}} single data packet loss do not lead to significant performance degradation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to investigate}} early childhood lead teachers' perspectives of <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> including their attitudes and beliefs, and the practice of <b>time</b> <b>out</b> in their classrooms. The study sought to detail the practice of <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> to investigate teachers' perceptions of <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> and to gain further understanding into teachers' choices regarding <b>time</b> <b>out</b> use. These objectives were achieved {{with the use of a}} comprehensive, written survey directed to 151 lead preschool teachers at 18 randomly selected preschool programs within Hamilton County, Ohio. Written discipline policies from 9 preschool programs included in the survey sample were also analyzed as they related to the use of <b>time</b> <b>out.</b> Fifty completed surveys were returned representing a well-balanced sample of lead teachers across multiple demographic variables. Results indicated that 66 % of teachers were using <b>time</b> <b>out</b> and there were not any distinguishable differences among the variables collected between those teachers who used <b>time</b> <b>out</b> and those who did not. Teachers' <b>time</b> <b>out</b> practices included verbal or visual warnings for children, discussion, and redirection. Teachers defined <b>time</b> <b>out</b> as an action, as a period of time, and as a place. 63 % of teachers did not perceive <b>time</b> <b>out</b> as punishment; nonetheless 55 % perceived that <b>time</b> <b>out</b> had the potential to be harmful to young children. The majority of teachers using <b>time</b> <b>out</b> did so because they perceived that the child learned through <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> but other teachers indicated that young children were not able to comprehend <b>time</b> <b>out.</b> Some teachers used <b>time</b> <b>out</b> due to the perceived social and emotional benefits for the child while other teachers perceived <b>time</b> <b>out</b> to be detrimental to children's social and emotional development. Teachers also indicated that they used <b>time</b> <b>out</b> to maintain control of children. Teachers who used <b>time</b> <b>out</b> were influenced by experience, education, program policies, and because <b>time</b> <b>out</b> is a form of discipline. Interestingly, these same factors influenced other teachers to not use <b>time</b> <b>out.</b> The majority of the teachers who chose not to use <b>time</b> <b>out</b> were influenced by other methods available for classroom or behavior management.

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>out</b> is a {{well-known}} discipline technique that has gained popularity among parents trying to manage and guide children’s behavior. When used appropriately, <b>time</b> <b>out</b> is an effective discipline tool; however, it is often overused in trying to handle too many situations of misbehavior. <b>Time</b> <b>out</b> is most effective when used {{for only a few}} specific situations. No one discipline technique works with every type of misbehavior. A parent needs to learn and be equipped with many discipline tools to guide their child’s behavior successfully. Here are several strategies that may be helpful. <b>Time</b> <b>Out</b> <b>Time</b> <b>out</b> is a technique used to interrupt an unacceptable behavior by removing the child from the situation where the misbehavior is occurring. Before using <b>time</b> <b>out</b> the child must understand the concepts of “waiting” and “quiet; ” this usually occurs by age three. The <b>time</b> <b>out</b> location selected should be a quiet, dull place devoid of activity. Preschool age children should be placed in an area where you can see them at all times. Children should be expected to stay in the <b>time</b> <b>out</b> for no more than one minute per year of age—for example, a four year old would be given four minutes. Explain the <b>time</b> <b>out</b> procedure ahead of time. Walk the younger child through the procedure until he or she understands. Time the quiet time only (not the time spent whining, yelling, or crying). When the time is up, explain to the child again what behavior is appropriate and allow him or her to return to the activity. Praise the child for using appropriate behavior. When <b>time</b> <b>out</b> doesn’t work: <b>Time</b> <b>out</b> won’t work if it is overused. If you use <b>time</b> <b>out</b> for every behavior problem, the effectiveness will lessen because it becomes an automatic response: “I yelled, now I’m in <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> and now I’m done. ” Also make sure to choose a toy-free place for the <b>time</b> <b>out.</b> Choosing a location where there are tons of toys and distractions, such as the child’s room, won’t allow the child to think about what they have done wrong (Famil...|$|R
