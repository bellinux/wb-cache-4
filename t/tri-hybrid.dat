Because of the nature of botanical restriction, breeding programs often encounter impediments. Reciprocal crosses may be difficult because the apomictic parent cannot be used as female parents. However interspecific crosses are well documented. There are <b>tri-hybrids</b> and quad-hybrids being produced (crossing 3 or 4 distinct species). Such work indicates that complex hybrids should be possible.

40|$|Today, groups {{considered}} Hispanic in the United States {{consist of}} populations whose complex genetic structures reflect intermixed diverse {{groups of people}} who came in contact during Spanish colonization in Latin America. After coming in contact and wiping {{out most of the}} Native Americans who occupied North and Latin America, the Spanish also introduced West African individuals for labor to begin developing crops to be shipped back to Europe, resulting in the Trans-Atlantic African slave trade. These migration events and differential gene flow among males and females that occurred throughout Latin America have led to populations that have been genetically transformed from what they were prior to Spanish arrival (Madrigal, 2006). Genetic research commonly refers to individuals considered Hispanic as 2 ̆ 2 <b>tri-hybrids</b> 2 ̆ 2 of Native American, European, and African ancestry (Bertoni et al., 2003; Gonz[aacute]lez-Andrade et al., 2007). This research focuses on populations from present-day Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, all of whom experienced various population histories as these three ancestral groups came in contact. Published genetic research demonstrates that individuals from Mexico tend to have the highest mean proportion of Native American ancestry, while Puerto Rican individuals have the highest mean proportion of European ancestry, and Cuban individuals have the highest mean proportion of African ancestry (Bonilla et al., 2005; Lisker et al., 1990; Mendizabal et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2007; Via et al., 2011). The present research utilizes craniometric data from these three groups to determine whether the cranial morphology reflects similar population relationships and mean ancestry proportions as found in genetic research through Mahalanobis distance (D 2), canonical discriminant function, and normal mixture cluster analyses. Sex-biased ancestry asymmetry was also tested by separating each group by sex and running the same analyses. The results show that all three groups considered Hispanic (Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Cuba) are significantly different from each other; however, when proxy ancestral groups are included (Guatemalan Mayan, Indigenous Caribbean, Spanish, and West African), the Mexican and Guatemalan Mayan samples are the most similar, followed by the Mexican and Indigenous Caribbean samples and the Puerto Rican and Cuban samples.

40|$|Onion (Allium cepa L.) {{cultivation}} in low {{input and}} organic farming systems is hampered by Fusarium basal rot (FBR) {{and the limited}} ability of onion to take up nutrients like phosphorus. The symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) contributes to plant acquisition of phosphorus, among other benefits. This PhD research studied the potential contributions from A. fistulosum and A. roylei to breed onion cultivars with resistance to FBR and enhanced benefit from the symbiosis with AMF. The genetic basis of these traits was studied in an A. cepa x (A. roylei x A. fistulosum) population. A collection of Fusarium isolates was analysed using AFLP markers. The most abundant species was F. oxysporum (with isolates clustered in two clades) followed by F. proliferatum. The Allium species were screened for FBR resistance using one F. oxysporum isolate from each clade, and one F. proliferatum isolate. Allium fistulosum showed high levels of resistance to these three isolates and A. roylei intermediate levels of resistance. High level of resistance from A. fistulosum was dominantly expressed in the A. roylei x A. fistulosum hybrid and the <b>tri-hybrid</b> population. A molecular linkage map based on AFLP markers was developed for the A. roylei x A. fistulosum hybrid. A QTL for FBR resistance from A. roylei was mapped on chromosome 2, and a QTL from A. fistulosum on chromosome 8. Each QTL separately had significant effect on FBR but did not confer complete resistance, thus more QTLs from A. fistulosum remain to be discovered. Regarding Allium-AMF relationship, a first step of research studied genetic diversity and colonization levels of naturally occurring AMF, comparing organic and conventional onion farming in the Netherlands. All plants were colonized with 60 % average arbuscular colonization. Onion yields were positively correlated with colonization. AMF phylotypes were identified by rDNA sequencing. The number of phylotypes per field ranged from one to six. Two Glomus-A phylotypes were the most abundant, whereas other phylotypes were infrequently found. Organic and conventional fields had similar number of phylotypes and Shannon diversity indices. A few organic and conventional fields had larger number of phylotypes, which suggested that specific environmental conditions or agricultural practices influence AMF diversity. The genetic basis for the response to AMF in the <b>tri-hybrid</b> Allium population was evaluated in two independent greenhouse experiments. The weights of mycorrhizal plants were significantly larger than the non-mycorrhizal plants. Mycorrhizal Responsiveness (MR) was negatively correlated with plant weight in the non-mycorrhizal condition and was therefore considered unsuitable as an index for plant breeding purposes. Two new indices were proposed: mycorrhizal benefit (MB) and mycorrhizal breeding value (MV). <b>Tri-hybrid</b> genotypes showed transgressive segregation for plant weight, MB, and MV. Two QTLs from A. roylei for these traits were detected on chromosomes 2 and 3. A QTL from A. fistulosum for MV (but not MB), plant weight {{and the number of}} stem-borne roots was found on linkage group 9. Positive correlations between plant weight, rooting system and benefit from mycorrhiza were observed, which open prospects to combine these traits in the development of more robust onion cultivars...|$|E

We identified the association of PABP with BC 200 RNA in a <b>tri-hybrid</b> screen and confirmed this binding in electrophoretic mobilityshift assays and via anti-PABP immunoprecipitation of BC 1 and BC 200 RNAs from crude extracts, immunodepleted extracts, partially purified RNPs and cells transfected with naked RNA. Furthermore, PABP immunoreactivity was localized to neuronal dendrites. Competition experiments using variants of BC 1 and BC 200 RNAs demonstrated that the central adenosine-rich region of both RNAs mediates binding to PABP.

Recently, we identi®ed a cis-acting dendritic targeting element (DTE) in MAP 2 mRNAs. Here we used the yeast <b>tri-hybrid</b> system to identify potential trans-acting RNAbinding factors of the DTE. A cDNA clone was isolated that encodes a member of a mammalian protein family that is highly homologous to the Drosophila RNA-binding protein Staufen. Mammalian Staufen appears to be expressed in most tissues and brain areas. Two distinct rat brain Staufen isoforms, rStau 1 I 6 and rStau-I 6, are encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs. Both isoforms contain four double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBD). In the larger rStau 1 I 6 isoform, six additional amino acids are inserted in the second dsRBD. Although both isoforms interacted with the MAP 2 -DTE and various additional RNA fragments in an in vitro north-western assay, rStau-I 6 exhibited a stronger signal of bound radioactively labelled RNAs as compared with rStau 1 I 6. Using an antibody directed against mammalian Staufen, the protein was detected in somata and dendrites of neurones of the adult rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Ultrastructural studies revealed that in dendrites, rat Staufen accumulates along microtubules. Thus in neurones, rat Staufen may serve to link RNAs to the dendritic microtubular cytoskeleton and may thereby regulate their subcellular localization...|$|E

The current study explores the segregation of multiple independent yield-related QTL that were identified and mapped using introgression lines (IL) of Solanum pennellii in cultivated processing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). We screened 45 different double and triple IL-QTL combinations for agricultural yield, to identify QTL pyramids that behaved in an additive manner and were suitable substrate for Mendelizing an oligogenic trait.

40|$|In low GC content Gram-positive bacteria, the HPr {{protein is}} the master {{regulator}} of carbon metabolism. HPr is {{a key component of}} the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) :sugar phosphotransferase system that interacts with and/or phosphorylates proteins relevant to carbon catabolite repression. HPr can be phosphorylated by two distinct kinases as follows: the bifunctional enzyme HPr kinase/Ser(P) -HPr phosphorylase (HprK/P) phosphorylating the serine 46 residue (Ser(P) -HPr) and acting as a phosphorylase on Ser(P) -HPr; and the PEP-requiring enzyme I (EI) generating histidine 15 -phosphorylated HPr (His(P) -HPr). The various HPr forms interact with numerous enzymes and modulate their activity. By carrying out a genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screen of a Bacillus subtilis library, we identified a novel HPr-interacting protein, the transcriptional activator YesS, which regulates the expression of pectin/rhamnogalacturonan utilization genes. Remarkably, yeast <b>tri-hybrid</b> assays involving the ATP-dependent HprK/P and the PEP-dependent EI suggested that YesS interacts with HPr and His(P) -HPr but not with Ser(P) -HPr. These findings were confirmed by in vitro interaction assays using the purified HPr-binding domain of the YesS protein. Furthermore, pectin utilization and in vivo YesS-mediated transcriptional activation depended upon the presence of His(P) -HPr, indicating that HPr-mediated YesS regulation serves as a novel type of carbon catabolite repression. In the yeast two-hybrid assays, B. subtilis HprK/P and EI were active and specifically recognized their substrates. Both kinases formed long lived complexes only with the corresponding nonphosphorylatable mutant HPr. These findings suggest that two-hybrid assays can be used for the identification of unknown kinases of phosphorylated bacterial proteins detected in phosphoproteome analyses...|$|E
40|$|The {{intracellular}} Src homology 2 (SH 2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP- 1) is {{a negative}} regulator of cell signaling and contributes {{to the establishment of}} TCR signaling thresholds in both developing and mature T lymphocytes. Although there is much functional data implicating SHP- 1 as a regulator of TCR signaling, the molecular basis for SHP- 1 activation in T lymphocytes is poorly defined. A modification of the yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify in T cells phosphotyrosine-containing proteins capable of binding the SH 2 domains of SHP- 1. From this yeast <b>tri-hybrid</b> screen, the p 85 beta subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase and the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-containing receptors, leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor- 1 (LAIR- 1) and programmed death- 1 (PD- 1), were identified. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the exclusive phosphotyrosine-containing protein associated with SHP- 1 in Jurkat T cells under physiological conditions is LAIR- 1. Significantly, this interaction is constitutive and was detected only in the membrane-enriched fraction of cell lysates. Ligand engagement of the SH 2 domains of SHP- 1 is a prerequisite to activation of the enzyme, and, consistent with an association with LAIR- 1, SHP- 1 was found to be constitutively active in unstimulated Jurkat T cells. Importantly, a constitutive interaction between LAIR- 1 and SHP- 1 was also detected in human primary T cells. These results illustrate the sustained recruitment and activation of SHP- 1 at the plasma membrane of resting human T cells by an inhibitory receptor. We propose that this mechanism may exert a constitutive negative regulatory role upon T cell signaling...|$|E
40|$|Gephyrin and collybistin are key {{components}} of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) clustering. Nonetheless, resolving the molecular interactions between the plethora of GABAAR subunits and these clustering proteins is a significant challenge. We report a direct interaction of GABAAR α 2 and α 3 subunit intracellular M 3 -M 4 domain (but not α 1, α 4, α 5, α 6, β 1 - 3, or γ 1 - 3) with gephyrin. Curiously, GABAAR α 2, but not α 3, binds to both gephyrin and collybistin using overlapping sites. The reciprocal binding sites on gephyrin for collybistin and GABAAR α 2 also overlap {{at the start of}} the gephyrin E domain. This suggests that although GABAAR α 3 interacts with gephyrin, GABAAR α 2, collybistin, and gephyrin form a trimeric complex. In support of this proposal, <b>tri-hybrid</b> interactions between GABAAR α 2 and collybistin or GABA AR α 2 and gephyrin are strengthened in the presence of gephyrin or collybistin, respectively. Collybistin and gephyrin also compete for binding to GABAAR α 2 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and co-localize in transfected cells in both intracellular and submembrane aggregates. Interestingly, GABAAR α 2 is capable of "activating " collybistin isoforms harboring the regulatory SH 3 domain, enabling targeting of gephyrin to the submembrane aggregates. The GABAAR α 2 -collybistin interaction was disrupted by a pathogenic mutation in the collybistin SH 3 domain (p. G 55 A) that causes X-linked intellectual disability and seizures by disrupting GABAAR and gephyrin clustering. Because immunohistochemistry in retina revealed a preferential co-localization of collybistin with α 2 subunit containing GABAARs, but not GlyRs or other GABAAR subtypes, we propose that the collybistin-gephyrin complex has an intimate role in the clustering of GABAARs containing the α 2 subunit. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc...|$|E

The genetic basis for response to AMF was analyzed in a <b>tri-hybrid</b> A. cepa × (A. roylei × A. fistulosum) population. Plant response to mycorrhizal symbiosis was expressed as relative mycorrhizal responsiveness (R') and absolute responsiveness (R). In addition, the average performance (AP) of genotypes under mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal conditions was determined. Experiments were executed in 2 years, and comprised clonally propagated plants of each genotype grown in sterile soil, inoculated with G. intraradices or non-inoculated. Results were significantly correlated between both years. Biomass of non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants was significantly positively correlated. R' was {{negatively correlated with}} biomass of non-mycorrhizal plants and hence unsuitable as a breeding criterion. R and AP were positively correlated with biomass of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. QTLs contributing to mycorrhizal response were located on a linkage map of the A. roylei × A. fistulosum parental genotype. Two QTLs from A. roylei were detected on chromosomes 2 and 3 for R, AP, and biomass of mycorrhizal plants.

Co-segregating QTLs for plant biomass, R and AP indicate that selection for plant biomass also selects for enhanced R and AP. Moreover, our findings suggest that modern onion breeding did not select against the response to AMF, as was suggested before for other cultivated species. Positive correlation between high number of roots, biomass and large response to AMF in close relatives of onion opens prospects to combine these traits for the development of more robust onion cultivar...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to outline the genetic {{makeup of the}} current {{population}} {{of the town of}} Yanga (Veracruz State, Mexico), the first Latin American settlement founded by African slaves in Mexico. For this purpose, we carried out the genetic characterization of 60 individuals from Yanga, analysing 15 autosomal short tandem repeats (STRs) and interpreting the results {{in the context of the}} admixed population known as Mexican mestizos. The genetic contribution from the three most important human groups in the current admixed Yanga population was calculated using Structure software. We detected a high percentage of Amerindian (48 %) and European inheritance (44. 7 %), and a much less important African contribution (7. 3 %). These results were then compared with 10 other Mexican mestizo populations. The results fit the <b>tri-hybrid</b> model for admixture characterized by a high genetic contribution from Europeans and Africans in the north—though the African influence is lower—and a decreasing contribution from these two populations to the south and southeast. Conversely, the Amerindian component presents maximum values in the south and minimum values in the north. The Amerindian and European genetic traces are related to their ancestral settlements, but the African contribution can be explained by other parameters. To understand the current African genetic traces, we have to assume that there was a redistribution of these population groups and an important admixture phenomenon which led to the dilution of the African ancestral genetic pool. Furthermore, admixture was favoured by conditions that allowed individuals who intermarried to ascend in social status. These reasons would explain why despite the fact that Yanga was founded by black slaves, high levels of African ancestry are not found in the current population...|$|E
40|$|Activity {{dependent}} {{changes of}} neuronal connectivity {{are the basic}} requirements for acquisition and storage of information. Short-term changes of synaptic efficacy depend on the posttranslational modification of pre-existing proteins, whereas long-lasting changes require mRNA and protein synthesis. However, the mechanisms that link events {{taking place in the}} nucleus or soma like transcription or translation to specific changes at distantly located activated synapses still remain elusive. Dendritically localized mRNAs may {{play a central role in}} these processes. After synthesis, these mRNAs are transported into the dendrites where they might be translated locally at activated synapses leading to specific alterations in their molecular composition. Among dendritic mRNAs, Arg 3. 1 mRNA expression is unique. Arg 3. 1 is an activity-dependent gene whose transcription is induced rapidly by synaptic activity. Upon induction, Arg 3. 1 mRNA and protein are distributed throughout the dendritic arbour and accumulate specifically at activated synapses. The analysis of directed Arg 3. 1 mRNA transport and its regulated translation may therefore considerably contribute to our understanding of processes resulting in long-lasting synaptic plasticity. Using the yeast <b>Tri-Hybrid</b> System our laboratory identified a specific Arg 3. 1 mRNA binding protein, a zinc finger protein named Zinki that could play an important role in the regulation of Arg 3. 1 mRNA transport and translation. In this PhD thesis molecular biological, biochemical and immunohistochemical methods were applied to further investigate the binding of Zinki to Arg 3. 1 mRNA and its functional role in the regulation of translation. Initial experiments using deletion constructs demonstrated that the C-terminal eight zinc fingers out of fourteen zinc fingers of the entire Zinki protein were necessary for effective binding to the Arg 3. 1 mRNA in the yeast <b>Tri-Hybrid</b> System. The majority of the N-terminally located seven zinc fingers share a common sequence motif within the &# 945;-helix and contribute largely to proper binding. Moreover, the interaction between Zinki and the Arg 3. 1 mRNA could be verified in independent in vitro RNA-pulldown-assays that were developed in this work. First evidence for a functional role of Zinki in the regulation of protein synthesis was obtained using an in vitro translation assay. Here, Zinki inhibited the translation of Arg 3. 1 as well as other control mRNAs. Further investigations concerning the mechanisms of this translational inhibition suggested that the N-terminus of Zinki blocks the assembly of the 80 S initiation complex. Electron microscopy analyses and biochemical studies demonstrated that Zinki protein is exclusively localized in the somata and dendrites of neurons. Despite being localized closely to synapses, Zinki was not found to be associated with synaptic membranes. Furthermore, several experiments indicated that the subcellular distribution and the stability of Zinki protein are regulated by neuronal activity. Previous studies conducted in our laboratory had shown that upon lamina specific stimulation of the middle molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, Zinki vacates activated regions within the dendritic arbour. Studies conducted in this PhD thesis provided evidence that following synaptic activation a small portion of Zinki protein is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome-machinery. In addition, using similar synaptic stimulation protocols Zinki protein redistributes from the cytosol to polysome-containing high-density fractions. Taken together, the experiments conducted in the first part of this work suggest an important role of Zinki in the regulation of Arg 3. 1 mRNA translation. Moreover, the experiments indicate that Zinki itself is subject to negative regulation by synaptic activity. In the second part of the thesis, the integration of Zinki into intracellular protein networks was examined. A yeast Two-Hybrid Screen identified several putative protein interaction partners of Zinki that are part of the Ras/MAPK signal transduction pathway. One of those was GRF 1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. GRF 1 was intensively characterized in subsequent experiments. In vitro and in vivo binding assays as well as immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses supported the physiological importance of the Zinki-GRF 1 -interaction. Additionally, in GRF 1 knockout mice an alteration in the expression pattern of Arg 3. 1 was observed following plasticity producing stimulation. In contrast, the expression and subcellular distribution of Zinki protein remained unaltered in GRF 1 knockout mice. The results of the second part of this PhD thesis indicate that Zinki might play a role in the Ras/MAPK signalling cascade and strongly encourages continued research of Zinki´s participation in this signal transduction pathway...|$|E

California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Stacey L Thompson, Kirsten Fisher, Patrick Krug, Nancy McQueenGenetics, Hybridization, Populus, SNP AssayBy characterizing hybrid zones we {{can predict}} the {{long-term}} consequences of hybridization. In 1977, eight poplar hybrid zones were studied, comprising two native Californian species, Populus fremontii and P. trichocarpa, and the European exotic, Populus nigra, which is commonly planted as an ornamental. The morphological and phytochemical analyses in this 1977 study identified first generation (F 1) hybrids and inferred an F 1 block between hybrids and the parental species. To characterize {{the composition of}} these poplar hybrid zones in more recent times, eight of the nine hybrid zones from the original 1977 study, plus one newly discovered population, were sampled and genotyped using a 25 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay. The diagnostic SNPs included 22 species-specific biparental nuclear markers and three chloroplast markers to identify maternal lineage. Hybrid classes were assigned using a molecular hybrid index. In addition to molecular analyses, five leaves from each individual (n= 2260) were digitally scanned and 16 leaf characters were measured and analyzed to determine the accuracy of leaf morphology for hybrid identification. Genotyping results from 468 trees showed an overall frequency of 45. 7 % of pure species (26. 7 % P. fremontii, 18. 6 % P. trichocarpa, 0. 4 % P. nigra) and 54. 3 % hybrids/introgressants. F 1 hybrids were detected in every population, while advanced-generation hybrids (backcrosses and more complex combinations) were observed at two of the nine sites, with an overall frequency of 3. 5 %. In {{the majority of the}} cases (79. 9 %), P. fremontii was the maternal parent of hybrids of all classes. Hybridization between the native species was more common (59. 7 % of hybrids), than between P. fremontii and P. nigra, with a tendency to backcross towards P. fremontii. No F 1 P. trichocarpa x P. nigra was found, suggesting the presence of prezygotic or postzygotic reproductive barriers. However, one <b>tri-hybrid</b> was found ((P. fremontii x P. trichocarpa) x P. nigra) at a site that lacked P. nigra 30 years ago. Leaf morphological analyses, using the 16 characters, was useful in the identification of pure species and hybrid taxa. The genotypic composition of these hybrid zones suggests increased admixture from the exotic species, while our detection of advanced-generation hybrids implies that there are few reproductive barriers among the species. This rampant hybridization suggests the need for long-term perspective when assessing potential impacts of gene flow on natural resources...|$|E
40|$|The {{central focus}} {{of this study was}} to {{determine}} the extent to which identity formation influenced Zimbabwean A-level female students’ perceptions of and participation in physics. The themes from the sub-problems included the influence of contextual factors on identity formation in relation to physics as a subject at Advanced Level (A-level), facets of identity formation considered to be of significance by female students in relation to physics, the way in which female students’ perceptions of physics influenced their participation in the subject as well as the factors of identity formation considered as contributing to developing an orientation towards physics by female students. A qualitative approach grounded in an interpretivist paradigm was used. A <b>tri-hybrid</b> theoretical lens comprising of Wenger’s (1998) Social Learning Theory featuring CoP, the Feminist Stand point Theory and Sfard and Prusak’s (2005) notion of ‘telling’ identities or stories, enabled a rich understanding of the influences of identity formation on female students’ perceptions of and participation in physics. The data generating methods used were classroom observation, Draw-A-Scientist Test and semi-structured interviews conducted with nine participants. The data were collated to generate narratives. Key findings: The contextual factors that influenced the identity formation of female students and subsequently their participation in physics at A-level included: Parental and siblings influence; cultural perceptions; impact of the O-level experience; A-level physics teachers’ attitudes; classroom and laboratory experience; male peer influence and other factors such as an understanding of the relevance of physics in daily life. Facets of identity formation considered to be of significance by female students in relation to physics included: being confident, fearless, intelligent, and courageous, liking physics and being determined. These facets motivated them to develop an identity in favour of physics. The female participants studying only mathematics perceived themselves as very intelligent but with a fear of failing physics, lacking confidence and courage. Female students who held negative perceptions towards physics chose to do only mathematics at A-level while those with positive perceptions which influenced the formation of a positive physics identity displayed enthusiasm and commitment to achieve high levels of performance in the subject. Factors of identity formation considered as contributing positively to the development of an orientation towards physics by female students included the importance of v female physics teachers as role models, motivation from O-level science teachers, high self-confidence, high self-esteem, parental support and encouragement, and aspirations towards a physics related career. Gender insensitivity displayed by male teachers, male peer harassment and gender stereotyping are factors in identity formation considered as inhibiting the development of an orientation towards physics by female students. This study provides physics educators, physics planners and the government with detailed information on the role identity formation plays on the participation of Zimbabwean female adolescent students in A-level physics. The findings may be used by heads of schools to sensitise academic staff on the gender dimensions of teaching and learning as well as by counsellors and parents to encourage females to enrol for physics and mathematics as their subjects of choice. This study also contributes to the strengthening of educational research in Zimbabwe, especially research aimed at emancipation of female students in Zimbabwe...|$|E
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1973. Bibliography: leaves [109]- 116. x, 116 l illus., tablesThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} effects of climate and inheritance on carpellody and sterility in Carica papaya (L.). Sex in papaya is determined by a triple allelic series, "M 1 m", "M 2 m", and "mm", representing males, hermaphrodites and females, respectively. All combinations of the dominants are lethal. The hermaphrodite may tend toward femaleness (carpellody) or toward maleness (female sterility). Genetics for the factors carpellody and sterility have not been determined but it has been proposed that 2 different sets of factors are responsible. Changes in temperature and rainfall are known to influence the sexual expression of hermaphroditic plants but their specific degree of influence on several different known sexual forms of hermaphroditic plants have not been reported. Information about the climatic influences on sexuality in papaya will be useful in improving the commercial crop through breeding methods designed to minimize the effects of sexual changes. Three inbred hermaphroditic lines selected for highly stable expression of high carpellody, high sterility, and mostly normal elongata flowers were used. Studies of floral initiation and development indicated that floral primordia were laid down 7 to 10 weeks prior to anthesis at the rate of about one new bud every 3 days. Differentiation of stamens began 7 to 8 weeks prior to anthesis and was completed by 5 weeks before anthesis. Ovaries began differentiating 6 to 7 weeks prior to anthesis and were complete by 4 weeks before anthesis. The 3 inbred lines and their crosses (F 1, F 2, BC) were planted in S randomized incomplete blocks at Malama-Ki on the island of Hawaii. Sexual changes of all plants in the orchard were correlated to temperature and rainfall changes from 4 to 10 weeks prior to anthesis for a period of 1 year. Results indicated that sex response to climatic influence was greatest at about 7 to 8 weeks prior to anthesis. Variations in sex expression from strongly carpellodic to strongly female sterile in the hermaphroditic trees were categorized into 7 "magnitudes" of expression. Trees were placed into one of these magnitudes in accordance with the sex expression of the last open flower each week and then placed into "classes" based on the overall yearly sex expression pattern of the tree. Results indicated that plants of the highly stable parents required as much as a 5 °F. change in temperature before a shift in sex expression occurred. Plants with sex expressions lying between the parental types required smaller temperature changes for sexual shifts to occur. The response to changes in temperature appeared to be additive. The segregation patterns of carpellody and sterility are also presented. The inheritance appears to be quantitative with partial dominance of carpellody. A genetic model is presented which utilizes a basic <b>tri-hybrid</b> ratio with 2 factors for carpellody (c/c, c/c) and 1 for sterility (s/s) and their normal alleles (+). "s" alleles were found to be epistatic over c alleles when "c" alleles were heterozygous. However, if "c" alleles were homozygous, carpellody would be exhibited regardless of "s". Expected and observed ratios were compared on this basis and chi-square indicated a close fit...|$|E
40|$|Tendo em vista as perdas consideráveis causadas pela moléstia conhecida como "mosaico do pimentão", induzida por estirpes do vírus Y da batatinha, nas culturas de pimentão (Capsicum annuum L.), formulou-se um projeto visando criar variedades resistentes. Como fontes de resistência, cêrca de 45 introduções de pimentão e 46 de pimenteiras, compreendendo oito espécies do gênero Capsicum, foram submetidas aos testes de inoculação. Três novos fatores genéticos responsáveis pela resistência aos grupos n e w do vírus Y foram encontrados em certas variedades de C. annuum: Gene "H": dominante, encontrado nas variedades Casca Dura e Mogi cias Cruzes, que condiciona reação de hipersensibilidade ao vírus Yn. Gene "w": recessivo, que controla a tolerância da var. Pôrto Rico Wonder ao vírus Yw. Gene "f": recessivo, que condiciona a tolerância ao vírus Yf na var. Moura. Há indicação de alelismo entre os genes "w" e "f", sendo que o nível de tolerância dêste é mais elevado que o daquele. A imunidade ao vírus Y constatada em P 11 (P. I. 264281), cujo comportamento foi atribuído à ação de um par de genes recessivos "yª", foi confirmada também com relação às estirpes do virus Y que aqui ocorrem. As combinações de tôdas as fontes de resistência acima citadas possibilitaram a criação de novas variedades de pimentão pràticamente imunes ao vírus Y, bastante produtivas e com características comerciais satisfatórias. Agronômico 7 produz frutos quadrados (tipo California Wonder) e Agronômico 8 apresenta frutos cônico-alongados (tipo Casca Dura). A highly {{prevalent}} type of mosaic that induces heavey {{losses to}} sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) plantings in São Paulo and other neighboring states {{is caused by}} two groups of the potato virus Y complex, designated as n and w. Group n is represented by strain Yn; group w by strains Yw and Yf. Screening tests with 45 sweet pepper varieties and 46 others of the pungent type, belonging to several species of Capsicum, were {{carried out in the}} greenhouse and in the field to detect resistance to mosaic. A hypersensitive type of resistance to Yn was found in the sweet pepper varieties Mogi-das-Cruzes and Casca-Dura. Porto Rico Wonder was tolerant to Yw, but not so to a related strain, Yf. A sweet pepper variety called Moura was highly tolerant to Yf. A variety known as P 11 (P. I. 264281) (Capsicum annuum) was found to be immune to all Y virus strains tested. The pungent types SA 112 (C. pubescens), 1 - 30771 and 1 - 30772 (C. pendulum) also behaved immune to Y virus strains, but were not used as sources of resistance because they are not compatible with C. annuum. Inheritance studies disclosed the existence of 3 new pairs of genes responsible for the various types of resistant reactions to strains of the potato Y virus in Capsicum annuum. They can be described as follows: Gene "H" is a dominant allele found in Mogi-das-Cruzes and Casca-Dura, that conditions hypersensitivity to Yn. Gene "w" is a recessive factor that controls tolerance of Porto Rico Wonder to strains of Yw. Gene "f" is a recessive factor that conditions tolerance to Yf in the sweet pepper variety Moura. Gene "f" behaves as an allele of "w", affording a higher level of tolerance to strains of the Y virus complex. The immunity to various strains of the Y virus complex found in Florida in P 11 (P. I. 264281) by COOK & ANDERSON (7), and attributed by these investigators to a pair of recessive genes "yªyª", was also verified for strains of the Y virus complex present in São Paulo. The sweet pepper varieties Yolo Wonder and All Big were introduced in the breeding program because they carry the partially dominant genes "LiLi" (17) that controls resistance to tobacco mosaic virus in pepper. Early {{in the development of the}} present breeding program, the genes "HH", "ww" and "LiLi" were combined in several improved lines, but appearence of a new strain Yf showed the need of a higher resistance level than that present in these <b>tri-hybrid</b> lines. The incorporation of the Moura type of tolerance due to genes "ff" permitted the development of commercial lines highly tolerant to strains of the Y virus complex. The immunity to strains of the Y virus complex from P 11, due to genes "yªyª", was incorporated to sweet pepper genotypes already possessing the other types of resistance to Y mosaic and to TMV. This resulted in two new groups of sweet pepper varieties that are immune to all strains of the Y complex so far tested, resistant to TMV, high yielding, and with good commercial characteristics: Agronomico 7 has fruits of the blocky type (California Wonder type) and Agronomico 8 has tapering, elongated fruits (Casca-Dura type) ...|$|E
