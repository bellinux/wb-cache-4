5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still get <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} Allen's {{interactions}} with other characters during the series, and IGN's Richard Osborn enjoyed the comic relief of his clashes with Kanda against the series' dark plot. John Rose of the Fandom Post considered {{the team of}} Allen and fellow Exorcist Yu Kanda the greatest strength of the manga's second volume. In a later review, Rose enjoyed the plotline in which Allen was unable to distinguish innocents from Akumas. Allen's rematch with enemy Noah Tyki Mikk was praised by Casey Brienza of Anime News Network. Brienza also liked his new abilities, the Innocence Crown Clown and Allen's sword, comparing it to a sword in Final Fantasy VII wielded by protagonist Cloud Strife. Reviewing the same fight, Otaku USAs Joseph Luster praised Allen's development during the series and enjoyed his battle with Tyki. Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin liked Allen's situation in volume 21, and wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same instead of the focus on Kanda's fight against the Akuma of Alma Karma. During Allen's imprisonment for saving Alma, Anne Lauenroth of Anime News Network found the growing camaraderie between Allen and Tyki interesting; it led to Allen's decision to leave the Order after putting his comrades in danger, and his goodbye to Lenalee was mournful.|$|E

500|$|Tourism {{developers}} have marketed Tana Toraja as an exotic adventure—an area rich in culture {{and off the}} beaten track. Western tourists expected to see stone-age villages and pagan funerals. Toraja is for tourists who have {{gone as far as}} Bali and are willing <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wild, [...] "untouched" [...] islands. However, {{they were more likely to}} see a Torajan wearing a hat and denim, living in a Christian society. Tourists felt that the tongkonan and other Torajan rituals had been preconceived to make profits, and complained that the destination was too commercialised. This has resulted in several clashes between Torajans and tourism developers, whom Torajans see as outsiders.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green, whilst {{writing for}} Trek Nation {{described}} [...] "Dear Doctor" [...] as the [...] "first truly great episode" [...] of Enterprise and {{compared it to}} [...] "" [...] from [...] and [...] "Tuvix" [...] from [...] {{in the way that}} the ethical dilemma is presented.

Peter Schorn, writing a review for the first season for IGN, described [...] "Dear Doctor" [...] as one of the more solid episodes. Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website Jammer's Reviews, said that it was [...] "by miles the best episode so far". He calls it a [...] "real story" [...] with an actual issue, and praises the performance of John Billingsley as Phlox.|$|E
500|$|A high-definition (HD) {{version of}} the game, titled Resident Evil HD Remaster, was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in January 2015. The HD version supports 5.1 surround sound {{as well as a}} resolution of 1080p and a widescreen aspect ratio of [...] Although the original pre-rendered backgrounds have a [...] format, the developers decided against re-rendering them in 16:9 because it would allow players <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment than originally intended, thus potentially reducing the sense of immersion and danger. As a result, the developers added a vertical scrolling functionality to the backgrounds, which respond to the movement of the character, to fit the remaster's widescreen aspect ratio. Since the original controls of the game were criticized, the remaster also includes a new control scheme which allows players to move their character {{in the direction of the}} analog stick.|$|E

500|$|Miranda {{and her new}} friends, Annemarie and Colin find a {{sandwich}} shop on the corner, wondering {{if they can get}} a job there. The owner, Jimmy, agrees, but he does not wish to pay them with money; instead he gives them a free pop and {{a sandwich}} each day. Miranda, Annemarie, and Colin discover a Fred Flintstone bank in the back of sandwich shop. Colin, wanting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank, is pulled way by Annemarie insisting that Jimmy could find them. The next day, Jimmy fires the three workers, thinking that one of them stole the Flintstone bank, when it was actually the laughing man who stole it. The workers write a card, give it to Jimmy and insist that they did not steal the bank. Jimmy believes them and let them work at the sandwich shop. He then tells them that he figured out who stole the bank. He thinks that it is Julia, a classmate in their class, and a best friend to Annemarie. He [...] thinks she did it because she is African American. This upsets Annemarie greatly and she immediately quits her job.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, the Park Service began {{preliminary}} {{work on a}} redesign of Independence Mall. Architects Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates developed a master plan with two design alternatives. The first proposed a block-long visitors center {{on the south side}} of Market Street, that would also house the Liberty Bell. This would have interrupted the mall's three-block vista of Independence Hall, and made the bell visible only from the south, i.e. Chestnut Street. The second alternative placed a similar visitors center on the north side of Market Street, also interrupting the mall's vista, with the bell in a small pavilion on the south side. City planner Edmund Bacon, who had overseen the mall's design in the 1950s, saw preservation of the vista of Independence Hall as essential. He created his own plan, which included a domed bell pavilion built north of Market Street. Public reaction to the possibility of moving the Liberty Bell so far from Independence Hall was strongly negative. NPS announced that the bell would remain on the block between Chestnut and Market Streets. [...] Other plans were proposed, each had strengths and weaknesses, but the goal of all was to encourage visitors <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical park than just the Liberty Bell.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Travis Fickett rated [...] "Gridlock" [...] an 8.4 out of 10, {{calling it}} [...] "the first great episode" [...] {{of the third}} series. He {{particularly}} praised the satire of a traffic jam, Tennant's acting, {{and the use of}} Martha as a companion to aid the Doctor's loss. Ian Berriman of SFX gave [...] "Gridlock" [...] four out of five stars. He praised the attention to detail of the props department, the appearance of the Macra, and the concept of the traffic jam, but felt there were many plot holes. He also called Travis Oliver, the actor who played Milo, [...] "wooden". Slant Magazine reviewer Ross Ruediger wrote that he did not like the episode much on first viewing because it was [...] "too busy and too chaotic to get a proper grip on" [...] but [...] "subsequent viewings proved those very qualities are the backbone of the story." [...] He initially wished <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Macra. Mark Wright of The Stage was positive towards calling back to [...] "The End of the World" [...] and [...] "New Earth", and praised Agyeman and the visual look of the episode. Despite finding the ending [...] "life-affirming", he found a possible plot hole: [...] "one wonders why the Face of Boe didn't just open the roof in the first place".|$|E

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said that}} this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't as fun and funny as it could have been", explaining that it had some great laughs, but that as a whole it [...] "felt a bit flat and joyless." [...] He wrote that the cameos by Jon Hamm, Jason Sudeikis, and Dean Winters [...] "did little {{in the body of}} the episode", nonetheless, the [...] "real payoff" [...] came in the end when the three portrayed the dental assistants. [...] "It was a gag mostly unrelated to the rest of the episode, and it was the best part of the half hour." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave it a 7.7 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that the episode was a [...] "pretty lifeless outing", reasoning it had the [...] "usual laughs in the margin" [...] but overall [...] "there were a lot of long, flat, deadly stretches, and entire subplots like Jenna with her stalker that just lay there." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed Liz's story here, but noted that he disliked Jenna's stalker story, concluding [...] "...there were a few really funny lines... but overall I found her missing-her-stalker-on-Valentine's-Day plot to be rather... icky [...] Honestly, I want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human, normal side of Jenna". Nick Catucci of New York magazine felt that Liz's plot here was [...] "one of the worst story lines in recent memory".|$|E
