5|$|Asked by a {{journalist}} once, {{he said that}} his favourite city was London, and in another instance he said that Mohammed Ali Jinnah had asked him to join the Pakistan Army during the partition in 1947, and in his usual jovial style, commented <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> joined the Pakistan Army, then India would have been defeated in the 1971 war. The latter remark attracted as much criticism as anything else in his career.|$|E
5|$|John {{initially}} attended local schools. When he was aged 10, {{his family}} scraped together {{the money to}} send him to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston. Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age at a time when only children from the most prosperous families were able to attend university. Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, remarking to his secretary Joseph Pope <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career.|$|E

5|$|Sang Penari {{touches on}} the history of {{communism}} in Indonesia, focusing on the nation's communist party spreading its ideology and the government's purge of the Communist Party's members from 1965–1966, which is thought to have killed several hundred thousand. It is only the third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> written about the killings as they were depicted in the film, the repressive New Order government would have had him shot.|$|E
5|$|The rock {{supposedly}} {{found in}} the lake, said to be taken from the Park's garden wall, has been challenged as evidence in multiple places. Both articles say that the police diver had no memory of recovering it, and he claimed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> found it, he would have placed it back. Professor Kenneth Pye, a defense witness, {{said that there was}} no evidence that the rock had ever been on the lake bed at all. The article in the Sunday Herald also claims that the policeman said to be responsible for finding the rock fainted when it was produced in court, offering no explanation, but still denying that he ever found it.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this, {{observers}} such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez have suggested <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{lived long enough}} to see his predictions substantiated by experiment, Oppenheimer might have won a Nobel Prize for his work on gravitational collapse, concerning neutron stars and black holes. In retrospect, some physicists and historians consider this to be his most important contribution, though it was not taken up by other scientists in his own lifetime. The physicist and historian Abraham Pais once asked Oppenheimer what he considered to be his most important scientific contributions; Oppenheimer cited his work on electrons and positrons, not his work on gravitational contraction. Oppenheimer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for physics three times, in 1945, 1951 and 1967, but never won.|$|E

5|$|Lord Cave {{resigned}} on 28 March 1928 due to ill health, {{and died}} the day after. His replacement was Lord Hailsham, {{who was appointed}} by Stanley Baldwin on 29 March 1928. Hailsham's first tenure as Lord Chancellor lasted barely a year and highlighted the fact that despite his abilities (many politicians considered <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not accepted the offer to become Lord Chancellor he would likely have become Prime Minister) {{he was not a}} particularly innovative Lord Chancellor. For a short period in August 1928 he acted as Prime Minister (Baldwin was on holiday in Aix-en-Provence) with Schuster as his chief adviser, but he rarely went to 10 Downing Street and nothing eventful happened during his time in charge.|$|E
5|$|Siwiec's timing {{has been}} {{described}} as unfortunate, as he chose to commit his act during a dance (mazurka), at which time his cry was muffled due to the sounds of an orchestra playing. Some, like Tomas Kavaliauskas or Krzysztof Kąkolewski, have speculated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> chosen to act moments earlier, during a speech by Polish communist leader Władysław Gomułka, first secretary of the Polish United Workers Party, the commotion he caused would have likely interrupted it and his message might have been witnessed more widely. Publicist Antoni Zambrowski noted that many other self-immolators like Czech Jan Palach had cooperated with anti-communist opposition movements and left messages and other documents which helped publicize their activities; Siwiec worked alone and so the Polish anti-communist opposition with which he identified with was not aware of his action and the meaning behind it until much later.|$|E
5|$|Jackson Niyomugao, {{at the age}} of 24, was {{the only}} Rwandian {{competitor}} in the London Games to have participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He qualified the Games after receiving a wildcard from the Olympic Solidarity Committee which was announced in the week {{before the start of the}} Olympics and was the last Rwandan athlete to attain qualification. After being eliminated from the heat stages in the previous Olympic Games in Beijing Niyomugao said he wanted to win a medal in London and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> more support, he would possibly be able to swim quicker but hoped to see the results. He was drawn in the second heat held on 2 August, finishing fourth out of seven swimmers, with a time of 27.38 seconds. He ranked ahead of Uganda's Ganzi Mugula (27.58 seconds) and Paul Edingue Ekane from Cameroon (27.87 seconds) but behind Ching Maou Wei of American Samoa (27.30 seconds) in a heat led by Abdourahman Osman from Djibouti (27.25 seconds). Overall Niyomugao finished 52nd out of 58 competitors overall, but did not progress to the semi-finals because her time was 5.11 seconds slower than the slowest swimmer who made the later stages.|$|E

50|$|During the 1980s {{he was on}} {{the faculty}} of Brown University, moving to Harvard around 1988. He served as chair of the {{department}} at Harvard from 2002 to 2005. His work is characterized by its classical geometric flavor: <b>he</b> <b>has</b> claimed that nothing he thinks about could not have been imagined by the Italian geometers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> had greater success than them, it is because <b>he</b> <b>has</b> access to better tools.|$|R
50|$|Finkel reads {{a section}} of his book, {{entitled}} True Story, at a promotional event in a bookstore. Taking questions from the audience, he imagines Longo standing {{in the back of}} the room.

5|$|Kerry led off the Australian team in {{a faster}} time than he had clocked in the {{individual}} event, {{but it was still}} two seconds slower than his personal best time. Kerry finished in a time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead with a leadoff leg of 56.81s with Hungary and Great Britain in second and third place. France was last to reach the 100m mark, posting a time of 58.84s. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, the fastest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63s. His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The remainder of the teams had been dropped, with a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East Germans. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a body length behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Tonelli's butterfly leg was such <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> swum the same time in the individual event, he would have claimed the silver medal. Although he lost 0.36s to Seredin, he had minimised his loss and Australia were within 0.81s going into the final leg. Furthermore, the Australians were now more than a second clear of the third placed Great Britain.|$|E

25|$|A {{more serious}} charge made against Chivington was <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> hurried to {{reinforce}} Slough {{as soon as}} he heard gunfire coming from Pigeon's Ranch, his 400 men might have been enough to win the battle for the Federals, especially if he had attacked Scurry's flank as he had been ordered.|$|E

25|$|Garnett's {{decision}} not to play college basketball was influenced in part by his failure to score well enough on the ACT test to meet NCAA requirements for freshman eligibility.

5000|$|At this time, as Chuck {{becomes more}} capable in combat and embraces {{becoming}} a spy, she becomes {{more concerned about}} how this will change his character, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to kill <b>he</b> will lose the trusting and good nature she originally came to love about him, just as she thinks her own [...] "red test" [...] changed her.|$|R
