5|$|A second air {{transport}} incident occurred {{the following day}} at Yerevan (capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic) when an Antonov An-12 from Yugoslavia crashed, killing all seven crew on board. The crash was blamed on the pilots' failure to properly adjust the altimeter following a miscommunication with <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers.|$|E
5|$|Amid rising tensions, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> {{controllers}} began {{staging a}} series of work actions, including slowdowns, walkouts, and even a hunger strike. This led to chaos in Brazil's aviation industry: major delays and disruptions in domestic and international air service, stranded passengers, canceled flights, and public demonstrations. Those who blamed various civilian and military officials for the growing crisis called for their resignation.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, the TSB {{released}} {{copies of}} the audio recordings of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control transmissions associated with the flight. The transcripts of these recordings had been released in 1998 (within days of the crash), but the TSB had refused to release the audio on privacy grounds. The TSB argued that under Canada's Access to Information Act and Privacy Act, the audio recordings constituted personal information and were thus not disclosable. Canada's Federal Court of Appeal rejected this argument in 2006 in a legal proceeding concerned with air traffic control recordings in four other air accidents. The Supreme Court of Canada did not grant leave to appeal that decision and consequently the TSB released {{a copy of the}} Swissair 111 air traffic control audio recordings to the Canadian Press, which had requested the recordings under the Access to Information Act. Several key minutes of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control audio {{can be found on the}} Toronto Star web site.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the black}} boxes and {{communication}} transcripts were obtained, the investigators interviewed the ExcelAire's flight crew and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers, trying {{to piece together}} the scenario which allowed two modern jet aircraft, equipped with the latest anti-collision gear, to collide with each other while on instrument flights in positive control airspace.|$|E
5|$|While {{agreeing on}} most basic facts and findings, CENIPA and NTSB, which collaborated in the {{accident}} investigation, arrived at disagreeing interpretations and conclusions. The CENIPA report concludes the accident was caused by mistakes made both by air traffic controllers and by the ExcelAire pilots, whereas the NTSB focuses on the controllers and the ATC system, concluding that both flight crews acted properly but were placed {{on a collision course}} by <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} earthquake, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ordered a ground stop along the East Coast, causing some flight delays. <b>The</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Control tower at John F.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> {{control at}} Værnes was {{established}} in 1946, after the air force had sent personnel to the United Kingdom for training.

Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center was also established to monitor all air space over Central Norway. In 1955, a glass dome was built on top of the control tower, giving a much better view of the air field.|$|E

NYPD detective Dominick Misino spoke with Demeke over the radio, assisted by FBI special agent John Flood and Port Authority detective sergeant Carmine Spano. After 70 minutes of negotiation, Demeke traded his pistol for the pilot's sunglasses and surrendered peacefully to authorities. All 94 passengers and ten crew were unharmed.|$|E
5|$|In Wilmington, Delaware, blocks fell to {{the street}} from the steeple of St. Thomas the Apostle Church, and the New Castle County Courthouse was evacuated, as was <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control tower of the New Castle County Airport in nearby Wilmington Manor.

Numerous buildings in Georgetown, the Sussex County seat, were evacuated while crews checked for damage; the Emergency Operations Center there reported 200 calls to 9-1-1. Delaware Department of Transportation crews were dispatched statewide to inspect interstate highways, the under-construction replacement Indian River Inlet Bridge, the Delaware Memorial Bridge on I-295, and other bridges and roads.|$|E

5|$|The first service {{after the}} war was started by DNL on 13 October 1945 and flew to Tromsø, with onwards {{connection}} to Trondheim and Oslo. The service only lasted until 1948, when it was replaced with a Ju-52 seaplane route with intermediate stops at Vadsø and Hammerfest to Tromsø. The route flew one direction each day, was only operated {{during the summer and}} was plagued with poor regularity. The original water aerodrome was located at Soldatbukta at Prestøya. Later it was moved to the quay {{on the north side of}} Langfjorden, on the other side as Kirkenes. Passengers were therefore freighted across the fjord by boat to the aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control moved from Høybuktmoen to Haganes in 1949, but returned in 1963.|$|E
25|$|While {{the inquiry}} was {{satisfied}} that <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control system was satisfactory it raised three operational errors of concern {{which may have}} contributed to the disaster. Specifically it underlined that <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control issued a landing forecast to the RAF aircraft of a local QFF which could have been interpreted by the pilots as a regional QFF; <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control not transmitting a regional QFF according to schedule; and the broadcasting of a faulty QFF to the SAS crew.|$|E
