25|$|Nadezhda von Meck saw <b>things</b> <b>very</b> differently. To her, {{filling the}} roles of mother, nurse, governess, dressmaker, housekeeper, and valet was far easier to bear than the humiliation of seeing her husband as a cog in the machine of a {{government}} organization. Neither did fulfilling all those domestic duties lower her resolve or weaken her energy in urging {{him to make a}} break. Russia, desperately short of railways, was expanding its communications network rapidly, and Nadezhda was far-sighted enough to see that a future for her husband lay there. She continually exerted pressure on him to find a partner with capital and to join the boom in Russian railway construction.|$|E

[...] "A woman has {{to know when to}} set the pace, because that's what men need. So that's what the song is about", she said. Musically, [...] "Make Love" [...] is an R ballad, set in a slinky slow jam groove. Patrick Varine of The Observer-Dispatch referred it to as a [...] "hacky mid-'90s R" [...] song, and its slow tempo was compared to ballads by American singer Ciara. According to Mariel Concepcion of Billboard, the song sees Hilson tapping into her vulnerable side.|$|E
500|$|Despite solid reviews, {{numerous}} publications {{remarked that}} Perfect Dark Zero {{did not meet}} the expectations. According to GameCritics, [...] "It took Rare a whole console generation to do it ... and the wait wasn't really worth it". Game Informer found the game underwhelming, reviewing it under the tagline [...] "Don't believe the hype". In a positive review, GameSpy observed that [...] "Perfect Dark Zero is a lot of fun and does a lot of <b>things</b> <b>very</b> well, but it's just not the killer-app that we'd all hoped for". Edge said that the game [...] "falls short", especially when compared to , a successful first-person shooter that was released as a launch title for the original Xbox.

500|$|The Tampa Bay Lightning hired Oates as an {{assistant}} coach in the 2009–10 season where he worked with the team's offense. Under his guidance, the team's power play finished ninth in the league and he was credited with playing a significant role in Steven Stamkos's offensive development. Oates then joined the New Jersey Devils in 2010 where he served an additional two years as {{an assistant}} coach, helping the team reach the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Los Angeles Kings in six games. New Jersey's General Manager, Lou Lamoriello, praised Oates' work with the team: [...] "He did an outstanding job for us. I wish him well. He's very communicative, very intelligent, he explains <b>things</b> <b>very</b> well. He has the resume behind him as a player and having the success he had – all the credentials are there for having the kind of respect players have for him." ...|$|E

500|$|The Hobbit employs {{themes of}} animism. An {{important}} concept in anthropology and child development, animism {{is the idea}} that all things—including inanimate objects and natural events, such as storms or purses, as well as living things like animals and plants—possess human-like intelligence. John D. Rateliff calls this the [...] "Doctor Dolittle Theme" [...] in The History of the Hobbit, and cites the multitude of talking animals as indicative of this theme. These talking creatures include ravens, a thrush, spiders and the dragon Smaug, alongside the anthropomorphic goblins and elves. Patrick Curry notes that animism is also found in Tolkien's other works, and mentions the [...] "roots of mountains" [...] and [...] "feet of trees" [...] in The Hobbit as a linguistic shifting in level from the inanimate to animate. Tolkien saw the idea of animism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth: [...] "...The first men to talk of 'trees and stars' saw <b>things</b> <b>very</b> differently. To them, the world was alive with mythological beings... To them the whole of creation was 'myth-woven and elf-patterned'." ...|$|E
500|$|The company 3ality Technica of Burbank, California {{produced}} {{some of the}} equipment. The film {{was reported to be}} the first to adopt 3ality Digital's TS-5 wireless and handheld beamsplitter mirror rig. 3ality technology helped make it possible to avoid 2D to 3D conversion. Webb wanted a new 3D experience for Spider-Man: [...] "Because we're shooting in 3D, I wanted to conceive of certain <b>things</b> <b>very</b> specifically for 3D. There's an experimental component to 3D that's fascinating and we're experimenting with generating that point of view– so you feel what Peter Parker feels, you feel what Spider-Man feels when he's jumping over buildings and over the streets." [...] He felt that Spider-Man was ideal for 3D, admitting that they [...] "started making the movie around the time Avatar came out" [...] which made every studio want 3D. This was Webb's first film using the technique, and he did not want a force-fit or clumsy conversion as he had seen in other films. Webb cited childhood films such as Creature from the Black Lagoon and House of Wax for inspirations to push the 3D in his film even further than the type of depth that James Cameron uses in his film.|$|E
500|$|In the lead-up to {{the match}} against Worcestershire, photographers and cameramen {{constantly}} followed Lindwall, {{trying to capture}} visual evidence of an illegal drag when he was bowling in the practice nets. Bradman {{tried to stop the}} [...] journalists from taking photographs of the crease as Lindwall came in to bowl, and deflected media questions about his bowler's drag. The spectators and media were keenly observing the position of his foot in the tour opener, but Lindwall was not no-balled in the first match at Worcester, and complaints about his drag faded away {{for the rest of the}} tour. The hosts elected to bat first, and Lindwall took 2/41 in the first innings, bowling and trapping his victims leg before wicket before delivering three wicketless overs for 19 runs in the second innings. Lindwall took a wicket with his second ball in England, trapping Don Kenyon for a duck to leave the hosts at 1/0. He was promoted to No. 4 as Bradman rotated his batting order and he scored a quickfire 32 from 34 balls with six boundaries before Australia completed an innings victory. According to former Australian Test batsman and journalist Jack Fingleton, Lindwall [...] "took <b>things</b> <b>very</b> quietly...The fast bowler is very wise who builds up his speed match by match". With the media and public attention now focused on actual bowling, Lindwall's classical bowling action evoked almost as much interest as his captain's batting.|$|E

500|$|Marvel Studios {{developed}} specific {{business practices}} to create its shared universe, including choosing filmmakers that were considered [...] "out-of-left-field", given their previous work. Feige remarked, [...] "You don't {{have to have}} directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us. You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome," [...] adding [...] "It's worked out well for us when we've taken people [...] that have done very, very good <b>things.</b> <b>Very</b> rarely are one of those good things a big giant blockbuster superhero movie." [...] When hiring directors, the studio usually has [...] "a kernel of {{an idea of what}} we want", which is presented to potential directors {{over the course of several}} meetings to discuss and further expand. [...] "And if over the course of three or four or five meetings they make it way better than what we initially were spewing to them, they usually get the job", according to Feige. Later expanding on this process, Feige explained that before talking to any directors on a film, Marvel Studios often puts together a [...] "lookbook" [...] of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for the film. These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds every [...] "18 months or so" [...] to plan out and develop the phases of the MCU. These lookbooks are not always shown to directors, though, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first.|$|E
500|$|The Rhinemaidens {{have been}} {{described}} as the drama's [...] "most seductive but most elusive characters", and in one analysis as representatives of [...] "seduction by infantile fantasy". They [...] act essentially as a unity, with a composite yet elusive personality. Apart from Flosshilde’s implied seniority, demonstrated by occasional light rebukes and illustrated musically by awarding the role to a deeper-voiced contralto or mezzo, their characters are undifferentiated. In The Perfect Wagnerite, his 1886 analysis of the Ring drama as political allegory, George Bernard Shaw describes the Rhinemaidens as [...] "thoughtless, elemental, only half-real <b>things,</b> <b>very</b> much like modern young ladies". The attributes most apparent initially are charm and playfulness, combined with a natural innocence; their joy in the gold they guard derives from its beauty alone, even though they know its latent power. However, this veneer of childlike simplicity is misleading; aside from proving themselves irresponsible as guardians, they are also provocative, sarcastic and cruel in their interaction with Alberich. When the demigod Loge reports that the Rhinemaidens need Wotan's help to regain the gold, Fricka, the goddess of marriage, calls them a [...] "watery brood" [...] (Wassergezücht) and complains about the many men they have lured away with their [...] "treacherous bathing". They are beguiling and flirtatious with Siegfried, but finally wise as revealed by the undisclosed counsel which they give to Brünnhilde. Sabor sees the personality of the Rhinemaidens as a blend of the [...] "good hearted nature" [...] of the Oceanids and the [...] "austerity" [...] (including the willingness to drown people) of the daughters of Ægir.|$|E

2500|$|Scates {{was highly}} {{competitive}} {{both as a}} player and a coach, and he designed his practices to underscore competition and intensity. Practices moved at a high pace, with high repetitions and little time between drills. [...] "I ran shorter drills and quicker, and I didn’t stop the drills to explain <b>things</b> <b>very</b> much. I just tried to coach and keep things going at the same time." [...] John Wooden was a major influence on Scates and eventually a lifelong friend. [...] "I used to sit up there and watch him when we weren’t practicing. I learned a lot from that. I liked how he changed drills very quickly. He didn’t have any down time.
