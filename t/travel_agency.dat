40|$|Abstract. The rapid {{development}} {{of information technology}} has offered {{a very good chance}} for the development of travel industry, there is a great space for <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> of our country to apply the internet. Because the conceptions of development and design are backward, tourist products of China’s <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> are crude and lack personalities, thus have restricted the development of China’s <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> seriously. Aiming at these problems, this paper adopts the methods of induction and systems analysis, has explained the necessities for China’s <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> to innovate on tourist products by using the internet, analyzed the problems existing in the tourist products of China’s <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> and proposed some corresponding innovative strategies. Finally, such a conclusion has been reached: as long as China’s <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> understand fully the existing problems in their tourist products, adopt some corresponding measures, using internet to innovate on their products continuously, then China’s <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> will surely get a sustainable and healthy development...|$|R

40|$|Tourism {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{contributors}} to Malaysia’s economy. Amongst important players in tourism are <b>travel</b> <b>agencies.</b> Realising the crucial role of the <b>travel</b> <b>agencies,</b> recruitment and selection of the right employees are paramount. At present there is dearth of literature in recruitment and selection pertaining to <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> in Malaysia and other developing countries. Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to investigate on how SMEs <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> in Penang, Malaysia exercise recruitment and selection to equip capable employees. This research utilised a qualitative research technique for data collection, where five key persons of selected <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> were interviewed at their premises in the mid 2010. The research findings support previous studies pertaining to recruitment of small ventures elsewhere where SMEs usually use methods that are convenient, inexpensive and directly controllable by their businesses such as direct applications, personal and employees referals, and newspaper advertising. But walk-in interview, job fairs, help from employment agencies are not usually applied. As far as selection proses was concerned, <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> in the study considered priority on personal characteristics, knowledge and working experiences of candidates pertaining to the industry. While the owners of <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> have their own basic requirements that applicants should fulfill, no specific guidelines to hire new workers are established. In conclusion, SMEs <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> in Penang prefered traditional and informal recruitment and selection methods. In order to equip themselves with competent employees SMEs <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> in Penang should also exercise the current trends of recruitment and selection methods such as online advertisement, psychological test and aptitude test...|$|R

40|$|Purpose/aim: This paper {{research}} to help SME <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> make ticket pricing strategy and choose the reasonable age group for publicity. Design/methodology/approach: This thesis will use SWOT {{to analyze the}} strength, weakness, opportunity and threat of Hainan’s SME <b>travel</b> <b>agencies,</b> and also the marketing theory and human resource management. Through discussion and research we will analyze {{the connection between the}} influencing factors for <b>travel</b> <b>agencies.</b> The data has been collected through questionnaires. The analysis includes a description of the samples and statistical tests in form of regressions. Findings: The analysis showed that there is a connection between the frequency of travel and the age of the travelers. There are also connections between the select ticket price and different cities. It is important for SME <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> make a ticket price strategy. Originality/value: According to this thesis, it is obvious that SME <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> have more problems with travelers and an unreasonable strategy in Hainan. Based on these findings we would argue that small and medium sized <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> should choose a group consisting of young and middle aged adults when they advertise, decide their ticket pricing strategy and when they develop new tourism products. This study has a value when it comes to analyzing the situation and develop suggestions for SME <b>travel</b> <b>agencies</b> in Hainan...|$|R

In 1959, Saga Tours was created {{as the first}} <b>travel</b> <b>agency</b> for Mediterranean charter trips, and the company started a cooperation with Braathens SAFE. The first DC-4 flew to Mallorca that year. In 1961, the company's first Douglas DC-6B was bought. It had a capacity of 96 passengers, and cooperation was also started with Metro and Paddan in Gothenburg. Other charter destinations were London, Alicante and Málaga, both in Spain. That year, Braathens SAFE bought 50% of Saga Tours in a private placement. Braathens SAFE established an office in Gothenburg in 1965. After Vingresor had been bought by SAS and moved to Stockholm three years later, three employees started Atlas Resor in Gothenburg, and started using Braathens SAFE as their airline.

At the same time, the airline lost NOK6 million on the routes to from Oslo to Ålesund, Molde and Kristiansund, and NOK18 million on the coastal routes between Stavanger and Tromsø.
