5|$|Galland flew {{his first}} of 300 combat mission in Spain with the J/88 {{commander}} Gotthard Handrick, on 24 July 1937, near Brunete. During {{his time in}} Spain, Galland analysed the engagements, evaluated techniques and devised new ground-attack tactics which were {{passed on to the}} Luftwaffe. His experiences in pin-point ground assaults were used by Ernst Udet, a proponent of the dive bomber and leading supporter of the Junkers Ju 87 <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>for</b> Stuka wings. Wolfram von Richthofen, an opponent of Udet's, used them <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>for</b> the opposite: Schlachtflieger dual combination fighter-bombers. After trials with Henschel Hs 123s, Bf 109s and Ju 87s, the Junkers was selected to undergo trials for the dive bomber role.|$|E

Around 1803 he began cooperating with Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who was now working for the Russian authorities. Around that time, he and Czartoryski authored a plan for a European federal organization of states intended to prevent armed conflicts and to maintain perpetual peace. Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service and administration of the Russians, too. Like Czartoryski, Piattoli tried <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>for</b> a more lenient and friendly attitude towards Poland at the Russian court, but with little success.|$|E
5|$|Although Fannin, Dimmitt, and Linn {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>for</b> {{an attack}} on Goliad, Texian attention soon shifted towards Gonzales, where {{a small group of}} Texians were refusing to obey orders from Ugartechea. Colonists eagerly rushed to assist, and on October 2 the Battle of Gonzales officially opened the Texas Revolution. After learning of the Texian victory, Cos made haste for Béxar. He left with the bulk of his soldiers on October 5, but because he was unable to find adequate transportation most of his supplies remained at La Bahía.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{remained}} a Senator while {{each of his}} appeals were pending. Allegedly, his colleagues made it known that they would move to expel him if he appeared in the Senate.

5|$|By 1919, the White armies were {{in retreat}} {{and by the}} start of 1920 were {{defeated}} on all three fronts. Although Sovnarkom were victorious, the territorial extant of the Russian state had been reduced, for many non-Russian ethnic groups had used the disarray <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>for</b> national independence. In some cases—such as the north-eastern European nations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland—the Soviets recognised their independence and concluded peace treaties. In other cases, the Red Army suppressed secessionist movements; by 1921 they had defeated the Ukrainian national movements and occupied the Caucasus, although fighting in Central Asia lasted until the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Domestic {{politics}} in Eastern European countries continued <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>for</b> more enlargement, {{and political parties}} reluctant to move on NATO membership, such as the Bulgarian Socialist Party and Slovak HZDS, were voted out of office. Hungary's interest in joining was confirmed by a November 1997 referendum that returned 85.3 percent in favor of membership. Russia's actions in the First Chechen War were also a motivating factor for several countries that had memories of similar Soviet offensives.|$|E

However, in recent years it has become less vocal on the issue of disarmament; the need for increased border defence, particularly in the Territories, has recently overshadowed other issues in military circles.|$|R

5|$|The 193738 {{season was}} purely domestic, with no {{international}} matches, {{but it was}} an opportunity for all players <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>for</b> selection in the squad for the 1938 Ashes tour. It was another disappointing season for Queensland, who were again winless; they lost three matches, hung on for a draw, eight wickets down in another, and the other two fixtures were washed out before the second innings. Tallon scored 204 runs at 22.66 without managing a half-century and made 17 dismissals.|$|E
5|$|When the {{legislative}} session ended on March 28, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky and addressed {{the state legislature}} on April 2, 1861.

5|$|Against Hampshire, Ring took 1/19 as {{the home}} team made 195 after being put into bat on a drying pitch. He made a duck as Australia {{collapsed}} to 117 to trail by 78 runs, {{the first time the}} tourists had conceded a first innings lead during the English summer. Ring was not required to bat in the Australian second innings, as Hampshire were bowled out for 103 in 42.5 overs and Australia then reached their target of 182 to win by eight wickets.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power and popularity <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>for</b> a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E
5|$|By 1938, over 400 {{contraceptive}} manufacturers were in business, over 600 {{brands of}} female contraceptives were available, and industry revenues exceeded $250million per year. Condoms {{were sold in}} vending machines in some public restrooms, and men spent twice as much on condoms as on shaving.Tone, p. 136. Although condoms had become commonplace in the 1930s, feminists in the movement felt that birth control should be the woman's prerogative, and they continued <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>for</b> development of a contraceptive that was under the woman's control, a campaign which ultimately led to the birth control pill decades later. To increase the availability of high-quality contraceptives, birth control advocates established the Holland–Rantos company to manufacture contraceptives– primarily diaphragms, which were Sanger's recommended method. By the 1930s, the diaphragm with spermicidal jelly had become the most commonly prescribed form of contraception; in 1938, female contraceptives accounted for 85 percent of annual contraceptive sales.|$|E
