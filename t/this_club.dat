5|$|After moving home to Kristiansund in 1913, Løvold was {{instrumental}} in establishing a wrestling club. The sport became popular {{and within a few}} years all the major sports clubs were offering wrestling. Especially the labor movement's clubs took up the sport, and Kristiansund was quickly known as a wrestling town. Løvold coached several clubs, including IL Nordlandet and Ynglingen. In 1913 he succeeded at getting sponsorships of NOK300 from various companies throughout town to purchase mats, which {{was instrumental}} in making the sport more popular in town. He later became known as a benefactor and sponsor of local wrestling. Kristiansund's first major national tournament was held in 1915 and the first Norwegian Championships in Kristiansund were held in 1922. Løvold also traveled to the neighboring town of Molde to establish a wrestling club there, although wrestling never became as popular in Molde as in Kristiansund. He also established Trondheim's first wrestling club. From 1939, when the labourers' wrestling clubs in Kristiansund merged to form the club Kristiansund AK, Løvold represented <b>this</b> <b>club.</b>|$|E
5|$|Borussia's oppostition in the quarter-finals was Belgian champions Club Brugge. The {{first leg}} at the Bökelbergstadion saw Borussia concede two {{goals in the}} first half. However, they scored two goals {{in the second half}} {{courtesy}} of Christian Kulik and Allan Simonsen to secure a 2–2 draw. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>Club</b> Brugge had the advantage due to them having two away goals. Borussia knew that they had to score in the second leg at the Jan Breydel Stadium to have any chance of progressing to the semi-finals. The first half was goalless, and with six minutes of the second half remaining Wilfried Hannes scored the goal Borussia needed. The match finished 1–0 and a 3–2 aggregate victory meant they progressed to the semi-finals. Their opposition were Soviet champions Dynamo Kyiv. The first leg at the Central Stadium was won 1–0 by Dynamo. Borussia again needed to score to stay in the competition. Midway through the second half, Rainer Bonhof scored to make the tie 1–1 on aggregate. With eight minutes remaining and the tie heading for extra time, Hans-Jürgen Wittkamp scored to give Borussia a two-goal lead. The score remained the same and Borussia progressed to their first European Cup final with a 2–1 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Atlético won the Campeonato Mineiro twice, in 1962 and 1963, {{but failed}} {{to advance to the}} later stages of the Taça Brasil. Mineirão, Belo Horizonte's new stadium, opened in 1965 and {{immediately}} became the club's home. It was in the mid-1960s that the rivalry with Cruzeiro became the biggest in the state, after <b>this</b> <b>club</b> won the first five state leagues of the Mineirão era. In 1967, another national-level competition was created by the CBD, the Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa. It included more clubs than the Taça Brasil, but Atlético did not finish in the top-four in any of its editions in the decade. In {{the second half of the}} 1960s, highlights came in the form of friendlies against national sides. In 1968, Atlético, representing the Brazilian national team, defeated European Championship runners-up Yugoslavia 3–2 at the Mineirão; the following year, the Seleção itself, which would become champions of the 1970 FIFA World Cup, was defeated 2–1.|$|E

5|$|The Madchester {{scene of}} the 1980s, from which groups {{including}} New Order, The Smiths, The Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, 808 State, James and The Charlatans emerged, was based on clubs such as the world-famous The Haçienda. The period {{was the subject of}} the film 24 Hour Party People. Many of the big clubs suffered problems with organised crime at that time; Haslam describes one where staff were so completely intimidated that free admission and drinks were demanded (and given) and drugs were openly dealt. Following a series of drug-related violent incidents, The Hacienda closed in 1998. In 1988, Manchester was often referred to as Madchester for its rave scene. Owned by Tony Wilson's Factory Records, it was given the catalogue number FAC51 and official club name, FAC51 The Hacienda. Known for developing many talented 1980s influential acts, it also influenced the graphic design industry via Factory artists such as Peter Saville (PSA), Octavo (8vo), Central Design Station, etc. The memorabilia from <b>this</b> <b>club</b> holds a high value among collectors and fans of these artists and the club. Peter Saville was most notable for his minimalistic influence that still affects contemporary graphic design everywhere.|$|E

A general breed standard was drawn up, and Corgis {{began to appear in}} conformation shows. Until this point, neither breed had been specifically bred for looks. Members of <b>this</b> <b>club</b> were primarily interested in the Pembroke variety, although the Cardigan variety also appeared. At that point the breeds were referred to as the Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire varieties; the names were later shortened. There were a number of disputes between breeders of the two types in early shows, as judges who were breeders of one type would often favour them.
