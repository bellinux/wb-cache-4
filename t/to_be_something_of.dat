5|$|Football resumed {{after the}} war for the 1919–20 season and Villa won their sixth FA Cup {{at the end of}} season, beating Huddersfield Town 1–0 at Stamford Bridge. In November 1923, Villa's centre-half Tommy Ball was killed by his neighbour, thus {{becoming}} the only active Football League player to have been murdered. In their Golden Jubilee season of 1923–24, Villa got through to the second final to be held at the then new Wembley Stadium, where they lost 2–0 to Newcastle United. This Cup final was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a pinnacle though as Villa then had League finishes of sixth and tenth in the following seasons. The Directors attempted to stop the slump with transfer dealings. In 1927, they bought both Jimmy Gibson and Eric Houghton. In 1928, they bought {{in one of the most}} prolific goalscorers to have ever played in the English football league. When Villa signed Tranmere Rovers striker Tom Waring for £4,700, he was relatively unknown. Waring scored a record 49 league goals in the 1930–31 season as Villa finished runners-up to Arsenal. One of the other purchases, Eric Houghton, scored 30 goals.|$|E
25|$|In these pre-war years, Hal Ware proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an {{agricultural}} innovator. He {{was one of}} the first local farmers to use a tractor in the fields. As he couldn't afford new agricultural implements for his machine, he was forced to innovate, welding together two harrows designed for use by horses and similarly trying to adapt other horse-drawn gear for use in mechanized agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Munro {{started his}} writing {{career as a}} {{journalist}} for newspapers such as the Westminster Gazette, the Daily Express, the Morning Post, and magazines such as the Bystander and Outlook. His first book The Rise of the Russian Empire, a historical study modelled upon Edward Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, appeared in 1900, under his real name, but proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a false start.|$|E

25|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the release of}} the 2005 movie, Majesco Entertainment and developer Terminal Reality released a video game adaptation on Xbox and PlayStation 2. While primarily based on the film, elements from both the movie and the television series are included, as the game sets out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a canonical link between the two—although the Æon character in the game is modeled only after Theron and is also voiced by her.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, a {{group of}} {{businessmen}} led by Joe Claudio formed the Perth Kangaroos IFC. The club competed in the 1994 Singapore Premier League along with the Darwin Cubs. At the time, there were visions of establishing an Asia-Pacific Super League which could become a sporting and financial empire in the east. It turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a farce. The Kangaroos finished the league season undefeated and easily won the Singapore league title. However, with dwindling support and resources, the experiment {{proved to be a}} financial disaster and Perth Kangaroos IFC soon folded.|$|E
25|$|The {{announcement}} made top news {{all across}} the globe. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250million, the astronomical figure was soon revealed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment). To maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that Beckham could make over the five-year period from all his revenue sources, which {{in addition to his}} Galaxy pay also include his personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a five-year contract worth US$32.5million in total or $6.5million per year.|$|E

25|$|In April, Parker {{made his}} first mistake with Presley's career. He had booked him into a four-week Las Vegas engagement, misjudging the {{reaction}} of the slightly older, more reserved audiences that Las Vegas attracted. While Presley was a hit among the youth of America, the middle-aged audiences found him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an oddity. Some viewed him as a clown-like figure, wiggling his hips for screams like a monkey for peanuts, while others found his manner of performance vulgar and more suitable for late-night gentleman's clubs. After a very cool reception during his first few shows, Parker cut Presley's appearance to two weeks. Presley would later remember the event as one of the worst moments of his career.|$|E
25|$|UVa {{entered this}} game with an 0-29 record against Clemson. The win was Virginia's first-ever victory over an {{opponent}} {{ranked in the}} top ten. Both goalposts came down when the fans stormed the field; the first actually fell with 48seconds still on the clock. The win proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a watershed in UVA football history in that it {{set the stage for the}} 1990 squad to begin the season 70, rising to #1 in the polls for the first time. In addition, in contrast to Virginia's historical futility against Clemson prior to the 1990 game, as of 2013 UVA has beaten Clemson eight times (and tied once) since that 1990 win, although since 2004 the schools no longer play every year due to the Atlantic Coast Conference's expansion.|$|E
25|$|The victories, however, proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a false dawn as, {{over the}} space of five days in September, an injury-hit Ireland dropped five points from two games and saw their {{qualifying}} campaign effectively come to an end. Leading 2–1 away to Slovakia the team would emerge with just one point after an injury-time strike from Marek Cech cancelled their advantage. Staunton was disappointed by the performance but four days later, on 12 September, a 1–0 defeat to the Czech Republic in Prague crippled the qualifying campaign. A 0–0 draw with Germany on 13 October at Croke Park and a 1–1 draw at home to Cyprus in the same stadium four days later (during which a chorus of boos greeted the final whistle) secured qualification for both Germany and the Czech Republic. Ireland would not be competing in the 2008 European Championship.|$|E

25|$|The China Poblana was a {{real person}} who lived during the colonial period. Her real name was Mirra. She was an Indian who was brought over from Manila in the 1620s on the Manila Galleon as a child {{to work as a}} slave for the viceroy Marques de Gélves. She was soon sold to ship captain Miguel de Sosa who lived in Puebla. According to legend, Mirra was {{originally}} a princess in her home country but her family was displaced by the Portuguese and she was kidnapped by pirates who sold her. Mirra was considered to be beautiful and exotic. She had been converted to the Catholic faith. Later in her life, she began to have visions of the child Jesus and angels. Her fame grew and she was eventually considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a prophet. When she died in 1688, people began to venerate her as a saint and many women copied her Asian/Mexican inspired dress.|$|E

[...] The renovations received some criticisms for being funded by tax-deductible donations, meaning some of it eventually did indirectly come from the tax-paying public.|$|E

In December that year, after {{suffering}} from ailing eyesight for several years, Long went temporarily blind at the age of 47. Despite this setback, he continued to write; in early 1905 he began publishing a series of essays in Harper's Monthly under the pseudonym Peter Rabbit; told {{from the point of view}} of the [...] "author", the essays commented upon the human condition, animal intelligence, and the controversy first begun by Burroughs two years prior. The essays were published a year later in a collection titled Brier-Patch Philosophy.

[...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order...

They also described her as being bright, confident, having an outspoken nature and being [...] "full of contradictions". Holy Soap also described Sunny as having [...] "typical teenage insecurities", which included being self-conscious about her braces and her lack of experience with boys. This results in Sunny having an abrasive attitude. British television magazine, What's on TV described Sunny as being initially [...] "disappointed {{by the lack of}} excitement in Erinsborough", they also added [...] "Sunny appears snobby and unfriendly. But Sunny's front is a cover for a whole host of insecurities".|$|E

500|$|On September 21, 1922, Constable Steve Lawson of the Alberta Provincial Police {{was murdered}} at his Blairmore home by bootlegger Emil Picariello and his {{companion}} Florence Lassandra. [...] He {{was the third}} policeman killed in Alberta in liquor-related incidents in 1922. [...] The murder opened up a rift between Albertans of British descent, who saw bootlegging as an affront {{to the rule of}} law even if they did not support prohibition, and Albertans of southern and eastern European descent, who found prohibition <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a joke and accepted bootlegging. [...] Brownlee authorized the deployment of special constables to apprehend Picariello and Lassandra. [...] Once they were arrested, he appeared personally at the prosecution's bench alongside A. A.

500|$|In 1916, after {{attending}} {{a series of}} preparatory schools, Olivier passed the singing examination for admission to the choir school of All Saints, Margaret Street, in central London. His elder brother was already a pupil, and Olivier gradually settled in, though he felt himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an outsider. The church's style of worship was (and remains) Anglo-Catholic, with emphasis on ritual, vestments and incense. The theatricality of the services appealed to Olivier, and the vicar encouraged the students to develop a taste for secular as well as religious drama. In a school production of Julius Caesar in 1917, the ten-year-old Olivier's performance as Brutus impressed an audience that included Lady Tree, the young Sybil Thorndike, and Ellen Terry, who wrote in her diary, [...] "The small boy who played Brutus is already a great actor." [...] He later won praise in other schoolboy productions, as Maria in Twelfth Night (1918) and Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew (1922).|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the {{previous}} season proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a false dawn though, with the team finishing 14th, seven points above relegation. After refusing to resign, Eric Houghton was sacked when relegation seemed imminent in 1958–59. His successor Joe Mercer was unable to prevent the club being relegated in 1959, {{for only the second}} time in its history. The fact that Villa reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup only served to highlight the complacency that had set in at the club that led to Villa being relegated. Villa only spent one season in the Second Division, returning as Champions in 1960. The 1960–61 season was a successful one; it saw Villa reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup, finish ninth in the League, and win the inaugural League Cup. This was helped by the emergence of an exciting group of youth players, who became known as [...] "Mercer's Minors".|$|E
