5|$|A {{turning point}} for Windle was the 1960 Australian Championships; he came second in the 1650yd {{freestyle}} behind John Konrads and was selected for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. He {{dropped out of high}} school to attend a three-month training camp in Queensland with the Olympic swimming team. Windle did not swim in Rome; team officials merely wanted him to learn from <b>the</b> <b>routine</b> and atmosphere of Olympic swimming. On his return to Australia, he switched to the tutelage of Don Talbot, who also coached Konrads.|$|E
5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on.

I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing.

40|$|BOUNDPACK is {{a package}} for {{computing}} solutions of boundary value problems (BVP). At this moment BOUNDPACK contains routines to compute solutions of two-point linear BVP for non-stiff problems, which {{are described in}} the first chapter. <b>The</b> <b>routines</b> are designed for either general boundary con-ditions (BC),(the routines DHUTSG and SMUTSG for respectively double preci-sion and single precision computation), separated BC, (<b>the</b> <b>routines</b> Dl 4 UTSS and SMUTSS) or partially separated BC, (<b>the</b> <b>routines</b> DMUTSP and SMUTSP). The manual is designed {{in such a way}} that both the user who only likes to know how to call <b>the</b> <b>routines</b> and <b>the</b> user who likes to know more about the method should find his way through the following decription. The first user may restrict himself to § 1 and § 5 and also might consult 9 4 if more in-formmation is needed. <b>The</b> present <b>routines</b> not only try to compute the desired solution accurate-ly, but also aim at a reliable diagnosis when the computation encounters difficulties. In any case (also if no problems are reported) <b>the</b> <b>routines</b> deliver useful stability constants of the problem. It is our intension to extend BOUNDPACK in the near future with routines for other specific cases. Comments and reports about <b>the</b> present <b>routines</b> are very much welcomed...|$|R
5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with <b>the</b> <b>routine</b> of performing live.

5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by <b>the</b> <b>routine</b> acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the lower classes.

Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E

5|$|A charter {{granted in}} 1363 by David II, King of Scots (reigned 1329–71), awarded the burgh {{the right to}} trade across the regality of Dunfermline.

5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After <b>the</b> <b>routine</b> maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
5|$|After {{joining the}} III Battle Squadron in December 1913, Kaiserin participated in <b>the</b> <b>routine</b> fleet {{training}} exercises.

Kaiserin left Germany on 7 July for the annual summer cruise to Norway, but was recalled prematurely on 22 July because of rising international tensions following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Upon returning to Germany, Kaiserin steamed to Brunsbüttel on 24 July, where {{she was the first}} battleship to traverse the recently deepened Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. The voyage required lightening, and in just under twelve hours Kaiserin exited the locks at Holtenau in Kiel where she met the rest of her squadron. On 31 July, the entire squadron returned to the North Sea via the Canal. At midnight on 4 August, the United Kingdom, with its powerful Grand Fleet, declared war on Germany.|$|E

5|$|Black Prince {{was ordered}} on 6 October 1859 from Robert Napier and Sons in Govan, Glasgow {{for the price}} of £377,954. The ship was laid down on 12 October 1859 and {{launched}} 27 February 1861. Her completion was delayed by a drydock accident at Greenock while fitting out, which damaged her masts. She steamed to Spithead in November 1861 with only jury-rigged fore and mizzenmasts. The ship was commissioned in June 1862, but was not completed until 12 September 1862. Black Prince was assigned to the Channel Fleet until 1866, then spent a year as flagship on the Irish coast. Overhauled and rearmed in 1867–68, she became guardship on the River Clyde. <b>The</b> <b>routine</b> of that duty was interrupted in 1869 when she and Warrior towed a large floating drydock from Madeira to Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Daily life at Fort Greble {{was similar}} to that {{experienced}} by soldiers at other forts in the Washington defenses. A soldier's normal day began with reville before sunrise and was immediately followed by morning muster, at which the soldiers of the garrison were counted and reported for sick call. Following muster, the day was filled with work on improving the fort's defenses and drill of various types, usually consisting of gunnery practice, but also including infantry and parade drill. This schedule usually continued, broken by meal and rest breaks, until taps was called at 8:00 or 9:00p.m. Sunday was a break in <b>the</b> <b>routine</b> as the muster was immediately followed by a weekly inspection and church call. Sunday afternoons were a soldier's free time, and this was usually filled by writing letters home, bathing, or simply catching up on extra sleep.|$|E

New Zealand policy at the time was that long serving men were to be repatriated and their places taken by men with less time in service. In this regard, commencing in late May, drafts of men departed in the order of their arrival at the battalion. This included the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arapeta Awatere, who was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Henare.|$|E

At the culmination of <b>the</b> <b>routine,</b> the players emerged from the tunnel, accompanied by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli singing Il Gladiatore – a song based on Earth from the soundtrack to the film Gladiator – before Bocelli sang supporting vocals to the UEFA Champions League Anthem. Before they emerged from their dressing room, manager Pep Guardiola played the Barcelona team a specially commissioned seven-minute film showing their best moments from the season interspersed with clips from the film Gladiator. The film culminated with the late Luciano Pavarotti's version of Nessun Dorma, and it left several of the players in tears. With his players motivated for the game, Guardiola said nothing as they emerged into the tunnel.|$|E
