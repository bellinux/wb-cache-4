2500|$|Formed in 1998, 40 Below Summer {{had made}} a name for {{themselves}} by performing heavily across their native New Jersey and New York. In late 2000, the band's self-released CD Side Show Freaks found its way to No Name Management (known for acts such as Slipknot and Mudvayne). After partnering with No Name, numerous record label showcases on both coasts followed, with up to fifteen prominent labels showing interest in the band. They eventually signed with Warner Music Group's London-Sire. In March 2001, 40 Below Summer travelled to Los Angeles to commence recording their major label debut with famed heavy metal producer GGGarth (Rage Against the Machine, Mudvayne, Kittie). Lead guitarist Jordan Plingos recalled [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that we clicked with Garth about was that he was relaxed. He wasn't like, 'let's go, guys, let's go!' He was more like, 'get comfortable, get settled in.' His whole thing is bringing out the best in you, so pressuring you to do something doesn't help. He was all about us, which was amazing", while vocalist Max Illidge said [...] "He’s a lot of fun. He’s crazy too. Definitely a crazy little fucker, but he’s a lot of fun and a very talented guy. He definitely helped unlock some doors inside of me." ...|$|E

6000|$|For {{a time he}} {{was afraid}} of being dropped. Then he grew angry but knew better than to struggle, and then he began to <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> was to send back word to Baloo and Bagheera, for, at the pace the monkeys were going, he knew his friends would be left far behind. It was useless to look down, for he could only see the {{topsides}} of the branches, so he stared upward and saw, far away in the blue, Rann the Kite balancing and wheeling as he kept watch over the jungle waiting for things to die. Rann saw that the monkeys were carrying something, and dropped a few hundred yards to find out whether their load was good to eat. He whistled with surprise when he saw Mowgli being dragged up to a treetop and heard him give the Kite call for--"We be of one blood, thou and I." [...] The waves of the branches closed over the boy, but Rann balanced away to the next tree {{in time to see the}} little brown face come up again. [...] "Mark my trail!" [...] Mowgli shouted. [...] "Tell Baloo of the Seeonee Pack and Bagheera of the Council Rock." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{a man is}} honoured by such {{a request}} as that which reached me from the {{authorities}} of your institution some time ago, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that occurs to him is that which occurred {{to those who were}} bidden to the feast in the Gospel--to begin to make an excuse; and probably all the excuses suggested on that famous occasion crop up in his mind one after the other, including his [...] "having married a wife," [...] as reasons for not doing what he is asked to do. But, in my own case, and on this particular occasion, there were other difficulties of a sort peculiar to the time, and more or less personal to myself; because I felt that, if I came amongst you, I should be expected, and, indeed, morally compelled, to speak upon the subject of Scientific Education. And then there arose in my mind the recollection of a fact, which probably no one here but myself remembers; namely, that some fourteen years ago I was the guest of a citizen of yours, who bears the honoured name of Rathbone, at a very charming and pleasant dinner given by the Philomathic Society; and I there and then, and in this very city, made a speech upon the topic of Scientific Education. Under these circumstances, you see, one runs two dangers--the first, of repeating one's self, although I may fairly hope that everybody has forgotten the fact I have just now mentioned, except myself; and the second, and even greater difficulty, is the danger of saying something different from what one said before, because then, however forgotten your previous speech may be, somebody finds out its existence, and there goes on that process so hateful to members of Parliament, which may be denoted by the term [...] "Hansardisation." [...] Under these circumstances, I {{came to the conclusion that}} the best thing I could do was to take the bull by the horns, and to [...] "Hansardise" [...] myself,--to put before you, in the briefest possible way, the three or four propositions which I endeavoured to support on the occasion of the speech to which I have referred; and then to ask myself, supposing you were asking me, whether I had anything to retract, or to modify, in them, in virtue of the increased experience, and, let us charitably hope, the increased wisdom of an added fourteen years.|$|E
6000|$|That figure has, however, {{a freedom}} that the {{occasion}} doubtless scarce demands, though we may retain it for its rough negative value. It {{was to come}} to pass, by a pressure applied to the situation wholly from within, that before the first ten days of November had elapsed he found himself practically alone at Fawns with his young friend; Amerigo and Maggie having, with a certain abruptness, invited his assent to their going abroad for a month, since his amusement was now scarce less happily assured than his security. An impulse eminently natural had stirred within the Prince; his life, as for some time established, was deliciously dull, and thereby, on the whole, what he best liked; but a small gust of yearning had swept over him, and Maggie repeated to her father, with infinite admiration, the pretty terms in which, after it had lasted a little, he had described to her this experience. He called it a [...] "serenade," [...] a low music that, outside {{one of the windows}} of the sleeping house, disturbed his rest at night. Timid as it was, and plaintive, he yet couldn't close his eyes for it, and when finally, rising on tiptoe, he had looked out, he had recognised in the figure below with a mandolin, all duskily draped in her grace, the raised appealing eyes and the one irresistible voice of the ever-to-be-loved Italy. Sooner or later, that way, one had to listen; it was a hovering, haunting ghost, as of a creature to whom one had done a wrong, a dim, pathetic shade crying out to be comforted. For this there was obviously but one way--as there were doubtless also many words for the simple fact that so prime a Roman had a fancy for again seeing Rome. They would accordingly--hadn't they better?--go for a little; Maggie meanwhile making the too-absurdly artful point with her father, so that he repeated it, in his amusement, to Charlotte Stant, to whom he was by this time conscious of addressing many remarks, that it was absolutely, when she came to <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> Amerigo had ever asked of her. [...] "She doesn't count of course his having asked of her to marry him"-- this was Mr. Verver's indulgent criticism; but he found Charlotte, equally touched by the ingenuous Maggie, in easy agreement with him over the question. If the Prince had asked something of his wife every day in the year, this would be still no reason why the poor dear man should not, in a beautiful fit of homesickness, revisit, without reproach, his native country.|$|E

It covers in general the economic and labor problems related to the experience of industrial workers, office workers, farmers, anything that touches the economic field. It is also and usually supplemented with much work in English, with elementary science, social psychology, with history, with a background of life in the United States. It touches: employers problems, trade union problems, the worker in the community as citizen, the governments relation to industry and to the labor movement." ...|$|E

5000|$|All {{records for}} Tiffany Studios were lost after it {{closed in the}} early 1930s. It was only through the {{combined}} efforts of Martin Eidelberg (professor emeritus of art history at Rutgers University), Nina Gray (another independent scholar and former curator at the New-York Historical Society), and Margaret K. Hofer (curator of decorative arts, New-York Historical Society), that the involvement of Clara Driscoll and other [...] "Tiffany Girls" [...] in designing Tiffany lamps was widely publicized. However, a book published in 2002 entitled Tiffany Desk Treasures, by George A. Kemeny and Donald Miller, had already named Clara Driscoll as the designer of Tiffany's signature Dragonfly lampshade, {{as well as a}} significant contributor to Tiffany Glass—four years before Eidelberg and Gray went public with their discovery in 2006. The book also cited Driscoll as being one of the highest-paid women of her time, earning $10,000 per year.While doing research for a book on Tiffany at the Queens Historical Society, Gray found the historically valuable letters written by Driscoll to her mother and sisters during the time she was employed at Tiffany. The New York Times quoted Gray as saying: [...] "They brought out two books and several boxes, all letters, and I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I read was about how she had designed a daffodil lamp. And I started squealing. At the top it said something like ‘Noon at Tiffany’s,’ so it was during her lunch hour. What do you do with something like that?”Martin Eidelberg had independently seen the correspondence when he was approached by a descendent of Clara Driscoll after a lecture. The two historians compared notes after they crossed paths at Kent State University, where they were both tracking down more of Driscoll's correspondence. Their conclusion was beyond doubt. It was Clara Driscoll and the [...] "Tiffany Girls" [...] who had created many of the Tiffany lamps originally attributed to Louis Comfort Tiffany and his staff of male designers.|$|E
5000|$|Refn {{has spoken}} about {{characterization}} in his films: I've always liked characters {{that because of}} the circumstances, have to transform themselves, and in the end, it's inevitable that what they end up becoming is what they were meant to be. Take, for example, Pusher II, which is a movie about a son by Mads Mikkelsen who all his life wants his father's love, but realizes he needs to kill him to free the sins of the father from him. What plants the seed for him is realizing he has his own child, and the responsibility of that suddenly forces him to take action. And it's a happy ending, even though it's a dark ending, but for the character, it is what he was meant to become. It's almost like he achieved his true meaning. And Drive is similar in the sense that The Driver was meant to become a superhero, and he's denied all these things—relationships, companionship. And why would he be denied that? It was because he was meant for something greater. [...] Refn prefers to shoot his films in chronological order: [...] "I read that John Cassavetes had done it on some of his films, so I thought, 'That's a pretty cool approach.' And after I did it on my first movie, I felt, 'How can you do a movie any other way?' It's like a painting—you paint the movie as you go along, and I like the uncertainty of not knowing exactly how it's going to turn out." [...] Refn spoke more about shooting in chronological order in September 2011, in reference to Drive: It's always difficult with production. All my films previous to Drive had been shot in what I call 100-percent almost-chronological order. Where Drive is like 80 percent. The reason why it didn't go 100 was that I just simply couldn't afford the last remaining pieces. I could afford what I call [...] "the emotional chronological order". So nobody would die or leave the movie {{in the middle of their}} shooting schedule. It would always be the end. So there was a build-up as much as possible. [...] On his approach to working with actors, Refn has said: I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I ask any actor is what they would like to do, which sometimes can frighten people or can be looked upon as, 'Oh, you don't know what you want.' But I try to draw the actor in—to force them in, in some cases, because a lot of actors don't want to discuss things or go in deep; they just want to come and do the work, play their part and walk away. But for me, it doesn't work like that. You've got to get absorbed and dirty, and a way to do that is to ask the actor what they would like to do. It also forces them to be more truthful. [...] Refn's color blindness has influenced his style: [...] "I can't see mid-colors. That's why all my films are very contrasted, if it were anything else I couldn't see it." ...|$|E

But nobody ever thought of so simple and common-sense a thing at that. No, everybody swallowed these people's lies whole, and never asked a question of any sort or about anything. Well, one day when I was not around, one of these people came along--it was a she one, this time--and told a tale of the usual pattern. Her mistress was a captive in a vast and gloomy castle, along with forty-four other young and beautiful girls, pretty much all of them princesses; they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty-six years; the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers, each with four arms and one eye--the eye in the center of the forehead, and as big as a fruit.

6000|$|He didn't say anything, but I {{noticed he}} turned up his collar and pulled down his hat over his eyes and ears.

The gilly asked me if there was anything the matter with the flies, but I didn't want him to know what had happened, and so I said, [...] "Oh, no," [...] and turning my back on him I tried my best to get the hook out without his helping me, for I didn't want him to <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I caught was myself, after just missing my husband--he might be afraid it would be his turn next.

60|$|One more {{cause of}} incorrectness I may note, {{though it is}} not {{peculiar}} to the artist's tree-drawing, but attaches to his general system of sketching. In Harding's valuable work {{on the use of the}} Lead Pencil, there is one principle advanced which I believe to be false and dangerous, that the local color of objects is not thereby to be rendered. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> instance given is that of some baskets, whose darkness is occasioned solely by the touches indicating the wicker-work. Now, I believe, that an essential difference between the sketch of a great and of a comparatively inferior master is, that the former is conceived entirely in shade and color, and its masses are blocked out with reference to both, while the inferior draughtsman checks at textures and petty characters of object. If Rembrandt had had to sketch such baskets, he would have troubled himself very little about the wicker-work; but he would have looked to see where they came dark or light on the sand, and where there were any sparkling points of light on the wet osiers. These darks and lights he would have scratched in with the fastest lines he could, leaving no white paper but at the wet points of lustre; if he had had time, the wicker-work would have come afterwards.[78] And I <b>think,</b> that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to be taught to any pupil, is neither how to manage the pencil, nor how to attain character of outline, but rather to see where things are light and where they are dark, and to draw them as he sees them, never caring whether his lines be dexterous or slovenly. The result of such study is the immediate substitution of downright drawing for symbolism, and afterwards a judicious moderation in the use of extreme lights and darks; for where local colors are really drawn, so much of what seems violently dark is found to come light against something else, and so much of what seems high light to come dark against the sky, that the draughtsman trembles at finding himself plunged either into blackness or whiteness, and seeks, as he should, for means of obtaining force without either.|$|R

Years and years ago, I remember, the grave Abdullah, the great trader of Sambir, unable to repress signs of astonishment and admiration at <b>the</b> <b>first</b> sight of that imposing beard. And it’s very well known that Bamtz lived on Abdullah off and on for several years. It was a unique beard, and so was the bearer of the same. A unique loafer. He made a fine art of it, or rather a sort of craft and mystery. One can understand a fellow living by cadging and small swindles in towns, in large communities of people; but Bamtz managed to do that trick in the wilderness, to loaf {{on the outskirts of the}} virgin forest.|$|R

I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> writing I did was little potted movie previews on the weekend TV spread. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> anyone seemed to actually notice was a small daily bar review I used to write when the paper had a London supplement."
