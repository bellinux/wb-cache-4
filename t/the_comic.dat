5|$|In 2012 he {{announced}} that he had quit his regular job to work on <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> full-time. In addition to books and merchandising <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> is supported through crowdfunding by Patreon since July 2014.|$|E
5|$|A {{one-shot}} {{comic book}} {{adaptation of the}} show was announced in October 2014. Produced by KaBoom!, an imprint of Boom! Studios, <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> was released on November 5, 2014. <b>The</b> <b>comic</b> was supervised by McHale and was produced as an oversized special. <b>The</b> <b>comic</b> was illustrated by Jim Campbell, a writer/storyboard artist on the television series. A special variant cover, by McHale, was also released. The success of the standalone comic led to further issues being commissioned in May 2015 and began {{to be released in}} August 2015. According to Patrick McHale, <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> books would be similar to the one-shot comic, detailing the events that occurred in between certain episodes and will expand on the miniseries. The success of the series of one-shots led to an ongoing series of comics, serving as both a sequel and prequel to the series, rather than telling adventures that happened between episodes. The stories are told parallel, with half <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> detailing Greg returning to mysterious dreamlands in his sleep. The other half chronicles the Woodsman's daughter, Anna, and how she became lost in the Unknown.|$|E
5|$|A promotional limited comic {{series was}} {{produced}} in the run up to the game's release. <b>The</b> <b>comic</b> was written by Robbie Morrison, and drawn by Sergio Sandoval and Trevor Hairsine. The cover art was handled by Murry, while both McMarle and Jacques-Belletête took supervisory roles for the story and artwork respectively. <b>The</b> <b>comic</b> was published by DC Comics between February 9 and June 20, 2011.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Dark Horse Comics {{began an}} archive reprint series in hardback, {{starting}} with <b>the</b> original <b>comics</b> published by Dell. The second volume covers <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> published by King Comics, the third covers <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> published by Charlton Comics, the fourth covers <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> published by Gold Key, {{and the fifth}} covers <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> published by Whitman.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>comics</b> follows <b>the</b> {{television}} show rather closely and replicates {{the atmosphere and}} the settings faithfully. Primarily, <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> exhibits a humorous and fun atmosphere. Premiering in 1997, <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> {{proved to be a}} great success propelling itself {{to be one of the}} top 5 best-selling comic strips in Flanders, together with The Adventures of Urbanus, Jommeke, Spike and Suzy, and De Kiekeboes. <b>The</b> <b>comics</b> ran from 1997 to 2011 with 94 albums published.|$|R
50|$|IGN praised <b>the</b> Gravity <b>comics,</b> {{comparing}} <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> {{favorably to}} <b>the</b> classic Spider-Man <b>comics.</b> <b>The</b> character of Gravity was awarded Best New Comic Character for 2005 by IGN.|$|R
5|$|As {{the series}} progressed, some critics began to express {{frustration}} with <b>the</b> <b>comic.</b> Joey Smith, also with Inside Pulse, found the large cast {{was difficult to}} track by the fourth issue. In a review of issue 33, Fulton found the series entertaining, but sometimes thought the plot felt directionless. Not all agreed, however; Paste Magazine included <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> book in its list of favorite horror comics in late 2016.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{then goes}} to the Android's Dungeon, {{with only a few}} cents extra, where he runs into Milhouse and Martin. He talks them into pooling their money and buying <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> book. Since none of them want to let <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> book out of their sights, they decide to spend the night {{together}} in Bart's treehouse. The three get progressively more paranoid and Bart becomes convinced that the other two are conspiring against him.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended {{to be in charge of}} the bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on. Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> and the series. In one instance, <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} a {{treatise}} {{in the field of}} anthropology of science. The main goal of the essay is the antropological analysis of <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> Expercience by Emilia Dziubak. The author treats <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> as a source of knowledge about stereotypes for the scientist and science. Especially, he points to the mythological patterns used in <b>the</b> <b>comics...</b>|$|R
50|$|In the movie, Jean Grey is {{not only}} prominent, but the film foreshadows Dark Phoenix. In <b>the</b> <b>comics,</b> <b>The</b> Dark Phoenix Saga has already occurred, thus, Jean Grey did not appear in this storyline in <b>the</b> <b>comics.</b>|$|R
5|$|Critchlow {{was also}} commended for the risky {{decision}} to write, draw and publish <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> himself. <b>The</b> <b>comic</b> was compared favourably with professional quality comics, with {{its lack of}} adverts viewed as an advantage over those offerings. The high production values were also praised, with the glossy cover and high quality paper used for the inner pages.|$|E

5|$|Five The Sarah Jane Adventures comics were {{released}} {{on the official}} Sarah Jane Adventures website. Four of them were audio and comic adventures read by Anjili Mohindra. A pdf document and a mp3 audio track was available to download {{of all of the}} comics. Next to the Krulius stories <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> The Silver Bullet was published on the website. It is <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> that Clyde Langer wrote in the Sarah Jane Adventures episode The Curse of Clyde Langer.|$|E
50|$|The {{founder of}} MensuHell is <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> artist Steve Requin {{who was also}} its former editor, but {{ownership}} has since been passed to <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> fan Francis Hervieux in 2002.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>comics</b> {{were written}} and drawn {{at the same}} time of the novel, so the first issue could be {{released}} immediately after the book. However, the story told by <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> has many differences. The first, and most important one, is that <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> tells what happened to Boba Fett and his [...] "friends", the bounty hunters hired by Darth Vader to find the Millennium Falcon in The Empire Strikes Back. Steve Perry, author of the project's novel, was a consultant of <b>the</b> <b>comics.</b> While <b>the</b> stories in <b>the</b> book and <b>comics</b> seldom intersected, it was necessary that characters, scenes, and dialogue match when they did come together.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> {{have been}} used in education. Liberal Studies {{is an integral part of}} the New Senior Secondary curriculum in Hong Kong. In this course, the Hong Kong Examinations Assessment Authority have used society-related comics as topics of examination. Students need to interpret the content of <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> and theme that reflects <b>the</b> <b>comics.</b> With <b>the</b> popularity of society-related <b>comics,</b> <b>the</b> assessment authority prefers to use comics instead of a long article for the examinations.|$|R
5|$|Giovanni Cimmino as Pleistarchus, son of Leonidas and Gorgo (Pleistarchus {{does not}} feature in <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> book).|$|E
5|$|He began drawing <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> book {{in early}} 2005 with {{traditional}} art {{tools such as}} Mongol pencils and brushes. He took great care while illustrating Elmer because he felt his earlier work, Wasted, was poorly drawn. To devote time to completing <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> book, he had to quit his job working for US comic companies. As a result, the period between 2006 and 2008 {{was one of the}} most financially difficult times of his life.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{science fiction}} author Neil Gaiman praised Gunnerkrigg Court in his blog, which brought <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> to the {{attention}} of many more readers.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{the drama}} version {{is based on}} <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>comics,</b> <b>the</b> main character Haruko {{has been involved in}} more problems with the teachers and students than in <b>the</b> <b>comics.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{point of}} partial {{continuity}} with <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> is Conan's frequent spoken comment {{that he does}} not like magic; this was often expressed aloud in <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> but was usually unspoken in the Howard books.|$|R
50|$|Wagner {{has been}} {{nominated}} for Grammy Awards, with Tomlin, for <b>the</b> <b>comic’s</b> recorded albums and has won three Emmy Awards and a Writers Guild of America award, also with Tomlin, for <b>the</b> <b>comic’s</b> television specials.|$|R

5|$|Like the game, <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world, {{overrun by}} zombie-like creatures {{infected}} by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The comics serve as a prequel to the game, chronicling the journey of the young Ellie and her meeting with another young survivor, Riley Abel. Druckmann chose Ellie as the focus of <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> due to the uniqueness of her birth and upbringing in the post-apocalyptic world. Hicks joined the project after discovering Ellie's role in the game, considering her an unusual character to include in a survival horror game. The comic's art style is different than the game art—a choice from Hicks to give <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> a unique feel and identity.|$|E
5000|$|To {{promote the}} release of <b>the</b> <b>comics,</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Hurts Like Heaven" [...] music video was also Issue #0 of <b>the</b> Mylo Xyloto <b>comic.</b>|$|R
50|$|Besides <b>the</b> <b>comics,</b> <b>the</b> Wondermark website {{includes}} {{a number of}} features and articles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{portrayal}} of the characters is rather faithful to <b>the</b> <b>comics</b> except for Mortadelo and Filemon: Mortadelo has far more common sense and Filemon is actually quite dumb while in <b>the</b> <b>comics,</b> it was <b>the</b> opposite ...|$|R
5|$|Milhouse {{rolls over}} the side of the treehouse, but Bart catches him precariously by his sleeve. When a gale of wind takes hold of <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> so that it flies towards the treehouse's {{entrance}}, Bart is forced to decide between it and Milhouse. After mulling over his options, Bart chooses Milhouse and pulls him up into the treehouse. <b>The</b> <b>comic</b> flies out the entrance and is shredded by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed. The next morning, the three boys reflect on how their inability to share led to the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>comic,</b> although Bart, has forgotten the experience.|$|E
5|$|Motivated by Jyoti's {{rape and}} murder, Ram Devineni, Lina Srivastava, and Dan Goldman {{released}} <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> book Priya's Shakti. The storyline of <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> focuses on Priya, a human woman and ardent devotee of the Goddess Parvati, who {{has experienced a}} brutal rape and the social stigma and isolation resulting from it. Inspired by the goddess, Priya fights against gender-based sexual violence in India and around the world, supporting the movement against patriarchy and misogyny.|$|E
