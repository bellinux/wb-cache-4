5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, the {{emergency}} medicine systems (EMSs) in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore were largely mature, leading some practitioners {{to focus on}} developing the specialty in other countries. Thus, international emergency medicine as a subspecialty began in the 1990s, although some isolated efforts to achieve some of its goals had <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1980s. There were several reasons for the heightened interest these practitioners had in developing emergency medicine abroad. One was {{the contrast between the}} EMSs of their countries and the EMSs of other countries. Another was the revolutions of 1989, overthrowing authoritarian regimes, which facilitated spread of new ideas, such as emergency medicine.|$|E

After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.|$|E
