5|$|Exceptionally heavy {{rainfall}} in November 2012 caused a major {{break in the}} Grand Western Canal's banks, near Halberton, necessitating nearby homes to be evacuated. Two temporary dams were installed which allowed {{the rest of the}} canal to remain open and meant the horse drawn barge at Tiverton was able to run throughout the summer of 2013. Around 400 fish were returned to the canal from a flooded field but many fish including pike, eels, perch, bream, tench and roach were lost. About 25 people from <b>the</b> <b>Environment</b> Agency and Tiverton Angling Club assisted with saving the fish. <b>The</b> <b>Environment</b> Agency restocked the canal with 3,000 fish in January 2013 and by May <b>the</b> <b>Environment</b> Agency said they were flourishing.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> biophysical <b>environment</b> is <b>the</b> biotic and abiotic {{surrounding}} of {{an organism}} or population, and consequently includes {{the factors that}} have an influence in their survival, development, and evolution. <b>The</b> biophysical <b>environment</b> can vary in scale from microscopic to global in extent.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of AGN, in particular, the density of galaxies in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN. This determines whether AGN trace dense environments at high redshifts and whether <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> are important in addressing the problem of radio-loud dichotomy. I extend my research by investigating whether star-formation evolves differently in high-redshift AGN <b>environments</b> compared to <b>the</b> field. I begin by investigating <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of 169 AGN using Spitzer data at z ??? 1. I investigate the source density of star-forming galaxies in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of radio galaxies, radio-loud quasars and radio- quiet quasars. I do not find any significant overdensity of star-forming galaxies in these environments, although I find tentative evidence for a diff	erence in the colours of galaxies in <b>the</b> radio galaxy <b>environments</b> compared to <b>the</b> quasar and field environments. I next use VIDEO data to investigate <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of <b>the</b> quasars out to z ??? 3. Firstly, I use a training sample of QSOs and galaxies, which trains a neural network to detect QSOs in the VIDEO data. I detect 274 possible QSOs in the VIDEO data using this method. I am able to determine that {{the efficiency of the}} neural network clas- sification is 95 per cent using the training sample. I compare these results to a colour selection method, which detects 88 QSOs in the VIDEO data, and find that the neural network is able to detect ??? 80 per cent of the colour selected QSOs at Ks = 21. I then investigate the source overdensity using a radial analysis on <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of <b>the</b> VIDEO QSOs. I find a significant overdensity of galaxies in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of <b>the</b> whole QSO sample and in <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of <b>the</b> radio-loud quasars compared to the radio-quiet quasars. I extend the density analysis by using a second density measure, called the spatial clustering amplitude technique, to compare <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> of <b>the</b> quasars with their radio luminosities, absolute magnitudes and redshifts. I do not fi any significant correlations between environmental density and radio luminosity, absolute magnitude or redshift for the QSOs. I extend this research to investigate the type of galaxies found in <b>the</b> AGN <b>environments.</b> However, I do not find any significant differences between the type of galaxies found in <b>the</b> QSO <b>environments</b> and <b>the</b> background field...|$|R

5|$|Beneath a Steel Sky is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. The player uses a point-and-click interface {{to interact with}} <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> and to guide protagonist Robert Foster through the game's world. To solve puzzles and progress in the game, the player collects items that may be combined with one another, used on <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> or given to non-player characters (NPCs). The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees {{to learn about the}} game's puzzles and plot. Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> Unlike in most adventure games at the time, the protagonist's death is possible, after which the player starts from the last save point. In the remastered iOS version, the point-and-click interface is replaced with a touch user interface, a hint system is added, and hotspots are highlighted.|$|E
