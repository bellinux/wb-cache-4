During Operation Desert Storm, E-3s flew 379 missions and logged 5,052 hours of on-station time. <b>The</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> capability of the E-3 radar and computer subsystems allowed an entire air war to be recorded for the first time in history.

5|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} record chart in the United Kingdom. Until 1983, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry with a two-week break each Christmas. The BMRB used motorcycle couriers to collect the sales figures taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. This data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Music Week. On 4 January 1983, the chart was taken over by Gallup who expanded the chart from the Top 75 to the Top 100 and began the introduction of computerised tills which automated <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> process. The chart was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets and announced on Tuesday until October 1987, when the Top 40 was revealed each Sunday, due to the new automated process.|$|E
25|$|The {{algorithm}} {{attempts to}} set up a congruence of squares modulo n (the integer to be factorized), which often leads to a factorization of n. The algorithm works in two phases: <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> phase, where it collects information that may lead to a congruence of squares; and the data processing phase, where it puts all the data it has collected into a matrix and solves it to obtain a congruence of squares. <b>The</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> phase can be easily parallelized to many processors, but the data processing phase requires large amounts of memory, and is difficult to parallelize efficiently over many nodes or if the processing nodes do not each have enough memory to store the whole matrix. The block Wiedemann algorithm can be used {{in the case of a}} few systems each capable of holding the matrix.|$|E

25|$|The {{actual data}} mining task is the {{semi-automatic}} or automatic analysis of {{large quantities of}} data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then {{be seen as a}} kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection,</b> data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, but do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Zimbardo {{began working}} with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory called the social {{intensity}} syndrome (SIS). SIS is a new term coined to describe and normalize the effects military culture has on the socialization of both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary factor analysis of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013. Brunskill finished <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> in December 2013. Through an exploratory component factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and validity tests demonstrated that SIS was a reliable and valid construct of measuring military socialization. Fifty-eight items were deemed viable and six factors were identified; military friends (16 items), family (11 items), gender social preference (7 items), social bonding (11 items), nostalgia (9 items) and drug use (4 items). Identifying and standardizing SIS was the first step, further research has identified that 4 demographic categories within the military; active and have been deployed (AD), active and never been deployed (AND), inactive and have been deployed (ID) and inactive and never been deployed (IND). These are important categories to better understand how service members are affected leaving the military.|$|E

2500|$|Because pornographic film making {{involves}} unsimulated sex, usually without condoms (barebacking), pornographic {{actors are}} particularly vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases. In a paper written by the LA Board of Public Health, officials claimed that among 825 performers screened in 2000–2001, 7.7% of females and 5.5% of males had chlamydia, and 2% overall had gonorrhea. These rates are much higher than in patients visiting family planning clinics, where chlamydia and gonorrhea rates were 4.0% and 0.7%, respectively. Between January 2003 and March 2005, approximately 976 performers were reported with 1,153 positive STD test results. Of the 1,153 positive test results, 722 (62.6%) were chlamydia, 355 (30.8%) were gonorrhea, and 126 (10.9%) were coinfections with chlamydia and gonorrhea.
