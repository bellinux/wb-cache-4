40|$|Large-scale copper {{nanowires}} {{have been}} fabricated by potentiostatic electro-chemical deposition (ECD) of copper sulphate solution within the nanochannels of porous anodic alumina templates. Scanning electron microscopy, transmis-sion electron microscopy, selected-area electron diffraction and x-ray diffrac-tion techniques {{were used to}} characterize the copper nanowires obtained.

The single-crystal and polycrystal copper nanowires can be prepared by choosing suitable applied potentials in the copper ECD processes. Moreover, the forma-tion of copper oxides in nanochannels is also discussed in detail. The investi-gation results reveal that a lower overpotential is necessary to fabricate copper nanowires with fine crystalline structures by the potentiostatic ECD technique. 1...|$|R
