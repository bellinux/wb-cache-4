5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} {{the role of}} sexual intercourse in society, has been interpreted as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not and <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin accused her of supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of her own work. When {{she said she was}} drugged and raped in a hotel in 1999, controversy over the truth of the allegations followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which limited her mobility. She died of acute myocarditis at the age of 58.|$|E
5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{covered the}} deaths of the men with a photo essay, including photographs by Cornell Capa and some taken by the five men before their deaths. The ensuing worldwide publicity gave several missionary organizations significant more visibility, especially in the United States and Latin America. Most notable among these was the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), the organization for which both Elisabeth Elliot and Rachel Saint worked. Because of the martyrdom of her brother, Saint considered herself spiritually bonded to the Huaorani, believing <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw as his sacrifice for the Huaorani was symbolic of Christ's death for the salvation of humanity. In 1957, Saint and her Huaorani companion Dayuma toured across the United States and appeared on the television show This Is Your Life. The two also appeared in a Billy Graham crusade in New York City, contributing to Saint's increasing popularity among evangelical Christians and generating significant monetary donations for SIL.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E

25|$|After Corday murdered Marat, the {{majority}} of women distanced themselves from her because they believed <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had done would spark a reaction against the now developing feminist movement, which was already facing criticism.

However, Zeldis looks back on her years in Detroit fondly, stating <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> remembers best is the nature. She also remembers weekend visits to the Detroit Institute of Arts where she recalls being taken by brightly colored Flemish paintings full of small figures. These paintings would later inspire her colorful works with many small figures.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, Cristal and {{her boyfriend}} Zack Carey, the {{entertainment}} director at the Stardust, visit Cheetah's and request a lap dance from Nomi. Although the bisexual Cristal is attracted to Nomi, her request is also based upon her desire to humiliate Nomi by proving she {{is little more than}} a prostitute. Nomi reluctantly performs the lap dance after Cristal offers her $500. James happens to be at the strip club as well and witnesses the lap dance. He visits Nomi's trailer the next morning and, like Cristal, tells Nomi <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is doing is no different from prostitution.|$|E

25|$|Chimnabai I was {{knowledgeable}} in Bharatanatyam and Carnatic music, {{and brought}} a troupe with her comprising two dancers, two nattuvanars (leaders of Bharatanatyam concerts) and two teachers (Khandwani 2002). Others followed later, including Nattuvanar Appaswamy and his dancer wife Kantimati, who had studied with Kannusamy and Vadively, {{two members of the}} Tanjore Quartet. After the death of Appaswamy in 1939, Kantimati and their son, Guru Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar, left Baroda to teach in Lucknow, and then worked in the film industry in South India until Sayajirao's successor, Pratapsinhrao Gaekwad recalled the family to Baroda in 1949 to teach in the Music Department in the Kalavan Palace, later absorbed into the Maharaja Sayajirao University (Gaston 1996: 158-160). Later Guruvarya Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar established his own Institute, the Tanjore Dance Music & Art Research Centre at Baroda with his son Guru Shri Ramesh Tanjorkar and Guru Smt. Leela R. Tanjorkar (Kubernath Tanjorkar's family is devoted to Bharatnatyam dance now including their grandsons Rajesh and Ashish). So {{what we have here is}} a tradition of very distinguished Bharatanatyam dancers and teachers, members of a family considered an offshoot of the Tanjore Quartet bani (stylistic schools; Gaston 1996: 159), already established in Gujarat by the time Mrinalini set up her own academy.

[...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger reported that he was [...] "very unsatisfied" [...] with this episode, though, noted that he preferred Liz's plot over Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth's.

[...] Shilcutt added that she found it upsetting <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> believes to be the moral of the episode is that [...] "Educated, passionate people are elitists. It reduces all the hard work that people put into creating good, honest food into a joke, and not a terribly funny one.

500|$|... "How Will I Know" [...] is {{composed}} in a 1980s dance beat. Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "perky synth-funk". According to Kyle Anderson of MTV, the song found Houston hitting an [...] "incredible groove". It {{is written in}} the key of G flat major. The beat is set the time signature of common time and moves at a fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song also has the sequence of G-Bm7-G/C-D-Em-D as its chord progression. Houston's vocals in the song span from the note of E4 to the high note of G5. Lyrically, the song speaks about the protagonist trying to discern whether a boy she likes will ever like her back. She is also hesitant, because her friends tell her [...] "love can be deceiving", and she is so shy that she cannot phone him. Later, she feels {{that it might be}} a dream, but realizes that [...] "there's no mistaking", and <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> feels is really love.|$|E

[...] The Queen agrees, reminding him that in the new world, they would have no recollection of their agreement. Rumpelstiltskin then tells the Queen that she must cut out the heart of the thing she loves the most and use it to complete the spell. The Queen protests <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> loved most died because of Snow White, but Rumpelstiltskin suggests that there is something else the Queen also loves. He also tells the Queen that he has informed Snow White and Prince Charming that their unborn daughter will be able to break the Queen's curse.|$|E

500|$|The season {{does not}} {{directly}} adapt any one storyline from the comics, with DeKnight feeling {{that it was more}} important to focus on [...] "nailing the spirit of the comics". He stated that Netflix's support of [...] "the creatives" [...] coupled with Marvel's restrictions on their properties led to him pushing the source material {{as far as he could}} while remaining respectful of the characters and their history, and being surprised at [...] "how willing everyone is to take a really fresh look and really push what we’re doing." [...] Vincent D'Onofrio compared telling a story on Netflix to more of a [...] "13-hour film" [...] than a television series and noted that time can be taken to tell the story and [...] "be much more specific". Deborah Ann Woll explained <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw as one of the most important themes in the series was normal people having an impact in [...] "seemingly insurmountable circumstances", with the focus not being on Daredevil's abilities or the characters' qualifications, but on their willingness to help people.|$|E
500|$|She {{spent the}} next five years managing, {{directing}} and acting there, but also appeared {{from time to time in}} Philadelphia and toured at least once in Canada. Moreover, she occasionally directed for the Shuberts in New York, and was associated with Frederick Freeman Proctor's 125th Street Theater in Harlem. Bonstelle said that her dedication was partly inspired by the death of Janauschek in 1904, realizing <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did for the theater was lasting. From 1906 she managed stock companies at the Star Theater in Buffalo, and from 1910 also at Detroit's Garrick Theater, moving weekly between the two cities. She usually put on plays which had recently been successful on Broadway, but not those which she saw as immoral. The most popular production she directed was an adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women by Marian de Forest. Bonstelle researched the play herself, traveling to Boston to view personal papers provided by Alcott's family and talking to her friends. The production toured nationally in 1911, with four companies performing in different places at the same time, and had a [...] "successful and lengthy run" [...] on Broadway in 1912. It was also performed in London after World War I. From 1912 to 1917 she was a director at the Northampton Municipal Theater in Massachusetts.|$|E
500|$|The younger Angelo Padovani {{went with}} De Angelis to confront Morisi in San Giovanni in Persiceto. Padovani {{recalled}} finding her in tears. After the visitors {{assured her that}} they meant no harm, Morisi recounted what she had told Feletti. She said that a grocer named Cesare Lepori had suggested the baptism when she mentioned Edgardo's sickness, and shown her how to perform it. She had not mentioned it to anyone, she went on, until soon after Edgardo's brother Aristide {{died at the age}} of one in 1857—when a neighbour's servant called Regina proposed that Morisi should have baptised Aristide, that she had done so to Edgardo [...] "slipped out of my mouth". According to Padovani, Morisi described crying during her interrogation by the inquisitor, and expressed guilt over Edgardo's removal: [...] "figuring that it was all my fault, I was very unhappy, and still am." [...] Morisi agreed to have this formally recorded, but was gone when Padovani and De Angelis returned after three hours with a notary and two witnesses. After searching for her in vain, they went back to Bologna with only their hearsay account of her story, which Padovani thought genuine: [...] "Her words, and her demeanour, and her tears before she could launch into her story, persuaded me <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> told me was all true." ...|$|E
