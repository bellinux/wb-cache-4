25|$|Two- and three-ring PAHs can {{disperse}} widely while {{dissolved in}} water or as {{gases in the}} atmosphere, while PAHs with higher molecular weights can disperse locally or regionally adhered <b>to</b> <b>particulate</b> matter that is suspended in air or water until the particles land or settle {{out of the water}} column. PAHs have a strong affinity for organic carbon, and thus highly organic sediments in rivers, lakes, and the ocean can be a substantial sink for PAHs.|$|E

25|$|Two-ring PAHs, and to {{a lesser}} extent three-ring PAHs, {{dissolve}} in water, making them more available for biological uptake and degradation. Further, two- to four-ring PAHs volatilize sufficiently to appear in the atmosphere predominantly in gaseous form, although the physical state of four-ring PAHs can depend on temperature. In contrast, compounds with five or more rings have low solubility in water and low volatility; they are therefore predominantly in solid state, bound <b>to</b> <b>particulate</b> air pollution, soils, or sediments. In solid state, these compounds are less accessible for biological uptake or degradation, increasing their persistence in the environment.|$|E
25|$|A 2002 study {{indicated}} that PM2.5 leads to high plaque deposits in arteries, causing vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis – a hardening of the arteries that reduces elasticity, {{which can lead to}} heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems. A 2014 meta analysis reported that long term exposure <b>to</b> <b>particulate</b> matter is linked to coronary events. The study included 11 cohorts participating in the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) with 100,166 participants, followed for an average of 11.5 years. An increase in estimated annual exposure to PM 2.5 of just 5µg/m3 was linked with a 13% increased risk of heart attacks. In 2017 a study revealed that PM not only affects human cells and tissues, but also impacts bacteria which cause disease in humans. This study concluded that biofilm formation, antibiotic tolerance, and colonisation of both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae was altered by Black Carbon exposure.|$|E
25|$|Inhalation of PM2.5 – PM10 is {{associated}} with elevated risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as low birth weight. Exposure to PM2.5 {{has been associated with}} greater reductions in birth weight than exposure to PM10. PM exposure can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, and impaired oxygen transport access to the placenta, all of which are mechanisms for heightening the risk of low birth weight. Overall epidemiologic and toxicological evidence suggests that a causal relationship exists between long-term exposures to PM2.5 and developmental outcomes (i.e. low birth weight). However, studies investigating the significance of trimester-specific exposure have proven to be inconclusive, and results of international studies have been inconsistent in drawing associations of prenatal particulate matter exposure and low birth weight. As perinatal outcomes have been associated with lifelong health and exposure <b>to</b> <b>particulate</b> matter is widespread, this issue is of critical public health importance and additional research will be essential to inform public policy on the matter.|$|E

25|$|Firefighting {{has long}} been {{associated}} with poor cardiovascular outcomes. In the United States, {{the most common cause}} of on-duty fatalities for firefighters is sudden cardiac death. In addition to personal factors that may predispose an individual to coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular diseases, occupational exposures can significantly increase a firefighter's risk. Historically, the fire service blamed poor firefighter physical condition for being the primary cause of cardiovascular related deaths. However, over the last 20 years, studies and research has indicated the toxic gasses put fire service personnel at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular related conditions and death. For instance, carbon monoxide, present in nearly all fire environments, and hydrogen cyanide, formed during the combustion of paper, cotton, plastics, and other substances containing carbon and nitrogen. The substances inside of materials change during combustion their bi-products interfere with the transport of oxygen in the body. Hypoxia can then lead to heart injury. In addition, chronic exposure <b>to</b> <b>particulate</b> matter in smoke is associated with atherosclerosis. Noise exposures may contribute to hypertension and possibly ischemic heart disease. Other factors associated with firefighting, such as stress, heat stress, and heavy physical exertion, also increase the risk of cardiovascular events.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "hot {{particle}}" [...] {{theory in}} which a particle of plutonium dust irradiates a localized spot of lung tissue is not supported by mainstream research—such particles are more mobile than originally thought and toxicity is not measurably increased due <b>to</b> <b>particulate</b> form. When inhaled, plutonium can pass into the bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, plutonium moves throughout the body and into the bones, liver, or other body organs. Plutonium that reaches body organs generally stays in the body for decades and continues to expose the surrounding tissue to radiation and thus may cause cancer.|$|E
40|$|Currently, 178, 048 {{miles of}} {{impaired}} streams are contaminated due to {{elevated levels of}} pathogens or pathogen indicators. While attachment of bacteria <b>to</b> <b>particulates</b> is an important transport mode, understanding of the factors driving these interactions is lacking. Previous studies have indicated bacteria attachment <b>to</b> <b>particulates</b> is influenced by bacterial surface properties, particulate properties, and environmental conditions. The goal {{of this study was}} <b>to</b> explore bacterial, <b>particulate,</b> and environmental factors driving E. coli attachment <b>to</b> <b>particulates</b> in the aquatic environment. Specific objectives were: 1) to determine if differences in environmental E. coli cell surface properties are due to extrinsic (environmental) or intrinsic (genomic) properties, or an interaction of the two; 2) to identify the impacts from bacterial and particulate properties on E. coli attachment fractions by constructing statistical models; 3) to elucidate mechanisms of E. coli attachment <b>to</b> <b>particulates</b> in livestock manure. Cell properties including hydrophobicity, zeta potential, net charge, total acidity, and EPS (extracellular polymeric substances) composition were measured for 77 genomically distinct E. coli strains collected from two environmental habitats (stream sediments and water). Meanwhile, attachment assays were constructed using a single E. coli strain and one model particulate (ferrihydrite, Ca-Montmorillonite, or corn stover) with environmentally relevant concentrations. Our results indicated variations between stream sediment E. coli and water E. coli in hydrophobicity, EPS protein and sugar content, net charge, and point of zero charge. The diversity of cell properties was due to interactions of extrinsic and intrinsic properties. Moreover, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) successfully predicted the attachment fractions to Ca-Montmorillonite and corn stover using cell characteristics as predictor variables and net charge had a linear impact on the attachment fractions. Three genomically different beef manure E. coli strains (A, B and C) and one E. coli O 157 :H 7 (ATCC 43888) were analyzed for their attachment to two types of beef manure particles with size smaller than 53 Âµm: methylene chloride insoluble and soluble. Flow cytometry was employed to measure attachment fractions for 6 different E. coli concentrations and the Freundlich isotherm successfully fitted the attachment data. The results indicated a more heterogeneous mechanism for E. coli attachment to methylene chloride manure particulates...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} pulmonary function and occupational exposure in aluminium pot operators. METHODS: 2795 observations were obtained in 630 workers over six years of follow up. An autoregressive method of analysis was used. RESULTS: After adjustment for FEV 1 in the three previous years, the effect of smoking v no smoking on FEV 1 was - 43. 1 ml, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) - 72. 3 to - 13. 9. Similarly, {{an increase in the}} exposure <b>to</b> <b>particulates</b> by 1 mg/m 3 corresponded to a decrease in FEV 1 of - 11. 9 ml, 95 % CI - 19. 9 to - 3. 9.
