5|$|Another modern {{development}} (in {{use in the}} Netherlands) is {{the creation}} of housing communities at the edges of wetlands with floating structures, restrained in position by vertical pylons. Such wetlands can <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to accommodate runoff and surges without causing damage to the structures while also protecting conventional structures at somewhat higher low-lying elevations, provided that dikes prevent major surge intrusion.|$|E
5|$|At its 23rd meeting, held in 2007, the CGPM {{recommended}} that the CIPM should continue to investigate methods to provide exact fixed values for physical constants of nature that could <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in the definitions of units of measure {{in place of the}} IPK, thus enabling the transition from explicit unit definitions to explicit constant definitions.|$|E
5|$|Personal weather stations, {{maintained}} by citizens rather than government officials, {{do not use}} METAR code. Software allows information to be transmitted to various sites, such as the Weather Underground globally, or the CWOP within the United States, which can <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> by the appropriate meteorological organizations either to diagnose real-time conditions, or be used within weather forecast models.|$|E

5|$|Some of Rosetta@home's {{results are}} {{used as the basis}} for some Folding@home projects. Rosetta {{provides}} the most likely structure, but it is not definite if that is the form the molecule takes or {{whether or not it is}} viable. Folding@home can <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to verify Rosetta@home's results, and can provide added atomic-level information, and details of how the molecule changes shape.|$|E
5|$|As the {{electric}} telegraph network expanded, {{allowing for the}} more rapid dissemination of warnings, a national observational network was developed, which could <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to provide synoptic analyses. Instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using photography were supplied to the observing stations from Kew Observatory – these cameras had been invented by Francis Ronalds in 1845 and his barograph had earlier been used by FitzRoy.|$|E
5|$|At Oregon's request, the U.S. Congress {{stripped}} the slough of its navigable status in 1978. This ended channel dredging on the slough, which could <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for recreation. Other laws affecting the slough in the 1970s and beyond were the federal Clean Water Act and the Oregon Comprehensive Land Use Planning Act. In 1986, a business association began promoting commercial development along the upper slough, {{and the city}} later used urban renewal funds to support industrial projects near the airport. In 1996 the city acquired the Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, where it began a slough watershed education program for children.|$|E

ConnDOT has proposed to use up to 32 M8's in SLE service as far as Old Saybrook; the step-fitted diesel equipment will <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> on the Hartford Line and for New London / Mystic / Westerly service. Limited direct service from Grand Central Terminal to Old Saybrook may be added once the M8s are in service. Testing of M8 cars on the Shore Line East route began in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|Dirge of Cerberus is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} third-person shooter. Battles occur in real-time, with the HUD displaying {{information such as}} Vincent's hit points and magic points, the currently selected item and quantity thereof, and a cross-hair to aid in targeting enemies. The action is viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to Resident Evil 4, although players can switch to a first-person perspective if they wish. Defeating enemies yields EXP, {{and at the end}} of each stage, the player can either use that EXP to level up, increasing Vincent's stats, or convert it to Gil (the in-game currency), which can <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to purchase items and equipment upgrades.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine-18 {{is often}} found in {{radioactive}} tracers for positron emission tomography, as its half-life of almost two hours is long enough to allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers. The most common tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose which, after intravenous injection, is taken up by glucose-requiring tissues such as the brain and most malignant tumors; computer-assisted tomography can <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for detailed imaging.|$|E

5|$|The Knox and Kane Railroad {{was forced}} to suspend {{operations}} in October 2004 after a 75percent {{decline in the number}} of passengers, possibly brought about by the collapse of the Kinzua Bridge. The Kovalchick Corporation bought the Knox and Kane's tracks and all other property owned by the railroad, including the locomotives and rolling stock. The Kovalchick Corporation also owns the East Broad Top Railroad and was the company that owned the Kinzua Bridge before selling it to the state in 1963. The company disclosed plans in 2008 to remove the tracks and sell them for scrap. The right-of-way would <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to establish a rail trail.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} Diermot's {{movements and}} actions with a mouse or a gamepad. Diermot {{can pick up}} various objects; these can <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. He can also engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be}} done to solve the puzzles or progress the plot. A few simple action-oriented battle scenes are also included.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hixon was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the use of electromagnetic principles to measure articulation. In his letter to the editor, published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, he described a setup using two sensor coils and one generator coil. The sensor coils, attached to the forehead and back of the neck, would remain stationary while the generator coil, attached to the jaw, would move creating variable currents in the sensor coils. These currents could <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to determine the distance in two dimensions.|$|E
50|$|Another {{model of}} {{scientific}} progress, as {{put forward by}} Richard Boyd, and others, is history of science {{as a model of}} scientific progress. In short, methods in science are produced which <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to produce scientific theories, which <b>then</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to produce more methods, which <b>are</b> <b>then</b> <b>used</b> to produce more theories and so on.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} each song, {{a result}} screen is {{displayed}} to player, and his or her performance is rated with a letter grade, a numerical score, and a percentage that represents his or her accuracy. The player is awarded a number of fans and in-game money for his or her performance. The number of fans determine the idols' ranking, and as the player's idols increase in ranking, more items become available for purchase. These items can <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to customize the game's appearance or adjust gameplay elements, such as straightening the Melody Lines' shapes or causing the player to gain fans quicker. Finishing a song also earns the player Memories with the idols who perform the song, which can be used in the Star of Festa game mode.|$|E
5|$|Dino Crisis {{features}} survival horror gameplay that is {{very similar}} to Capcom's early Resident Evil titles. Regina can walk, run, turn, backpedal, push and climb objects, and perform a 180-degree turn. A map is available which will show Regina's location, destination, save points, and locked doors. Save points are rooms which will prompt the player to save upon exiting them. Some doors are locked by a D.D.K. (digital disk key) device. To open these doors, the player will need both a code disc and input disc which can <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to decipher a code and unlock the door. There are also force fields of red beams throughout the complex which can be activated to block access to intruders.|$|E
5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Bedell {{put forward}} an {{agricultural}} plan {{that he thought}} would increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by labor unions and certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to determine what types of production controls to enact. The purpose of this plan was twofold: production controls would decrease the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit farmers, {{who were in the}} middle of an acute debt crisis.) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls.|$|E
5|$|In metabolism, {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide {{is involved}} in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD is an oxidizing agent– it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, the most notable one being a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because {{of the importance of}} these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Ian Ramsey {{developed}} {{the theory of}} analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by Alister McGrath. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation {{and the nature of}} God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God. The use of other analogies may <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied.|$|E
