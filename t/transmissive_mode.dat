40|$|ABSTRACT: The issues {{affecting}} {{the future of}} distance education are complex. Questions concerning accreditation and standards, evaluation and assessment, instructional requirements related to academic credit, admissions criteria, and control of instruction present a mine field of difficulties for decision-makers. Moreover, such issues as descriptions of experiential learning, cognitive processing, transformational versus <b>transmissive</b> <b>modes</b> of learning, and lifelong learning demonstrate one clear trend: some form of an instructional paradigm is inexorably shifting {{to some form of}} a learning paradigm. This review of the literature on distance education is to provide a basis for the discussion of distance education in relation to theological education, and the role and responsibility of accreditation agencies in relation to the rapidly developing programs of distance education in various institutional settings. Any review of literature on this subject is quickly dated. Literature on the topic is increasing exponentially, web sites appear and disappear seemingly overnight, and what was once considered “state-of-the-art ” technology quickly becomes obsolete. Nonetheless, there are issues presented in this review that are important for the future of theological schools and agencies that accredit them...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} "transmissibility" of a {{simulated}} two-dimensional pack of frictionless disks formed by confining dilute disks in a shrinking, periodic box {{to the point}} of mechanical stability. Two opposite boundaries are then removed, thus allowing a set of free motions. Small free displacements on one boundary then induce proportional displacements on the opposite boundary. Transmissibility is the ability to distinguish different perturbations by their distant responses. We assess transmissibility by successively identifying free orthonormal modes of motion that have the smallest distant responses. The last modes to be identified in this "pessimistic" basis are the most transmissive. The transmitted amplitudes of these most <b>transmissive</b> <b>modes</b> fall off exponentially with mode number. Similar exponential falloff is seen in a simple elastic medium, though the responsible modes differ greatly in structure in the two systems. Thus the marginal pack's transmissibility is qualitatively similar to that of a simple elastic medium. We compare our results with recent findings based on the projection of the space of free motion onto interior sites. Comment: to be published in J. Phys. Cond. Ma...|$|R

40|$|A novel LCD {{technology}} yields {{both high}} reflection and transmission. Mobile display {{devices such as}} portable media players, satellite navigators, and laptop computers demand good readability in both indoor and outdoor settings. These stringent constraints make transflective LCDs (displays that are readable under both bright sunlight and low-light situations) a promising technol-ogy. In transflective LCDs, each pixel {{is divided into two}} parts, one transmissive and the other reflective. The limited suitability of LCDs due to their narrow viewing angles can be overcome by introducing in-plane (IPS) and fringe-field horizontal switch-ing (FFS) modes. However, manufacturing horizontal-mode-switching LCDs requires complicated and expensive fabrication processes. 1, 2 Transflective LCDs operating in a single mode and manufac-turedwith a so-called single-cell-gap structure are very desirable to reduce production costs. But they require in-cell retardation layers to prevent image inversion between the reflective and <b>transmissive</b> <b>modes.</b> 1, 2 Moreover, these retarders, too, have a number of significant problems, including increased operating voltage and unreliability of the materials used for their fabrica-tion. A new optical configuration for a transflective IPS LCDwas recently reported, 3 which employs a twisted-nematic liquid-crystal (TNLC) cell with a single-cell-gap structure and without in-cell retarders. Although the transmissive-mode viewing angle performance is significantly improved, the resulting reflective-mode display capability is poor, and both modes exhibit differ-ent electro-optic characteristics. Here, we propose an optical TNLC cell design for a single-cell-gap transflective display in FFS mode (see Figure 1). A system-atic manufacturing procedure simultaneously achieves optimal display performance of both reflection and transmission.

40|$|Transflective {{liquid crystal}} {{displays}} (LCDs) combine {{the characteristics of}} transmissive LCDs and reflective LCDs. The pixels of the transflective LCDs are separated into the transmissive and reflective sub-pixels. The transmissive sub-pixels in a transflective display are transmitting with backlight illumination and the reflective sub-pixels are reflecting light from the environment under ambient illumination. Conventional transflective LCDs are commonly fabricated using a double cell gap approach to maintain the same optical characteristics with increasing the voltage. In the double cell gap approach, the cell gap for <b>transmissive</b> <b>mode</b> is doubled to that for the reflective mode. So that, both reflective and <b>transmissive</b> <b>mode</b> has the same optical path difference. But on the other hand, the fabrication {{would be much more}} complicated. In a single cell gap approach matching the transmittance versus voltage curve (TVC) with the reflectance versus voltage curve (RVC), different LC modes in the transmissive and the reflective sub-pixels have been suggested recently. In this thesis, several new configurations of transflective LCD with single cell gap approach are proposed. Three general types of transflective are proposed. Firstly, the transflective configuration using double cell gap approach and patterned retardation film, which are currently using throughout the transflective market. Secondly, the multimode transflective configurations with different electro-optical mode in the transmissive and reflective part. The alignment domains in pixels could be realized by a photo-alignment technique. Lastly, the transflective liquid crystal display without sub-pixel separation.

This method {{is part of}} the design of a novel lab-on-chip device[1] that enables microbiologists to purify, isolate and assay mixtures of viruses without the use of destructive labeling techniques or direct observations using electron microscopy. Our approach is based on the fabrication of large (103 scale) and very dense (100 nm scale) electrode arrays using the semiconductor layers of a lab-on-chip die. This array, see Figure 1, is the platform for dielectrophoresis (DEP) based methods for sorting the mixtures of bioparticles and arranging the particles by type into groups at various regions of the electrode array.

Even for completely incoherent illumination (constant in angle), the reflected radiance distribution of a single location on the display exhibits angular variation (right), which is impossible with single layer displays. With a wide range of applications in product design and optical watermarking, computational BxDF display has become an emerg-ing trend in the graphics community. In this paper, we analyze the design space of BxDF displays and show that existing approaches cannot reproduce arbitrary BxDFs. In particular, existing surface-based fabrication techniques are often limited to generating only specific angular frequencies, angle-shift-invariant radiance distribu-tions, and sometimes only symmetric BxDFs. To overcome these limitations, we propose diffractive multilayer BxDF displays. We derive forward and inverse methods to synthesize patterns that are printed on stacked, high-resolution transparencies and reproduce prescribed BxDFs with unprecedented degrees of freedom within the limits of available fabrication techniques...|$|R

By applying spectroscopic ellipsometry, we have determined the optical constants of thin films of electrochromic tungsten oxide (WOx) and nickel oxide (NiOy), the films’ thickness and roughness. These films, which were obtained at spattering conditions possess high transmittance that is important for achieving good visibility and high contrast in an EC device. Another application of the general spectroscopic ellipsometry relates {{to the study of}} a photo-alignment layer of a mixture of azo-dyes SD- 1 and SDA- 2. We have found the optical constants of this mixture before and after illuminating it by polarized UV light. The results obtained confirm the diffusion model to explain the formation of the photo-induced order in azo-dye films. We have developed new techniques for fast characterization of twisted nematic LC cells in <b>transmissive</b> and reflective <b>modes.</b> Our techniques are based on the characteristics functions that we have introduced for determination of parameters of non-uniform birefringent media. These characteristic functions are found by simple procedures and can be utilised for simultaneous determination of retardation, its wavelength dispersion, and twist angle, as well as for solving associated optimization problems. Cholesteric LCD that possesses some unique properties, such as bistability and good selective scattering, however, has a disadvantage – relatively high driving voltage (tens of volts). The way we propose to reduce the driving voltage consists of applying a stack of thin (~ 1 µm) LC layers. We have studied the ability of a layer of a surface stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal coupled with several retardation plates for birefringent color generation.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the notion of}} holistic education into the context of action-based entrepreneurial education, {{in order to develop}} a framework for achieving and understanding whole person development. The aim of the framework is to connect with a wider set of teaching and learning paradigms as a basis for instructional design and assessment, to bridge some of the fragmentation apparent in conceptual frameworks for entrepreneurial education. To facilitate this multi-facetted view on teaching and learning, we introduce a framework of transmissive, transactional and transformative teaching modes. In this framework, the <b>transmissive</b> <b>mode</b> relies upon traditional teaching methods; the transactional mode relies upon on self-directed problem-solving, collaboration and engagement in authentic learning environments; and, the transformative mode appreciates the whole learning person, how she connects with herself, others and the world. We argue that all modes are needed in order to achieve and understand whole person development, and that entrepreneurship teaching should be designed so that it offers a reservoir of rich and diverse experiences in an authentic learning environment. The three teaching modes are analyzed and discussed in relation to a leadership course assignment and eight selected citations from student deliverables in 2007. The citations represent an extreme sampling as the students had been running a tech venture during almost a year as the major vehicle of learning in their program, they had no prior entrepreneurship experience, and all of the selected students became and have remained start-up entrepreneurs since their graduation. The selected citations illustrate how transmissive, transactional and transformative teaching modes can be contextualized in action-based entrepreneurial education, and point towards that significant learning has emerged through the integration of different teaching modes. The richness of the citations indicate that action-based entrepreneurial education is a vehicle {{for a wide variety of}} learning outcomes. Accordingly, the introduced framework seems to hold promise as a basis for achieving and understanding whole person learning in this context. Practical teaching aspects are addressed, both around designing authentic learning environments as well as around designing and examining more tangible deliverables from students in such environments...|$|E

LS is presented as a model of PL that offers EFL teachers in Indonesia a way to shift current transmissive teacher-centered approaches to EFL teaching to more student- centered learning. It is argued that in Indonesian tertiary educational settings, secondary school teachers PL should similarly become the centre of their own learning. Drawing on theories of reflective practices in teaching and learning and the principles of LS, the study sought to demonstrate the applicability of LS as a model of EFL lecturers’ PL in tertiary contexts. Informed by interpretivist approach and naturalistic inquiry, the study involved twelve EFL teachers from secondary schools, three LS specialists, and seven EFL lecturers from the Gama Language Training Centre (GLTC) in Indonesia. Using qualitative methods, focus group interviews and in-depth interviews were utilized to gather the data. Focus group interviews were conducted with the EFL secondary school teachers and the EFL lecturers in the GLTC, while individual in-depth interviews were carried out with the LS specialists. These three lenses on the phenomenon under enquiry provided rich data for exploration. The data were triangulated for trustworthiness and credibility. The data were analysed thematically using increasingly rigorous levels of coding. The findings are illustrated by verbatim quotations to give voice to the participants. The findings indicate that many {{of the participants in the}} secondary school contexts considered LS an efficacious approach to teacher reflective practice and PL. The collaborative work and reflective practice embedded in the phases of LS provided many learning opportunities for enhancing EFL content knowledge and creating effective pedagogies that contributed positively to their sense of self as professional educators. Another finding reveals that after having focus group interviews, the EFL lecturers in the GLTC shifted their beliefs from a paradigm of professional development to one of PL. LS with its phases of PLAN, DO, SEE offers a potential framework of PL to achieving this. When comparing and contrasting the school teachers’ beliefs about LS as a collaborative and reflective practice form of PL with those beliefs held about PL at the tertiary level, it was found that both groups of participants believed their PL activity was an opportunity for them to become better practitioners. The findings too revealed that the characteristics of LS as the form of the EFL secondary school teachers PL have embedded in the EFL lecturers’ PL in the GLTC. This provides opportunities for LS to be adopted as a collaborative model of reflective practice so that the <b>transmissive</b> <b>mode</b> of EFL teaching in Indonesia can be shifted to one more focused on student learning. LS proved to be effective model of PL and it is currently undertaken by secondary school teachers; therefore, it will be particularly useful for EFL teaching in Indonesian tertiary contexts. The implication of this study of LS as collaborative and reflective PL in Indonesian tertiary institutions is that PL is essential in improving teacher professionalism and supporting a shift from a transmissive teaching practice to one that is learner centred...|$|E
