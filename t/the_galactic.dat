5|$|Astronomers such as David Morrison {{argue that}} <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> equator {{is an entirely}} {{arbitrary}} line and can never be precisely drawn, because {{it is impossible to}} determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> equator from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} theorise that <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> tide {{may have}} contributed to the formation of the Oort cloud by increasing the perihelia (smallest distances to the Sun) of planetesimals with large aphelia (largest distances to the Sun). The effects of <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system. Cumulatively, however, the effect can be quite significant: up to 90% of all comets originating from the Oort cloud may be the result of <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> tide. Statistical models of the observed orbits of long-period comets argue that <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> tide is the principal means by which their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent studies {{saw more}} {{fundamental}} {{revision of the}} old concept of <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> habitable zone as an annulus. In 2008, a study by Nikos Prantzos revealed that, while {{the probability of a}} planet escaping sterilization by supernova was highest at a distance of about 10 kpc from <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> center, the sheer density of stars in the inner galaxy meant that the highest number of habitable planets could be found there. The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael Gowanlock, who calculated the frequency of supernova-surviving planets as a function of their distance from <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> center, their height above <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> plane, and their age, ultimately discovering that about 0.3% of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life, or 1.2% if one does not consider the tidal locking of red dwarf planets as precluding the development of complex life.|$|E

5|$|The Solar System travels alone {{through the}} Milky Way in a {{circular}} orbit approximately 30,000light years from <b>the</b> <b>Galactic</b> Centre. Its speed is about 220km/s. The period required for the Solar System to complete one revolution around <b>the</b> <b>Galactic</b> Centre, <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> year, is {{in the range of}} 220â€“250 million years. Since its formation, the Solar System has completed at least 20 such revolutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} galactic {{habitable}} zone {{was further}} developed in 2001 in a paper by Ward and Brownlee, in collaboration with Guillermo Gonzalez of the University of Washington. In that paper, Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward stated that regions near <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> halo would lack the heavier elements required to produce habitable terrestrial planets, thus creating an outward limit {{to the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> habitable zone. Being too close to <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> center, however, would expose an otherwise habitable planet to numerous supernovae and other energetic cosmic events, as well as excessive cometary impacts caused by perturbations of the host star's Oort cloud. Therefore, the authors established an inner boundary for <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> habitable zone, located just outside <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> bulge.|$|E

5|$|This {{constellation}} forms {{part of the}} zodiac, {{and hence}} is intersected by the ecliptic. This circle across the celestial sphere forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually {{be found in the}} constellation Taurus during some part of each year. <b>The</b> <b>galactic</b> plane of the Milky Way intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> anticenter is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga. Taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> equator, celestial equator, and ecliptic. A ring-like galactic structure known as Gould's Belt passes through the constellation.|$|E
5|$|A galactic bar {{also has}} the {{potential}} to affect the size of <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> habitable zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> habitable zone. It has been suggested that for this reason, it may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} vast distances between stars outside <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> nucleus, collisions between stars {{are thought to be}} rare.

These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity of the cluster to which it belongs.|$|E

5|$|Early {{research}} on <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> habitable zone, including the 2001 paper by Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward, did not demarcate any specific boundaries, merely {{stating that the}} zone was an annulus encompassing a region of the galaxy that was both enriched with metals and spared from excessive radiation, and that habitability {{would be more likely}} in the galaxy's thin disk.
