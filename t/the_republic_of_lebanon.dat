50|$|Yusuf's Maronite successor, Emir Bashir Shihab II, maneuvered {{against his}} local rivals and the {{powerful}} Acre-based governors of Sidon to centralize his control over Mount Lebanon. This ultimately involved destroying the feudal power of the mostly Druze lords and the cultivation of the Maronite clergy as an alternative power base of the emirate. Bashir allied himself with Muhammad Ali of Egypt during his occupation of Syria, but was deposed in 1840 when the Egyptians were driven out by an Ottoman-European alliance, which had the backing of Maronite forces. His successor, Emir Bashir III, ruled for two years, after which emirate was dissolved and replaced with the Double Qaimaqamate, which split Mount Lebanon into Druze and Christian sectors. The Shihab family's influence declined thereafter. However, members of the presently mixed Muslim-Christian family, namely President Fuad Chehab and Prime Minister Khaled Chehab, reached high political office in <b>the</b> modern <b>republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lebanon.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The first Syrian {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} the United States from Ottoman Syria in the period between 1889 and 1914. Most of them came from Christian villages around Mount <b>Lebanon</b> (before <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lebanon),</b> while around 5-10% were Muslims of different sects. A small number were also Palestinians. According to historian Philip Hitti, approximately 900,000 [...] "Syrians" [...] {{arrived in the}} United States between 1899 and 1919. An estimated 1,000 official entries per year came from the governorates of Damascus and Aleppo, which are governorates in modern-day Syria, in the period between 1900 and 1916. Early immigrants settled mainly in Eastern United States, in the cities of New York, Boston and Detroit and the Paterson, New Jersey area. Until 1899, all migrants from the Ottoman Empire registered as [...] "Turks" [...] when entering the US. When [...] "Syrian" [...] became available as a designation {{at the turn of}} the 20th century., 3,708 migrants from the region registered as Syrians, only 28 as Turks. In the 1920s, the majority of immigrants from Mount Lebanon began to refer to themselves as Lebanese instead of [...] "Syrians".|$|R
40|$|When {{domestic}} {{labor markets}} cannot fully absorb an increasing level of educated labor force, migration {{is an important}} channel for resolving local market imbalances with potentially large benefits to the individuals and nations involved. Labor movement is particularly important for the MENA region {{because one of the}} region’s main characteristics is excess labor in a subgroup of countries (such as <b>the</b> Arab <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Egypt, <b>Lebanon,</b> Jordan, and Morocco) and excess capital in another (such as the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries). 1 A similar point can be made about labor-abundant countries in the South versus capital-rich countries in the North. This situation creates an opportunity for a mu-tually beneficial exchange between the two groups of countries, provided that market failures across borders are addressed and national migration policies are not biased against migration. In this chapter, it is argued that, despite the significant level of mi-gration in MENA, a host of factors has limited the full realization of its potential benefits. In addition to political factors, which are {{beyond the scope of this}} report, migration is adversely affected by widespread mar-ket failures (most visibly information asymmetry and imperfect con-tracts) and national migration and labor policies at both ends of the ex-change. Historically, governments in the region tended to focus on the liberalization of trade in goods and services by joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) or signing regional free-trade agreements. No similar effort was made to liberalize or coordinate labor movement over-seas, although the benefits from labor mobility can be more substantial than those from the movement of goods and capital because of the huge differential in the wage rates for similar skills across countries. 2 Thus, there is room for enhancing the returns to education through migration. This potential can be realized through labor mobility agreements among MENA countries (or a subset of countries) and through reforms of na-tional migration policies that stand in the way of greater and more effi-cient labor mobility...|$|R
