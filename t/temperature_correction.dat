One of the most important sources not possible to quantify is the conceptual model, which is developed and defined by the modeller. Further sources are the parameterization of the model regarding the hydraulic (only when simulating transport) and mineralogical properties. The parameters used for the geochemical simulations can also contribute to model uncertainty. These are the applied thermodynamic database and the parameters for the kinetic minerals dissolution. Differences in the thermodynamic data (i.e. equilibrium constants, parameters for <b>temperature</b> <b>correction,</b> activity equations and coefficients) can result in large uncertainties.

60|$|In the {{following}} tables I {{have given the}} elevations of 300 places, chiefly computed from barometric data. For the computations such observations alone were selected as were comparable with contemporaneous ones taken at the Calcutta Observatory, or as could, by interpolation, be reduced to these, with considerable accuracy: the Calcutta temperatures have been assumed {{as those of the}} level of the sea, and eighteen feet have been added for the height of the Calcutta Observatory above the sea. I have introduced two standards of comparison where attainable; namely, 1. A few trigonometrical data, chiefly of positions around Dorjiling, measured by Lieutenant-Colonel Waugh, the Surveyor-General, also a few measured by Mr. Muller and myself, in which we can put full confidence: and, 2. A number of elevations in Sikkim and East Nepal, computed by simultaneous barometer observations, taken by Mr. Muller at Dorjiling. As the Dorjiling barometer was in bad repair, I do not place so much confidence in these comparisons as in those with Calcutta. The coincidence, however, between the mean of all the elevations computed by each method is very remarkable; the difference amounting to only thirty feet in ninety-three elevations; the excess being in favour of those worked by Dorjiling. As the Dorjiling observations were generally taken at night, or early in the morning, when the temperature is below the mean of the day, this excess in the resulting elevations would appear to prove, that the <b>temperature</b> <b>correction</b> derived from assuming the Calcutta observations to correspond with eighteen feet above the level of the sea at Sikkim, has not practically given rise to much error.|$|E
40|$|PhDIn {{this thesis}} {{some aspects of}} <b>temperature</b> <b>corrections</b> in string theory are analyzed: in particular, we study the thermal {{contributions}} to the 4 dimensional effective potential arising from string theory compactifications. String theory predicts that the spacetime has more than 4 dimensions; in particular, supersymmetric string theories are consistent only if the spacetime has 10 dimensions, 1 time plus 9 space directions. In order to describe the physics of our Universe with string theory we make 6 spatial directions very small, namely, we curl them into a 6 -dimensional space. The resulting 4 -dimensional theory depends on {{a large number of}} parameters which are massless scalar fields called moduli. The different values that the moduli can take represent both the possible deformations of the 6 - dimensional compact space and the values of the coupling constants and masses in the 4 -dimensional spacetime. Allowing them to have arbitrary values leads to a lack of predictability of various 4 D physical quantities, to a huge vacuum degeneracy and to unobserved long range fifth forces. In the thesis we review some methods established in the literature in order to fix the moduli values and hence to fix a particular geometry and we investigate how the inclusion of <b>temperature</b> <b>corrections</b> alter their values and affect the geometry of the compact space. The analysis seems to suggest that at least in the specific compactification scenarios considered in this thesis, <b>temperature</b> <b>corrections</b> do not alter substantially the zero temperature results.

In principle, this effective action {{can be added}} to the usual gauge action in simulations, reproducing the effects of closed fermion loops. Using lattice perturbation theory at finite temperature, we compute for staggered fermions the one-loop fermionic corrections to the spatial and temporal plaquette couplings as well as the leading Z_N symmetry breaking coupling. A. Hasenfratz and T. DeGrand have shown that β_c for dynamical staggered fermions can be accurately estimated by the formula β_c = β^ pure_c - Δβ_F where Δβ_F is the shift induced by the fermions at zero temperature. Numerical and analytical results indicate that the finite <b>temperature</b> <b>corrections</b> to the zero-temperature calculation of A. Hasenfratz and T. DeGrand are small for small values of κ = 1 2 m_F, but become significant for intermediate values of κ. The effect of these finite <b>temperature</b> <b>corrections</b> is to ruin the agreement of the Hasenfratz-DeGrand calculation with Monte Carlo data. We argue, however, that the finite <b>temperature</b> <b>corrections</b> are suppressed nonperturbatively at low temperatures, resolving this apparent disagreement.
