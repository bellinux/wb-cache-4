5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by <b>the</b> <b>incredibly</b> hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E

In an All-Union Tournament of First Category players at Gorky 1945, Furman posted his first {{noteworthy}} result when he tied for first with Konstantin Klaman, at 11/15. At Tula 1945, Furman placed second with 10½/14, behind only V. Lyublinsky. In the Leningrad Championship of 1946, Furman tied for 8th-9th places, with 8½/17. In the USSR Championship semi-final (URS-ch15 sf), Leningrad 1946, Furman was unsuccessful in advancing, but made a highly respectable score of 9/18, to tie for 9th-10th places. He was moving up slowly through <b>the</b> <b>incredibly</b> deep Soviet vanguard.|$|E
25|$|Hume {{also points}} out {{there is still a}} {{possibility}} that the universe could have been created by random chance but still show evidence of design as the universe is eternal and would have an infinite amount of time to be able to form a universe so complex and ordered as our own. He called that the 'Epicurean hypothesis'. It argued that when the universe was first created, the universe was random and chaotic, but if the universe is eternal, over an unlimited period of time, natural forces could have naturally 'evolved' by random particles coming together over time into <b>the</b> <b>incredibly</b> ordered system we can observe today without the need of an intelligent designer as an explanation.|$|E
25|$|Most numismatists {{agree that}} the first true numismatic {{collection}} was the Olympic Five and Ten Dollar coins for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. Starting in 1973, the RCM issued four coin sets (two five dollar coins and two ten dollar coins). At {{the behest of the}} Federal Government, led by then-Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, it was agreed that these coins would help finance while commemorate the 1976 Summer Olympics. The plan was to have thirty coins, twenty-eight silver coins with face values of $5 and $10, and two gold coins. Due to <b>the</b> <b>incredibly</b> high mintage (over 20 million coins were produced), these coins have no investment value whatsoever. Most of these coins today are usually sold for their silver content.|$|E

25|$|During the Sixth Dynasty (2345–2181 BCE), {{the power}} of pharaohs {{gradually}} weakened in favor of powerful nomarchs. These no longer belonged to the royal family and their charge became hereditary, thus creating local dynasties largely independent from the central authority of the pharaoh. Internal disorders set in during <b>the</b> <b>incredibly</b> long reign of Pepi II Neferkare (2278–2184 BCE) {{towards the end of}} the dynasty. His death, certainly well past that of his intended heirs, might have created succession struggles and the country slipped into civil wars mere decades after the close of Pepi II's reign. The final blow came when the 4.2 kiloyear event struck the region in the 22nd century BC, producing consistently low Nile flood levels. The result was the collapse of the Old Kingdom followed by decades of famine and strife.|$|E
25|$|This {{downward}} trend {{has been demonstrated}} by the conflicts between various agencies and levels of government. This has allowed wood traders to shop for export clearance among the authorities that regulate it. As {{a result of this}} bribery to open periodic trade windows, large-scale exports of illegal precious woods clear customs without much difficulty. Because of <b>the</b> <b>incredibly</b> lucrative nature of recent trades, reports have indicated that government officials have significantly increased the price of export certificates to make more money for themselves. This however has not stopped exporters from re-using single-use export certificates for two or three containers of rosewood. Furthermore, some of the certificates and authorizations from various government agencies bear titles found nowhere in any legal text, such as permis de ramassage and permis de carbonisation (collection permit and carbonization permit respectively). Such authorizations are not supported by and clearly conflict with Malagasy law.|$|E
25|$|Davydova {{also participated}} in the 1981 World Championships, her last major {{international}} event. The USSR won team gold. Davydova contributed more points towards the Soviet team score than anyone else. She {{finished third in the}} all-around final after an improper landing in the balance beam event. Had she not sat down on her beam dismount she would have won gold. Davydova suffered a serious neck injury in pre-competition warm up but still finished 3rd AA and was the only gymnast from any nation to make all 4 event finals. Davydova was the total points top scoring gymnast at the 1981 World Championships. She won silver on floor and bronze on bars. She would have won gold on vault but was unable to stand <b>the</b> <b>incredibly</b> difficult vault of her own invention, full twist on front tuck off. Jackie Fie, the US Head Judge on vault at the 81 World championships wrote that if the other vaults were to be marked out of 10 then Davydova's one should be scored out of 10.5. Davydova's vault was the pinnacle of the event. It was the most difficult vault of the competition – in either women's or men's gymnastics. Davydova {{is the only one who}} has done a vault that a male gymnast has not. Until Gabrielle Douglas 2015, she was the only IOC Olympic champion, since 1980, to have medalled in a World Championships after she had won the Olympic AA title.|$|E

500|$|Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), {{supervised}} by Stefen Fangmeier, created the film's 505 visual effects-shots. The filmmakers used as few digital effects as possible, though {{the train and}} smoke for the railroad crossing scene was entirely created using computer animation. ILM also used color grading techniques for the Lake Lachrymose scene, which required complete animation for the leeches. The digital animators studied footage of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season to accurately depict Hurricane Herman, which was ILM's most ambitious use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) for the film. Nexus Productions designed the opening [...] "Littlest Elf" [...] animated sequence by modeling it after stop motion animation and completing it with computer animation. The snakes at Uncle Monty's house were a combination of real snakes and animatronics. The animatronics, primarily <b>the</b> <b>Incredibly</b> Deadly Viper, were used as reference models that ILM later enhanced using CGI. Because working with infants was sometimes risky in producing a film, four scenes involving Sunny Baudelaire required CGI with motion capture technology. Among these are the shot of Sunny hanging on to a table by her teeth, catching a spindle with her mouth and the scene where she is entangled with <b>the</b> <b>Incredibly</b> Deadly Viper. Animation supervisor Colin Brady used his baby daughter for motion capture recording. A remote controlled animatronic of Sunny was also designed by Kevin Yagher.|$|E

500|$|Realism {{in films}} {{depicting}} lesbians developed further to include romance stories such as <b>The</b> <b>Incredibly</b> True Adventure of Two Girls in Love and When Night Is Falling, both in 1995, Better Than Chocolate (1999), {{and the social}} satire But I'm A Cheerleader in 2001. A twist on the lesbian-as-predator theme was the added complexity of motivations of some lesbian characters in Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures (1994), the Oscar-winning biopic of Aileen Wuornos, Monster (2003), and the exploration of fluent sexuality and gender in Chasing Amy (1997), Kissing Jessica Stein (2001), and Boys Don't Cry (1999). The film V for Vendetta shows a dictatorship in future Britain that forces lesbians, homosexuals, and other [...] "unwanted" [...] people in society to be systematically slaughtered in Nazi concentration camps. In the film, a lesbian actress named Valerie, {{who was killed in}} such a manner, serves as inspiration for the masked rebel V and his ally Evey Hammond, who set out to overthrow the dictatorship.|$|E

Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone described the clip as a [...] "revealingly down-to-earth tour" [...] of the singer's hometown. Similar sentiments were offered by Sydette Harry from the website Salon who {{referred to the}} video as a [...] "love letter" [...] to Houston. Rob Markman writing for MTV News wrote in his review that the video gave viewers a glimpse of Houston local culture.

[...] Fairall also pointed out that [...] " [...] might hint, at first, in the direction of some Blade Runner-esque sci-fi pathos, but Robyn turns it towards a canny meta-commentary on the fluid sense of authenticity that pervades 21st century pop stardom." [...] Fairall, however, thought that [...] "the verses are nothing more than an inventory of the titular ‘bot’s synthetic virtues." [...] Ben Norman of About.com selected the song as his favorite track on Body Talk Pt. 1, and wrote that [...] "'Fembot' is <b>the</b> <b>incredibly</b> quirky and well-written Robyn-rap track that needs to be heard to be believed."
