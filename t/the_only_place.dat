It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Few dinosaur remains {{have been}} found in Scandinavia. The {{mainland}} of western Denmark is an unlikely region to find dinosaur remains, since the Mesozoic sediments there are marine Maastrichtian chalk. Fossils of non-dinosaurian marine animals, including mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, {{have been found}} in these deposits. Mesozoic deposits in Scania, Sweden, are much richer in fossils, including those of dinosaurs. The Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea was part of the same land mass as Scania (the Scandinavian-Russian continent), and has a similar geology. The southwestern part of the island is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> in Denmark which has yielded dinosaur remains.|$|E

The European immigrants also created a market for cold cuts and cheeses, with three competing delicatessens on King George and Ben Yehuda Streets.

After resting, Wes is given access to the Relic Stone, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where he can purify Shadow Pokémon. After receiving an e-mail from Duking about Mt. battle being under attack by Cipher, Rui asks Eagun where it is and the two headed over there.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the mid-1930s, Orizaba {{often carried}} {{gold and silver}} bars from Veracruz to New York for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Chase National Bank, or for later {{transshipment}} to London. In October 1933 three short tons (2.7tonnes) of gold bars and coins were shipped on Orizaba for eventual delivery to London, prompting some to believe that gold was being smuggled into Mexico {{to take advantage of}} its policy of not charging duties on gold. In July 1934 Orizaba brought in 16cases of Mexican gold, and in January 1935, 20cases; in both instances, for delivery to Chase National Bank. Twice in 1935, the Ward liner delivered over 1,000bars of silver for the Federal Reserve Bank, bringing 1,390bars in March, and 1,933bars in July. Mexico was not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>place</b> from which Orizaba delivered precious metals.
