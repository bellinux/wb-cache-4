5|$|A key {{determinant}} of <b>the</b> <b>output</b> {{of the system}} is the conversion efficiency of the solar modules, which will depend in particular on the type of solar cell used.|$|E
5|$|A numerically {{controlled}} oscillator (NCO) is a digital signal generator which creates a synchronous (i.e. clocked), discrete-time, discrete-valued {{representation of a}} waveform, usually sinusoidal. NCOs are often {{used in conjunction with}} a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) at <b>the</b> <b>output</b> to create a direct digital synthesizer (DDS).|$|E
5|$|A voltage doubler is an {{electronic}} circuit which charges capacitors from the input voltage and switches these charges {{in such a}} way that, in the ideal case, exactly twice the voltage is produced at <b>the</b> <b>output</b> as at its input.|$|E
30|$|Not all <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of <b>the</b> congestion-contributing {{generators}} are curtailed. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of some generators are increased.

30|$|As a result, one {{of these}} two P-point RFFT is {{redundant}} which can be eliminated, while <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of <b>the</b> eliminated P-point RFFT can be obtained by simply conjugating <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of <b>the</b> retained P-point RFFT.|$|R
5|$|As a metal, {{beryllium}} is transparent to most {{wavelengths of}} X-rays and gamma rays, making it useful for <b>the</b> <b>output</b> windows of X-ray tubes {{and other such}} apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, <b>the</b> <b>output</b> cannot {{simply be}} {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and <b>the</b> <b>output</b> from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E
5|$|In general, data {{normalisation}} {{can help}} diminish {{the amount of}} experimental work and can increase the reliability of <b>the</b> <b>output,</b> and is suitable for both graphical and numerical analysis.|$|E

30|$|A {{reversible}} {{logic gate}} {{is one that has}} n input n output; with one-to-one mapping that means it determines <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> from <b>the</b> inputs. It also helps the inputs to be uniquely recovered or reconstructed from <b>the</b> <b>outputs.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the clique {{decision}} problem, {{the input}} is an undirected graph {{and a number}} , and <b>the</b> <b>output</b> is a Boolean value: true if the graph contains a -clique, and false otherwise.|$|E
5|$|In the maximal clique listing problem, {{the input}} is an undirected graph, and <b>the</b> <b>output</b> {{is a list}} of all its maximal cliques. The maximum clique problem may be solved using as a {{subroutine}} an algorithm for the maximal clique listing problem, because the maximum clique must be included among all the maximal cliques.|$|E
5|$|In {{the maximum}} clique problem, the input is an undirected graph, and <b>the</b> <b>output</b> is a maximum clique in the graph. If there are {{multiple}} maximum cliques, one of them may be chosen arbitrarily.|$|E
30|$|In {{the same}} wind farm, the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of different wind turbines is strongly correlated, the correlation coefficient is 1; and {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of different wind farms is mutually independent, the correlation coefficient is thus 0.|$|R
30|$|Similarly, in {{the same}} PV station, the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of different PV modules has a correlation coefficient of 1; {{and the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of different PV stations is mutually independent with correlation coefficient equal to 0.|$|R
30|$|Since integrators in a continuous-time {{control system}} serve as memory devices, <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of such integrators can be {{considered}} as the variables that define the internal state of the dynamic system. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> of integrators serve as state variables [17].|$|R

5|$|Most {{stations}} are sited {{within a few}} kilometres of a suitable grid connection point.

The project developer will normally have to absorb the cost of providing power lines to this point and making the connection; in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid, so it can accommodate <b>the</b> <b>output</b> from the plant.|$|E
5|$|Of the 20 bits {{allocated}} for each program instruction, 10 {{were used to}} hold the instruction code, which allowed for 1,024 (210) different instructions. The machine had 26 initially, increasing to 30 when the function codes to programmatically control the data transfer between the magnetic drum and the cathode ray tube (CRT) main store were added. On the Intermediary Version programs were input by key switches, and <b>the</b> <b>output</b> was displayed {{as a series of}} dots and dashes on a cathode ray tube known as <b>the</b> <b>output</b> device, just as on the SSEM from which the Mark 1 had been developed. However, the Final Specification machine, completed in October 1949, benefitted from the addition of a teleprinter with a 5-hole paper-tape reader and punch.|$|E

5|$|She {{has written}} that science, engineering, design and art should be more {{actively}} connected – with <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of each discipline serving as input for another.|$|E
5|$|Spurious {{products}} {{are the result}} of harmonic or non-harmonic distortion in the creation of <b>the</b> <b>output</b> waveform due to non-linear numerical effects in the signal processing chain. Only numerical errors are covered here. For other distortion mechanisms created in the digital-to-analog converter see the corresponding section in the direct-digital synthesizer article.|$|E
30|$|By {{establishing}} {{the transfer function}} of the parallel inverters controlled by the close-loop adjustment of the instantaneous voltage feedback, {{the influence of the}} parameters of the close-loop feedback circuit to the inhibition effects to <b>the</b> <b>outputting</b> circulation current are observed. As the increasing of the parallel inductance, the filter inductor and the equivalent circuit resistance, the inhibition effect of <b>the</b> <b>outputting</b> circulation current are more obvious. However, the drop and <b>the</b> <b>outputting</b> waveform distortion of the voltage should be greater when the parameters of the parallel inductance, the filter inductor and the equivalent circuit resistance are selected as high enough. Furthermore, the inhibition effect of <b>the</b> <b>outputting</b> circulation current is mainly adjusted by the regulator of the instantaneous voltage feedback.|$|R
30|$|In the {{established}} simulation model of parallel inverter system, the harmonic distortion rate at <b>the</b> <b>outputting</b> voltage frequency values of 4, 10, 20, 41 and 50  Hz are calculated to verify inhibition effects of <b>the</b> <b>outputting</b> circulation current by the close-loop controller of the instantaneous voltage feedback. The harmonic distortion rate are all low than 2.32  % of the controlled by <b>the</b> instantaneous <b>outputting</b> voltage feedback.|$|R
30|$|By {{comparing}} {{the results from}} Figs.  9 and 10, the using of <b>the</b> instantaneous <b>outputting</b> voltage feedback method effectively inhibits the harmonic circulating current at different frequencies. When <b>the</b> <b>outputting</b> voltage is 4  Hz, the harmonic distortion rate of <b>the</b> <b>outputting</b> voltage is 5.05  % under the open-loop state, but the harmonic distortion rate is 2.32  % of the controlled by <b>the</b> instantaneous <b>outputting</b> voltage feedback. When the frequency increases, the harmonic distortion decreases. The harmonic distortion rate reaches the minimum value at frequency 50  Hz.|$|R
5|$|The {{heterodyne}} technique {{is used for}} (1) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input signal (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1+f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1−f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically {{only one of the}} new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of the mixer. <b>The</b> <b>output</b> signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} technology, the centrifuge, failed, but {{electromagnetic}} separation, gaseous diffusion, and thermal diffusion technologies were all successful {{and contributed to}} the project.

5|$|There are {{two primary}} {{alternatives}} for configuring this conversion equipment; centralised and string inverters, although {{in some cases}} individual, or micro-inverters are used. Single inverters allows optimizing <b>the</b> <b>output</b> of each panel, and multiple inverters increases the reliability by limiting the loss of output when an inverter fails.|$|E
