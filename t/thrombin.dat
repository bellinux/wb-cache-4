5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into <b>thrombin.</b> <b>Thrombin</b> is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates fibrin from fibrinogen, and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, factor XI, factor V and factor VIII, TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates <b>thrombin,</b> factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits factor Xa).|$|E
5|$|In some rare cases, {{a single}} amino acid {{change in a}} serpin's RCL alters its {{specificity}} to target the wrong protease. For example, the Antitrypsin-Pittsburgh mutation (M358R) causes the α1-antitrypsin serpin to inhibit <b>thrombin,</b> causing a bleeding disorder.|$|E
5|$|Most serpins are {{protease}} inhibitors, targeting extracellular, chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. These proteases {{possess a}} nucleophilic serine residue in a catalytic triad in their active site. Examples include <b>thrombin,</b> trypsin, and human neutrophil elastase. Serpins act as irreversible, suicide inhibitors by trapping an intermediate of the protease's catalytic mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Tests for thrombophilia include {{complete}} {{blood count}} (with examination of the blood film), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombodynamics test, <b>thrombin</b> time and reptilase time, lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody, activated protein C resistance, fibrinogen tests, factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation, and basal homocysteine levels. Testing may {{be more or less}} extensive depending on clinical judgement and abnormalities detected on initial evaluation.|$|E
5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate <b>thrombin,</b> thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of <b>thrombin</b> and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to <b>thrombin,</b> followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
25|$|Increased <b>thrombin</b> {{inhibition}} {{requires the}} minimal heparin pentasaccharide {{plus at least}} an additional 13 monomeric units. This {{is thought to be}} due to a requirement that antithrombin and <b>thrombin</b> must bind to the same heparin chain adjacent to each other. This {{can be seen in the}} series of models shown in Figure 5.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory that}} <b>thrombin</b> is {{generated}} {{by the presence of}} tissue factor was consolidated by Paul Morawitz in 1905. At this stage, it was known that thrombokinase/thromboplastin (factor III) is released by damaged tissues, reacting with prothrombin (II), which, together with calcium (IV), forms <b>thrombin,</b> which converts fibrinogen into fibrin (I).|$|E
25|$|Subgroup IIb - Decreased <b>thrombin</b> {{inactivation}} {{and normal}} heparin affinity.|$|E
25|$|FVII {{is itself}} {{activated}} by <b>thrombin,</b> FXIa, FXII and FXa.|$|E
25|$|Subgroup IIa - Decreased <b>thrombin</b> inactivation, {{decreased}} factor Xa inactivation {{and decreased}} heparin affinity.|$|E
25|$|Subgroup IIc - Normal <b>thrombin</b> {{inactivation}}, normal factor Xa inactivation {{and decreased}} heparin affinity.|$|E
25|$|FXa and its co-factor FVa {{form the}} {{prothrombinase}} complex, which activates prothrombin to <b>thrombin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tissue factor also binds {{to factor}} VII in the blood, which initiates the {{extrinsic}} coagulation cascade to increase <b>thrombin</b> production. <b>Thrombin</b> {{is a potent}} platelet activator, acting through Gq and G12. These are G protein coupled receptors and they turn on calcium mediated signaling pathways within the platelet, overcoming the baseline calcium efflux. Families of three G proteins (Gq, Gi, G12) operate together for full activation. <b>Thrombin</b> also promotes secondary fibrin-reinforcement of the platelet plug. Platelet activation in turn degranulates and releases factor V and fibrinogen, potentiating the coagulation cascade. So in reality the process of platelet plugging and coagulation are occurring simultaneously rather than sequentially, with each inducing the other to form the final clot.|$|E
25|$|Antithrombin is a serine {{protease}} inhibitor (serpin) that degrades the {{serine protease}}s: <b>thrombin,</b> FIXa, FXa, FXIa, and FXIIa. It is constantly active, but its adhesion to these factors is increased {{by the presence}} of heparan sulfate (a glycosaminoglycan) or the administration of heparins (different heparinoids increase affinity to FXa, <b>thrombin,</b> or both). Quantitative or qualitative deficiency of antithrombin (inborn or acquired, e.g., in proteinuria) leads to thrombophilia.|$|E
25|$|Upon binding to this {{pentasaccharide}} sequence, {{inhibition of}} protease activity is increased by heparin {{as a result}} of two distinct mechanisms. In one mechanism heparin stimulation of Factor IXa and Xa inhibition depends on a conformational change within antithrombin involving the reactive site loop and is thus allosteric. In another mechanism stimulation of <b>thrombin</b> inhibition depends on the formation of a ternary complex between AT-III, <b>thrombin,</b> and heparin.|$|E
25|$|Excess {{circulating}} <b>thrombin</b> {{results from}} the excess activation of the coagulation cascade. The excess <b>thrombin</b> cleaves fibrinogen, which ultimately leaves behind multiple fibrin clots in the circulation. These excess clots trap platelets to become larger clots, which leads to microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis. This lodging of clots in the microcirculation, in the large vessels, and in the organs is what leads to the ischemia, impaired organ perfusion, and end-organ damage that occurs with DIC.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to interacting with vWF and fibrin, platelets interact with <b>thrombin,</b> Factors X, Va, VIIa, XI, IX, and prothrombin to complete clot formation via the coagulation cascade.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thrombin</b> then {{activates}} {{other components}} of the coagulation cascade, including FV and FVIII (which forms a complex with FIX), and activates and releases FVIII from being bound to vWF.|$|E
25|$|Any {{inflammatory}} process, such as trauma, {{surgery or}} infection, can cause {{damage to the}} endothelial lining of the vessel's wall. The main mechanism is exposure of tissue factor to the blood coagulation system. Inflammatory and other stimuli (such as hypercholesterolemia) can lead to changes in gene expression in endothelium producing to a pro-thrombotic state. When this occurs, endothelial cells downregulate substances such as thrombomodulin, which is a key modulator of <b>thrombin</b> activity. The end result is a sustained activation of <b>thrombin</b> and reduced production of protein C and tissue factor inhibitor, which furthers the pro-thrombotic state.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of having}} platelets, non-mammalian {{vertebrates}} have thrombocytes, {{which have a}} nucleus and resemble B lymphocytes in morphology. They aggregate in response to <b>thrombin,</b> but not to ADP, serotonin, nor adrenaline, as platelets do.|$|E
25|$|Antithrombin inactivates its {{physiological}} target enzymes, <b>Thrombin,</b> Factor Xa and Factor IXa with rate constants of 7–11 x 103, 2.5 x 103 M−1 s−1 and 1 x 10 M−1 s−1 respectively. The rate of antithrombin-thrombin inactivation {{increases to}} 1.5 - 4 x 107 M−1 s−1 {{in the presence}} of heparin, i.e. the reaction is accelerated 2000-4000 fold. Factor Xa inhibition is accelerated by only 500 to 1000 fold {{in the presence of}} heparin and the maximal rate constant is 10 fold lower than that of <b>thrombin</b> inhibition. The rate enhancement of antithrombin-Factor IXa inhibition shows an approximate 1 million fold enhancement in the presence of heparin and physiological levels of calcium.|$|E
25|$|The {{antifibrinolytic}} agents epsilon amino {{caproic acid}} and tranexamic acid are useful adjuncts {{in the management}} of vWD complicated by clinical hemorrhage. The use topical <b>thrombin</b> JMI and topical Tisseel VH are effective adjuncts for correction of hemorrhage from wounds.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{adsorbent}} chemicals, such as zeolites, {{and other}} hemostatic agents {{are also used}} for sealing severe injuries quickly (such as in traumatic bleeding secondary to gunshot wounds). <b>Thrombin</b> and fibrin glue are used surgically to treat bleeding and to thrombose aneurysms.|$|E
25|$|Under homeostatic conditions, {{the body}} is {{maintained}} in a finely tuned balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The activation of the coagulation cascade yields <b>thrombin</b> that converts fibrinogen to fibrin; the stable fibrin clot being the final product of hemostasis. The fibrinolytic system then functions to break down fibrinogen and fibrin. Activation of the fibrinolytic system generates plasmin (in the presence of <b>thrombin),</b> {{which is responsible for}} the lysis of fibrin clots. The breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin results in polypeptides called fibrin degradation products (FDPs) or fibrin split products (FSPs). In a state of homeostasis, the presence of plasmin is critical, as it is the central proteolytic enzyme of coagulation and is also necessary for the breakdown of clots, or fibrinolysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} of coagulation in two pathways is mainly artificial, it originates from laboratory tests in which clotting times were measured after the clotting was initiated by glass (intrinsic pathway) or by thromboplastin (a mix of tissue factor and phospholipids). In fact <b>thrombin</b> is present {{from the very}} beginning, already when platelets are making the plug. <b>Thrombin</b> has a large array of functions, not only the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the building block of a hemostatic plug. In addition, {{it is the most}} important platelet activator {{and on top of that}} it activates Factors VIII and V and their inhibitor protein C (in the presence of thrombomodulin), and it activates Factor XIII, which forms covalent bonds that crosslink the fibrin polymers that form from activated monomers.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulants and anti-platelet {{agents are}} amongst the most {{commonly}} used medications. Anti-platelet agents include aspirin, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel; the parenteral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are used during angioplasty. Of the anticoagulants, warfarin (and related coumarins) and heparin are {{the most commonly}} used. Warfarin affects the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) and protein C and protein S, whereas heparin and related compounds increase the action of antithrombin on <b>thrombin</b> and factor Xa. A newer class of drugs, the direct <b>thrombin</b> inhibitors, is under development; some members are already in clinical use (such as lepirudin). Also under development are other small molecular compounds that interfere directly with the enzymatic action of particular coagulation factors (e.g., rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban).|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that {{protease}} enzymes become trapped in inactive antithrombin-protease complexes {{as a consequence of}} their attack on the reactive bond. Although attacking a similar bond within the normal protease substrate results in rapid proteolytic cleavage of the substrate, initiating an attack on the antithrombin reactive bond causes antithrombin to become activated and trap the enzyme at an intermediate stage of the proteolytic process. Given time, <b>thrombin</b> is able to cleave the reactive bond within antithrombin and an inactive antithrombin-thrombin complex will dissociate, however the time it takes for this to occur may be greater than 3 days. However bonds P3-P4 and P1'-P2' can be rapidly cleaved by neutrophil elastase and the bacterial enzyme thermolysin respectively, resulting in inactive antithrombins no longer able to inhibit <b>thrombin</b> activity.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme reptilase (batroxobin), {{derived from}} this snake's venom, {{is used in}} modern medical {{laboratories}} to measure fibrinogen levels and blood coagulation capability. The test {{is considered to be}} a replacement for <b>thrombin</b> time, and is used when heparin is present in the sample. The enzyme is unaffected by heparin.|$|E
25|$|P-selectins: P-selectin is {{expressed}} on activated endothelial cells and platelets. Synthesis of P-selectin can be induced by <b>thrombin,</b> leukotriene B4, complement fragment C5a, histamine, TNFα or LPS. These cytokines induce the externalisation of Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells, presenting pre-formed P-selectins on the endothelial cell surface. P-selectins bind PSGL-1 as a ligand.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though it}} is present at only 5–10% the levels of α-antithrombin, due to its {{increased}} heparin affinity, {{it is thought that}} β-antithrombin is more important than α-antithrombin in controlling thrombogenic events resulting from tissue injury. Indeed, <b>thrombin</b> inhibition after injury to the aorta has been attributed solely to β-antithrombin.|$|E
25|$|Factor VIII {{is bound}} to vWF while {{inactive}} in circulation; factor VIII degrades rapidly when not bound to vWF. Factor VIII is released from vWF {{by the action of}} <b>thrombin.</b> In the absence of vWF, factor VIII has a half-life of 1-2 hours; when carried by intact vWF, factor VIII has a half-life of 8-12 hours.|$|E
25|$|Antithrombin {{begins in}} its native state, {{which has a}} higher free energy {{compared}} to the latent state, which it decays to on average after 3 days. The latent state has the same form as the activated state - that is, when it is inhibiting <b>thrombin.</b> As such it {{is a classic example}} of the utility of kinetic vs thermodynamic control of protein folding.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of TEV protease has been solved by X-ray crystallography. It {{is composed of}} two β-barrels and a flexible C-terminal tail and displays structural homology to the chymotrypsin superfamily of proteases (PA clan, C4 family by MEROPS classification). Although homologous to cellular serine proteases (such as trypsin, elastase, <b>thrombin</b> etc.), TEV protease uses a cysteine as its catalytic nucleophile (as do many other viral proteases).|$|E
25|$|Digestive proteases {{are part}} of many laundry {{detergents}} and are also used extensively in the bread industry in bread improver. A variety of proteases are used medically both for their native function (e.g. controlling blood clotting) or for completely artificial functions (e.g. for the targeted degradation of pathogenic proteins). Highly specific proteases such as TEV protease and <b>thrombin</b> are commonly used to cleave fusion proteins and affinity tags in a controlled fashion.|$|E
