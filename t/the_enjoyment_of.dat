5|$|Australia {{defeated}} South Africa 4–0 {{and senior}} {{players such as}} Bill O'Reilly were pointed in their comments about <b>the</b> <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> playing under Richardson's captaincy. A group of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour. For some, the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting, as was the knowledge that he would additionally be sitting in judgement of their abilities {{in his role as}} a selector.|$|E
5|$|Jain texts mention five transgressions (Atichara) of the vow: {{the desire}} to be reborn as a human, {{the desire to}} be reborn as a divinity, the desire to {{continue}} living, the desire to die quickly, and the desire to live a sensual life in the next life.

She taught him {{a great deal of}} botany and awakened in him <b>the</b> <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> {{the look and feel of}} plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.|$|E
5|$|The best {{interests}} of society require that causes of action should not be deferred an unreasonable time. This remark is peculiarly applicable to land titles. Nothing so much retards the growth and prosperity of a country as insecurity of titles to real estate. Labor is paralysed where <b>the</b> <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> its fruits is uncertain; and litigation without limit produces ruinous consequences to individuals.|$|E

5|$|Buildings {{from most}} of the {{architectural}} periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for <b>the</b> <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church.|$|E

The Clan Maclachlan Society {{consists}} of eight branches around the world, including Australia, Britain & Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States of America. The Lachlan Trust is a registered Scottish charitable organisation which takes donations to preserve the heritage of Clan Maclachlan. The trust, in part with Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund, helped raise £100,000 {{for the preservation of}} Kilmorie Chapel, the traditional burying place of the chiefs. The project was completed in 2006, as a memorial to the twenty-fourth chief (the present chief's mother). Further funding from Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund has since been approved for the conservation of the old castle and {{the construction of a new}} footbridge over the River Lachlan. Work began in the spring of 2013 with the erection of scaffolding around the west corner of the old castle. The plan is to develop the site for <b>the</b> <b>enjoyment</b> <b>of</b> visitors, with improved pathways, a nature trail and information points about the heritage of the area.|$|E
