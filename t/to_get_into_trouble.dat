500|$|On April 8 or 12, the {{government}} capitulated. Low's Alberta Social Credit Act delivered what the insurgents wanted, including {{the creation of}} [...] "Alberta credit" [...] {{in the amount of}} [...] "the unused capacity of industries and people of Alberta to produce wanted goods and services", the establishment of [...] "credit houses" [...] to distribute this credit, {{and the creation of a}} Social Credit Board. The bill was passed, and the insurgents were placated, though Brown warned during a cross-province speaking tour that they were determined to see social credit implemented, and [...] "if anyone gets in our way, he's going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble...</b> we must choose between principles and party, between Social Credit and Premier Aberhart." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2012, Anthony and Tyler get {{involved}} with criminal Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Of this storyline Lapinksas said, [...] "I loved the challenge. Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble,</b> so as we saw, he was trying his best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice that we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Knievel left Butte High School {{after his}} sophomore year and {{got a job in}} the copper mines as a diamond drill {{operator}} with the Anaconda Mining Company, but he preferred motorbiking to what he called [...] "unimportant stuff".

[...] Knievel was fired when he made the earth mover do a motorcycle-type wheelie and drove it into Butte's main power line, leaving the city without electricity for several hours.

2500|$|Around age eleven, Mary Albert {{moved to}} a one-room house on Perdido Street with Louis, her {{daughter}} Lucy, and her common-law husband, Tom Lee. They lived next door to Mary Albert's brother Ike and his two sons. After {{dropping out of the}} Fisk School in 1912, Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money. He also started <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble.</b> Cornet player Bunk Johnson said he taught Armstrong (then 11) to play by ear at Dago Tony's Tonk in New Orleans, although in his later years Armstrong gave the credit to Oliver. Armstrong hardly looked back at his youth as the worst of times but drew inspiration from it instead: [...] "Every time I close my eyes blowing that trumpet of mine—I look right in the heart of good old New Orleans... It has given me something to live for." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the January 4, 2010, special live, three-hour Monday night {{edition of}} Impact! Hogan made his debut in TNA, and Scott Hall and Sean Waltman made {{their return to}} the company to greet him. Nash, Hall and Waltman quickly {{reformed}} their alliance, but Hogan kept {{himself out of the}} group, claiming that times have changed. At Genesis in their first match back together Nash and Syxx-Pac, who replaced Scott Hall in the match, were defeated by Beer Money, Inc. On the February 4 episode of Impact!, Hall and Syxx-Pac turned on Nash. At Destination X Nash and Young faced Hall and Syxx-Pac in a tag team match, where The Band's TNA futures were on the line. Nash turned on Young and helped the Band pick up the victory, which finally gave them contracts with the company. On the March 29 episode of Impact!, Nash offered Young a spot in the Band, claiming that what happened in Destination X was just business and nothing personal. Young refused the offer and in the main event of the evening, teamed up with Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy to defeat the Band in a six-man tag team steel cage match. Nash gained a measure of revenge on Young by defeating him in a steel cage match at Lockdown. Later in the night, Nash replaced Syxx-Pac, who no-showed the event, and teamed up with Hall in a St. Louis Street Fight, where they were defeated by Team 3D. On the May 3 episode of Impact!, Eric Young turned on Team 3D and joined The Band. On May 4, at the tapings of the May 13 episode of Impact!, after TNA World Tag Team Champion Matt Morgan had been attacked by Samoa Joe, Nash cashed in his [...] "Feast or Fired" [...] contract, teaming with Hall, and pinned him to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Nash later named Young one third of the champions under the Freebird rule. At the June 14 tapings of the June 17 episode of Impact!, The Band was stripped of the Tag Team Championship, due to Scott Hall's legal problems. The following day it was reported that Hall had been released from his contract with TNA. On the June 24 episode of Impact!, Nash and Young decided to part ways, as Nash intended to go after Hogan, whom he blamed for what had happened to Hall and Waltman, and didn't want Young <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble</b> for it.|$|E
