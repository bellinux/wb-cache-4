5|$|A Ellis {{had not yet}} reached <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> be {{replaced}} by an extra attacker (he even attempted to return to stop the puck) and thus the goal was credited as an official goal against Ellis, {{as opposed to an}} empty-net goal.|$|E
5|$|Nash has {{a medical}} {{condition}} called spondylolisthesis, which causes muscle tightness and back pain. Due to the condition, {{when he is not}} playing in basketball games, he lies on his back rather than sitting on <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> keep his muscles from stiffening.|$|E
5|$|After {{coming off}} <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> record 101 rushing yards in his initial NFL action at New England, {{he ran for}} 106 yards and {{registered}} 104 receiving yards in his first professional start against Oakland. In the Chiefs' October 18, 1981 game against the Denver Broncos, Delaney broke loose for a 75-yard touchdown run, but an offside penalty caused the play to be restarted from five yards back. On the second play after the penalty, Delaney scored an 82-yard touchdown, the longest rushing play from scrimmage in the 1981 NFL season.|$|E

50|$|A few benches under a {{chestnut}} tree, the ivy {{hanging from}} the surrounding façades makes the space a lush, relaxed spot. During summers, a network of storytellers gather around <b>the</b> <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> tell their stories both to enthusiasts and passers-by.|$|R
5|$|Andy (Ian Gomez) {{discovers that}} a {{photograph}} of Jules on an advertising bench has been defaced, so he, Bobby (Brian Van Holt) and Grayson stake out <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> catch the culprit. Grayson quickly realises that Bobby defaced the bench; Bobby confides in Grayson that he's not entirely comfortably yet with Grayson's and Jules' relationship, but insists that their friendship is still close.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{disputes}} over the refereeing, the goal judges on several occasions did not turn on the red light indicating a goal after a Canadian score. After Henderson's goal in game seven, Sinden sent the entire team off <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> ensure the goal was counted. A similar incident during game eight led to the melee that Eagleson was involved in.|$|E
5|$|Cave 19 is a cell {{without a}} front wall and a bench {{runs along the}} left wall. The ceiling shows signs of a dressed stone or wooden screen from the right wall {{to the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b> <b>To</b> the right is a small cell in the same roof, {{probably}} connected with cave 19. The small cell has a bench along its right wall and the grooved doorway. The cave has two cisterns.|$|E

60|$|In the {{meantime}} the people {{came down from}} <b>the</b> <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> congratulate <b>the</b> life-savers, and for fully an hour the two were forced to remain there listening to words of praise which they felt were not warranted by their exploit on the creek.|$|R
60|$|Rollo and Carlos {{sat down}} upon one of <b>the</b> <b>benches</b> <b>to</b> wait; but <b>the</b> little minute {{proved to be}} nearly half an hour. They were not tired of waiting, however, {{there was so much}} to amuse and {{interest}} them going on in the room.|$|R
5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E
5|$|Rick Neuheisel {{came off}} <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> lead the Chargers to three second-half scores. Partly {{based on this}} performance, the Buccaneers later signed Neuheisel as a backup quarterback. Although many veteran NFL players crossed the picket line during the week, the Buccaneers were one of only six teams to have no players cross. More than 1,000 area union members joined the Buccaneers regulars in {{picketing}} the game, with some fans tearing up their tickets and joining them.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, Holroyd {{joined his}} {{hometown}} club, Conference National side Macclesfield Town, on loan until January 2013. He made a scoring debut for the club, coming off <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> score {{with his first}} touch in a 3–2 win against Lincoln City. In the fourth appearance of his loan spell, Holroyd scored a hat-trick as Macclesfield defeated Stockport County 4–3 at Edgeley Park. Holroyd scored his fifth goal for Macclesfield in a 2–2 away draw with Gateshead, coming on as a substitute and equalising late-on. He went on to score nine times in 23 appearances during the five-month loan spell, including two goals in a 4–1 FA Cup victory over Barrow that ensured Macclesfield progressed to {{the third round of}} the competition.|$|E

5|$|In September 2007 Evans {{came off}} <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> make his senior debut in City’s 1–0 League Cup victory against Norwich City. With first choice {{opportunities}} at City limited Evans moved on loan to Norwich City in November of that year, agreeing a deal until 1 January 2008. He made his debut for Norwich {{the following week}} when he came on as a substitute in the 3–1 victory over Blackpool. His first goal for the club came two games later, and just two minutes into his first start in a 2–1 victory over Plymouth Argyle {{at the start of}} December. Evans returned to Manchester City after his initial loan deal expired in January 2008, having made eight appearances and scored two goals.|$|E
5|$|Shearer {{was awarded}} a {{testimonial}} match by the club, against Scottish-side Celtic. All proceeds of the match went to charitable causes. Because of the injury he sustained three games earlier at Sunderland, Shearer was unable {{to play in the}} whole match; however he kicked-off the game and came off <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> score a penalty, winning the game 3–2. The match was a sell-out, and saw Shearer perform a lap of honour at the end with his family, with his young son notably covering his ears due to the volume of noise produced by the crowd in tribute.|$|E
5|$|The Blazers then {{faced the}} Dallas Mavericks {{in the first}} round of the 2011 NBA Playoffs. Roy shot 1-for-8 the first 2 games, {{including}} a Game 2 where he saw only 8 minutes of playing time and went scoreless. The Blazers lost both games and trailed 0–2 in the series. He expressed his frustration about being the last substitution during the first 2 quarters, and playing for 8 minutes after getting 26 minutes in Game 1. The series then went to Portland, and Roy scored 16 points in 23 minutes off <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> boost the Blazers to a 97–92 Game 3 win.|$|E

5|$|With {{running back}} James Wilder nursing a bruised sternum, Nathan Wonsley rushed for 138 {{yards and two}} touchdowns. Wonsley became the first Buccaneer running back, other than Wilder, to rush for 100 yards since Nov. 29, 1981. He was the first Tampa Bay rookie to rush for 100 yards since Jerry Eckwood in 1979. Wonsley {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} his two older brothers, George and Otis, both backup NFL running backs who came off <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> have breakout games while leading their respective teams to victory against the Lions. Constant Buccaneer blitzes resulted in four sacks, two interceptions, and six forced fumbles. Although Lions quarterback Eric Hipple had a good statistical day, completing 31 passes for 318 yards, the Tampa Bay defense's pressure prevented him from converting his opportunities into points. The win broke Tampa Bay's 19-game road losing streak.|$|E
5|$|A blocked {{field goal}} and extra-point attempt {{provided}} {{the margin of}} victory for the Miami Dolphins. Ex-Dolphin receiver Morris Owens came back to haunt his old team with three touchdown catches. Starting quarterback Parnell Dickinson threw the first, then was replaced by recently acquired quarterback Terry Hanratty after injuring his ankle. When Hanratty proved ineffective, Steve Spurrier, who had not practiced during the week due to a swollen knee, came off <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> throw the final two touchdowns. It took a final-minute, 55-yard Garo Yepremian field goal to clinch the game for the Dolphins, whose pass defense had been decimated by injuries. 192 of the Buccaneers’ 334 total yards came through the air. John McKay would later point to this game as {{the high point of}} the Buccaneers’ season. Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti saw it differently, calling the narrow victory “a disgrace” and “the low point in Miami Dolphins’ history”.|$|E
5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} league debut {{on the opening}} day of the season in a 4–4 draw with Rennes. He scored his first goal for Les Marseillais in that match. He {{continued}} in form scoring six times in his first 11 matches. However, his reputation for controversy continued to haunt him when he was involved in another dispute, this time with the Cameroon international Modeste M'bami during a warm up session ahead of the club's UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool. The two had to be separated by Ronald Zubar. Controversy arose again following Marseille's 4–2 loss to Le Classique rivals Paris-Saint Germain. He drew the ire of manager Eric Gerets after his refusal to leave <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> warm up. Ben Arfa later said he was injured much to the chagrin of Gerets, but later apologized for the incident to the media and Gerets himself. Upon his return to the squad, Ben Arfa responded by scoring a goal and providing the assists on both the other goals in a 3–1 victory over Saint-Étienne.|$|E

5|$|Despite Messi's {{individual}} form, Barcelona's four-year {{cycle of}} success under Guardiola – {{one of the}} greatest eras in the club's history – drew to an end. Although Barcelona won the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao on 25 May, its 14th title of that period, the team had lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Chelsea, with Messi sending a crucial second-leg penalty kick against the crossbar. In Barça's last home league match on 5 May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> embrace Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager. He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, an all-time La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed Gerd Müller's 67 goals in the 1972–73 Bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football.|$|E
5|$|Friday {{made his}} debut for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against Bromley, coming off <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> set up Walthamstow's equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against Tooting & Mitcham he once again {{appeared}} as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west London club Hayes in December 1971 after scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League match. Hayes offered £30 per week, and were also based closer {{to his home in}} Acton. A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a roof in Lambeth, a hoist rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on. The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike: the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung. Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972.|$|E
5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> <b>to</b> average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
