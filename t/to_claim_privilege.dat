40|$|Evidence {{subject to}} the attorney-client {{privilege}} is protected against compelled discovery or disclosure. However, the privilege can be waived if the client who holds the privilege (or the attorney acting on his behalf) fails <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> the <b>privilege</b> or voluntarily discloses {{the subject matter of}} the privileged communication. This Section discusses the law governing privilege waiver by voluntary disclosure or failure <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> the <b>privilege...</b>|$|R

5000|$|While the Upjohn {{decision}} did {{not explicitly}} mention a warning procedure, the case {{gave rise to}} a procedure called an [...] "Upjohn warning," [...] in which a companys lawyer explains that the lawyer represents the company and not the individual employee with whom the lawyer is dealing. This is intended to ensure that the employee understands that the company can waive the attorney-client privilege at any time and disclose the contents of the conversation between the lawyer and the employee, even if the employee objects. In subsequent cases, failure to give an Upjohn warning has led to the employee being able <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>privilege</b> over communications with company lawyers.|$|E
50|$|The {{common law}} {{maintains}} {{a distinction between}} two limbs of legal professional privilege. Advice privilege refers {{to the protection of}} communications between a client and a lawyer {{for the purposes of the}} lawyer providing legal advice to the client. Litigation privilege refers to the protection of communications between a client, lawyer (and any third party) for the dominant purpose of anticipated or existing legal proceedings. The prior test of 'sole purpose,' as per Grant v Downs, limited a lawyer's ability <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>privilege</b> on items that were not for the exclusive purpose of the client's case. The current dominant purpose test, while more complex, significantly broadens the scope of legal professional privilege, as defined in Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation. There is, invariably, much overlap between the two limbs.|$|E

2500|$|Neville's father-in-law, Sir Humphrey Stafford (c.1426/7 [...] 8 July 1486) of Grafton, Worcestershire, was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} of King Richard III. After Richard's defeat at Bosworth, Stafford and Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell, fled to sanctuary at Colchester. In April 1486 {{they attempted to}} stir up rebellion against the new King, Henry VII, with Stafford trying to raise forces in the West Midlands, and Lovell in Yorkshire. When the rebellion collapsed, on 11 May 1486 Stafford again fled to sanctuary, this time at Culham, but was not allowed <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> the <b>privilege,</b> and {{for his part in}} the insurrection was executed at Tyburn on 8 July 1486.|$|R
40|$|The {{most obvious}} {{way for a}} {{corporation}} to resist compulsory production of documents that contain evidence of potential misconduct is <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> that production may tend to incriminate the company. Until recently, {{it was assumed that}} corporations were entitled <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> the <b>privilege</b> against self-incrimination; the High Court never having expressed a conclusive opinion on the question. In EPA v Caltex, however, a narrow majority of the Court held that the focus of the privilege is to prevent abuses of personal freedoms and individual human rights, and therefore, that the privilege has no application to corporate entities. It also endorsed a wide interpretation of statutory powers to compel production. This note examines the Caltex decision and assesses its implications for white-collar crime investigation and enforcement...|$|R
40|$|Many lawyers {{believe that}} ethical duties of {{confidentiality}} and zealousness {{require them to}} assert attorney-client privilege as aggressively as they assert a criminal defendant’s lack of guilt. They treat client information {{as if it is}} “privileged until proven unprivileged,” even though it is the claimant of privilege that has the evidentiary burden of showing that all the legal elements of privilege are met. Ordinarily, the adversary system works well to expose and control frivolous <b>claims,</b> but challenges <b>to</b> frivolous <b>claims</b> of <b>privilege</b> face unique obstacles. Challengers must operate “in the dark,” without the detailed knowledge of the communication needed to determine whether it really is privileged and whether its strategic value justifies the expense of opposition. This has made it easy and advantageous for lawyers <b>to</b> make frivolous <b>claims</b> of attorney-client <b>privilege,</b> despite the threat of court-imposed sanctions. Such abusive <b>claims</b> of <b>privilege</b> decrease the quality of justice by preventing consideration of relevant evidence and increase the cost of litigation by forcing expensive collateral litigation around <b>privilege</b> <b>claims.</b> The strategic advantage of frivolous <b>claims</b> of <b>privilege</b> combined with the inadequacy of the adversary system to discover and sanction such claims suggests that the rules of ethics could serve as a counter-balance. Yet, our existing ethical rules actually seem to encourage lawyers to make frivolous, “knee-jerk” <b>claims</b> of <b>privilege</b> by emphasizing the ethical duties of confidentiality and zealous representation. Against this, I argue that a limit <b>to</b> <b>claims</b> of attorney-client <b>privilege</b> should be understood as implicit in the existing Model Rules of Attorney-Client Privilege and that explicit ethical limits of the kind proposed in the article will not undermine confidentiality. However, an effective ethical limit requires that useful guidance about what constitutes a frivolous <b>claim</b> of <b>privilege</b> can be provided. I condense an analysis of cases in which lawyers have been either legally sanctioned or ethically disciplined for making such claims into a proposed added Comment to Model Rule 3. 1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions) ...|$|R

No. 169777, 20 April 2006). For its part, the Senate Committees argued that they did not exceed their authority in issuing the assailed orders because there is no valid justification for Neri's <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> executive <b>privilege.</b> In addition, they claimed that the refusal of petitioner to answer the three questions violates the people’s right to public information, and that the executive is using the concept of executive privilege as a means to conceal the criminal act of bribery in the highest levels of government.|$|R

40|$|Focusing on a {{frequent}} {{theme in the}} executive privilege arguments advanced by the Clinton Administration, Neal Kumar Katyal explores the distinction drawn {{between the public and}} private lives of the President, particularly in the Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky cases. He argues that the Administration 2 ̆ 7 s difficulties in asserting executive <b>privilege</b> <b>claims</b> following these cases demonstrate that the public/private distinction is not entirely valid He asserts that, unlike members of Congress who have time when they are not in session, the President is unique in that he is in office twenty-four hours a day. He argues that this special constitutional status puts pressure on the public and private distinction. Professor Katyal maintains that presidents have only a limited reservoir of secrecy from which to draw. Thus, the use of privilege on private mailers such as the Lewinsky investigation not only weakens their ability <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> executive <b>privilege</b> on significant public mailers but it also adversely affects their ability to achieve their political ends...|$|R
40|$|During {{the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries tens of {{thousands}} of Castilians initiated lawsuits at the royal appellate courts to gain recognition of the status of hidalgo and enjoyment of legal privileges associated with this status. Appealing to a diversity of laws and customs these litigants claimed that the status of hidalgo provided such privileges as exemption from taxation, freedom from judicial torture, right to public office, and immunity from debtor's prison. Historians frequently characterize pre-modern European society as one in which the ruling classes enjoyed legal privileges {{on the basis of their}} social status or estate. Nevertheless in these contests the success or failure of litigants did not depend on the individual's ancestry or the objective application of existing laws governing privilege and status. In Early Modern Castile litigants intensely disputed one another's <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> and about <b>privilege,</b> and their respective definitions of status. Sources from the period reveal that royal and municipal authorities granted and recognized possession of legal privileges based on status. Paradoxically these authorities frequently denied the status of these same individuals and resisted their <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>privilege.</b> In this dissertation I analyze disputes over privilege as a means for understanding how legal inequality actually functioned in Early Modern Castile. The responses of monarchs, royal officials, and municipal councils <b>to</b> <b>claims</b> concerning <b>privilege</b> (at times in the form of judicial rulings) reflected contingent factors typically shaped by their own immediate interests. Consequently both claimants to privilege and the opposing sides in these cases used available rules and procedures as resources to advance their respective causes...|$|R
