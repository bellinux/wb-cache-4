50|$|The <b>Taiwan</b> <b>hwamei</b> (Garrulax taewanus) is a {{passerine}} bird in {{the family}} Leiothrichidae. It is endemic to the island of Taiwan. It was formerly regarded as a subspecies of the Chinese hwamei (Garrulax canorus) but has recently been split as a separate species. It is estimated to have diverged from the Chinese hwamei about 1.5 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|It is 21 to 25 cm {{long with}} broad, rounded wings and a fan-shaped tail. The plumage is mostly reddish-brown with dark steaks on the crown, back and throat. There {{is a white}} ring around the eye which extends {{backwards}} as a white stripe. The bill and feet are yellowish. Birds on Hainan Island (L. c. owstoni) are paler below and more olive-coloured above. The <b>Taiwan</b> <b>hwamei</b> is greyer and more streaked and lacks the white markings on the head.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a small}} {{population}} of red-billed blue magpies that has been introduced to Wuling Farm in Taichung County (now part of Taichung City). In 2007, three hybrid chicks were found in a nest in Taichung, with red-billed and Taiwan magpie parents tending them. This caused some concern to conservationists, given {{the decline of the}} <b>Taiwan</b> <b>hwamei</b> due to the invasion of the Chinese hwamei. However, the Endemic Species Research Institute of Taiwan has been working to control red-billed magpie populations by capturing individual birds and relocating their nests.|$|E
50|$|It has two subspecies: G. c. canorus, {{native to}} {{mainland}} Asia, and G. c. owstoni of Hainan Island. The <b>Taiwan</b> <b>hwamei</b> (Leucodioptron taewanum) was formerly {{considered to be}} a subspecies of the Chinese hwamei but has recently been split as a separate species. Based on a study of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, Li et al. (2006) suggested that the two species diverged about 1.5 million years ago with the two Chinese hwamei subspecies diverging about 600,000 years ago. The two were formerly placed in the genus Garrulax with the other laughingthrushes but have recently been moved to a new genus Leucodioptron.|$|E
40|$|Garrulax canorus) songs. Zoological Studies 43 (3) : 629 - 640. Different {{songs in}} the same species may lead to {{reproductive}} divergence and potential speciation. Our aim was to compare the geographic variation of Taiwan and Mainland Hwamei (Garrulax canorus taewanus and G. c. canorus) songs both micro- and macrogeographi-cally. <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Hwamei</b> is found only in Taiwan, while the Mainland Hwamei is found in both southern China and Indochina. We taperecorded 229 songs of 20 <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Hwamei</b> and 227 songs of 20 Mainland Hwamei, and compared them at the note, syllable, song, and syntax levels. Our results show that geographic variation of Hwamei songs mainly occurred at the syllable level and above. Mainland Hwamei shared more syllables and syntax between and among sample locations than did the <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Hwamei.</b> Mainland Hwamei songs were more complex than <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Hwamei</b> songs, containing significantly more syllable types, more variations in sylla-ble changes, larger syntactic combinations, and fewer repeated syllables per song. The simpler songs of the <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Hwamei</b> could {{be a result of}} either the founder effect or a vicariant event...|$|E
30|$|The {{relatively}} {{high number of}} endemic species is one of Taiwan's outstanding biodiversity features. The existing protected areas network, as it is mostly found in mountainous areas should, according to our analyses, protect most endemic species rather well as they are also concentrated in the mountains (Figure  3) with a few notable exceptions (the Taiwan Barbet, Formosan Blue Magpie Urocissa caerulea, <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Hwamei,</b> and Styan's Bulbul). However, this could change if mountain species are forced to migrate upwards because of climate change (Ko 2010; Chien et al. 2012). Moreover, although percentages of hotspot criteria covered by 'low-to-high’ protection were rather high (48.5 % to 87.2 %, Table  2), {{a large portion of}} those percentages come from major wildlife habitats, which are in the lowest protection category. For the highest protection category, namely national parks, percentages were much lower (12.7 % to 19.2 %, Table  2). Therefore, we strongly support upgrading the protection status of some of the less well-protected areas and establishing some completely new protected areas, especially in the northeastern mountains (Figures  6 and 7).|$|E
30|$|Our study {{included}} {{a few more}} endemic species than previous studies. Specifically, we included the Taiwan Barbet Megalaima nuchalis and <b>Taiwan</b> <b>Hwamei</b> Garrulax taewanus which were not included by Nieh (1999) and Ko et al. (2009 b); we further included the Taiwan Bush-Warbler Bradypterus alishanensis which was not included by Nieh (1999), and we also included Styan's Bulbul Pycnonotus taivanus which was not included by Ko et al. (2009 b). Nevertheless, our results mostly confirmed those of previous studies. Our {{mean and standard deviation}} for the elevation of endemic species hotspots was 2, 016 ± 463.0 m, while Nieh (1999) reported 1, 941 ± 602.5 m, and Ko et al. (2009 b) reported 1, 917 ± 437.8 m. Furthermore, a visual comparison of our Figure  3 B with figure thirty of Nieh (1999) and figure five in Ko et al. (2009 b) shows a very good agreement, with the exception that our analysis highlighted more hotspots in southern Taiwan, and Nieh (1999) failed to pick out the northeastern Nan-ao mountainous areas. This could have been due to differences in the lists of endemic species, especially lowland species, as described above. Our analysis is therefore important in that it confirms some previous results and also highlights additional previously undetected areas of high species richness. Furthermore, our results are much more relevant as they are based on a much more complete set of species.|$|E
