5|$|Rand {{did not use}} a {{specific}} architect {{as a model for}} Keating. Her inspiration for the character came from a neighbor she knew while working in Hollywood in the early 1930s. Rand asked <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> to explain her goals in life. The woman's response was focused on social comparisons: the neighbor wanted her material possessions and social standing to equal or exceed those of other people. Rand created Keating as an archetype of this motivation, which she saw as the opposite of self-interest.|$|E
500|$|The concert audio {{was mixed}} by Rick Camp, the same {{engineer}} who mixed at the concert venues. It is uncommon for mix engineers {{to specialize in}} both live and recorded mixing. For Camp, [...] "Mixing Beyoncé is a pleasure because she's a real singer and makes it easy. There is hardly an overdub on this project — it's 95 percent live Beyoncé." [...] He further talked about the collaboration with Beyoncé with Mix magazine, saying: [...] "In my 22 years of mixing, I've never come across anyone who could deliver like she does: vocally and her ability to do a show. I've seen <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> run across a 60-foot stage, hit every note and never miss a thing. And that makes my job so much easier." ...|$|E
500|$|Patton's niece Jean Gordon {{appeared}} again; {{they spent}} some time together in London in 1944, and again in Bavaria in 1945. Gordon actually loved a young married captain who left her despondent when he went home to his wife in September 1945. Patton repeatedly boasted of his sexual success with <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> but his biographers are skeptical. Hirshson says the relationship was casual. Showalter believes that Patton, under severe physical and psychological stress, made up claims of sexual conquest to prove his virility. D'Este agrees, saying, [...] "His behavior suggests that in both 1936 [...] and 1944–45, {{the presence of the}} young and attractive Jean was a means of assuaging the anxieties of a middle-aged man troubled over his virility and a fear of aging." ...|$|E

Kaja: 1988–2008 sparked renewed {{controversy}} over perceptions of Scientology activities in Norway. In {{a review of the}} book, Dagbladet noted that because the author was writing both as a private individual and as a physician, [...] "he is trained to look at the familiar and intimate with professionalism and distance." [...] Upon the book's publication, representative Matthias Fosse of the Church of Scientology stated, [...] "Church of Scientology had {{absolutely nothing to do with}} this young woman's decision to take her own life. We are sorry for the loss the family has suffered, but <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> was never a member of the Church of Scientology and never participated in any of the church activities." ...|$|E

[...] In reply, Boxall says [...] "no," [...] and when asked if Harkness could have known, Boxall replies [...] "not unless somebody else told her." [...] When Littlemore suggests in the interview {{that there may have been}} an espionage connection to the dead man in Adelaide, Boxall replies: [...] "It's quite a melodramatic thesis, isn't it?" [...] Boxall's army service record suggests that he served initially in the 4th Water Transport Company, before being seconded to the North Australia Observer Unit (NAOU) – a special operations unit – and that during his time with NAOU, Boxall rose rapidly in rank, being promoted from Lance Corporal to Lieutenant within three months.|$|E
