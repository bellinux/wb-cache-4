500|$|McVeigh {{then added}} a dual-fuse {{ignition}} system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled twoholes {{in the cab}} of the truck under the seat, while twoholes were also drilled {{in the body of}} the truck. Onegreen cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank <b>tubing</b> <b>conduit</b> to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around [...] of high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's livery, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the [...] of Tovex Blastrite Gel [...] "sausages", which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about [...] of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the twomen separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh with the truck to Junction City.|$|E

These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank <b>tubing</b> <b>conduit</b> to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around 350 lb of high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry.

Of the 13 filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about 4 gal of diesel fuel.

50|$|Over {{the next}} two years, the company {{released}} two additional mobile applications: the Conduit Fill Tracker calculated allowable fill rates when adding conductors to <b>tubing</b> or <b>conduit</b> and Summit Mobile took scans of product bar codes and worked {{in conjunction with the}} e-commerce content on Summitâ€™s website.|$|R
50|$|In a {{hardened}} carrier PDS, {{the data}} cables are {{installed in a}} carrier constructed of electrical metallic <b>tubing</b> (EMT), ferrous <b>conduit</b> or pipe, or rigid sheet steel ducting. All of the connections in a Hardened Carrier System are permanently sealed completely around all surfaces with welds, epoxy or other such sealants. If the hardened carrier is buried under ground, to secure cables running between buildings for example, the carrier containing the cables is encased in concrete.|$|R
50|$|When {{natural gas}} flows {{to the surface}} in a {{producing}} gas well, the gas carries liquids to the surface if the velocity of the gas is high enough. A high gas velocity results in a mist flow pattern in which liquids are finely dispersed in the gas. Consequently, a low volume of liquid {{is present in the}} <b>tubing</b> or production <b>conduit,</b> resulting in a pressure drop caused by gravity acting on the flowing fluids. As the gas velocity in the production tubing drops with time, the velocity of the liquids carried by the gas declines even faster. Flow patterns of liquids {{on the walls of the}} conduit cause liquid to accumulate in the bottom of the well, which can either slow or stop gas production altogether.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Laparoscopic {{procedures}} utilize a pneumoperitoneum to distend {{and separate}} the abdominal wall from the intra-abdominal structures. Carbon dioxide {{is commonly used}} for this purpose, although this study is inclusive of any gas used for abdominal distention. The gas is delivered from cylinders through a gas insufflation delivery system. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine if laparoscopic gas delivery systems composed of gas cylinders and insufflators used for laparoscopy have microbes present. Methods: Gas delivery systems were evaluated for the presence of microbial growth using standard techniques. External connection sites, gas cylinders and the internal <b>conduit</b> <b>tubing</b> of insufflators were cultured. Fifty two (52) insufflators and sixty (60) gas cylinders were evaluated. Results: Twelve (12) of the sixty cylinders (20 %) and fifty four (54) of the sixty insufflators (92. 3 %) were culture positive. The organisms identified are significant and a varied spectrum. Conclusions: Recognition that gas cylinders, insufflation attachments and internal components of insufflators quantitatively contain microbes is demonstrated. Reduction of microbial exposure from insufflation apparatus is achieved by cleansing external ports and use of a 0. 3 micron filter for abdominal pneumoperitoneum...|$|R
30|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} in an ex vivo ECMO circuit where the differential destruction of the pump head and oxygenator were assessed in controlled laboratory conditions. Whilst the circuit equipment {{is the same as}} used clinically, there are numerous important differences. The main difference was that there was no patient component that would contribute to microbubble destruction. Also, in light of this, there were no access or return cannulae located within the ex vivo circuit. Flow through these cannulae also contributes to microbubble destruction. There are numerous sites for contrast microbubble destruction in the ECMO circuit, including the <b>conduit</b> <b>tubing.</b> This research focussed on the oxygenator and pump head components. It was not possible to isolate the relative contribution of boundary turbulent flow related to this tubing, which is an important component of an ECMO circuit. Also, whilst unlikely to be clinically relevant to microbubble destruction, this ex vivo circuit was primed with normal saline, which has a viscosity approximately one third that of blood. Ideally, blood would have been the preferable product to prime the ECMO circuit. However, the constraints of our research resulted in access to saline for the circuit priming. However, the results may be still meaningful as there were significant identifiable differences in the contrast concentrations between the two circuits, and as saline was used in both circuits, it would not have accounted for this difference in signal intensity.|$|R
