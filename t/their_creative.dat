Gaga also partnered with Polaroid in January 2010 as <b>their</b> <b>Creative</b> Director and announced {{a suite of}} photo capturing products called Grey Label. Her collaboration with past producer and ex-boyfriend Rob Fusari led to her production team, Mermaid Music LLC, being sued. At this time, Gaga was tested borderline positive for lupus, but claimed not {{to be affected by}} the symptoms and hoped to maintain a healthy lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|For {{the film}} score, Mizoguchi relied on {{composer}} Fumio Hayasaka and the assistant directors, {{and was not}} involved in <b>their</b> <b>creative</b> process. Fumio Hayasaka was a strong proponent of using Japanese music in Japanese films. For Ugetsu, he employed geza music, common in Kabuki theatre. Additional, uncredited composers were Ichiro Saito and Tamekichi Mochizuki, whose music was blended with Hayasaka's, and could provide accurate music reflective of the period.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Veronica rebuffs Logan for {{sleeping}} with Madison over winter break {{was the subject of}} a continuing debate in the writers' room about Veronica's character. Specifically, Enbom and Klemmer, two writers for the episode thought that Veronica should be less mistrustful, paranoid and jealous, while executive producers Thomas and Diane Ruggiero advocated for these traits in Veronica. Thomas illustrated <b>their</b> <b>creative</b> differences by stating that he enjoyed the film Chasing Amy, while Enbom did not.|$|E

5|$|Though Scott drew heavily {{upon his}} wife's intense {{personality}} in his writings, {{much of the}} conflict between them stemmed from the boredom and isolation Zelda experienced when Scott was writing.

Scott had become severely alcoholic, Zelda's behavior became increasingly erratic, and neither made any progress on <b>their</b> <b>creative</b> endeavors.|$|E
5|$|Cambodian Rocks is a {{compilation}} of 22 uncredited, untitled Cambodian psychedelic and garage rock songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the tracks were recorded, musicians in the thriving music scene were combining Western rock and pop genres with their own styles and techniques. When the Khmer Rouge {{came to power in}} 1975, artists were among those viewed {{as a threat to the}} regime's agrarian socialist vision, and several of the performers on the album are believed to have been among those killed during the ensuing Cambodian Genocide of 1975-1979. Little information about them or <b>their</b> <b>creative</b> output has survived.|$|E
5|$|Cortina has {{attracted}} many distinguished guests, often inspiring them in <b>their</b> <b>creative</b> work. They include the Italian novelists Dino Buzzati (1906–1972), author of The Tartar Steppe, Goffredo Parise (1929–1986) and Fernanda Pivano (1917–2009). Ernest Hemingway, author of A Farewell to Arms, also {{arrived in the}} area in 1918 as a young ambulance driver. Other notable visitors include John Ball (1818–1889), the Irish mountaineer and naturalist who climbed Monte Pelmo in 1857, the Italian mountaineers Emilio Comici (1901–1940), Angelo Dibona (1879–1956) and Lino Lacedelli (1925–2009), the Italian skier Kristian Ghedina (born 1969), the Italian bobsledder Eugenio Monti (1928–2003), the Austrian mountaineer Paul Grohmann (1838–1908) and the Austrian skier Toni Sailer (1935–2009).

He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop <b>their</b> <b>creative</b> side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
5|$|The Khmer Rouge regime, led by Pol Pot, {{wanted to}} return the nation of Cambodia to an idyllic notion of the past by {{implementing}} a radical form of agrarian socialism while simultaneously shunning outside aid and influence. In order to build and protect their utopian goals, the regime perceived enmity in anyone tied to the previous Cambodian governments, ethnic and religious minorities, intellectuals, and members of certain professions. Artists posed a threat due to their own influence on culture, incompatibility with an agrarian lifestyle, or exhibiting foreign influence. Between 1975 and 1979, about 2 million people (25% of the country's population) were killed during the ensuing Cambodian Genocide. Several of the artists on Cambodian Rocks {{are thought to have}} been among those killed, and information about them destroyed along with much of <b>their</b> <b>creative</b> output.|$|E

Meanwhile, Zolciak and Burruss continued recording music together, although they clashed over <b>their</b> <b>creative</b> differences. Bailey later became engaged to her boyfriend Peter Thomas, while Zolciak set her affections on football player Kroy Biermann; a conflict between Burruss, Leakes, and Zolciak later ensued while the latter two women embark on a promotional concert tour. Against the advice of her mother and sister, Bailey married Thomas in the third-season finale.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the album}} had been {{composed}} and committed to demo form before the band arrived at Rundgren's studio, but the producer felt that the first crop was insufficient. He expected a full working album worth of songs to be ready, whereas the Furs believed that <b>their</b> <b>creative</b> process had always flourished best inside a studio. He postponed recording while the Furs made additional demos. British keyboardist and future music producer Ed Buller helped to create many of the demos made before the band returned. Although never an official member of the Furs, Buller supplied much-needed musical accompaniment at this stage, and {{would go on to}} collaborate frequently with the band over the next six years. When the second batch arrived, Rundgren made major revisions and even dropped some tracks entirely. By necessity then, some songs were revised or fully composed in the studio.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{story was}} born from wanting to expand upon the {{original}} game's {{theme of the}} growing rift between mankind and the gods. The Greek Underworld was the one major mythical location that the developers of Titan Quest had not yet approached. As it offered {{a rich source of}} material for <b>their</b> <b>creative</b> staff, it was made the location for the expansion. The story concept the team began with was the possibility of a secondary hostile force besides the Titans that had only kept away from humans due to the presence of the Olympians, and now rose up as they retreated from human affairs. With the quests, the team worked to improve on the structure and impact they had in the original, introducing famous places and people from history and mythology. They also expanded the variety of side quests, and included elements such as legends and customs related to the dead. The script was written by Dean O'Donnell. While an experienced playwright, he encountered new challenges in writing for the video game medium, as he needed to always assume that the player had spoken first to a selected NPC and to contain the necessary information in the first line of dialogue with embellishment in additional lines. Aesthetically, the tone of Immortal Throne was darker than that of its predecessor, with one of the main elements of this change being the cover art: according to designer Arthur Bruno, this was in reaction to the unfavorable impression players received from the surface appearance of Titan Quest when compared to the darker take on Grecian mythology in the God of War series.|$|E

25|$|This musical style {{reflects}} {{a confluence of}} influences from traditional music, French urban popular songs of the 1960s, African music and Brazilian popular music.

25|$|Other {{researchers}} {{of creativity}} {{see the difference}} in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise {{in the field of}} <b>their</b> <b>creative</b> expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.|$|E
25|$|Black figure vase {{painting}} {{had been}} developed in Corinth in the 7th century BC and quickly became the dominant style of pottery decoration throughout the Greek world and beyond. Although Corinth dominated the overall market, regional markets and centres of production did develop. Initially, Athens copied the Corinthian style, but it gradually came to rival and overcome the dominance of Corinth. Attic artists developed the style to an unprecedented quality, reaching the apex of <b>their</b> <b>creative</b> possibilities in the second third of the 6th century BC. Exekias, active around 530 BC, {{can be seen as}} the most important representative of the black-figure style.|$|E
