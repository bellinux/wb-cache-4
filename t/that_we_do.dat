5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Saint Padarn (or Paternus to use his Latin name), and almost nothing {{with any degree of}} certainty; the {{earliest}} literary reference to him is by Rhygyfarch in about 1097. However, it is possible to construct a general outline of his life from the little <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> have.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not have Ine's laws {{in their original}} 7th-century form. Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked. He did not specify what laws he omitted, but {{if they were the}} ones no longer relevant in his own time, it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine's laws is complete.|$|E
5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was pointed out to me by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E

5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} {{on some of}} the other characters seen not in isolation but as they interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences. For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{as a body}} {{remained}} {{devoid of}} any significant power; nevertheless, the senators, who had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats. Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule; however, such an interpretation remains conjectural, given the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not have the precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

25|$|Peter Singer, a bioethicist {{and author}} of Animal Liberation {{published}} in 1975, suggested that consciousness {{is not necessarily the}} key issue: just because animals have smaller brains, or are ‘less conscious’ than humans, {{does not mean that they}} are not capable of feeling pain. He goes on further to argue <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not assume newborn infants, people suffering from neurodegenerative brain diseases or people with learning disabilities experience less pain than we would.|$|E
25|$|When we {{talk about}} a {{permanent}} vegetative state, I am offended by that. Terri smiles and acknowledges the people that love her {{when they come to}} see her. She cries when they leave. How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren.

However, Dominic will no longer be playing music or working on behalf of Love Equals Death.

25|$|The {{relationship}} of homo sapiens {{to the other}} animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entail in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.|$|E
25|$|Many consequentialist {{theories}} {{may seem}} {{primarily concerned with}} human beings and their relationships with other human beings. However, some philosophers argue {{that we should not}} limit our ethical consideration to the interests of human beings alone. Jeremy Bentham, who is regarded as the founder of utilitarianism, argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern. More recently, Peter Singer has argued that it is unreasonable <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the way we are to treat them. Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.|$|E
25|$|Richard Dawkins {{outlines}} in The Selfish Gene (1976) {{that humans}} are machines made of genes and genes are the grounding for everything we do. The gene-centric view outlines that natural selection, evolution and all behaviour must {{be traced back to}} the survival of competing genes as an extension of Darwin’s theory being the survival of competing individuals. The main goal of individuals, coming from the instinct of our genes, is to reproduce and thrive, where thriving involves protection, conquering competition and future growth. Therefore, everything <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> relates to thriving in our environment above competition, including the way we consume as a form of survival in our environment when simply purchasing the basic physiological needs of food, water and warmth. We also consume to thrive above others, for example in conspicuous consumption where a luxury car represents money and high social status and the application of makeup makes the person and their genes seem more attractive and worthy of passing to offspring.|$|E

25|$|In pre-modern times, {{environmental}} issues were not widely discussed, though Ashoka banned {{the burning of}} forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken {{about the issue of}} environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current ecological crisis is the belief that increased production and consumption to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, {{there is no point in}} going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human right and that it is our responsibility as humans to ensure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.|$|E
