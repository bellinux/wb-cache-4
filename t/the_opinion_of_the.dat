5|$|Rainivoninahitriniony's {{tenure as}} sole Prime Minister was short lived. His violent tendencies, {{irritability}} and insolence toward Rasoherina, {{in addition to}} lingering popular resentment over Rainivoninahitriniony's role in the violent end to Radama's rule, gradually turned <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nobles against him. As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony attempted to counsel his brother, while simultaneously overseeing diplomatic and military efforts to re-pacify the agitated Sakalava and other peoples, who viewed the coup {{as an indication of}} weakening Merina control. The Prime Minister repaid these efforts by repeatedly castigating high-ranking officers and even threatening Rainilaiarivony with his sword.|$|E

If a senatus consultum conflicted with a law (lex) that was passed by a Roman Assembly, the law overrode the senatus consultum, because the senatus consultum had its authority based in precedent, and not in law. A senatus consultum, however, could serve to interpret a law.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E
