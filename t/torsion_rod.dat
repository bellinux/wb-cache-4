50|$|Recently {{another type}} of opener, known as the {{jackshaft}} opener, has become more popular. This style of opener was used frequently on commercial doors {{but in recent years}} has been adapted for residential use. This style of opener consists of a motor that attaches to the side of the <b>torsion</b> <b>rod</b> and moves the door up and down by simply spinning the rod. These openers need a few extra components to function safely for residential use. These include a cable tension monitor, to detect when a cable is broken, and a separate locking mechanism to lock the door when it is fully closed. These have the advantage that they free up ceiling space that an ordinary opener and rail would occupy. These also have the disadvantage that the door must have a <b>torsion</b> <b>rod</b> to attach the motor to.|$|E

Three concentrations of ³He, x₃, were studied: isotopically purified ⁴He with the estimated x₃ < 10 ⁻¹⁰, commercial ‘well-grade’ helium with x₃ 3 ⋅ 10 ⁻⁷ and a mixture with x₃ = 2. 5 ⋅ 10 ⁻⁶. Torsional oscillations at two frequencies, 132. 5 and 853. 6 Hz, and thermal conductivity were investigated before and after annealing. The solid helium under investigation was located {{not only in the}} annular container but also in the axial fill line inside two <b>torsion</b> <b>rods</b> and dummy bob of the doublefrequency torsional oscillator. The analysis of the frequency shifts upon loading with helium and changing temperatures of different parts of the oscillator suggests that the three techniques probe the properties of solid helium in three different locations: the two different torsion modes respond to the changes of the shear modulus of solid helium in either of the two <b>torsion</b> <b>rods</b> while the thermal conductivity probes the phonon mean free path in solid helium inside the annular container. The temperature and width of the torsional anomaly increase with increasing frequency and x₃. The phonon mean free path increases with increasing x 3.

5000|$|One {{can measure}} the {{superfluid}} {{response of the}} film by measuring the moment of inertia. An indispensable tool {{for this is the}} Torsional Oscillator, and early design was first used by Andronikashvili to detect superfluid in bulk fluid 4He and later modified by John Reppy and co-workers at Cornell in the 1970s. In the torsional oscillator, the experimental volume is suspended by a <b>torsion</b> <b>rod</b> and made to oscillate at resonance via capacitive coupling with a fin or pair of fins, depending on the configuration (shown below in grey). When part of the film becomes superfluid, it no longer has any viscosity and will remain at rest in the lab frame, lowering the moment of inertia of the cell. Recall that the resonant period of a torsional oscillator is [...] Therefore, lowering the moment of inertia reduces the resonant period of the oscillator. By measuring the period drop as a function of temperature, and total loading of the film from the empty cell value, one can deduce the fraction of the film that has entered the superfluid state.

40|$|Inertia of the {{electric}} carrier in metals. — Although Tolman and Stewart had apparently demonstrated that the carriers in metals have approximately the same ratios of mass to charge as an electron, it was desirable to verify this result and if possible obtain a more accurate value for m/e by using an entirely different method. An oscillating apparatus was constructed, consisting of a copper cylinder 91 / 8 ″ long, 4 ″ outside diameter and 3 ″ inside diameter, attached to a brass <b>torsion</b> <b>rod</b> {{in such a manner}} that it could be oscillated about its axis with a frequency of about 20 cycles per second. Surrounding this copper cylinder was a coil, containing about 60 miles of No. 38 copper wire, which acted as the secondary of a transformer, and was connected to a vibration galvanometer through a specially designed three-stage amplifier. The tendency of the electrons in the oscillating copper cylinder to lag behind because of their inertia leads to an electromotive force, the effects of which were finally measured by the deflection of the vibration galvanometer, tuned to the frequency of the mechanical oscillations. This galvanometer deflection was then compared with that produced by the known electromotive force accompanying a transverse oscillation of the cylinder across the earth's magnetic field. The apparatus was mounted on a massive concrete pier in a special location 150 yards from the nearest electrical circuits, was constructed without the use of magnetic materials, and was driven by compressed air. The axis of the oscillating cylinder was set parallel to the earth's magnetic field to reduce accidental effects. The apparatus avoids the direct electric connections between moving and stationary parts, and the sudden stopping of a coil of wire, with the attendant chance of buckling and slipping of the wire, which were present in the apparatus used by Tolman and Stewart. The fact that the vibration galvanometer will respond only to the frequency of the desired effect is also important in eliminating accidental effects. Mass of carrier in copper. The average of 86 determinations of m/e is 5. 2 × 10 ^- 8. However since the means of the first 42 determinations and of the last 44, obtained with the cylinder earthed only through the concrete pier and specially earthed, respectively, are 5. 97 and 4. 35, and since the corrections for zero amplitude were large, these preliminary results are not regarded as demonstrating a difference between the ratio m/e of the carrier in copper and of an election in free space, 5. 66 × 10 ^- 8...|$|E

Using absolute coordinates, the mass and constraint matrices are sparse and this sparsity may be exploited to speed-up time integration.

40|$|AbstractStatic {{problems}} for the elastic plates and rods periodically perforated by small holes of different shapes are solved using the asymptotic approach based on {{the combination of the}} asymptotic technique and the multi-scale homogenization method. Using the asymptotic homogenization method the original boundary-value problem is reduced to the combination of two types of problems. First one is a recurrent system of unit cell problems with the conditions of periodic continuation. And the second problem is a homogenized boundary-value problem for the entire domain, characterized by the constant effective coefficients obtained from the solution of the unit cell problems. The combination of the perturbation method and the technique of successive approximations is applied for the solution of the unit cell problems. Taking into the account small size of holes the method of perturbation of the shape of the boundary and the Schwarz alternating method are used. The problems of <b>torsion</b> of a <b>rod</b> with perforated cross-section; deflection of the perforated membrane loaded by a normal load; and bending of perforated plates with circular and square holes are considered consecutively.

40|$|Extract] Gorgonian growth form {{represents}} a trade-off between selective forces related {{at least to}} feeding (Leversee, 1976; Sebens, 1984; Sponaugle and LaBarbera, 1991; Patterson, 1991 a; b), gas exchange (Patterson and Sebens, 1989), resistance to dislodgment caused by wave action and current (Wainwright and Dillon, 1969; Rees, 1972; Mosquera, 1991; Weinbauer and Velimirov, 1995; Lin and Dai, 1996) and light capture (West et al. 1993). Several authors, however, have suggested that hydrodynamic regime within coral reefs {{is one of the}} most important factor determining gorgonian morphology (Wainwright and Dillon, 1969; Grigg, 1972; Velimirov, 1976; Muzik and Wainwright, 1977; Jordan and Nugent, 1978; Weinbauer and Velimirov, 1995). Under wave-generated bidirectional current or high unidirectional current, gorgonians and other soft corals tend to grow fanform and typically oriented perpendicularly to the current (Theodor and Denyzot, 1965; Wainwright and Dillon, 1969; Koehl, 1982). This growth form seems to minimize the axial <b>rod</b> <b>torsion</b> and colony detachment (Theodor and Denyzot, 1965; Lin and Dai, 1996), and on the other hand, to maximize the food capture as well (Leversee, 1976, Patterson, 1991 a). Alternatively, gorgonians grow arborescently tree-form under low-impact hydrodynamic regimes (Grigg, 1972). Thus, according to Sebens (1987), the change in gorgonian morphology along the depth gradient mirrors the change in hydrodynamic regime. Along depth gradients, in which the hydrodynamic stress decreases from wave-exposed shores toward deeper areas, shallow colonies should tend to be fan-form whereas deep ones should be tree-form. Here we set out to test a widely cited concept that gorgonian morphology seems to be a direct reflection of hydrodynamic regime on a coral reef. Our observational data suggests that the effect of hydrodynamic regime on gorgonian morphology is species-specific...|$|R

40|$|Shape {{changing}} or morphing structures enable optimisation {{of structural}} configuration to suit current operating conditions. Conventional techniques for achieving shape change often result in weight and complexity penalties, which may outweigh {{the potential benefits}} of greater shape changing ability. The research presented in this thesis focuses on the use of shape memory materials to achieve a reversible change in shape of an innovative compliant composite structure, which may enable shape change without the drawbacks of conventional shape changing techniques. An initial concept was evaluated using a glass fibre reinforced shape memory polymer which was heated and deformed locally to fix the actuated shape. It was found that a large change in shape can be achieved. However, due to the high shear strain between the fibres during large deformations, fibre/matrix debonding occurred and propagated with repeated cycling. An alternative topology, consisting of a shape memory polymer reinforced with comparatively large diameter precured CFRP composite rods, was proposed and successfully demonstrated to reduce matrix shear strains, thereby reducing damage during deformation. The increased reinforcement size also improved load carrying ability when the shape memory polymer was in its low stiffness state. Initial testing of a rod reinforced composite beam with a low stiffness elastomer matrix indicated that shape memory alloy actuators wound helically around the composite beam could be effectively used to provide Significant rotational actuation. A constitutive model of the shape memory alloy thermo-mechanical behaviour was compared to the experimental findings for different configurations of shape memory alloy winding around the composite beam. A composite beam with a shape memory polymer matrix was found capable of 'locking' and 'releasing' mechanically introduced rotational shape change. The composite beam topology used initially consisted of circular rods and relied upon an adhesive for torsional rod restraint within the end alignment fittings, often resulting in failure of the adhesive and large non- returnable rotations at the temperatures required for softening of the shape memory polymer matrix. Rectangular cross section rods were used to enable the end fittings to mechanically restrain the <b>rods</b> in <b>torsion.</b> The rectangular <b>rod</b> topology also gave a large increase in bending stiffness compared to circular rods, with both topologies having similar torsional rigidities. A key aspect of the actuator performance was found to be {{the rate at which the}} shape memory materials could be activated by heating or cooling. This was found to be a particular problem for the shape memory polymer. To increase the rate of heating for the composite beam with a shape memory polymer matrix, efforts were made to incorporate carbon nanotubes to improve the thermal response of the material. However, only a modest change in thermal properties was achieved, combined with some undesirable detrimental effects on mechanical and therrno- mechanical properties. Further work is needed to optimise this combination. A final composite beam demonstrator combining both helically wound shape memory alloy wires for actuation and a shape memory polymer matrix for shape fixing was constructed. The shape memory polymer matrix was heated using an embedded heating element. By activating the shape memory alloy actuators when the shape memory polymer matrix was in its soft state, a rotation was achieved. Cooling the shape memory polymer matrix before the shape memory alloy actuators fixed the rotated, which was returned upon reheating the shape memory polymer matrix.
