Numerical simulation technique using the finite element program Abaqus is described. The paper shows that the numerical Abaqus models are able to capture the trend in earth forces with increasing base acceleration for all three models. The use of the EPS geofoam as a compressible buffer yields obviously reduction of the lateral seismic thrust against retaining wall.

40|$|AbstractNozzle {{effects on}} thrust and inlet {{pressure}} of a multi-cycle air-breathing pulse detonation engine (APDE) are investigated experimentally. An APDE with 68 mm {{in diameter and}} 2 050 mm in length is operated using gasoline/air mixture. Straight nozzle, converging nozzle, converging-diverging nozzle and diverging nozzle are tested. The results show that thrust augmentation of converging-diverging nozzle, diverging nozzle or straight nozzle is better than that of converging nozzle on the whole. Thrust augmentation of straight nozzle is worse than those of converging-diverging nozzle and diverging nozzle. Thrust augmentations of diverging nozzle with larger expansion ratio and converging-diverging nozzle with larger throat area range from 20 % to 40 % on tested frequencies and are better than those of congeneric other nozzles respectively. Nozzle effects on inlet pressure are also researched. At each frequency it is indicated that filling pressures and average peak pressures of inlet with diverging nozzle and converging-diverging nozzle with large throat cross section area are higher than those with straight nozzle and converging nozzle.

In this research, we made a model pulse-detonation-rocket system with increased specific impulse by partialfill. The performance predicted by this model was then confirmed experimentally. The thrust can be calculated byusing the simplified pulse-detonation-engine model of Endo et al. [Endo, T., Kasahara, J., Matsuo, A., Inaba, K.,Sato, S., and Fujiwara, T., “Pressure History at the <b>Thrust</b> <b>Wall</b> of a Simplified Pulse Detonation Engine,” AIAAJournal, Vol. 42, No. 9, 2004, pp. 1921 – 1929] and the partial-filling-effect models of Sato et al.

The mass flow rate of the propellantsupplied from the pressurized cylinders is considered in this calculation. As a result, the thrust performance can bedetermined by the kind of propellant, the initial conditions of the gas in the cylinders, the supply-valve-orifice andpulse-detonation-engine-tube volume, and the operation frequencies. We fabricated a pulse detonation rocketnamed Todoroki and verified the thrust calculation model via a horizontal sliding test.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{experimentally}} and numerically investigated {{the influence of}} heat transfer and friction {{on the performance of}} a single-shot detonation tube open at one end. Two kinds of specific impulse measurement were carried out with various tube lengths and levels of surface roughness, one by using a ballistic pendulum arrangement and the other by integrating the pressure history measured at the <b>thrust</b> <b>wall.</b> These measurements revealed the degree to which potential impulse can be exploited by the detonation tube after the impulse losses due to various wall loss mechanisms such as heat transfer and friction. The detonation tube obtained 89 %, 70 %, and 64 % of the theoretical ideal impulse for electropolished tubes at a ratio of tube length to diameter (L/D) of 49, 103, and 151, respectively. The impulse losses due to shear stress on the side wall of the detonation tube were found to have a dominant influence on the performance of the detonation tubes of L/D = 103 and 151, but the loss was remarkably small for L/D = 49 relative to that of the longer tubes. In addition to the experiments, a simplified one-dimensional gas-dynamic model was developed by considering heat transfer and friction as wall loss mechanisms and validated by the experimental results. This simplified model was found to predict the experimental results very well, especially in the range of L/D 103 – 151...|$|E
40|$|In {{one-dimensional}} {{calculations of}} pulsed detonation engine (PDE) performance, the exit boundary condition is frequently {{taken to be}} a constant static pressure. In reality, for an isolated detonation tube, after the detonation wave arrives at the exit plane, {{there will be a}} region of high pressure, which will gradually return to ambient pressure as an almost spherical shock wave expands away from the exit, and weakens. Initially, the flow is supersonic, unaffected by external pressure, but later becomes subsonic. Previous authors have accounted for this situation either by assuming the subsonic pressure decay to be a relaxation phenomenon, or by running a two-dimensional calculation first, including a domain external to the detonation tube, and using the resulting exit pressure temporal distribution as the boundary condition for one-dimensional calculations. These calculations show that the increased pressure does affect the PDE performance. In the present work, a simple model of the exit process is used to estimate the pressure decay time. The planar shock wave emerging from the tube is assumed to transform into a spherical shock wave. The initial strength of the spherical shock wave is determined from comparison with experimental results. Its subsequent propagation, and resulting pressure at the tube exit, is given by a numerical blast wave calculation. The model agrees reasonably well with other, limited, results. Finally, the model was used as the exit boundary condition for a one-dimensional calculation of PDE performance to obtain the <b>thrust</b> <b>wall</b> pressure for a hydrogen-air detonation in tubes of length to diameter ratio (L/D) of 4, and 10, {{as well as for the}} original, constant pressure boundary condition.

40|$|An {{integrated}} petrologic, thermochronologic, and numerical modeling study constrains {{the thermal}} {{evolution of the}} Lesser Himalayan Sequence in the Kumaun and Garwhal regions of India. South of the Tons thrust, peak metamorphic temperatures do not exceed 330 °C. On the northern side, a transition toward higher temperatures adjacent to the Main Central <b>thrust</b> hanging <b>wall</b> is documented. In the immediate footwall of the Main Central thrust, peak temperatures average ~ 550 °C. An inverted thermal field gradient of ~ 30 °C/km beneath the Vaikrita thrust is calculated. An inverted thermal field gradient of ~ 20 °C/km is also documented beneath a klippe of the Main Central <b>thrust</b> hanging <b>wall</b> ~ 25 km south of the Vaikrita thrust, and a peak footwall temperature of 530 °C is recorded close to the shear zone {{at the base of}} the klippe. The mechanism for thermal metamorphism in the Lesser Himalayan Sequence is interpreted to be conduction of heat from the Main Central thrust fault and/or hanging wall to the footwall. A localized thermal field gradient is also associated with the Tons thrust. The ^(40) Ar/^(39) Ar thermochronology reveals that the exposed rock in the Kumaun and Garwhal Lesser Himalaya underwent cooling below the closure temperature (Tc) for white mica at different times in the late Tertiary. The proximal footwall of the Munsiari thrust experienced cooling below the white mica Tc at ca. 8. 5 Ma. South of the Munsiari thrust, in the proximal footwalls of the Chaukori and Askot klippen, muscovites ages are ca. 11. 5 Ma, ~ 3 Ma older than samples to the north. The age differences in samples from northern and southern exposures are interpreted to document cooling related to thermal relaxation following passage of the Main Central <b>thrust</b> hanging <b>wall</b> atop the Lesser Himalayan Sequence.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the geologic evolution of the Himalaya remains incomplete, particularly in regard to structural and geochronologic details of the Proterozoic-Paleozoic Lesser Himalayan Sequence. We conducted an integrated field mapping, geochronological study, and geochemical analysis of the Lesser Himalayan Sequence strata in the Kumaun and Garwhal Himalaya of NW India (78 ° 00 ′- 80 ° 30 ′E). Structural observations reveal a systematic change in deformation styles from lower to higher structural levels in the Main Central Thrust footwall. In the south, and at lower structural levels, the Main Central Thrust footwall is characterized by parallel folding and sparse development of axial cleavage. Quartz microstructures indicate that deformation occurred at temperatures below 350 °C. In contrast, {{in the north and}} at higher structural levels close to the Main Central Thrust, deformation is characterized by replacement of original bedding, the development of penetrative cleavage, and schistosity locally. Folds are tight, in places isoclinal and overturned. The corresponding quartz microstructures indicate that deformation occurred above 350 °C. Dating of detrital zircons from Lesser Himalayan Sequence metasedimentary units, and igneous zircons from schistose gneisses throughout the Lesser Himalayan Sequence allow refinements to the stratigraphic framework. First, unlike what has been observed in western Nepal immediately west of our study area, U-Pb zircon dating suggests the absence of Paleoproterozoic strata in the Ramgarh <b>Thrust</b> hanging <b>wall.</b> This suggests that the thrust cuts upsection laterally along strike. Second, U-Pb detrital zircon dating suggests that metasedimentary strata in the Ramgarh <b>Thrust</b> hanging <b>wall</b> are correlative with basal units of the Outer Lesser Himalayan Sequence, removing the necessity that the Ramgarh <b>Thrust</b> hanging <b>wall</b> was allochthonous with respect to its footwall Lesser Himalayan Sequence units. Schistose gneisses with U-Pb ages of ca. 1850 Ma are older than Lesser Himalayan Sequence units in the area, suggesting that they are Lesser Himalayan Sequence basement. We conclude that the Ramgarh Thrust is an out-of-sequence thrust postdating a folding event in its footwall. The earlier proposal that Neoproterozoic-Cambrian Lesser Himalayan Sequence strata are the southern extension of the Tethyan Himalayan Sequence requires that the Tons Thrust, which separates the distal and proximal facies of the Lesser Himalayan Sequence, be a major, south-directed structure with a slip magnitude of > 50 - 100 km. © 2009 Geological Society of America.

40|$|The Himalaya is {{commonly}} {{described as a}} three layer-two fault stack. Namely, a high-grade crystalline core featuring an inverted metamorphic field gradient, the Greater Himalayan Crystalline complex (GHC), is separated from units above and below by shear zones. The Lesser Himalayan Sequence (LHS) underlies the GHC below the Main Central thrust, and the Tethyan Himalayan Sequence (THS) overlies it along the South Tibet detachment. However, the southern Main Central <b>thrust</b> hanging <b>wall</b> consists of a lower unit dominated by a right-way-up metamorphic sequence of biotite ± garnet schists (Bhimphedi Group) and an upper unit with only anchizone metamorphism (Pulchauki Group). The Bhimphedi Group {{is commonly}} equated to the GHC, while the Pulchauki Group is well correlated to the THS. However, no shear zone separates these units. We present new structural and geochronological data along {{the boundary between the}} GHC and the Bhimphedi Group in the Kathmandu region. These data reveal an ~. 200. m thick Early-Middle Miocene top-north-northeast shear zone that we term the Galchi shear zone. We correlate this shear zone to the South Tibet detachment on the basis of lithological, metamorphic, structural, and chronological criteria. The Galchi shear zone merges with the Main Central thrust to the south, bounding {{the leading edge of the}} GHC. This result, combined with recent work in the western Himalaya, suggests that the locally preserved leading edge of the GHC is sub-parallel to the arc of the orogen and the southern Main Central <b>thrust</b> hanging <b>wall</b> is dominated by THS rocks.
