She also would have won the season trophy for the {{combined}} discipline four times (2001, 2003, 2005, 2006), but the discipline trophy for the combined was not awarded to women during her career, being added only in 2007.|$|R
5|$|The aerial {{game was}} also {{developed}} within the Sheffield game. While causing much amusement when the side visited London in 1866, the header {{would become an}} important feature of the national game. This {{was linked to the}} abolition of the fair catch in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> prevented all use of the hands by outfield players.|$|E

5|$|After the village's disincorporation, taxes {{decreased}} {{for former}} village residents, but increased for Rosendale residents {{throughout the rest}} of the town. The population of the former village has grown 24.5percent, from 1,220 to an estimated 1,519 people. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> the village chose to disincorporate, the Wallkill Valley rail line that ran through the village also ceased regular service.|$|E
2500|$|Having become “an {{international}} superstar” and {{a continuous}} “box office hit throughout the world,” Plisetskaya was {{treated by the}} Soviet Union as a favored cultural emissary. [...] Although she toured extensively during <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> other dancers defected, including Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov, Plisetskaya always refused to defect. In 1991 she published her autobiography, I, Maya Plisetskaya.|$|R

25|$|Within a few years, Plisetskaya was {{recognized}} as “an international superstar” and a continuous “box office hit throughout the world.” The Soviet Union treated her as a favored cultural emissary, as “the dancer who did not defect.” Although she toured extensively during <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> other dancers defected, including Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov, “Plisetskaya always returned to Russia”, wrote historian Tim Scholl.|$|R
5|$|As {{oil prices}} rose during the 1990s, Fairbanks' economy improved. The city was also boosted by the {{regrowth}} of gold mining in the area. The Fort Knox Gold Mine north of Fairbanks opened in 1997 {{after several years}} of development, and another gold prospect is likely to be developed in the next decade. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> Fort Knox Mine opened, Alyeska moved 300 jobs from Anchorage to Fairbanks, making the city the base of its operations {{for the first time in}} several decades.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> Brønsted and Lowry {{published}} their theory, G. N. Lewis {{proposed an}} alternative theory of acid–base reactions. The Lewis theory {{is based on}} electronic structure. A Lewis base {{is defined as a}} compound that can donate an electron pair to a Lewis acid, a compound that can accept an electron pair. Lewis's proposal gives an explanation to the Brønsted–Lowry classification in terms of electronic structure.|$|E
5|$|Magnus had a son, Haakon Toresfostre, who was {{probably}} born <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> Magnus died. Haakon {{went on to}} claim what he considered {{his part of the}} kingdom (after his father) in 1093 when his uncle Olaf Kyrre died, and shared the kingdom with his cousin Magnus Barefoot (son of Olaf Kyrre). Similar to the reign of his father, Haakon's reign also ended abruptly after a short time as he died young in 1095.|$|E

His dynasty dissolved quickly, ushering in the fifty-three-year period of disunity {{known as the}} Five Dynasties period. One of the five dynasties, the Later Jin (936–947), was a client state of the Khitans.|$|E

5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and initiated the devastating plagues that {{swept through the}} native populations of the Americas. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality. Maya written histories suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> it arrived in central Mexico. Among the most deadly diseases were the aforementioned smallpox, influenza, measles {{and a number of}} pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33–50% {{of the population of the}} Maya highlands perished.|$|E
5000|$|I: Joshua 13:15-33 (° this Sabbath, or the {{preceding}} one, begins the three Sabbaths before the Fast of the 9th of Av (Tisha B'Av), the Three Sabbaths of Calamity, whose haftarot, {{at least for}} A and S, are two prophecies of Jeremiah, and one from Isaiah. In most years, Matot is combined with Masei and only the haftarah for Masei is read; only in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> Pinchas occurs before 18 Tammuz are Matot and Masei read on separate Sabbaths.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "silence on the {{objective}} level" [...] attributed to Korzybski and his insistence on consciousness of abstracting are parallel to some central ideas in Zen Buddhism. Korzybski is not recorded to have acknowledged any influence from this quarter, but he formulated general semantics during <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first popularizations of Zen were {{becoming part of}} the intellectual currency of educated speakers of English. On the other hand, later Zen-popularizer Alan Watts was influenced by ideas from general semantics.|$|R
5000|$|The Britts were lifelong Republicans, not {{converts}} {{from the}} Democratic Party, as {{have been most}} southern Republicans {{of the second half}} of the 20th century. Eldest daughter Nancy Britt Marsh said that her father [...] "was interested throughout his life in establishing a two-party system in the state. And I think he did. He continually stayed active in the party." [...] Britt was general counsel to the Arkansas GOP from 1962-1964, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> he chaired <b>the</b> Garland County party apparatus.|$|R
5|$|Coffin did {{not enjoy}} being {{in the public eye}} and {{considered}} his job soliciting financial aid as begging for money, which he thought to be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned about giving money freely to all blacks, some of whom he was believed {{would never be able to}} care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the Society should give their limited resources only to those who were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> black men were guaranteed the right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the two and}} a {{half year}} world tour in support of the albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II, Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash {{returned}} to Los Angeles. He soon sold his home, the Walnut House, and moved to Mulholland Drive. He built a small home studio, nicknamed The Snakepit, over his garage and began working on demos for songs he had written during the tour. Slash worked on the demos with Guns N' Roses bandmate and drummer Matt Sorum. They were later joined by guitarist Gilby Clarke and Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez, jamming and recording most nights. Slash played the demos for Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose who rejected the material, though he would later want to use them for the next Guns N' Roses album. They had recorded twelve songs by 1994, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> Guns N' Roses went on hiatus.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, {{the year}} that Jacob Rogers died and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) was formed through the merger of eight other {{locomotive}} manufacturers, the company reopened as the Rogers Locomotive Works. Reuben Wells was again the shop superintendent. But Rogers was at a competitive disadvantage. Not enough capital investment was made to purchase new equipment or in research and development. ALCO and Baldwin, the two companies that were {{at the time the}} largest locomotive manufacturers in North America, held too much of a lead in manufacturing and selling their own locomotives for Rogers to keep up. Compounding Rogers' troubles was the greater city of Paterson that had grown up around the shop. There was not any room for Rogers to expand.|$|E
50|$|Having become “an {{international}} superstar” and {{a continuous}} “box office hit throughout the world,” Plisetskaya was {{treated by the}} Soviet Union as a favored cultural emissary. Although she toured extensively during <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> other dancers defected, including Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov, Plisetskaya always refused to defect. Beginning in 1994, she presided over the annual international ballet competitions, called Maya, and in 1996 she was named President of the Imperial Russian Ballet. In 1991 she published her autobiography, I, Maya Plisetskaya.|$|R

5|$|In 2013 García, while {{representing}} Spain's U17 side, {{was awarded}} the Golden Boot award at the 2013 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship, ending the tournament as the top goalscorer and only player to have scored more than once. Spain were ultimately eliminated by Sweden in the semi-finals but ended the tournament in third after beating Belgium in the third place playoff. She was again part of the squad for the 2014 edition of the tournament where Spain went one step further, this time ending as runners-up to Germany. It {{was the second time}} in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> Spain had ended a major competition as runners-up, having lost to Japan in the final of the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in April.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{others were}} {{also working on}} the {{development}} of sound-on-film. In 1919, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> DeForest received his first patents in the field, three German inventors, Josef Engl (1893–1942), Hans Vogt (1890–1979), and Joseph Massolle (1889–1957), patented the Tri-Ergon sound system. On September 17, 1922, the Tri-Ergon group gave a public screening of sound-on-film productions—including a dramatic talkie, Der Brandstifter (The Arsonist) —before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin. By the end of the decade, Tri-Ergon would be the dominant European sound system. In 1923, two Danish engineers, Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen, patented a system that recorded sound on a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel. Gaumont licensed the technology and briefly put it to commercial use under the name Cinéphone.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>year</b> <b>that</b> she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague {{when she told him}} the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E
