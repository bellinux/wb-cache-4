Sage Yajnavalkya answers {{questions}} in the first five, wherein <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> posed by Brihaspati, Atri, students of Brahman-Atman, King Janaka and by Atri again. The last chapter lists the names of famous sages who were model sannyasis (renunciates).|$|E
25|$|The Court {{began by}} {{considering}} the argument that <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> not justiciable (i.e. {{the court did not}} have the authority to answer) based on it being a political question.

25|$|All {{students}} receive an analysis sheet {{along with their}} certificate, which records their answers for each question, along with the correct answers. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> divided into four categories: arithmetic, algebra, geometry and problem solving, {{and the number of}} questions that the student answered correctly for each category is listed along with the regional mean.|$|E

25|$|The CAGE is {{designed}} as a self-report questionnaire. It is obvious to the person what <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> about. Because talking about drinking behavior can be uncomfortable or stigmatized, people's responses {{may be subject to}} social desirability bias. The honesty and accuracy of responses may improve if the person trusts the person doing the interview or interpreting the score. Responses also may be more honest when the form is completed online, on a computer, or in other anonymous formats.|$|E

25|$|In {{probabilistic}} combinatorics, <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> of {{the following}} type: what is {{the probability of a}} certain property for a random discrete object, such as a random graph? For instance, what is the average number of triangles in a random graph? Probabilistic methods are also used to determine the existence of combinatorial objects with certain prescribed properties (for which explicit examples might be difficult to find), simply by observing that the probability of randomly selecting an object with those properties is greater than 0. This approach (often referred to as the probabilistic method) proved highly effective in applications to extremal combinatorics and graph theory. A closely related area is the study of finite Markov chains, especially on combinatorial objects. Here again probabilistic tools are used to estimate the mixing time.|$|E
500|$|All {{that exists}} in the scene is a {{procession}} of individuals, and the narrator conjectures on the rest. The altar and town exist as part of a world outside art, and the poem challenges the limitations of art through describing their possible existence. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> unanswered because there is no one who can ever know the true answers, as the locations are not real.

500|$|Due to {{the adult}} {{nature of the}} game, the game {{includes}} an age verification system consisting of trivia questions that Al Lowe assumed children would not know the answer to. As many of <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> U.S.-centric, they risked frustrating non-American players. If played today, the questions also include out-of-date cultural references. (One question begins [...] "OJ Simpson is..." [...] and one wrong answer is [...] "under indictment.") In the original AGI version, the age verification screen may be skipped by pressing Alt-X (or in the 1991 SCI remake, by pressing Ctrl-Alt-X).|$|E

500|$|According to Ausmus, Hoffman {{wanted his}} teams {{to feel like}} a family. He felt like he let his family down if he did not do his job on a {{particular}} night. Still, he was accessible and held himself accountable on the rare occasions that he failed. Hoffman was more accommodating for interviews after blown saves than he was after successful ones. [...] "The people asking <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> not responsible for the ball flying out of the park", he explained. Both Towers and Black best remember Hoffman for his accountability after his blown save in the 2007 Wild Card tie-breaker.|$|E
500|$|At its core, {{the game}} is a quiz {{competition}} in which {{the goal is to}} correctly answer a series of fourteen (originally fifteen) consecutive multiple-choice questions. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> of increasing difficulty, except in the 2010–15 format overhaul, where the contestants were faced with a round of ten questions of random difficulty, followed by a round of four questions of increasing difficulty. Each question is worth a specified amount of money; the amounts are cumulative in the first round, but not in the second. If the contestant gives a wrong answer to any question, their game is over and their winnings are reduced (or increased, in the first two questions) to $1,000 for tier-one questions, $5,000 for tier-two questions, and $50,000 for tier-three questions. However, the contestant has the option of [...] "walking away" [...] without giving an answer after being presented with a question, in which case the game ends and the contestant is guaranteed to walk away with all the money they have previously received. With the exception of the shuffle format, upon correctly answering questions five and ten, contestants are guaranteed at least the amount of prize money associated with that level. If the contestant gives an incorrect answer, their winnings drop down to the last milestone achieved. Since 2015, if the contestant answers a question incorrectly before reaching question five, he or she leaves with $1,000, even on the first question that is worth only $500. For celebrities, the minimum guarantee for their nominated charities is $10,000. Prior to the shuffle format, a contestant left with nothing if (s)he answered a question incorrectly before reaching the first milestone. In the shuffle format era, contestants who incorrectly answered a question had their winnings reduced to $1,000 in round one and $25,000 in round two.|$|E

30|$|Involving {{emotional}} {{events in}} the process of teaching improves memory and eases overcoming misconceptions (Cahill et al. 1994). Therefore, suspense stories like “How Galileo overcame superstitions” raise emotions improving memory and attendance thus easing concept change, according to results of neurological research (Erk et al. 2003). This memory improvement is confirmed by research on perception of movement (Gibson and Gibson 1994; Shapiro 2010). When <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> answered by students, fewer misconceptions showed up when <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> described by a picture, which can raise emotions as when <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> put in a linear form.|$|R
