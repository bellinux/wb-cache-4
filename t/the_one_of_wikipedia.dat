40|$|The "closed vs open " dualism is an {{integral}} part of the Internet, which is born and grown up as a collective open project based on a network architecture and planned to contain every kind of information and subject. Communities are an essential aspect of the Internet and can be defined as structured aggregation systems sharing common interests and objectives. One of the main contemporary community is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wikipedia,</b> the free encyclopedia, which collects knowledge and information in order to spread them around the world and potentially reach everyone on the planet. The way Wikipedia works is very similar to the bazaar model typical of free and open source projects, like GNU Linux and Mozilla, and defined by Eric Raymond in his essay “The cathedral and bazaar”. Some of the features which constitutes this model are collaboration, transparency, a global involvement in terms of number of people in action and geographical areas implicated and an active culture of participation which enables community users to influence decisions and tendencies of the project. The bazaar model demonstrated its effectiveness in several ways, first of all in the rise of Linux and of the FLOSS systems, then in the transition process from Nupedia (the first encyclopedia founded by Jim Wales) to Wikipedia. In both cases the success of a modus operandi has not been dictated only by ethical ideals, but also by functional and structural reasons which we will analyze in the progress of this paper and which will state the favorable connection between the sharing of knowledge and the model adopted to share it...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Inonly 10 years,Wikipediahasrisenfromobscuritytobecomethedominant infor-mation {{source for}} an entire generation. However, any visitor can edit any page onWikipe-dia, which hardly fosters {{confidence}} in its accuracy. In this article, I review thousands of Wikipediaarticlesaboutcandidates, elections, andofficeholders toassessboth theaccuracy and the thoroughness ofWikipedia’s coverage. I find thatWikipedia is almost always accu-ratewhenarelevantarticleexists,buterrorsofomissionareextremely frequent. Theseerrors of omission follow a predictable pattern. Wikipedia’s political coverage is often very good for recent or prominent topics but is lacking on older ormore obscure topics. Since its 2001 launch, Wikipedia has ballooned intothe world’s largest andmost popular reference site onthe Internet, eclipsing all competitors and puttingMicrosoft’s Encarta out of business entirely. 1 Over 12 million visitors have registered as volunteerWikipe-dia editors, with 150, 000 active editors as ofMay 2010. 2 This anon-ymous army has written every word on the site. At the same time, Wikipedia’s “crowd-sourcing ” approach to content creation pro-duces little confidence in its accuracy. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wikipedia’s</b> more infamous scandals emerged in 2007, when prolific editor “Essjay” {{was found to have}} used false credentials to persuade other volun...|$|R

The analysis and design of Social Machines has already started attracting considerable attention both within the industry and academia. Web science, however, is still missing a clear definition of what a Social Machine is, which has in turn resulted in several calls for a “philosophical engineering” (Halpin 2013; Hendler & Berners-Lee 2010); Halpin et al. 2010). This paper is a first attempt to respond to this call, by combining contemporary philosophy of mind and cognitive science with epistemology. The idea of philosophical engineering implies that a sufficiently good conception of Social Machines should be of both theoretical and practical advantage. To demonstrate how the present approach can satisfy both objectives it will be used in order to address <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wikipedia’s</b> (<b>the</b> most famous Social Machine to date) most worrying concerns—i. e., the current and ongoing {{decline in the number of}} its active contributors (Halfacker et al. 2012) ...|$|R

The English Wikipedia edition is by far the primary source of translations. We discuss the im-pact of these results for Wikipedia as well as user-generated content communities in general...|$|R

This paper departs from a statement of OERs and its current usage. Then, the paper goes into detail some related aspects. Which are the technical resources needed for them?
