5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{very successful}} in providing a framework for accurate models which describe {{an impressive array of}} physical phenomena. On the other hand, there are many interesting open questions, and in particular, the <b>theory</b> <b>as</b> a whole is almost certainly incomplete.|$|E
5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this <b>theory</b> <b>as</b> the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E
5|$|Euler {{worked in}} almost all areas of mathematics, such as geometry, infinitesimal calculus, trigonometry, algebra, and number <b>theory,</b> <b>as</b> well as {{continuum}} physics, lunar theory and other areas of physics. He is a seminal figure {{in the history of}} mathematics; if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 quarto volumes. Euler's name is associated with a large number of topics.|$|E

5|$|His {{interest}} in games {{led him to}} propose an early formal definition of a strategy, anticipating John von Neumann's more complete treatment {{of a few years}} later. Consequently, he is considered an early founder of modern game <b>theory.</b> <b>As</b> a result of his work on infinite games Steinhaus, together with another of his students, Jan Mycielski, proposed the Axiom of determinacy.|$|E
5|$|Hubble's law has two {{possible}} explanations. Either {{we are at}} the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the Copernican principle—or the universe is uniformly expanding everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang <b>theory</b> <b>as</b> developed by Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker.|$|E
5|$|Jose Brandao, a {{historian}} specializing in North American Native history, suggests that contemporary {{analyses of the}} Lachine Massacre continue to demonstrate cultural bias. Brandao criticizes historians Parkman, Charles McIlwain, and George Hunt for citing the growing dependence on European goods (which were, according to these historians, viewed by the Iroquois as superior to other goods) {{as a reason for}} Iroquois dissatisfaction and violence. Brandao dismisses this <b>theory</b> <b>as</b> a largely ethnocentric interpretation with little evidence to support it. Brandao also dismisses Hunt’s suggestion that natives, similar to the Europeans, waged wars for economic reasons.|$|E

5|$|One of Euler's {{more unusual}} {{interests}} was {{the application of}} mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the Tentamen novae theoriae musicae, hoping to eventually incorporate musical <b>theory</b> <b>as</b> part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.|$|E
5|$|Regressive theory : Viruses {{may have}} once been small cells that {{parasitised}} larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They lend credence to this <b>theory,</b> <b>as</b> {{their dependence on}} parasitism {{is likely to have}} caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell.|$|E
5|$|The early 19th-century {{zoologist}} Jean-Baptiste Lamarck {{suggested the}} inheritance of acquired characteristics {{as a mechanism}} for evolutionary change; adaptive traits acquired by an organism during its lifetime could be inherited by that organism's progeny, eventually causing transmutation of species. This theory, Lamarckism, was an influence on the Soviet biologist Trofim Lysenko's antagonism to mainstream genetic <b>theory</b> <b>as</b> late as the mid 20th century.|$|E

5|$|With {{the rise}} of nation-states and the Protestant Reformation, the theory of divine right {{justified}} the king's absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters. The theory {{came to the fore}} in England under the reign of James I of England (1603–1625, also known as James VI of Scotland 1567–1625). Louis XIV of France (1643–1715) strongly promoted the <b>theory</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E
5|$|After resigning {{from the}} {{university}} museum in 1957, Lethbridge moved with his wife to Branscombe, Devon. There he devoted himself to researching paranormal phenomena, publishing a string of {{books on the subject}} aimed at a popular rather than academic audience. Most of this involved his research into the use of pendulums for dowsing, although in other publications he championed the witch-cult hypothesis of Margaret Murray, articulated the Stone Tape <b>theory</b> <b>as</b> an explanation for ghost sightings, and argued that extraterrestrial species were involved in shaping human evolution; in this he came to embrace and perpetuate the esoteric ideas of the Earth mysteries movement. Although his work in parapsychology was derided and ignored as pseudo-scientific by the academic establishment, he attracted a cult following, and his work was posthumously championed by esotericists like Colin Wilson and Julian Cope. In 2011 he was made the subject of a biography by Terry Welbourn.|$|E
5|$|Beebe was {{relatively}} undeterred by the scientific community's acceptance of Heilmann's rejection of his <b>theory,</b> <b>as</b> {{is evidenced by}} the fact that he was still writing about his Tetrapteryx hypothesis well into the 1940s. His adherence to his theory was well-placed, as in 2003 a revolutionary discovery was made in the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China: Microraptor gui, the small, four-winged dromaeosaur that had led to renewed credence of the arboreal model for the origin of bird flight. This animal's most remarkable feature was the existence of long, pennaceous feathers on both its arms and legs, forming a set of four aerodynamic wings that its discoverers theorized were used for gliding. This discovery had the immediate effect of resurrecting the idea that leg feathers may have had some bearing on the origin of flight in birds, building on the idea originally proposed by Beebe and rejected by Heilmann.|$|E

5|$|Cycle detection, {{the problem}} of {{following}} a path in a functional graph to find a cycle in it, has applications in cryptography and computational number <b>theory,</b> <b>as</b> part of Pollard's rho algorithm for integer factorization and as a method for finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions. In these applications, ƒ is expected to behave randomly; Flajolet and Odlyzko study the graph-theoretic properties of the functional graphs arising from randomly chosen mappings. In particular, a form of the birthday paradox implies that, in a random functional graph with n vertices, the path starting from a randomly selected vertex will typically loop back on itself to form a cycle within O(√n) steps. Konyagin et al. have made analytical and computational progress on graph statistics.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged <b>theory.</b> <b>As</b> a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E
5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the <b>theory</b> <b>as</b> being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, most cricketers {{considered}} it unsportsmanlike to bowl {{the ball at}} the leg stump or for batsmen to hit on the leg side. But by {{the early years of}} the 20th century, some bowlers—usually slow or medium-paced—used leg <b>theory</b> <b>as</b> a tactic; the ball was aimed outside the line of leg stump and the fielders placed on that side of the field, the object being to test the batsman's patience and force a rash stroke. Two English left-arm bowlers, George Hirst in 1903—04 and Frank Foster in 1911—12, bowled leg theory to packed leg side fields in Test matches in Australia; Warwick Armstrong used it regularly for Australia. In the years immediately before the First World War, several bowlers used leg theory in county cricket.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{superstring}} revolution in 1984, many physicists turned to string <b>theory</b> <b>as</b> a unified theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory {{was able to}} accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian. In string theory, the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.|$|E
5|$|Jean Buridan (1300–1358) also {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} this motion-generating property, which he named impetus, dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by {{the resistance of the}} air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his <b>theory</b> <b>as</b> only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.|$|E
