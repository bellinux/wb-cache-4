During a recent paediatric airway emergency at Torbay hospital, Devon, the theatre staff were unable <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> the paediatric bronchoscope. We therefore investigated methods to improve the efficiency and timeliness of the assembly of the paediatric bronchoscope. To assess the current problem we asked ten theatre staff at random <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> the paediatric bronchoscope. 70 % of the staff were not able <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> the paediatric bronchoscope. A prompt poster was developed as a visual aid to help demonstrate how <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> the paediatric bronchoscope. Another ten theatre staff were asked <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> the paediatric bronchoscope. Now all of the staff were able <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> the paediatric bronchoscope.

40|$|Archaeal box C/D sRNAs {{guide the}} {{methylation}} of specific nucleotides in archaeal ribosomal and tRNAs. Three Methanocaldococcus jannaschii sRNP core proteins (ribosomal protein L 7, Nop 56 / 58, and fibrillarin) bind the <b>box</b> C/D sRNAs <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> the sRNP complex, and these core proteins {{are essential for}} nucleotide methylation. A distinguishing feature of the Nop 56 / 58 core protein is the coiled-coil domain, established by α-helices 4 and 5, that facilitates Nop 56 / 58 self-dimerization in vitro. The function of this coiled-coil domain has been assessed for box C/D sRNP assembly, sRNP structure, and sRNP-guided nucleotide methylation by mutating or deleting this protein domain. Protein pull-down experiments demonstrated that Nop 56 / 58 self-dimerization and Nop 56 / 58 dimerization with the core protein fibrillarin are mutually exclusive protein:protein interactions. Disruption of Nop 56 / 58 homodimerization by alteration of specific amino acids or deletion of the entire coiled-coil domain had no obvious effect upon core protein binding and sRNP assembly. Site-directed mutation of the Nop 56 / 58 homodimerization domain also had no apparent effect upon either box C/D RNP- or C′/D′ RNP-guided nucleotide modification. However, deletion of this domain disrupted guided methylation from both RNP complexes. Nuclease probing of the sRNP assembled with Nop 56 / 58 proteins mutated in the coiled-coil domain indicated that while functional complexes were <b>assembled,</b> <b>box</b> C/D and C′/D′ RNPs were altered in structure. Collectively, these experiments revealed that the self-dimerization of the Nop 56 / 58 coiled-coil domain is not required for assembly of a functional sRNP, but the coiled-coil domain {{is important for the}} establishment of wild-type box C/D and C′/D′ RNP structure essential for nucleotide methylation...|$|R
