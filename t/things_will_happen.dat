For the record, it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they {{thought they were going to}} get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen.</b> I'm telling you, amazing <b>things</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Harvard {{economist}} and former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers explains Hayek's place in modern economics: [...] "What's {{the single most}} important thing to learn from an economics course today? What I tried to leave my students with is the view that the invisible hand is more powerful than the hidden hand. <b>Things</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> in well-organized efforts without direction, controls, plans. That's the consensus among economists. That's the Hayek legacy." ...|$|E

5000|$|This is {{also when}} {{measurement}} predicts {{a relationship between}} what is measured and something else; predicting {{whether or not the}} other <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> in the future.
