25|$|As the {{shooting}} unfolded, Patti Nielson <b>talked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with emergency services, telling her story and urging {{students to take}} cover beneath desks. According to transcripts, her call was received by a 9-1-1 operator at 11:25:05a.m. The time between the call being answered and the shooters entering the library was four minutes and ten seconds. Before entering, the shooters threw two bombs into the cafeteria, both of which exploded. They then threw another bomb into the Library Hallway; it exploded and damaged several lockers. At 11:29a.m., Harris and Klebold entered the library, where a total of 52 students, two teachers and two librarians had concealed themselves.|$|E

The two <b>talked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> for about 40 minutes, where West explained some of the concepts for the project, and invited him down to his studio in Hawaii. West is a big admirer of Bon Iver's album For Emma, Forever Ago, and was impressed with Vernon's unique use of auto-tune. The two artists became friends while playing games of basketball together, and West introduced him to Jeff Bhasker, one of his main producers.|$|E
2500|$|On June 8, 1981, Cotten had a {{heart attack}} {{followed}} by a stroke that affected his speech center. He began years of therapy which in time made it possible for him to speak again. As he began to recover, he and Orson Welles <b>talked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> each week for a couple of hours: [...] "He was strong and supportive," [...] Cotten wrote, [...] "and whenever I used the wrong word (which was frequently) he would say, 'That's a much better word, Jo, I'm going to use it.'" [...] He and Welles would meet for lunch and reminisce, and when Cotten said he had written a book Welles asked for the manuscript and read it that same night. In a phone conversation on October 9, 1985, Welles told his friend and mentor Roger Hill that Cotten had written a book, and Hill asked how it read. [...] "Gentle, witty, and self-effacing, just like Jo," [...] Welles replied. [...] "My only complaint is that it's too brief." [...] Welles died the following day. [...] "Somewhere among his possessions is a manuscript of this book," [...] Cotten wrote on the last page of his autobiography, published in 1987 under the title Vanity Will Get You Somewhere.|$|E

40|$|Listening {{to music}} or <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> while cycling {{as well as}} the growing number of quiet (electric) cars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road can make the use of {{auditory}} cues challenging for cyclists. The present study examined to what extent and in which traffic situations traffic sounds are important for safe cycling. Furthermore, the study investigated the potential safety implications of limited auditory information caused by quiet (electric) cars and by cyclists listening to music or <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> An Internet survey among 2249 cyclists in three age groups (16 – 18, 30 – 40 and 65 – 70  year old) was carried out to collect information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following aspects: 1) the auditory perception of traffic sounds, including the sounds of quiet (electric) cars; 2) the possible compensatory behaviours of cyclists who listen to music or <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> their mobile phones; 3) the possible contribution of listening to music and <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to cycling crashes and incidents. Age differences with respect to those three aspects were analysed. Results show that listening to music and <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> negatively affects perception of sounds crucial for safe cycling. However, taking into account the influence of confounding variables, no relationship was found between the frequency of listening to music or <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and <b>the</b> frequency of incidents among teenage cyclists. This may be due to cyclists’ compensating for the use of portable devices. Listening to music or <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> whilst cycling may still pose a risk in the absence of compensatory behaviour or in a traffic environment with less extensive and less safe cycling infrastructure than the Dutch setting. With the increasing number of quiet (electric) cars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road, cyclists in the future may also need to compensate for the limited auditory input of these cars...|$|R

50|$|Cosby says he paid over $100,000 over 20 {{years to}} keep the affair with Upshaw secret. The money went to a trust fund for Jackson, paid for Jackson's car, and her college tuition.
