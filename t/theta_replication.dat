50|$|When the {{replication}} fork moves around the circle, a structure shaped like the Greek letter theta Ө is formed. John Cairns demonstrated the theta structure of E. coli chromosomal replication in 1963, using an innovative method to visualize DNA replication. In his experiment, he radioactively labeled the chromosome by growing his cultures {{in a medium}} containing 3H-thymidine. The nucleoside base was incorporated uniformly into the bacterial chromosome. He then isolated the chromosomes by lysing the cells gently and placed them on an electron micrograph (EM) grid which he exposed to X-ray film for two months. This Experiment clearly demonstrates the <b>theta</b> <b>replication</b> model of circular bacterial chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|The P1 plasmid has a {{separate}} {{origin of replication}} (oriL) that is activated during the lytic cycle. Replication begins by a regular bidirectional <b>theta</b> <b>replication</b> at oriL but later in the lytic phase,it switches to a rolling circle method of replication using the host recombination machinery. This results in numerous copies of the genome being present on a single linear DNA molecule called a concatemer. The end of the concatemer is cut a specific site called the pac site or packaging site. This {{is followed by the}} packing of the DNA into the heads till they are full. The rest of the concatemer that does not fit into one head is separated and the machinery begins packing this into a new head. The location of the cut is not sequence specific. Each head holds around 110kbp of DNA so there is a little more than one complete copy of the genome (~90kbp) in each head, with the ends of the strand in each head being identical. After infecting a new cell this terminal redundancy is used by the host recombination machinery to cyclize the genome if it lacks two copies of the lox locus. If two lox sites are present (one in each terminally redundant end) the cyclization is carried out by the cre recombinase.|$|E

Presence of Rac compensated the absence of dnaA function, causing initiation of replication. In dnaAts rac(+) cells at 43 °, most of parental phage DNA molecules, after one round of <b>theta</b> <b>replication,</b> switched to a replication with features of the sigma mode and produced progeny at high yield. Initiation of replication of the λPts 1 mutant at 43 ° was blocked by dnaA function; however, under dnaA(-) rac(+) conditions all parental phage DNA molecules, after one round of <b>theta</b> <b>replication,</b> switched to the sigma mode and produced progeny at high yield. Taking into account our recent finding that transcriptional activation of oriλ seems to be dnaA-regulated (to be published elsewhere), we suggest that the DnaA-λPts 1 incompatibility occurs at the insertion of the oriλ-bound λO-λP-DnaB preprimosome between the complementary λ DNA strands. The role of Rac and the mechanism of the switch from theta to sigma mode of λ phage DNA replication are discussed...|$|E

Cells exhibiting this inhibition phenotype (IP) prevent the plating of homo-immune and hybrid hetero-immune lambdoid phages.

IP was observed in cells with plasmids containing a l DNA fragment including oop, encoding a short OOP micro RNA, and part of the lambda origin of replication, oril, defined by iteron sequences ITN 1 - 4 and an adjacent high AT-rich sequence. Transcription of the intact oop sequence from its promoter, pO is required for IP, as are iterons ITN 3 – 4, but not the high AT-rich portion of oril.

The minimal replicon {{that is essential}} and sufficient for autonomous replication and stable maintenance in Haloarcula hispanica was determined by deletion analysis of the plasmid. This minimal replicon (∼ 1. 8 kb) consisted of only two functionally related segments: (i) a putative origin (ori 201) containing an AT-rich region and sets of repeats and (ii) an adjacent gene encoding a putative replication initiation protein (Rep 201). Electron microscopic observation and Southern blotting analysis demonstrated that pSCM 201 replicates via a theta mechanism. Precise mapping of the putative origin suggested that the replication initiated from a fixed site close to the AT-rich region and proceeded unidirectionally toward the downstream rep 201 gene, which was further confirmed by electron microscopic analysis of the ClaI-digested replication intermediates.

40|$|The {{replication}} of covalently closed circular supercoiled (form I) DNA in prokaryotes is generally controlled at the initiation level by a rate-limiting effector. Once initiated, replication proceeds via {{one of two}} possible modes (<b>theta</b> or sigma <b>replication)</b> which do not rely on functions involved in DNA repair and general recombination. Recently, a novel plasmid replication mode, leading to the accumulation of linear multigenome-length plasmid concatemers in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, has been described. Unlike form I DNA replication, an intermediate recombination step is most probably involved in the initiation of concatemeric plasmid DNA replication. On the basis of structural and functional studies, we infer that recombination-dependent plasmid replication shares important features with phage late replication modes and, in several aspects, parallels the synthesis of plasmid concatemers in phage-infected cells.

40|$|The local {{separation}} of duplex DNA strands (strand opening) {{is necessary for}} initiating basic transactions on DNA such as transcription, replication and homologous recombination. Strand opening is commonly a stage at which these processes are regulated. Many different mechanisms are used to open the DNA duplex, the details of which are of great current interest. In this review, we focus on a few well-studied cases of DNA replication origin opening in bacteria. In particular, we discuss the opening of origins that support the <b>theta</b> () mode of <b>replication,</b> which is used by all chromosomal origins and many extra-chromosomal elements such as plasmids and phages. Although the details of opening can vary among different origins, a common theme is binding of the initiator to multiple sites at the origin, causing stress that opens an adjacent and intrinsically unstable A+T rich region. The initiator stabilizes the opening by capturing one of the open strands. How the initiator binding energy is harnessed for strand opening remains to be understood...|$|R
40|$|Bifidobacterium longum DJO 10 A is {{a recent}} human isolate with {{probiotic}} characteristics and contains two plasmids, designated pDOJH 10 L and pDOJH 10 S. The complete sequences of both these plasmids have now been determined and consist of two circular DNA molecules of 10, 073 and 3, 661 bp, with G+C contents of 62. 2 % and 66. 2 %, respectively. Plasmid pDOJH 10 L is a cointegrate plasmid consisting of DNA regions exhibiting very high sequence identity to two other B. longum plasmids, pNAC 2 (98 %) and pKJ 50 (96 %), together with another region. Interestingly, the rolling circular replication (RCR) regions of both the pNAC 2 - and pKJ 50 -like plasmids were disrupted during the recombination event leading to a further recombination event to acquire a functional replicon. This consists of a new fused rep gene and an RCR-type ori consisting of a conserved DnaA box in an AT-rich region followed by four contiguous repeated sequences consistent with an iteron structure and an inverted repeat. The smaller pDOJH 10 S had no sequence similarity to any other characterized plasmid from bifidobacteria. In addition, it did not contain any features consistent with RCR, which is the replication mechanism proposed for all the bifidobacteria plasmids characterized to date. It did exhibit sequence similarity with several <b>theta</b> replication-related <b>replication</b> proteins from other gram-positive, high-G+C bacteria, with the closest match from a Rhodococcus rhodochrous plasmid, suggesting a <b>theta</b> mechanism of <b>replication.</b> S 1 nuclease analysis of both plasmids in B. longum DJO 10 A revealed single-strand DNA intermediates for pDOJH 10 L, which is consistent for RCR, but none were detected for pDOJH 10 S. As the G+C content of pDOJH 10 S {{is similar to that}} of Rhodococcus rhodochrous (67 %) and significantly higher than that of B. longum (60. 1 %), it may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer from a Rhodococcus species, as both genera are members of the Actinomycetes and are intestinal inhabitants. An Escherichia coli-B. longum shuttle cloning vector was constructed from pDOJH 10 S and the E. coli ori region of p 15 A, a lacZ gene with a multiple cloning site of pUC 18, and a chloramphenicol resistance gene (CAT) of pCI 372 and was transformed successfully into E. coli and B. longum. It could not be introduced into lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus and Lactobacillus), showing it was not very promiscuous. It was stably maintained in B. longum in the absence of antibiotic pressure for 92 generations, which is consistent with the segregational stability of theta-replicating plasmids in gram-positive bacteria. This is the first cloning vector for bifidobacteria that does not utilize RCR and should be useful for the stable introduction of heterologous genes into these dominant inhabitants of the large intestine...|$|R

Plasmid pSF 118 - 20 encodes a toxin-antitoxin system composed of pemI and pemK homologs, and this plasmid could be cured when PemI was produced in trans.

Strain FW 213 harbors a 7. 0 -kb cryptic plasmid, pFW 213, with a copy number at 5 to 10 per chromosome. Sequence and functional analyses of pFW 213 revealed that the open reading frame (ORF) encoding the replication protein (Rep) is essential for the replication of pFW 213, and the putative plasmid addiction system (RelB and RelE) and an ORF (ORF 6) with no known function are required for its stability. The minimal replicon of pFW 213 contains the rep gene and its 5 ′-flanking 390 -bp region. Within the minimal replicon, an A/T-rich region followed by 5 contiguous 22 -bp repeats was located 5 ′ of the ATG of rep. No single-stranded replication intermediates were detected in the derivatives of pFW 213, suggesting that pFW 213 replicates via the <b>theta</b> <b>replication</b> mechanism.

40|$|Recombination-dependent DNA replication, {{which is}} a central {{component}} of viral replication restart, is poorly understood in Firmicutes bacteriophages. Phage SPP 1 initiates unidirectional <b>theta</b> DNA <b>replication</b> from a discrete replication origin (oriL), and when replication progresses, the fork might stall by the binding of the origin binding protein G 38 P to the late replication origin (oriR). Replication restart is dependent on viral recombination proteins to synthesize a linear head-to-tail concatemer, which is the substrate for viral DNA packaging. To identify new functions involved in this process, uncharacterized genes from phage SPP 1 were analyzed. Immediately after infection, SPP 1 transcribes a number of genes involved in recombination and replication from P(E 2) and P(E 3) promoters. Resequencing the region corresponding to the last two hypothetical genes transcribed from the P(E 2) operon (genes 44 and 45) showed {{that they are in}} fact a single gene, re-annotated here as gene 44, that encodes a single polypeptide, named gene 44 product (G 44 P, 27. 5 kDa). G 44 P shares a low but significant degree of identity in its C-terminal region with virus-encoded RusA-like resolvases. The data presented here demonstrate that G 44 P, {{which is a}} dimer in solution, binds with high affinity but without sequence specificity to several double-stranded DNA recombination intermediates. G 44 P preferentially cleaves Holliday junctions, but also, with lower efficiency, replicated D-loops. It also partially complemented the loss of RecU resolvase activity in B. subtilis cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Gram-positive {{bacteria}} of {{the genus}} Rhodococcus have shown an extraordinary capacity for metabolizing recalcitrant organic compounds. One hindrance to the full exploitation of Rhodococcus is the dearth of genetic tools available for strain manipulation. To address this issue, we sought to develop a plasmid-based system for genetic manipulation {{of a variety of}} Rhodococcus strains. Results We isolated and sequenced pB 264, a 4, 970 bp cryptic plasmid from Rhodococcus sp. B 264 - 1 with features of a theta-type replication mechanism. pB 264 was nearly identical to pKA 22, a previously sequenced but uncharacterized cryptic plasmid. Derivatives of pB 264 replicate in a diverse range of Rhodococcus species, showing that this plasmid does not bear the same host range restrictions that have been exhibited by other theta replicating plasmids. Replication or maintenance of pB 264 is inhibited at 37 °C, making pB 264 useful as a suicide vector for genetic manipulation of Rhodococcus. A series of deletions revealed that ca. 1. 3 kb from pB 264 was sufficient to support replication and stable inheritance of the plasmid. This region includes two open reading frames that encode functions (RepAB) that can support replication of pB 264 derivatives in trans. Rhodococcus sp. B 264 - 1 will mobilize pB 264 into other Rhodococcus species via conjugation, making it possible to genetically modify bacterial strains that are otherwise difficult to transform. The cis -acting element (oriT) required for conjugal transfer of pB 264 resides within a ca. 0. 7 kb region that is distinct from the regions responsible for replication. Conclusion Shuttle vectors derived from pB 264 will be useful for genetic studies and strain improvement in Rhodococcus, and will also be useful for studying the processes of <b>theta</b> <b>replication</b> and conjugal transfer among actinomycetes. </p...|$|E

It was 5. 5 kb in size, and was mapped by restriction endonuclease digestion. Two previously cloned fragments from this plasmid (the origin fragment and the fusiform fragment, both can autonomously replicate) {{were shown to}} overlap. A shuttle plasmid was constructed that contained pVY 103 combined with Escherichia coli plasmid pUC 18 and a neomycin resistance gene, and was functional in both E. coli and B. megaterium. Plasmid stability assays revealed the instability of pVY 103 when pUC 18 was inserted into it. Moreover, sporulation efficiency tests using strains containing different combinations of plasmid origins suggested that the origin from plasmid pVY 103 might interfere with host sporulation. This effect could be reduced when this origin coexisted with a <b>theta</b> <b>replication</b> origin. DNA sequencing of the 2. 3 -kb origin fragment of pVY 103 revealed two putative ORFs with little homology to known sequences. ORF 1 could encode a protein of 298 amino acids with a molecular weight of 34, 505 and a pi of 9. 51. ORF 2 could encode a protein of 110 amino acids with a molecular weight of 12, 912 and a pi of 10. A 25 -bp region was found within the 5 ' end of ORF 1 to have 76 % identity to the consensus sequence of the plus strand origin of the pUB 110 /pC 194 family, which replicates by the rolling circle mechanism. A aA promoter region and a ribosomal binding site were found preceding ORF 1. No such sequences could be identified preceding ORF 2. No rho-independent transcription terminator could be found following ORF 1 or ORF 2. Subcloning showed that ORF 1 was necessary for replication. In addition, {{a surprising number of}} direct and inverted repeats was found spanning the entire origin fragment, with a very low probability (< 0. 0001) according to statistical analysis that these would be found by chance.

Heterologous Escherichia coli or bacteriophage A DNA fragments of various sizes were inserted into vectors based on either the rolling-circle-type plasmid pVVO 1 or the theta-type plasmid pAM,l. All pAM 1 il derivatives were stably maintained. pVV 01 derivatives, however, showed size-dependent segregational instability, in particular when large DNA fragments were inserted. All recombinant pWV 01 derivatives generated high-molecular-weight plasmid multimers (HMW) in amounts that were positively correlated with plasmid size and inversely correlated with the copy numbers of the monomeric plasmid forms.

40|$|Trypanosoma brucei {{and related}} parasites are causative agents of severe {{diseases}} that affect global health and economy. T. brucei {{is responsible for}} sleeping sickness in humans (African trypanosomiasis) and a wasting disease in livestock. More than 100 years after T. brucei was identified as the etiological agent for sleeping sickness, available treatments remain inadequate, complicated by toxicity, lengthy and expensive administration regiments, and drug-resistance. There is clear need {{for the development of}} a new antitrypanosomal drugs. Due to the unique evolutionary position of these early diverging eukaryotes, trypanosomes posses a number of biological properties unparalleled in other organisms, including humans, which could prove valuable for new drug targets. One of the most distinctive properties of trypanosomes is their mitochondrial DNA, called kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). kDNA is composed of over five thousand circular DNA molecules (minicircles and maxicircles) catenated into a topologically complex network. Replication of kDNA requires an elaborate topoisomerase-mediated release and reattachment mechanism for minicircle <b>theta</b> structure <b>replication</b> and at least five DNA polymerases. Three of these (POLIB, POLIC, and POLID) are related to bacterial DNA polymerase I and are required for kDNA maintenance and growth. Each polymerase appears to make a specialized contribution to kDNA replication. ^ The research described in this dissertation is a significant contribution to the field of kDNA replication and the advancement of kDNA replication proteins as putative drug targets for sleeping sickness. Functional characterization of POLIB indicated that it participates in minicircle replication but is likely not the only polymerase contributing to this process. Gene silencing of POLIB partially blocked minicircle replication and led to the production of a previously unidentified free minicircle species, fraction U. Characterization of fraction U confirmed its identity as a population of dimeric minicircles with non-uniform linking numbers. Fraction U was not produced in response to silencing numerous other previously studied kDNA replication proteins but, as we demonstrated here, is also produced in response to POLID silencing. This common phenotype led us to hypothesize that POLIB and POLID both participate in minicircle replication. Simultaneously silencing both polymerases completely blocked minicircle replication, supporting a model of minicircle replication requiring both POLIB and POLID. Finally, we demonstrate that disease-causing trypanosomes require kDNA and the kDNA replication proteins POLIB, POLIC, and POLID. These data provide novel insights into the fascinating mechanism of kDNA replication and support the pursuit of kDNA replication proteins as novel drug targets for combating African trypanosomiasis. ...|$|R

Transcription of the repN gene starts 167 nucleotides upstream from the translational start site of repN. The copy number of repN-coding plasmid pHDCS 2, in which the repN gene was placed downstream of the IPTG (isopropyl- 1 -thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) -inducible Pspac promoter, was increased 100 fold by the addition of IPTG. Histidine-tagged RepN bound to a specific region in the repN gene containing five 22 -bp tandem repeats (iterons) with partial mismatches, as shown by gel retardation and foot printing analyses. Sequence alterations in the first three iterons resulted in an increase in plasmid copy number, whereas those in either the forth or fifth iteron resulted in the failure of plasmid replication. The iterons expressed various degrees of incompatibility with an incoming repN-driven replicon pSEQ 243, with the first three showing the strongest incompatibility. Finally, by using a plasmid, pHDMAEC 21, carrying the sequence alterations in all the five iterons in repN and thus unable to replicate but encoding intact RepN, the region necessary for replication was confined to a 96 -bp sequence spanning the 3 ′-terminal half of the fourth iteron to an A+T-rich region located downstream of the fifth iteron. From these results, we conclude that the iterons in repN are involved in both the control of plasmid copy number and incompatibility, and we suggest that the binding of RepN to the last two iterons triggers replication by melting the A+T-rich DNA sequence...|$|R
