5|$|The bark {{of other}} {{varieties}} of oak {{has traditionally been}} used in Europe for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been used elsewhere. <b>The</b> <b>active</b> <b>ingredient,</b> tannin, is extracted and after various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed {{in a series of}} vats containing solutions in increasing concentrations. The tannin causes the hide to become supple, less affected by water and more resistant to bacterial attack.|$|E
5|$|The major {{turning point}} for {{salicylate}} medicines came in 1763, when a letter from English chaplain Edward Stone was read {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society, describing the dramatic power of willow bark extract to cure ague—an ill-defined constellation of symptoms, including intermittent fever, pain, and fatigue, that primarily referred to malaria. Inspired by the doctrine of signatures to search for a treatment for agues near the brackish waters that were known to cause it, Stone had tasted the bark of a willow tree in 1758 and noticed an astringency reminiscent of the standard—and expensive—ague cure of Peruvian bark. He collected, dried, and powdered a substantial amount of willow bark, and over the next five years tested it on a number of people sick with fever and agues. In his letter, Stone reported consistent success, describing willow extract's effects as identical to Peruvian bark, though a little less potent. (In fact, <b>the</b> <b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> of Peruvian bark was quinine, which attacked the infectious cause of malaria, while <b>the</b> <b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> of willow extract, salicin, relieved the symptoms of malaria but could not cure it.) Stone's letter (mistakenly attributed to Edmund rather than Edward Stone) was printed in Philosophical Transactions, and by the end of the 18th century willow was gaining popularity as an inexpensive substitute for Peruvian bark.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain <b>the</b> <b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E

40|$|In {{considering}} {{the possibility of}} controlling the spray volume of pesticides according to cultivation period, actual spray volumes for controlling insect pests were investigated in an apple orchard {{in the city of}} Gongju in Chungnam province. Before the flowering period, a spray volume of 372 l/ 10 a was sprayed in the middle of April, whereas 449 – 452 l/ 10 a was sprayed from June to August when the leaves and fruit were luxuriate. Though 372 l/ 10 a, much less than the standard spray volume, was used for controlling moths around the middle of April, more than the amount of <b>the</b> <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> sufficient for LC 95, 0. 018 kg a. i. / 10 a, was attached in all treated plots. In mid–July and late August, however, the standard spray volume, 450 l/ 10 a was sprayed, but the amount of <b>the</b> <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> in several plots was less than that inquired for LC 95.
