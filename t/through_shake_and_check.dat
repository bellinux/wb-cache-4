40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the definition of}} the force modification factor (q-factor) in the literature and its relevance to the design of structures in seismic areas. The available methods for estimating the q-factor are based on the verification of the non-linear seismic response of entire buildings by means of experimental full scale shake table tests or numerical simulations. Such procedures are very expensive from cost and computational points of view. This paper proposes a new procedure for the q-factor evaluation based on a proper application of the pushover method to the load-displacement curve obtained through experimental quasi static tests on representative wall elements. That procedure is validated <b>through</b> <b>shake</b> table tests <b>and</b> numerical simulations on Cross-Laminated-Timber (CLT) building systems. An extensive application of the proposed procedure to a number of CLT shearwall systems tested in the CNR-IVALSA laboratory is presented in order to carry out a reliable estimation of appropriate q-factors.

40|$|During 1973 – 1986 the {{seismicity}} in Santa Monica Bay {{consisted of}} an average of four events per year of M_L ≥ 2. 5, {{in addition to the}} 1979 Malibu (M_L = 5. 0) mainshock-aftershock sequence. The 1979 sequence ruptured a north dipping thrust fault at 10 – 15 km depth beneath the bay. A diffuse distribution of seismicity extends across the bay from the terminus of the Palos Verdes fault to Point Dume. Two thirds of the single-event focal mechanisms of 36 events that are located within the bay show mostly thrust or reverse faulting on west to west-northwest striking planes. A third of the focal mechanisms exhibit strike-slip faulting on north to north-northwest striking planes. A stress inversion of the focal mechanism data shows that the maximum principal stress is oriented N 13 °E in a horizontal plane and the minimum principal stress is oriented N 102 °E and plunging 47 °. Hence the tectonics in Santa Monica Bay are dominated by compression, with thrust, reverse, and strike-slip faulting. The coexistence of thrust and strike-slip faults suggests that the bay is {{not a part of the}} Peninsular Ranges terrane but forms a transition zone that accommodates the change from strike-slip in the Peninsular Ranges to the south to reverse faulting in the Transverse Ranges to the north. Mapped anticlines and the previously unrecognized thrust faults beneath the bay form two fold and thrust belts that present additional seismic hazards to Los Angeles and the southern California coastal zone <b>through</b> seismic <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> possible generation of small tsunamis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Information on the HIV and AIDS-related {{knowledge}} among dental students {{provides a}} crucial foundation for efforts aimed at developing an appropriate dental curriculum on HIV and AIDS, and for attracting {{the attention of}} dental school educators towards the subject. Purposes Focusing on a census of dental students attending their 3 rd, 4 th and 5 th study year at publicly – and privately funded dental faculties in Khartoum, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and socio-economic correlates of dental students' knowledge, sources of information and reported need for further education related to HIV and AIDS. Methods At {{the time of the}} survey (March–May 2007), the total number of dental students registered was 782 of which 642 (response rate 82 %, mean age 21. 7 year, 72 % girls) completed anonymous self-administered questionnaires in supervised class room settings. Results A total of 49 % and 86 % had correct sum scores with respect to knowledge of transmission <b>through</b> contamination <b>and</b> <b>through</b> <b>shaking</b> hands <b>and</b> eating, respectively. About half the dental students recognized a need for further education across HIV related issues, varying from 75 % (basic HIV/AIDS related issues) to 84 % (patient management). Only 38 % of the students had correct sum scores regarding various occupational groups at risk for contacting HIV and AIDS. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that compared to privately funded dental school students, publicly funded dental school students were less likely to have correct knowledge about modes of HIV transmission (OR = 0. 6) and occupational risk groups (OR = 0. 6) and to have received information from lectures/health care workers (OR = 0. 5). Conclusion Students attending privately funded schools were more knowledgeable about various HIV related issues than students from publicly funded schools. About half of the students investigated had received HIV/AIDS information from various sources and reported need for further education. This suggests that students are not adequately prepared for treating patients with HIV infection and AIDS and that the dental school curriculum needs improvements. Differences between public and private dental schools should be considered when planning such improvements. </p...|$|R

In Japan, co-sleeping is common during infancy and early childhood. This study investigates the prevalence of <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering and their associations with co-sleeping among 4 -month-old infants in Japan. A questionnaire was administered to mothers who participated in a 4 -month health checkup program in Kamagaya City in Japan (n = 1307; valid response rate, 82 %). The questionnaire investigated the frequency of self-reported <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering during the past one month, co-sleeping status, and living arrangements with grandparents, in addition to traditional risk factors such as stress due to crying. Associations between co-sleeping <b>and</b> self-reported <b>shaking</b> or smothering were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. The prevalence of self-reported <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering at least one time during the past one month was 3. 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 2. 4 %– 4. 3 %) and 2. 4 % (95 % CI, 1. 5 %– 3. 2 %), respectively. Co-sleeping was marginally associated {{with the amount of}} crying and not associated with stress due to crying.
