Twenty-four patients with GS (BCVA 20 / 20, normal visual field, intraocular pressure, IOP, less than 21 mmHg, and glaucomatous optic neuropathy, GON) and 14 patients with OHT (BCVA 20 / 20, intraocular pressure 25 mmHg, absence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy and normal visual field) <b>were</b> considered in <b>this</b> study. <b>GON</b> <b>was</b> intended as vertical cup-disk ratio of 0. 5 or more; asymmetry of greater than 0. 2, disk notching, disk splinter hemorrhages. PERGLA amplitude and phase were measured, while thickness of the RNFL was obtained with spectral OCT. A control group of 50 age-matched healthy patients was added. In the GS group, 16 eyes (66. 7 %) showed normal average RNFL analysis and normal PERGLA, 3 eyes (12. 5 %) showed abnormal average RNFL analysis and abnormal PERGLA, 5 eyes (20. 8 %) presented with normal average RNFL analysis and abnormal PERGLA. In the OHT group, 11 eyes (78. 6 %) showed an average normal RNFL and normal PERGLA, while 3 eyes (21. 4 %) presented with an average normal RNFL and abnormal PERGLA. PERGLA is a non-invasive, fast, and fully automatic version of the pattern ERG. In eyes with OHT and in eyes with GS, PERGLA abnormalities in presence of a normal RNFL could suggest an early functional damage of viable retinal ganglion cells...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{knowledge}} of the anatomy of greater occipital nerve {{and its relation to}} occipital artery is important for the surgeon. Blockage or surgical release of greater occipital nerve is clinically effective in reducing or eliminating chronic migraine symptoms. Aim: The aim of <b>this</b> research <b>was</b> to study the anatomy of greater occipital nerve (GON) and its relation to occipital artery. Also the use of these anatomical measures in local injection of the greater occipital nerve for treatment of migraine. Materials and methods: The study was carried out at the Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University. The posterior neck and scalp of 25 cadaveric heads <b>were</b> dissected. <b>GON</b> <b>was</b> identified and measured relative to bony landmarks. Delineation of GON and occipital artery relationship was done. Twenty patients suffering from migraine diagnosed according to International Headache Society (IHS) criteria (HIS 2004) <b>were</b> treated using <b>GON</b> blockade. The landmark for <b>GON</b> injection <b>was</b> based on the anatomical study. Treatment was assessed using the visual analogue scale for migraine pain. Results: In the anatomical study, the <b>GON</b> <b>was</b> found in all specimens. The diameter of <b>GON</b> <b>was</b> measured at the lower border of inferior oblique, where it pierced SSC, and after its exit from trapezius muscle. The distance between the point where the GON pierced SSC inferior to the external occipital protuberance (EOP) and lateral to the midline was also measured. The <b>GON</b> <b>was</b> parallel to the occipital artery. The distance between GON and occipital artery was measured. In the clinical study, 20 patients suffering from migraine were treated with 1. 5  ml of 0. 5 % bupivacaine using GON blockade. The landmark for <b>GON</b> injection <b>was</b> based on the anatomical study. For the right GON: the vertical location inferior to EOP ranged from 19. 85  mm to 26. 9  mm with a mean of 23. 1  mm. The lateral location from EOP ranged from 11. 03  mm to 14. 65  mm with a mean of 13. 4  mm. For the left GON: the vertical location inferior to EOP ranged from 16. 89  mm to 29. 5  mm with a mean of 22. 1  mm. The lateral location from EOP ranged from 10. 89  mm to 15. 31  mm with a mean of 14. 1  mm. Pain was improved in 70 % of patients within the first hour after the first injection. After 1  month, 60 % of patients still showed improvement. Conclusion: The {{knowledge of}} the anatomy of greater occipital nerve and its relation to occipital artery is important for the surgeon. Blockage or surgical release of greater occipital nerve is clinically effective in eliminating chronic migraine headache...|$|R
