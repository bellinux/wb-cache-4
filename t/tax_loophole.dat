500|$|After a tip-off from Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, Barker and Corbett {{opted to}} move with their {{families}} to Sydney, Australia in 1979 for the year to exploit a <b>tax</b> <b>loophole</b> and avoid paying the year's income tax. They performed their stage show for four weeks in Sydney and a further four in Melbourne; because of their existing popularity in Australia and, what Corbett terms, the Australian audiences' [...] " [...] soul that still related to the UK," [...] they made no changes to the routine. Barker made no other appearances that year and spent his time writing and engaging in recreational activities. Following the show's success, Kerry Packer commissioned a six episode TV series of The Two Ronnies in Australia for Nine Network. The show comprised material not yet shown in Australia from The Two Ronnies and new content targeted more towards an Australian audience. They returned for a second series in 1986.|$|E

2500|$|Granada's boldness {{was seen}} in ambitious documentaries such as Seven Up!, which premièred in 1964. The {{programme}} was a social experiment which followed the lives of 14 British children aged seven.
