60|$|I admire old George--if {{that was}} his name--for his discernment. He knew {{when he said that}} his son couldn't tell a lie that he was {{stretching}} it a good deal. He wouldn't have to go to John D. Rockefeller's Bible class <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>out.</b> The way the old George Washington story goes down it doesn't do anybody any good. It only discourages people who can tell a lie.|$|E

All I {{can tell}} you is that he's an Englishman, and she has known him for a long time--kind of love stunt, I imagine. She wasn't having any, but now he's at death's door she seems to have relented. Anyway, she is {{breaking}} every engagement she's got, giving up her chairmanship of the War Hospitals Committee, and she isn't going to leave him while he's alive. There's no other nurse going, so it'll be a night and day job for her." ...|$|E

I will leave you <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> for yourself. In the third place, {{you want to have}} Philip under your own wing; domestic familiarity will make him fonder of you than ever. Keep him out of the sort of company that he meets with in the billiard-room and the smoking-room. You have got a spare bed here, I know, and your poor father is in no condition to use his authority. Make Philip one of the family." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, the carts are all full. More straw, my Antoine, {{to shake}} over these top rows; then, off we will clatter, rumble, jolt, and rattle, a long row of us, {{out of the}} first town-gate, and out at the second town-gate, and past the empty sentry-box, and the little thin square bandbox of a guardhouse, where nobody seems to live: and away for Paris, by the paved road, lying, a {{straight}}, straight line, in the long, long avenue of trees. We can neither choose our road, nor our pace, for that is all prescribed to us. The public convenience demands that our carts should get to Paris by such a route, and no other (Napoleon had leisure <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>out,</b> while he had a little war with the world upon his hands), and woe betide us if we infringe orders.|$|E

You would {{scarcely}} believe it, perhaps, if I told you that the theft of your formulas is only a slight thing compared to the bigger business that man has on hand. There is something else {{at the back of}} his head which is worth heaven and earth to us to understand. We want the formula and we shall have it, but more than anything else in the world we want to know why Fischer has pledged his word in Berlin to bring this war to an end within three months. We have <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>out,</b> and we are going to find it out--from him. You see, I have treated you with confidence, Captain Graham. Now let me show you to your room."

60|$|Behind every {{rock and}} cedar she {{expected}} to find Jim. Surely he had only threatened her. But she had taunted {{him in a way}} no man could stand, and if there were any strength of character in him he would show it now. Her remorse and dread increased. After all, he was only a boy--only a couple of years older than she was. Under stress of feeling he might go to any extreme. Had she misjudged him? If she had not, she had at least been brutal. But he had dared to kiss her! Every time she thought of that a tingling, a confusion, a hot shame went over her. And at length Joan marveled <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> of the affront to her pride, and the quarrel, and the fact of his going and of her following, and especially out of this increasing remorseful dread, there had flourished up a strange and reluctant respect for Jim Cleve.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} a great thing <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> beforehand, sir. If you like, I will drop down the river this {{afternoon}} in the gig; that will attract no attention, for it will be thought that we are merely going fishing or shooting. As soon as it is dark we will muffle the oars, and row up the other branch, find the mouth of the creek and row up it, first find how far it is to the pool, then drop down {{a quarter of a mile}} and land, strike into the jungle, and look for the path. I should, of course, choose a point where the creek bends that way, for as the path no doubt goes straight from the village to the pool, it would be nearer the creek at a bend than it {{would be a}}t any other point. If it is a sharp bend it might go quite close to it." ...|$|E
