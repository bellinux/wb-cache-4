5|$|The Canadian pale, a pale {{division}} {{amounting to}} half the entire field, derived from the Canadian flag, is widely used in Canadian heraldry, while the Canadian fess, a similar horizontal division, has been used once. The term érablé, referring to maple leaves, is often used in Canadian arms. For example, as a tressure érablé in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monarchist League of Canada, coronets érablé {{in the arms of}} Sudbury and Canada's National History Society, and as a partition much like engrailed or dancetty.

5|$|Before his succession, George {{was granted}} the royal arms differenced by a label of five points Azure, the centre point bearing a fleur-de-lis Or on 27 July 1749. Upon his father's death, {{and along with}} the dukedom of Edinburgh and the {{position}} of heir-apparent, he inherited his difference of a plain label of three points Argent. In an additional difference, the crown of Charlemagne was not usually depicted on <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heir, only on the Sovereign's.|$|E

5|$|Legend relates that in January 1297 François Grimaldi, {{disguised}} as a monk, sought shelter at the castle. On obtaining entry he murdered the guard, whereupon his men appeared and captured the castle. Thus the fortress became the stronghold of the Grimaldi. This event is commemorated by a statue of François Grimaldi in the precincts of the palace (Illustration 6) and in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House of Grimaldi where François is depicted wielding a sword while in the garb of a monk (Illustration 2).|$|E
5|$|Partitions of Poland {{at the end}} of the 18th century {{brought an}} end to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The King (Tsar) of Poland at that time used a white royal banner emblazoned with <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congress Kingdoma black double-headed Russian eagle with the Polish White Eagle in an inescutcheon.|$|E
5|$|Roman Catholic {{bishops in}} England {{historically}} used only their personal arms, as dioceses {{established by the}} See of Rome {{are not part of}} the official state Church of England and cannot be recognized in law, though in Scotland the legal situation has been different and many Roman Catholic dioceses have arms. If a suffragan or auxiliary bishop has a personal coat of arms, he does not combine it with <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diocese he serves.|$|E
