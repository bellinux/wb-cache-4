40|$|The {{development}} of electronic {{technology in the}} direction of improving its performance and speed, accompanied by the decrease of its dimensions and mass. This trend requires a new generation of electrical connectors differing from the basic models {{of a large number of}} contacts and density of placement on the insulator, having low contact resistance and high insulation resistance, high reliability and long life. The article describes the way of practical application of statistical methods for quality control of contact pairs of electrical connectors. The objects of study of effectiveness of statistical methods of quality management selected two typical details contact pairs received by <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>automatic</b> lathes: pin and socket. The article considers the process of collecting statistical information about the technological process automatic turning of parts of the contact pairs. Shows the results of processing statistical information about the quality of the details of the contact pairs. The use of statistical methods for quality control of contact pairs of electrical connectors allows to correctly configure technological equipment according to the results of making a test batch of parts. Recommendations are made to improve the quality of the contact pairs of connectors. Compiled by technique of quality management of contact pairs according to the results of the statistical analysis of technological processes of their manufacture...|$|E
50|$|Their social {{shopping}} platform allows {{businesses to}} monetize their social media pages {{through the use}} of comments, allowing brands to directly sell on Facebook and Instagram. Retailers looking at selling on Facebook or Instagram upload products according to a template that includes price and item description. They can then schedule campaigns, or sales of multiple items, that post at the designated time. Fans register through email and comment 'Sold' to trigger the purchasing process. The process is managed through a backend dashboard that compiles all the comments and then allows retailers to send invoices to buyers. Retailers can also <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>automatic</b> invoices, track customers, and put buyers on a waitlist for out-of-stock items. This process allows businesses to turn their Facebook and Instagram pages into points of sale.|$|R
5000|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN / WSAN) are, generically, {{networks}} of low-power, low-cost devices that interconnect wirelessly to collect, exchange, and sometimes act-on {{data collected from}} their physical environments - [...] "sensor networks". Nodes typically connect in a star or mesh topology. While most individual nodes in a WSAN {{are expected to have}} limited range (Bluetooth, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, etc.), particular nodes may be capable of more expansive communications (Wi-Fi, Cellular networks, etc.) and any individual WSAN can span a wide geographical range. An example of a WSAN would be a collection of sensors arranged throughout an agricultural facility to monitor soil moisture levels, report the data back to a computer in the main office for analysis and trend modeling, and maybe <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>automatic</b> watering spigots if the level is too low.|$|R
50|$|Xiaomi {{unveiled}} the Smart Home Kit for CNY 199 on 10 June 2015. The kit contains {{a set of}} smart sensors, including the multi-function gateway, the door/window sensor, the motion detector and the wireless switch, which can be combined to achieve over 30 different kinds of functions. For example, the motion detector can be paired with the gateway to perform functions such as switching on a light at night when it detects motion; the window sensors can start or stop a connected fan as windows are closed or opened; in another example, users can set the gateway into alert mode with their smartphones as they leave the house, and the gateway would then send push notifications and <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> the <b>automatic</b> recording of a Yi Smart Webcam when the door/window sensor or the motion detector detects abnormal activity.|$|R

Classification {{is provided}} for the multitool single-supports setups for which methods are developed for determining the maximum precision feed. Developed are the methods for computing the conditions for the multitool single-support setups <b>on</b> the <b>automatic</b> and semi-automatic lathes {{as well as a}} set of standartization charts for correction of feed with regard to the structure of the multitool single-support setups. The general mechanical engineering authorizing documents on the design of the setups and the standards for the time and conditions of <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> lathes are being introduced.
