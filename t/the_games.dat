5|$|The idea {{to hold an}} inter-continental {{sporting}} event between Asia and Africa was initiated in April 1983, with New Delhi as the proposed venue. However, for unknown circumstances, the venue was shifted to Kuwait and <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> were proposed {{to be held in}} 1985. Political instability led to the cancellation of <b>the</b> <b>Games.</b> In 1989, the proposal was reconsidered, with New Delhi again chosen as the venue for <b>the</b> <b>Games.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Games</b> were then scheduled for 1991. The plans went wrong due to inefficient communication between the members, and so could not come into force.|$|E
5|$|The largest venue was the Jawaharlal Nehru Sports Complex, {{which had}} a {{capacity}} of 60,000 during <b>the</b> <b>games.</b> The stadium was the main venue of <b>the</b> <b>games,</b> hosting both the opening and the closing ceremonies.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>game</b> {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon its release; critics disparaged <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> short length, and although <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> variety was generally seen positively, reviewers noted little outstanding in <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Despite this mediocre reception, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{was nominated for}} two awards.|$|R

5|$|After {{the success}} of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of {{stagnation}} that threatened their survival. The Olympic Games held at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904 were side shows. <b>The</b> <b>Games</b> in Paris did not have a stadium, but were notable for being the first time women took part in <b>the</b> <b>Games.</b> When the St. Louis Games were celebrated roughly 650 athletes participated, but 580 were from the United States. The homogeneous nature of these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement. <b>The</b> <b>Games</b> rebounded when the 1906 Intercalated Games (so-called because they were the second Games held within the third Olympiad) were held in Athens. These Games were, but are not now, officially recognised by the IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since. <b>The</b> <b>Games</b> attracted a broad international field of participants and generated great public interest. This marked the beginning of a rise in both the popularity {{and the size of the}} Olympics.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>game's</b> art style {{received}} acclaim. Stantion {{thought that}} <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> art-style is striking to look at. Clements praised <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> visuals, {{which he described}} as [...] "stunning". Joe Juba from Game Informer also praised <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> artistic direction, and he thought that <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> visuals install a sense of unpleasantness and surrealism to <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> alternate universe. <b>The</b> <b>game's</b> boss design was praised by Taljonick, but he expressed disappointment that these enemies are not fun to play with. In addition, he criticised the lack of enemy variety in <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|R
500|$|Video game website IGN spoke {{positively}} of <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> {{giving it}} an 8/10 and praising <b>the</b> <b>game</b> for its graphics and controls, while criticizing <b>the</b> <b>game</b> for {{its lack of}} variation and noting its similarities to Super Mario 64. Joe Fielder of GameSpot was more critical of <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> scoring it a 5.8/10 and noting <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> charm but criticizing it for its camera, stating that it makes <b>the</b> <b>game</b> [...] "frustratingly hard to play." [...] Josh Smith of GameSpot gave the PC port of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> a 4.2/10, criticizing <b>the</b> <b>game</b> for its graphics, camera and controls, and ultimately deemed <b>the</b> <b>game</b> [...] "a generic 3D platformer." ...|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>game's</b> story also {{received}} praise from critics. Camron praised <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> voice-acting and setting, which {{he thought was}} [...] "intriguing". However, {{he thought that the}} narrative was too basic, and missed many details that could have further improved <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> story. Albert admired <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> story, and thought that it was handled with great care. He added that <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> plot was easy for players to follow, even though <b>the</b> <b>game</b> features multiple unexpected twists. Cooper described <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> narrative as surprising, adding that the later part of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> successfully added personalities to both <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> heroes and villains. However, Walton called <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> script as [...] "laughable" [...] and said that the dialogue made the plot unbelievable for players.|$|R
5|$|Although, <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> officially {{began on}} 26 June 2009, the first {{football}} games were held on 25 June.

5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} {{formed a}} central part of <b>the</b> <b>games</b> and normally took place in the morning. Dio says that {{over the course of the}} inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence. This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of the fourth century, that 5,000 animals were slain during <b>the</b> <b>games.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} 2008 Summer Olympics, the BBC aired {{coverage}} of <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> in the UK. <b>The</b> <b>Games</b> were broadcast in high-definition {{for the first}} time.

5000|$|MMORPG.com rated <b>the</b> <b>game</b> 5.5/10 {{and wrote}} that <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was bland and uninspired, lacking a true sandbox {{environment}} and offering [...] "little more than grinding combat and crafting" [...] while also noting that <b>the</b> <b>game</b> suffered from performance issues.

5000|$|Matt Wales of Eurogamer {{recommended}} <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> {{concluding that}} <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is [...] "the finest simulator yet". Meanwhile, Ben Reeves of <b>Game</b> Informer praised <b>the</b> <b>game</b> for its creative mode but criticized <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> career mode, referring it to as [...] "boring" [...] and [...] "tedious". TJ Hafer of IGN compared <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> integration of Steam Workshop to Minecraft and Second Life. Edmond Tran of GameSpot praised <b>the</b> <b>game</b> for its accessible creative tools {{and for its}} evocative tone. Jonathan Leack of Game Revolution claimed that <b>the</b> <b>game</b> [...] "resurrected <b>the</b> park simulation genre". In a critical review of <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> Jody Macgregor of PC Gamer praised <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> challenge mode but criticized <b>the</b> <b>game</b> for not innovating enough from RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. The original score (70/100) was retracted due to miscommunication between Frontier Developments and PC Gamer with <b>the</b> <b>game</b> version they received; its reevaluated score is 75/100. Patrick Hancock of Destructoid noted that <b>the</b> <b>game</b> suffers frame rate issues in larger parks. Furthermore, Edge Magazine noted that <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> [...] "fiddly" [...] camera makes some actions harder.|$|R
50|$|The tune for <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is John Philip Sousa's Liberty Bell March.

5|$|Before Romney took over, {{the event}} was $379million short of its revenue goals. Officials had made plans to scale back <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> to {{compensate}} for the fiscal crisis, and there were fears it might be moved away entirely. In addition, the image of <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> had been damaged by allegations of bribery against top officials including prior committee president and CEO Frank Joklik. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee forced Joklik and committee vice president Dave Johnson to resign. Utah power brokers, including Governor Mike Leavitt, searched for someone with a scandal-free reputation to take charge of the Olympics. They chose Romney based on his business and legal expertise as well as his connections to both the LDS Church and the state. The appointment faced some initial criticism from both non-Mormons and Mormons that it represented cronyism and made <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> seem too Mormon-dominated.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>game</b> is an action-platformer {{that bears}} {{similarities}} to <b>the</b> previous Tarzan <b>game</b> for <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> Boy Color.
