5|$|An {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> comets with nearly parabolic orbits identifies five new comets with hyperbolic orbits that approach the nominal orbit of Planet Nine described in Batygin and Brown's initial paper. If these orbits are hyperbolic due to close encounters with Planet Nine the analysis estimates that Planet Nine is currently near aphelion with a right ascension of 83°–90° and a declination of 8°–10°. Scott Sheppard, who is skeptical of this analysis, notes that many different forces influence <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> comets.|$|E

5|$|The {{elementary}} {{objects of}} geometry –points, lines, triangles– are traditionally defined in three-dimensional space or on two-dimensional surfaces. In 1907, Hermann Minkowski, Einstein's former mathematics {{professor at the}} Swiss Federal Polytechnic, introduced a geometric formulation of Einstein's special theory of relativity where the geometry included not only space but also time. The basic entity of this new geometry is four-dimensional spacetime. <b>The</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> moving bodies are curves in spacetime; <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> bodies moving at constant speed without changing direction correspond to straight lines.|$|E
5|$|The inner Solar System also {{contains}} near-Earth asteroids, {{many of which}} cross <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> the inner planets. Some of them are potentially hazardous objects.|$|E

5000|$|The adjunct diagram shows one {{complete}} <b>orbit</b> <b>of</b> asteroid [...] in a {{frame of}} reference rotating with Jupiter.

5|$|In 1596, Johannes Kepler {{predicted}} “Between Mars and Jupiter, I place a planet” in his Mysterium Cosmographicum. While analyzing Tycho Brahe's data, Kepler {{thought that}} there was too large a gap between <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> Mars and Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a {{study of}} how <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> Saturn's moons should have changed due to tidal effects {{suggested}} that all of Saturn's satellites inward of Titan, including Enceladus (whose geologic activity was used to derive the strength of tidal effects on Saturn's satellites), may have formed as little as 100 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|In 499 CE, the Indian {{astronomer}} Aryabhata propounded {{a planetary}} model that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he explains {{as the cause}} of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars.

5|$|Kepler's laws of {{planetary}} motion describe <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects {{closer to the}} Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly {{because they are more}} affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion. <b>The</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using numerical models.|$|E
5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large}} number of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. <b>The</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.|$|E
5|$|Numerical {{studies have}} shown that over {{millions}} of years, the general nature of the alignment between <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> Pluto and Neptune does not change. There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's {{existence}} <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> comets are unstable and eventually dynamics dictate that a comet must either collide with the Sun or a planet or else be ejected from the Solar System by planetary perturbations.|$|E
5|$|The Planet Nine {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> several detached objects {{can be explained}} by the gravitational influence of a large, unobserved planet between 200 AU and 1200 AU from the Sun and/or the influence of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The flyby also {{provided}} the first accurate measurement of Neptune's mass which {{was found to}} be 0.5 percent less than previously calculated. The new figure disproved the hypothesis that an undiscovered Planet X acted upon <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> Neptune and Uranus.|$|E

25|$|The third component, λ Tau C, is <b>orbiting</b> <b>the</b> inner pair over a 33.025 day {{period with}} an {{eccentricity}} of roughly 0.15.

It has about half the mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun. <b>The</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>of</b> this star causes perturbation effects on <b>the</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AB pair, resulting in periodic changes in their orbital eccentricity and other orbital elements.|$|R

5|$|The {{system is}} among the most compact known; <b>the</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> planets b - f would easily fit inside the orbit of Mercury, with g only {{slightly}} outside it.
