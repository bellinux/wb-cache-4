5|$|Its {{dimensions}} are highly symmetrical and proportionate, probably {{influenced by the}} geometric ideals, ratios and rules of design of the ancient Greeks. The balance of measurements, especially between the width and height of the cross, seem derived from the sides and diagonals of squares, and dynamic rectangles. Cimabue was not rigid in his placement, however, and to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> of Christ's body, altered the positioning {{of some of the}} boards on the lower half.|$|E
5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control {{the orbits of}} the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large number}} of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.|$|E
5|$|With no army left {{to defend}} Tigranocerta, and a foreign populace that gleefully opened the gates to the Romans, Lucullus' army began the {{wholesale}} looting and plunder of the city. The city was literally deconstructed piece by piece. The king's treasury, {{estimated to be}} worth 8,000 talents, was looted and each soldier in the army was awarded 800 drachma. The battle also resulted in severe territorial losses: most of the lands in Tigranes' empire {{to the south of}} the Taurus fell under <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> of Rome.|$|E

5|$|Governor Violante Beatrice and the Dowager Electress, {{following}} the former's sojourn in Rome, {{in spite of}} their mutual dislike of each other, attempted to ameliorate Gian Gastone's decadent public image together. Violante Beatrice organised banquets to remove him from <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> of the Ruspanti. His behaviour at these sent guests running for their carriages: he vomited into his napkin, wiped his mouth with his peri-wig and told rude jokes. These parties ceased when Violante Beatrice died, in 1731; Gian Gastone was devastated by the loss of his beloved sister-in-law. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died, as the public never saw him. To discredit these, the Dowager Electress induced Gian Gastone to make a public appearance—his final one—on Saint John the Baptist's day of 1729. An alcoholic, Gian Gastone drank too much before the ceremony and vomited repeatedly throughout; he had to be carried unconscious back to the Palazzo Pitti, the royal palace, on a litter. A sprained ankle incurred in July 1729 left the Grand Duke bed-ridden for—barring two occasions—the rest of his life.|$|E
5|$|During these {{difficult}} years, Boosey {{was supported by}} his trusted managing director, Ernst Roth. However, Roth later regarded the Boosey family as ineffectual and parochial. In the early 1960s, Roth forced Boosey's sons Anthony and Simon out of the company, and prevented his youngest son, Nigel, from even joining, allegedly {{at the behest of}} Benjamin Britten. Roth and Boosey also had differences over Britten's influence over the company. Roth regarded Britten as a gifted local musician, rather than a true genius like Roth's friends Strauss and Stravinsky. Boosey realised how valuable Britten was to the company, and agreed to Britten's request to divide the company into instruments and publishing. However, Britten humiliated Boosey by preventing him from chairing the music publishing board Boosey had established at Britten's request. In 1963, Britten also managed to get Boosey & Hawkes to employ Donald Mitchell to find new, young composers for the company. Angered by <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> Britten had over Boosey, Roth fired Mitchell within a year. Mitchell later set up Faber Music for book publisher Faber and Faber with the assistance of Britten and the blessing of T. S. Eliot.|$|E
25|$|Nobody parks on {{the roads}} where <b>the</b> <b>Sway</b> may go, and for good reason. In 2002, a couple of drivers parked {{opposite}} the Duke William. <b>The</b> <b>Sway</b> headed right for them and pushed one of the cars 10 feet {{down the road and}} into the other.|$|E
5000|$|Most people sway a bit {{but then}} quickly {{decrease}} <b>the</b> amplitude of <b>swaying.</b> If however, <b>the</b> <b>swaying</b> is not corrected, or the patient opens the eyes or {{takes a step}} to regain balance, Romberg’s test is positive.|$|R

25|$|After {{this bit}} of fun to warm up the crowd <b>the</b> <b>Sway</b> Hood is then thrown up in the air. The rugby type scrum (or Sway to give it its {{official}} title) then converges on the Hood and the game starts in earnest. The {{idea is to get}} <b>the</b> <b>Sway</b> Hood into one of the four pubs in either Haxey or Westwoodside.|$|E
25|$|The Hood, which {{cannot be}} thrown or run with, is moved slowly by 'swaying', that is pushing and pulling the Hood and {{people within the}} 'Sway' toward the {{direction}} of their pub. Although everyone is trying to push in a particular direction, there are no real organised teams. <b>The</b> <b>Sway</b> makes very slow progress, as it snakes around, stopping quite often when it collapses, in order to pull bodies out, that became crushed into the mud. Safety is of prime concern {{and the whole thing}} is supervised by the Boggins. The Lord is referee and sees that the game is played fairly. At any one time there are usually around 200 people in <b>the</b> <b>Sway</b> and about one thousand people watching. Games can last anything from a couple of hours onwards and have been known to go on well into the night. Everything in the path of <b>the</b> <b>Sway</b> goes down before it, including hedges and walls. Another of the Boggins' jobs is to stop <b>the</b> <b>Sway</b> destroying everything in its path.|$|E

25|$|The Romans came to {{this area}} almost two {{thousand}} years ago, leaving Dere Street and the nearby fort of Trimontium as evidence of their occupation. Following {{the departure of the}} Romans, the area came under <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria.|$|E
25|$|The Land of Israel {{has come}} under <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> of various empires and has been home {{to a variety of}} ethnicities, but was {{predominantly}} Jewish from roughly 1,000 years before the Common Era (BCE) until the 3rd century of the Common Era (CE).|$|E
25|$|Bengali {{food has}} {{inherited}} {{a large number}} of influences, both foreign and pan-Indian, arising from a historical and strong trade links with many parts of the world.

25|$|Under <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> of the Cap faction, Sweden {{seemed in}} danger of falling prey to the {{political}} ambitions of Russia.

It seemed to many that only a swift and sudden coup d'état could preserve Sweden's independence.|$|E
25|$|The 1633 Sejm {{would also}} take more direct {{control of the}} royal mint, deepen <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> of serfdom, and accept the {{petition}} of Polish Jews to forbid the printing of antisemitic literature, its importation from Western Europe, and its distribution in the Commonwealth. The Sejm also declared war on Muscovy, which had invaded the Commonwealth the previous fall.|$|E

25|$|In 1894, the Insurgents openly {{challenged}} the Stalwarts for {{leadership of the}} Republican Party. Their Nils Haugen sought the Republican nomination for governor in 1894, and La Follette followed in 1896 and 1898. His speeches decrying <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> of big business (especially the railroads) and his calls for a more direct democracy drew ever increasing crowds.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Charles the Bold (1477) and the {{marriage}} of his daughter Mary to the archduke Maximilian of Austria ended {{the independence of the}} Low Countries by bringing them increasingly under <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> of the Habsburg dynasty.

25|$|The Peshwas had {{established}} their sovereignty over Gujarat including Saurashtra, and collected taxes and tributes through their representatives. Damaji Gaekwad and Kadam Bande divided the Peshwa's territory between them, with Damaji establishing <b>the</b> <b>sway</b> of Gaekwad over Gujarat and made Baroda (present day Vadodara) his capital. The ensuing internecine war among the Marathas was fully exploited by the British, who interfered {{in the affairs}} of both Gaekwads and the Peshwas.|$|E
