40|$|D ow nloaded from Abstract: Due to {{the large}} number of {{chemicals}} for which <b>toxicological</b> and ecotoxicological <b>information</b> is lacking, priority-setting for data acquisition is a major concern in chemicals regulation. In the current European system, two administrative priority-setting criteria are used, namely novelty (i. e. time of market introduction) and production volume. In the proposed REACH system, the novelty criterion is no longer used, and production volume will in practice be the only priority-setting criterion for testing requirements. This criterion has severe weaknesses. It is proposed that a multi-criteria system should be developed that includes at least three additional criteria: chemical properties, results from initial testing in a tiered system, and voluntary testing for which efficient incentives can be created. Toxicological and decision-theoretical research is needed to design testing systems with validated priority-setting mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|TheTh UK has {{developed}} a simple scheme to provide practical control advice to {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs), to assist them in their risk assessments and risk management decisions. This scheme makes use of <b>toxicological</b> hazard <b>information</b> indicated by R-phrases assigned under the European Union (EU) classification system, to assign substances to hazard bands. In the UK scheme, the allocation of substances to hazard bands according to R-phrases has taken into account three key factors: whether or not the toxicological endpoint has an identifiable dose threshold; the seriousness of the resultant health effect; and the relative exposure levels at which toxic effects occur. Based on all these considerations, R-phrases have been allocated to hazard bands within the scheme. An evaluation exercise has been undertaken, to compare the output of the scheme with established health-based occupational exposure limits, for more than 100 subst-ances. The results of this exercise demonstrate that as far as possible, the scheme recommends control strategies which should provide adequate control. This scheme is potentially a very powerful means of helping SMEs adequately control chemical health risks in the workplace. Since it utilises the EU-agreed classification system, the scheme can be applied to any substance supplied and used in the workplace and it may also be used internationally. ICrown copyright © 1998.

30|$|Bayesian {{networks}} (BNs) can be utilised {{to overcome}} these limitations. BNs offer a reliable method for NM risk estimation owing {{to their ability to}} capture data sets that have a probability distribution of values or even missing values. These omissions are commonly observed in toxicological investigations related to NM risk characterisation and assessment. Furthermore, BNs allow for the incorporation of expert opinion where data are lacking, and has the functionality to refurbish these assessments as new experimental data becomes available. The model can incorporate NM-specific physicochemical characteristics, exposure potential and hazard components relevant to NMs for all exposure routes. In this article, we demonstrate the use of BN in occupational settings (e.g. inhalation exposure). The risk estimation is transparent and can be used to prioritize further testing to increase accuracy.

Therefore, new approaches are being considered to provide adequate experimental data that allow regulatory decisions. This process requires a matching of regulatory needs {{on the one hand and}} the opportunities provided by new test systems and methods on the other hand. Alignment of academically and industrially driven assay development with regulatory needs in the field of DNT is a core mission of the International STakeholder NETwork (ISTNET) in DNT testing. The first meeting of ISTNET was held in Zurich on 23 - 24 January 2014 in order to explore the concept of adverse outcome pathway (AOP) to practical DNT testing. AOPs were considered promising tools to promote test systems development according to regulatory needs. Moreover, the AOP concept was identified as an important guiding principle to assemble predictive integrated testing strategies (ITSs) for DNT. The recommendations on a road map towards AOP-based DNT testing is considered a stepwise approach, operating initially with incomplete AOPs for compound grouping, and focussing on key events of neurodevelopment. Next steps to be considered in follow-up activities are the use of case studies to further apply the AOP concept in regulatory DNT testing, making use of AOP intersections (common key events) for economic development of screening assays, and addressing the transition from qualitative descriptions to quantitative network modelling...|$|R

40|$|The {{types of}} {{information}} available differ for existing and new chemicals. For established chemicals, exposure and adverse effect data may be readily available, e. g., from scientific literature, or poison control centres. Such information is often unavailable for unapproved new substances for which no practical experience exists. <b>Toxicological</b> <b>information</b> may be gained prospectively or retrospectively. Prospective information may be gained from in vivo (including human), in vitro, or in silico studies. Data may be obtained using standardized test protocols or novel mechanistic techniques, e. g., toxicogenomics. Retrospective information includes epidemiological, post-marketing surveillance, and occupational health data, but also information from non-human sentinel species studies, e. g., fish, wildlife, or livestock. Before collecting and/or evaluating <b>toxicological</b> <b>information,</b> {{it is important to}} assess its source. The quality of the data and the quality control measures used for generating the data should be assessed. An assay should be validated for its reliability and (predictive) relevance, and its mechanistic basis (relevance) should be understood. Finally, the appropriateness of the statistical methods used should be evaluated. Sources of information should also be evaluated for their relevance to the question being addressed, e. g, taking into account interspecies variability. For example, weaknesses of in vitro systems include the inability to predict pharmacokinetic parameters, whereas in silico models have this capability, but do not on the other hand provide empirical information. Epidemiological studies should be assessed for population variability, and uncertainties over dose and exposure. Other factors to consider include whether the original data are available for examination and audit. All information should be evaluated for variability and inconsistencies, and their potential causes. Laboratory testing (e. g., toxicogenomics) should adhere to validated, explicit test protocols. It is important also to consider the demonstrated applicability domain limitations of test methods based on physical/chemical properties. Lastly, publication bias should be considered. Recommendations for evidence-based toxicological assessments include increasing the availability of standardized databases of <b>toxicological</b> <b>information.</b> Integrated testing strategies, including infomatic methods to integrate and analyse data from different methodologies, are also needed.
