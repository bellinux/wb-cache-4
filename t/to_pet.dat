5|$|Millburn (Rafe Spall) is a {{biologist}} {{who is a}} part of the Prometheus expedition. After awakening, he tries to become friends with Fifield (who rejects him). Millburn joins the initial expedition to the Engineers' artificial structure concealing the Juggernaut, tagging along with Fifield after he is upset by the number of corpses. Separated from the rest of the expedition, they are stranded in the ship. Millburn and Fifield enter the room containing the thawed black liquid and encounter the Hammerpedes. When Millburn tries <b>to</b> <b>pet</b> one it attacks him, breaking his arm and jumping down his throat. When the crew of the Prometheus returns the next day, they find Millburn's body with the Hammerpede still in his throat.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies {{suggest that}} early {{childhood}} exposure <b>to</b> <b>pets</b> may protect from {{the development of}} atopy, but limited information is available on adults. The association of allergy markers in adulthood with current and childhood exposure <b>to</b> <b>pets</b> was studied considering retrospectively the window of exposure. METHODS: Immunoglobulin E (IgE), skin prick tests (SPT), eosinophils were related <b>to</b> exposure <b>to</b> <b>pets</b> in 187 adult asthmatic cases and 243 controls from the Epidemiological Study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy (EGEA) study. Analyses were redone after exclusion of subjects who removed pets or experienced symptoms to animals {{to take into account}} selection in that retrospective study. RESULTS: In asthmatic cases, current exposure <b>to</b> <b>pets</b> was unrelated <b>to</b> SPT positivity (+), whereas childhood exposure was significantly related to less SPT+ to any allergen, and to cat in particular, with an association restricted to those exposed before 2 years of age [OR = 0. 30 (CI 0. 12 - 0. 76) ]. Considering the relative timing of exposure in relation to asthma onset showed that the protective effect of exposure <b>to</b> <b>pets</b> occurs for pet exposure starting before asthma onset [OR for SPT+ = 0. 19 (CI 0. 08 - 0. 48) ]. CONCLUSION: Results support the hypothesis that exposure <b>to</b> <b>pets</b> in early life, and in particular before asthma onset, may protect against allergen sensitization in adulthood...|$|R

40|$|Attachment <b>to</b> <b>pets</b> has an {{important}} role in children’s social, emotional, and cognitive development, mental health, well-being, and quality of life. This study examined associations between childhood attachment <b>to</b> <b>pets</b> and caring and friendship behaviour, compassion, and attitudes towards animals. This study also examined socio-demographic differences, particularly pet ownership and pet type. A self-report survey of over one thousand 7 to 12 year-olds in Scotland, UK, revealed that the majority of children are strongly attached <b>to</b> their <b>pets,</b> but attachment scores differ depending on pet type and child gender. Analysis revealed that attachment <b>to</b> <b>pets</b> is facilitated by compassion and caring and pet-directed friendship behaviours and that attachment <b>to</b> <b>pets</b> significantly predicts positive attitudes towards animals. The findings have implications for the promotion of prosocial and humane behaviour. Encouraging children <b>to</b> participate in <b>pet</b> care behaviour may promote attachment between children and their pet, which in turn may have a range of positive outcomes for both children (such as reduced aggression, better well-being, and quality of life) and pets (such as humane treatment). This study enhances our understanding of childhood pet attachment and has implications for humane education and promoting secure emotional attachments in childhood...|$|R

25|$|The labeled 18F-FDG {{compound}} has {{a relatively}} short shelf life which {{is dominated by the}} physical decay of 18F with a half-life of 109.8 minutes, or slightly less than 2 hours. Still, this half life is sufficiently long to allow shipping the compound to remote PET scanning facilities, in contrast to other medical radioisotopes like 11C. Due to transport regulations for radioactive compounds, delivery is normally done by specially licensed road transport, but means of transport may also include dedicated small commercial jet services. Transport by air allows to expand the distribution area around a 18F-FDG production site to deliver the compound <b>to</b> <b>PET</b> scanning centres even hundreds of miles away.|$|E

25|$|In {{the park}} on a Sunday some time later, George {{sketches}} a disgruntled Boatman to the disapproval of an observing Jules. Dot enters {{on the arm of}} Louis, a baker. Two chatting shopgirls, both named Celeste, notice Dot with a new man ("Gossip"). When Jules and Yvonne's daughter Louise attempts <b>to</b> <b>pet</b> the Boatman's dog, he shouts at her, then lashes out at George and storms off. George and Dot have a strained conversation as she works on the grammar book she is using to teach herself how to read and write. As Jules and Yvonne mock the unconventional nature of George's art, they discuss an initiative to have his work included in the next group show, which they both protest. George sketches two dogs while whimsically trying to imagine the world from their perspective, describing their relief to be free of their routines on Sunday ("The Day Off"). As the day goes on, George quietly sketches denizens of the park: The two Celestes try {{to attract the attention of}} a pair of Soldiers, fighting over which will get the more handsome of the two; the Nurse hides from the Old Lady and attempts to attract Franz's attention; Franz and his wife Frieda argue with Louise and each other; a pair of wealthy American tourists pass by, hating everything about Paris but the pastries, and plan to return home with a baker in tow; Jules returns to further lecture George on his shortcomings as an artist, receiving in response an invitation to see his new painting; the Boatman reappears to rebuke artists' condescending attitude. Dot sees George, but he slips away before she can speak to him, and in retaliation she describes her satisfying new life with Louis. She clearly misses and loves George, but Louis loves, respects and needs her in a way George cannot, and she has made her choice ("Everybody Loves Louis").|$|E

We present exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis of the instrument. We then examine convergent validity with four a priori derived measures of pet attachment (Anthropomorphism Scale, CENSHARE PAS, CABS, LAPS) and a social support scale. We provide evidence that having a current relationship with a <b>pet</b> is related <b>to</b> higher scores on the PALS than having a former pet relationship, evidencing that the PALS is a relational measure. Overall, females are more attached <b>to</b> <b>pets</b> than are males, and dog owners are most attached, followed by cat owners and owners of other pets...|$|R
