5|$|The Houston Astros hired Virdon {{as their}} manager on August 20, 1975, {{succeeding}} Preston Gómez. Tal Smith, {{who had served}} as {{executive vice president for}} the Yankees, had become the Astros' general manager on August 7. Virdon led <b>the</b> <b>Astros</b> to third-place finishes in 1976 and 1977, but <b>the</b> <b>Astros</b> slipped to fifth place in 1978. The 1979 Astros fell one game short of winning the NL West division championship. <b>The</b> <b>Astros</b> tied the Los Angeles Dodgers for the division championship in 1980, and defeated them in the 1980 NL West tie-breaker game. <b>The</b> <b>Astros</b> played the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1980 NLCS, losing the series in five games. He again won the Manager of the Year Award in 1980. Due to the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, the 1981 season was split into halves with each half's winner appearing in the 1981 NL Division Series. The Dodgers won the first half, while <b>the</b> <b>Astros</b> won the second. In the Division Series, the Dodgers defeated <b>the</b> <b>Astros</b> in five games. During the 1982 season, <b>the</b> <b>Astros</b> fell to fifth place. Virdon was fired during the season and replaced by Bob Lillis.|$|E
5|$|After leaving high school, Richard was {{selected}} by <b>the</b> <b>Astros</b> as the second pick {{in the first round}} of the 1969 amateur draft. From the time he made his major league debut with <b>the</b> <b>Astros</b> in 1971 until 1975, Richard had a limited role as an Astros pitcher, throwing no more than 72 innings in a season. In 1975, Richard played his first full season in the majors as a starting pitcher.|$|E
5|$|As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser {{evaluated}} Jeter extensively {{before the}} 1992 MLB draft. <b>The</b> <b>Astros</b> held the first overall {{pick in the}} draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, lobbied team management to select him. <b>The</b> <b>Astros</b> feared that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract, so they passed on him, instead choosing Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston for $700,000. Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with <b>the</b> <b>Astros</b> in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.|$|E

5|$|Bill Wood, the Astros' general manager, {{said the}} team {{believed}} Nevin {{was close to}} a major-league level and would require little development in minor league baseball. As evidence for this, <b>the</b> <b>Astros</b> pointed to Nevin's training with the wooden bats used in professional baseball {{in an effort to}} prepare himself for the transition from metal bats. <b>The</b> <b>Astros</b> believed he would be a solid power hitter and have a strong work ethic. Nevin also did not intend to seek a signing bonus approaching those received by Van Poppel and Taylor. <b>The</b> <b>Astros</b> decided to employ Nevin as a third baseman. Not wanting to draw out his contract negotiations, Nevin signed with Houston in June, receiving a $700,000 bonus.|$|E
5|$|Houston's win {{clinched}} the team's first postseason berth in franchise history. <b>The</b> <b>Astros</b> lost the five-game NLCS to the Phillies 3–2, ending their season. Due to the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, the following season was split into halves {{and the winner}} of each half advanced to the postseason. The Dodgers won {{the first half and}} <b>the</b> <b>Astros</b> the second and so met in the first National League Division Series. The Dodgers won, and {{went on to win the}} 1981 World Series. <b>The</b> <b>Astros</b> did not return to the NLCS until 1986 and did not win a NL pennant until 2005, leading to a loss in the 2005 World Series.|$|E
5|$|Nevin {{traveled}} with <b>the</b> <b>Astros</b> {{at the end}} of their 1992 season but was not on the team's roster. <b>The</b> <b>Astros</b> sent Nevin to the instructional Arizona Fall League during the off-season. Before the 1993 season, Baseball America ranked Nevin as the 30th-best prospect in baseball.|$|E

Overall in 2017, combined with all three teams he had played for, Clippard's total stats came to 67 appearances out of the bullpen, a 2-8 record, and a 4.77 ERA. <b>The</b> <b>Astros</b> finished the 2017 season with a 101-61 record, clinching the AL West. Clippard, however, was not part of any postseason action, although he was still on <b>the</b> <b>Astros</b> 40-man roster at the time. <b>The</b> <b>Astros</b> won their first World Series in franchise history as they bested the Los Angeles Dodgers in 7 games of the 2017 World Series.
