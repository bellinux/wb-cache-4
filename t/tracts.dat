5|$|Feathers are {{a feature}} {{characteristic}} of birds (though {{also present in}} some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling. There are several types of feathers, each serving {{its own set of}} purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific <b>tracts</b> of skin called pterylae. The distribution pattern of these feather <b>tracts</b> (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex.|$|E
5|$|A large temple also owned sizable <b>tracts</b> of {{land and}} {{employed}} thousands of laymen to supply its needs. Temples were therefore key economic as well as religious centers. The priests who managed these powerful institutions wielded considerable influence, and despite their ostensible subordination to the king they may have posed significant challenges to his authority.|$|E

40|$|Chlamydia muridarum {{is known}} to colonize in the {{gastrointestinal}} <b>tract</b> {{for long periods of}} time, which has been hypothesized to serve as a reservoir for spreading to the genital <b>tract.</b> To test this hypothesis, a luciferase-expressing C. muridarum was used to establish a long-lasting infection in the mouse gastrointestinal <b>tract</b> following either intragastric or intrarectal inoculations. In vivo imaging revealed significant bioluminescent signals mainly in the mouse abdominal area throughout the experiments. Ex vivo imaging localized the signals to the mouse gastrointestinal <b>tract,</b> which was confirmed by monitoring the C. muridarum organisms in the mouse organs/tissues. Despite the long-lasting colonization in the gastrointestinal <b>tract</b> and active shedding of infectious organisms in the rectal swabs, the organisms did not cause any significant infection or pathology in the genital <b>tract</b> throughout the experiments, which was reproduced in multiple strains of mice and with an increased inoculation dose to the gastrointestinal <b>tract.</b> The above observations have demonstrated that the long-lasting C. muridarum organisms from the gastrointestinal <b>tract</b> are inefficient in auto-inoculating the genital <b>tract,</b> suggesting that the gastrointestinal <b>tract</b> Chlamydia may utilize an indirect mechanism to affect its pathogenicity in the genital <b>tract...</b>|$|R
