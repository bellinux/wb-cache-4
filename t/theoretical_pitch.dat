In the current study, a 2 D numerical model was established by Fluent software to simulate the fluid flow, {{heat transfer}} and solidification of the steel in the mold. The VOF model and k-ε model were applied to simulate the flow field of the three phases (steel, slag and air), and solidification model was used to simulate the solidification process. The phenomena at the meniscus were also explored through interfacial tension between the liquid steel and slag {{as well as the}} mold oscillation. The model included a 20 mm thick mold to clarify the heat transfer and the temperature distribution of the mold. The simulation results show that the liquid steel flows as upper backflow and lower backflow in the mold, and that a small circulation forms at the meniscus. The liquid slag flows away from the corner at the meniscus or infiltrates into the gap between the mold and the shell with the mold oscillating at the negative strip stage or at the positive strip stage.

40|$|The {{emphasis}} of this PhD {{is in the}} field of original/contemporary musical composition and I have submitted a portfolio of original compositions (volume 1 / 2, comprising of music scores of both acoustic and electroacoustic music compositions [totalling c. 114 : 30 minutes of music] as well as written material relating to notation and artistic motivation), along with an academic commentary (volume 2 / 2 [totalling c. 19, 500 words], which places the original compositional work in the portfolio in its academic context). The composition works in first volume are varied and broad ranging in scope. In terms of pitch organisation, the majority of works adopt some form of modality or polymodality, whilst certain works also incorporate post-tonal chromaticism and serialism into their syntax. Certain key works also explore extended timbre and colouration (in particular for bowed strings, voices, flute and electronics) and adopt the use of timbral modifications, harmonics, microtones, multiphonics, sprechgesang (i. e. ‘speech-song’), phonetics and the incorporation of electroacoustic sampling, sound synthesis and processing. The academic commentary in the second volume sets out several initial <b>theoretical</b> <b>pitch</b> organisation models (namely relating to modes, polymodes, rows, serial techniques and intervallic cells), with a particular emphasis placed on the formation of a melodic/harmonic language which is fundamentally polymodal, polychordal and polyharmonic. The commentary then takes a closer look at various works within the portfolio which adopt modal, polymodal and chromatic forms of pitch-organisation (whilst intermittently discussing wider musical parameters, such as rhythm, counterpoint, timbre, structure etc [...] .). Separate chapters also discuss a work for flute and electronics and a lengthy work for string quartet (inspired by urban dystopian film) in greater depth. The commentary also discusses my style of writing, placing individual works within the portfolio in their academic context alongside key influences as well as contextualising non-musical aesthetics and sources of artistic inspiration relating to my work...|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{in this thesis}} is the {{analysis}} of alternative approaches for estimation and control of automotive vehicles based on sound theoretical principles. Of particular importance is the problem rollover prevention, which is an important problem plaguing vehicles with a high center of gravity (CG). Vehicle rollover is, statistically, the most dangerous accident type, {{and it is difficult}} to prevent it due to the time varying nature of the problem. Therefore, a major objective of the thesis is to develop the necessary theoretical and practical tools for the estimation and control of rollover based on robust and adaptive techniques that are stable with respect to parameter variations. Given this background, we first consider an implementation of the multiple model switching and tuning (MMST) algorithm for estimating the unknown parameters of automotive vehicles relevant to the roll and the lateral dynamics including the position of CG. This results in high performance estimation of the CG as well as other time varying parameters, which can be used in tuning of the active safety controllers in real time. We then look into automotive rollover prevention control based on a robust stable control design methodology. As part of this we introduce a dynamic version of the load transfer ratio (LTR) as a rollover detection criterion and then design robust controllers that take into account uncertainty in the CG position. As the next step we refine the controllers by integrating them with the multiple model switched CG position estimation algorithm. This results in adaptive controllers with higher performance than the robust counterparts. In the second half of the thesis we analyze extensions of certain theoretical results with important implications for switched systems. First we obtain a non-Lyapunov stability result for a certain class of linear discrete time switched systems. Based on this result, we suggest switched controller synthesis procedures for two roll dynamics enhancement control applications. One control design approach is related to modifying the dynamical response characteristics of the automotive vehicle while guaranteeing the switching stability under parametric variations. The other control synthesis method aims to obtain transient free reference tracking of vehicle roll dynamics subject to parametric switching. In a later discussion, we consider a particular decentralized control design procedure based on vector Lyapunov functions for simultaneous, and structurally robust model reference tracking of both the lateral and the roll dynamics of automotive vehicles. We show that this controller design approach guarantees the closed loop stability subject to certain types of structural uncertainty. Finally, assuming a purely <b>theoretical</b> <b>pitch,</b> and motivated by the problems considered during the course of the thesis, we give new stability results on common Lyapunov solution (CLS) existence for two classes of switching linear systems; one is concerned with switching pair of systems in companion form and with interval uncertainty, and the other is concerned with switching pair of companion matrices with general inertia. For both problems we give easily verifiable spectral conditions that are sufficient for the CLS existence. For proving the second result we also obtain a certain generalization of the classical Kalman-Yacubovic-Popov lemma for matrices with general inertia...|$|E
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{claimed that the}} nature of Aristoxenus' scales and genera deviated sharply from his predecessors. That Aristoxenus used a model for creating scales based upon the notion of a topos, or range of pitch location, is fact, however {{there is no reason to}} believe that he alone set this precedent, as he himself does not make this claim. Indeed, the idea of unfixed pitch locations that cover certain ranges, the limits of which may be defined by fixed points, is a notion that was popular until the modern fixation upon fixed pitch systems, as is indicated by baroque <b>theoretical</b> systems of <b>pitch</b> and intonation. Another way of stating this, however perhaps less accurate, is that instead of using discrete ratios to place intervals, he used continuously variable quantities.|$|R

Potentially, double exposure processes will have a lower cost of ownership that double pafterning. However, double exposure materials have not yet been proven to work experimentally. Before applying significant effiort to develop double exposure materials, their feasibility can be determined using rigorous simulation techniques.

40|$|Background: Dysprosody is {{a common}} feature in {{speakers}} with hypokinetic dysarthria. However, speech prosody varies across different types of speech materials. This {{raises the question of}} what is the most appropriate speech material for the evaluation of dysprosody. Aims: To characterize the prosodic impairment in Cantonese speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria associated with Parkinson’s disease, and to determine the effect of different types of speech stimuli on the perceptual rating of prosody. Methods & Procedures: Speech data in the form of sentence reading, passage reading, and monologue were collected from ten Cantonese speakers with Parkinson’s disease. Perceptual analysis was conducted on ten prosodic parameters to evaluate five dimensions of prosody, based on a <b>theoretical</b> framework: <b>pitch,</b> loudness, duration, voice quality, and degree of reduction. Outcomes & Results: The results showed that the most severely affected prosodic parameters were monopitch, harsh voice, and monoloudness, followed by breathy voice and prolonged interval. Differences were noted between speakers with mild and moderate dysprosody. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the three types of stimuli. However, qualitative analysis revealed noticeable differences between the three stimuli in two speakers. Conclusions& Implications: The prosodic profile of Cantonese speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria is similar to those of other languages (for example, English). The involvement of two new dimensions in the definition of prosody (voice quality and degree of reduction) provides additional insight in differentiating patients with mild and moderate dysarthria. Further investigation on the use of speech materials in the clinical evaluation of speech prosody in speakers with dysarthria is needed, as no single task was found to represent a patient’s performance under all circumstances...|$|R
40|$|The {{relations}} between the protein coats and DNAs of the four filamentous bacteriophages fd, Xf, Pf 1, and Pf 3 are considered. These viruses have similar morphologies, yet show a diversity of detailed structure, having different protein coat symmetries (helical and rotational), different coat protein sizes (44 - 50 amino acids per subunit) and sequences, different nucleotide axial translations (2. 3 - 5. 5 A), and different ratios of nucleotides per coat protein subunit (integers 1. 0 and 2. 0, and nonintegers approximately 2. 4). These divergences are all reconciled quantitatively by means of two <b>theoretical</b> concepts: the <b>pitch</b> connection and the restricted pitch connection. The pitch connection relates protein and DNA surface lattices with arbitrary, nonintegral nucleotide/subunit ratios in a nonrandom way.

40|$|Musical notes can {{be ordered}} from low to high along a perceptual {{dimension}} called “pitch”. A characteristic property of these sounds is their periodic waveform, and periodicity generally correlates with pitch. Thus, pitch {{is often described as}} the perceptual correlate of the periodicity of the sound’s waveform. However, the existence and salience of pitch also depends in a complex way on other factors, in particular harmonic content. For example, periodic sounds made of high-order harmonics tend to have a weaker pitch than those made of low-order harmonics. Here we examine the <b>theoretical</b> proposition that <b>pitch</b> is the perceptual correlate of the regularity structure of the vibration pattern of the basilar membrane, across place and time—a generalization of the traditional view on pitch. While this proposition also attributes pitch to periodic sounds, we show that it predicts differences between resolved and unresolved harmonic complexes and a complex domain of existence of pitch, in agreement with psychophysical experiments. We also present a possible neural mechanism for pitch estimation based on coincidence detection, which does not require long delays, in contrast with standard temporal models of pitch.

40|$|Mean-field galactic dynamo {{theory is}} the leading theory to explain the {{prevalence}} of regular magnetic fields in spiral galaxies, but its systematic comparison with observations is still incomplete and fragmentary. Here we compare predictions of mean-field dynamo models to observational data on magnetic pitch angle {{and the strength of}} the mean magnetic field. We demonstrate that a standard α^ 2 Ω dynamo model produces pitch angles of the regular magnetic fields of nearby galaxies that are reasonably consistent with available data. The dynamo estimates of the magnetic field strength are generally within a factor of a few of the observational values. Reasonable agreement between <b>theoretical</b> and observed <b>pitch</b> angles generally requires the turbulent correlation time τ to be in the range 10 - 20 Myr, in agreement with standard estimates. Moreover, good agreement also requires that the ratio of the ionized gas scale height to root-mean-square turbulent velocity increases with radius. Our results thus widen the possibilities to constrain interstellar medium (ISM) parameters using observations of magnetic fields. This work is a step toward systematic statistical tests of galactic dynamo theory.

40|$|Observations are {{reported}} of field aligned etectron fluxes {{in the energy}} range 50 – 500 eV at altitudes below 270 km from two rocket flights in the auroral zone. The regions of field aligned suprathermal electrons occurred in bursts of a few seconds duration, {{and in some instances}} the energy of the peak field aligned flux was in the range 100 – 500 eV. Theoretical calculations of the pitch angle distribution were made using the Monte Carlo technique for two model atmospheres having exospheric temperatures of 750 and 1500 K bracketing the expected auroral zone exospheric temperature. The calculations were made for the case of incident field aligned suprathermal fluxes with no local parallel electric field and also for the case of a local constant parallel electric field. Comparison of <b>theoretical</b> and experimental <b>pitch</b> angle distributions showed that in one case at 270 km a parallel electric field of 1 – 2 mV/m fitted the data whereas another burst at 210 km required a parallel electric field of about 10 mV/m to produce a field aligned distribution of 230 eV electrons as pronounced as was observed. Furthermore in this latter case the lack of strong field alignment at 500 eV pointed to localisation of the parallel electric field to an altitude range of 20 – 30 km about the rocket altitude...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{relation}} between the timing of a rising or falling pitch movement and the syllable it accentuates is investigated. The five-syllable utterance /mamamamama/ was provided with a relatively fast rising or falling pitch movement. The timing of the movement was systematically varied and Dutch subjects were asked to indicate which syllable they perceived as accented. In order to find out where in the pitch movement the cue which induces the percept of accentuation is located, the duration of the pitch movement was varied. In order to find out which segments of the utterance this characteristic is linked to, the duration of the /m/ was varied. The results showed that the percept of accentuation is induced by a change in pitch {{at the start of the}} movement. The moment at which the course of pitch starts to change significantly determines which syllable is perceived as accented. If this moment lies some tens of milliseconds before the P-center, i. e., the perceptual moment of occurrence of the syllable, the preceding syllable is perceived as accented. For a rise, a high accent is perceived; for a fall, a low accent. If the pitch change occurs after this moment, the syllable with this P-center is perceived as accented. For the rise, a low accent is then perceived; for the fall, a high accent. This will be discussed in the light of earlier research on accentuation and of <b>theoretical</b> knowledge about <b>pitch</b> accents...|$|R
40|$|This study narrates the {{organisation}} {{of mental health}} care via an ethnographic case study of a NHS Trust mental health directorate in England in the 1990 s, during implementation of the Care Programme Approach (CPA). It seeks to understand how things are organised such that someone gets treated, by someone; in some way, and how far this mode of organisation commits people to courses of action and makes them accountable. Various stories are told - in different ways, using different <b>theoretical</b> frameworks, and <b>pitched</b> {{at different levels of}} analysis. The thesis deploys two 'ontological themes' to do this: sense-making and authorising. Sense-making refers to the processes of how people understand and act; authorising refers to the limits and stabilisation of sense-making, the fixing and legitimation of versions of the truth. The systems story of organisation narrates a gap between what was anticipated by government policy by introducing the CPA, and what happened, with regard to systems of care and forms of responsibility and accountability. 'The teamwork story narrates organising as accomplished through daily work practice. A ceremonial order in team meetings of primus inter pares results in different kinds of responsibility and accountability to that indicated in the CPA. The patienthood story narrates how people are transformed into objects of mental health work. Becoming a psychiatric patient is more diffuse than much labelling theory presumes. and is the product of specific forms of organisation. The thesis concludes by discussing the kind of organisation that allows for more or less authorised versions of what has been, and what should be, done. It suggests two ideal-typical forms of organisation, different kinds of 'structural context' within which organising may take place. The thesis produces two 'grand narratives' with regard to organisation: one, about the structure-process distinction; the other, about the evaluative nature of tales...|$|R
40|$|Talent {{identification}} (TID) {{has implications}} for practice and theory {{in light of the}} increasing popularity of talent management (TM). However, because of the diverse ways and settings in which it occurs, the field of TM lacks conceptual and theoretical boundaries concerning what it means and how it is practiced. Most research takes place in large profit-seeking firms and the main focus of this thesis is to explore how talent and TM are conceptualised in public sector organizations. A qualitative case study methodology was used to gain insights from three public sector organizations and one large retail organization in the UK. The <b>theoretical</b> framework is <b>pitched</b> on multi-levels drawing largely on Institutional Theory with sub-levels being organisational justice, Resource Base View and Human Capital Theories. Key findings include a more inclusive TM philosophy operating in the retail company in contrast to relatively exclusive approaches in two public organizations and a hybrid approach pursued in a third public organization. A second contribution comprises two new aspects of the definition of ‘talent’ namely people who are ‘inclusive’ in their management approach and the idea of ‘talent’ as the ‘art of the conversation’. Both aspects expand the concept of ‘talent as object’ and are useful to practice and policy by driving knowledge of equality and diversity as well as promoting managerial responsibility and competence in conducting career conversations and in driving talent development which is a generic challenge for managers. A third contribution to debates around clarifying the boundaries of the meaning of ‘exclusive’ and ‘inclusive’ talent in relation to inclusion and exclusion is typified by local government’s ‘inclusion’ add-on to its ‘exclusive’ talent approach, which enabled identification of talent from everyone in specified targeted grades as well as those from diverse backgrounds who were under-represented in its leadership team. This finding from local government is important to the TM field as other findings suggest that ‘exclusive’ talent implies ‘exclusion’. A fourth contribution from the health sector highlights the importance of evaluating TM programmes in order to drive continuous organisational support and manage the challenges of poor leadership whilst tracking the progression of talent cohorts...|$|R
