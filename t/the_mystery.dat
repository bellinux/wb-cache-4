5|$|Even {{in ancient}} times these {{similarities}} were controversial. Non-Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> cults resembled each other. Reacting to these claims by outsiders, early Christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion. The 17th-century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought up the question again by accusing the Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from the rituals of <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> cults. Charles-François Dupuis, in the late 18th century, went further by claiming that all Christianity originated in <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> cults. Intensified by religious disputes between Protestants, Catholics, and non-Christians, the controversy has continued to the present day.|$|E
