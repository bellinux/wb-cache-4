40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a quasi-isometric invariant class of metric spaces {{which we call}} metrically thick. We show that any metrically <b>thick</b> <b>space</b> is not (strongly) relatively hyperbolic with respect to any non-trivial collection of subsets. Further, we show that the property of being (strongly) relatively hyperbolic with thick peripheral subgroups is a quasi-isometry invariant. We show that the class of thick groups includes mapping class groups of all surfaces (except those few that are virtually free), the outer automorphism group of the free group on at least 3 generators, non-uniform lattices in higher rank, certain Artin groups, and others. The mapping class groups thus provide the first examples of groups that are asymptotically with cut-points, but not relatively hyperbolic—this allows us to resolve several questions about the structure of relatively hyperbolic groups. As a further application of these techniques we show that Artin groups are relatively hyperbolic {{if and only if}} they are freely decomposable. We also show that Teichmüller spaces for surfaces of sufficiently large complexity are thick, this contrasts with Brock–Farb’s hyperbolicity result in low complexity...|$|E
40|$|Switched {{photocurrent}} {{direction in}} photoelectrodes {{is a very}} interesting phenomenon and has demonstrated their potentials in important applications including photodiodes, phototransistors, light-driven sensors and biosensors. However, the design and mechanism understanding of such photoelectrodes remain challenging to date. Here we report a new phenomenon of sequence-driven the photocurrent direction on a simple bilayer structure of 5 nm thick Au and 10 nm TiO 2 under visible-light irradiation. It is found that when Au layer are deposited as the outer layer on TiO 2 coated fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate (designated as FTO/TiO 2 /Au), anodic photocurrent is obtained due to the band bending formed at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Interestingly, simply swapping the deposition sequence of Au and TiO 2 leads to cathodic photocurrent on FTO/Au/TiO 2 electrode. Characterization and calculations on the photoelectrode reveals that the photogenerated electrons can be easily trapped in the energy well formed between the band bending and the Schottky contact, which allows electronic tunnelling through the 1. 6 nm <b>thick</b> <b>space</b> charge layer, resulting in a unique anodic to cathodic photocurrent conversion. The understanding of this new phenomenon can be important for designing new generation optoelectronic converting devices in a low-cost and facile manner...|$|E

Here we report a method based on bacterial iron biomineralization for the synthesis of alpha-Fe 2 O 3 and its subsequent use as a conversion-based electrode material in Li batteries. This high-yield synthesis approach enlists (1) the room temperature formation of gamma-FeOOH via the use of an anaerobic Fe(o) -oxidizing bacterium Acidovorax sp. strain BoFeN 1 and (2) the transformation of these BoFeN 1 /gamma-FeOOH assemblies into an alveolar bacteria-free alpha-Fe 2 O 3 material by a short heat treatment under air. As the y-FeOOH precursor particles are precipitated between the two membranes of the bacterial cell wall (40 nm <b>thick</b> <b>space),</b> the final material consists of highly monodisperse nanometric x 15 nm) and oriented hematite crystals, assembled to form a hollow shell having the same size and shape as the initial bacteria (bacteriomorph). This double level of control (nanometric particle size and particle organization at the micrometric scale) provided powders exhibiting (1) enhanced electrochemical reversibility when fully reacted with Li and (2) an impressive high rate capability when compared to non-textured primary alpha-Fe 2 O 3 particles of similar size. This bacterially induced eco-efficient and scalable synthesis method opens wide new avenues to be explored at:the crossroads of biomineralization and electrochemistry for energy storage...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{preliminary}} {{findings of a}} study to achieve a durable thin film CdTe photovoltaic device structure onto ultra-thin space qualified cover glass. An aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO) transparent conducting oxide (TCO) was deposited directly onto cover glass using metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). The AZO demonstrated a low sheet resistance of 10 Ω/□ and high optical transparency of 85 % {{as well as an}} excellent adherence and environmental stability. Preliminary deposition of the photovoltaic layers onto the AZO on cover glass, by MOCVD, showed the possibility of such a structure yielding a device conversion efficiency of 7. 2 %. High series resistance (10 Ω. cm 2) and low Voc (586 mV) were identified as the limiting factors when compared to the authors platform process on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated aluminosilicate. The coverage of the Cd 1 -xZnxS window layer along with the front contacting of the device was shown to be the major cause of the low efficiency. Further deposition of the AZO/CdTe employing an oxygen plasma cleaning step to the cover glass and evaporated gold front contacts significantly improved the device performance. A best conversion efficiency of 10. 2 % with series resistance improved to 4. 4 Ω. cm 2 and open circuit voltage (Voc) up to 667 mV and good adhesion has demonstrated for the first time direct deposition of CdTe solar cells onto 100 μm <b>thick</b> <b>space</b> qualified cover glass...|$|E
