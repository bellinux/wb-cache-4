5|$|These early knives {{sold for}} between $800 and $2,000 each; that, {{combined}} with his appearances at knife shows and write-ups in knife magazines, helped Emerson gain status and {{credibility as a}} custom knifemaker. Once established as a serious and reputable maker, Emerson was soon able to concentrate on making <b>the</b> <b>knives</b> he wanted to make—knives designed for use as opposed to show, specifically folding-knives designed for combat.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that <b>the</b> <b>knives</b> he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E

50|$|The {{inclination}} of <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> is <b>the</b> angle between <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> {{face and}} <b>the</b> sample. For an optimal result, this angle must be chosen appropriately. The optimal angle depends upon <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> geometry, <b>the</b> cut speed {{and many other}} parameters. If the angle is adjusted to zero, <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> cut can often become erratic, and a new location of <b>the</b> <b>knife</b> must be used to smooth this out.|$|R

5|$|Myles' Mary Collins {{prosthetic}} {{took six}} hours to accomplish, and the shot where she morphs into the younger Lady Helen took seven hours to complete because it required three stages of make-up. Her first {{performance at the}} beheading scene was met with applause by the extras; Head requested that he redo {{his part of the}} scene because he felt that it was not good enough. Gaius' fall from the balcony was done by a stuntman and filmed with a high-speed camera. The mattress that Merlin magically moves across the floor was achieved with rigging it up to hidden wires and pulleys under the set. <b>The</b> <b>knives</b> Arthur throws were actually shot out of a nitrogen gun; James did throw them in a separate shot, but against a cloth that he still missed. Fake fruit was made for the stocks scene, but it was deemed too fake-looking and was replaced with real tomatoes. The mace fight was originally filmed with plastic maces, but they were not believable as they did not have enough weight. The scene was then shot with real steel maces; {{it was one of the}} most complex and hardest scenes to execute. The climax, where the guests all fall asleep and are covered by cobwebs, took many days to complete. The chandelier falling was also considered difficult.|$|E

On July 28, the Parole board notified Carlos Alberto that they would postpone their decision for at least 90 days, pending resolution of the charges. Two days later, the prison disciplinary hearing officer held hearings on the weapons charges. Alberto's defense consisted not merely of his statement denying possession. The tenth cellmate appeared as a witness, admitting that <b>the</b> <b>knives</b> were his, and his alone, and that Carlos Alberto and none of the other cellmates knew he had hidden <b>the</b> <b>knives</b> in the light fixture. The guilty party also provided a sworn statement to this effect. The disciplinary hearing officer nevertheless found them guilty of possessing the hidden weapons.|$|E

25|$|To {{increase}} the visual interest of his show, Emerson would abuse his Hammond L-100 organ by, among other things, hitting it, beating {{it with a}} whip, pushing it over, riding it across the stage like a horse, playing with it lying on top of him, and wedging knives into the keyboard. Some of these actions also produced musical sound effects: hitting the organ caused it to make explosion-like sounds, turning it over made it feed back, and <b>the</b> <b>knives</b> held down keys, thus sustaining notes. Emerson's show with the Nice has been cited as having a strong influence on heavy metal musicians.|$|E

He then followed Holmes to Indianapolis, where Holmes had rented a cottage. Holmes {{was reported to have}} visited a local pharmacy to purchase the drugs which he used to kill Howard Pitezel, and a repair shop to sharpen <b>the</b> <b>knives</b> he used to chop up the body before he burned it.

Holmes' murder spree finally ended when he was arrested in Boston on November 17, 1894, after being tracked there from Philadelphia by the Pinkertons. He was held on an outstanding warrant for horse theft in Texas, as the authorities had become more suspicious at this point and Holmes appeared poised to flee the country in the company of his unsuspecting third wife.|$|E
