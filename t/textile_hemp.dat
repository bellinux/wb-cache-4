40|$|Background: The fasciclin-like {{arabinogalactan}} proteins (FLAs) {{belong to}} the arabinogalactan protein (AGP) superfamily and are known to play different physiological roles in plants. This class of proteins was shown to participate in plant growth, development, defense against abiotic stresses and, notably, cell wall biosynthesis. Although some studies {{are available on the}} characterization of FLA genes from different species, both woody and herbaceous, no detailed information is available on the FLA family of <b>textile</b> <b>hemp</b> (Cannabis sativa L.), an economically important fibre crop. [br/] Results: By searching the Cannabis genome and EST databases, 23 CsaFLAs have been here identified which are divided into four phylogenetic groups. A real-time qPCR analysis performed on stem tissues (isolated bast fibres and shivs sampled at three heights), hypocotyls (6 - 9 - 12 - 15 - 17 - 20  days-old), whole seedlings, roots, leaves and female/male flowers of the monoecious fibre variety Santhica 27, indicates that the identified FLA genes are differentially expressed. Interestingly, some hemp FLAs are expressed during early phases of fibre growth (elongation), while others are more expressed in the middle and base of the stem and thus potentially involved in secondary cell wall formation (fibre thickening). The bioinformatic analysis of the promoter regions shows that the FLAs upregulated in the younger regions of the stem share a conserved motif related to flowering control and regulation of photoperiod perception. The promoters of the FLA genes expressed at higher levels in the older stem regions, instead, share a motif putatively recognized by MYB 3, a transcriptional repressor belonging to the MYB family subgroup S 4. [br/] Conclusions: These results point to the existence of a transcriptional network fine-tuning the expression of FLA genes in the older and younger regions of the stem, {{as well as in the}} bast fibres/shivs of <b>textile</b> <b>hemp.</b> In summary, our study paves the way for future analyses on the biological functions of FLAs in an industrially relevant fibre crop...|$|E

Both NHF and SHF with strong mechanical properties are good candidates as reinforcing fibres for plastics such as polypropylene (PP). The PP/NHF and PP/SHF composites were blended via internal mixing process. The effect of fibres on the morphology, thermal resistance and reinforcement of the composites were investigated. PP/NHF composites showed higher impact strength, lower flexural strength than PP/SHF at the corresponding loading because NHF has smaller diameter and better thermal resistance than SHF. Meanwhile, NHF has the similar reinforcement to tensile strength with SHF. The effect of maleic anhydride polypropylene (MAPP) on the fibre-resin interface bonding was also comparatively studied. With increasing amount of MAPP, the tensile, flexural and impact strengths of PP/NHF and PP/SHF increased, respectively. The morphology of PP/SHF and PP/NHF results well showed that MAPP improved the interaction of the fibres with PP through chemical adhesion. ...|$|E

Some plants/tissues are rich in secondary metabolites or synthesize thick cell walls, which hinder an efficient RNA extraction. One such example is bast fibres, long extraxylary cells characterized by a thick cellulosic cell wall. Given the economic importance of bast fibres, which {{are used in the}} textile sector, as well as in biocomposites as green substitutes of glass fibres, it is desirable to better understand their development from a molecular point of view. This knowledge favours the development of biotechnological strategies aimed at improving specific properties of bast fibres. To be able to perform high-throughput analyses, such as, for instance, transcriptomics of bast fibres, RNA extraction is a crucial and limiting step.

40|$|Bast fibres {{are long}} extraxylary cells which {{mechanically}} support the phloem {{and they are}} divided into xylan-and gelatinous-type, depending on the composition of their secondary cell walls. The former, typical of jute/ kenaf bast fibres, are characterized {{by the presence of}} xylan and a high degree of lignification, while the latter, found in tension wood, as well as flax, ramie and hemp bast fibres, have a high abundance of crystalline cellulose. During their differentiation, bast fibres undergo specific developmental stages: the cells initially elongate rapidly by intrusive growth, subsequently they cease elongation and start to thicken. The goal of the present study is to provide a transcriptomic close-up of the key events accompanying bast fibre development in <b>textile</b> <b>hemp</b> (Cannabis sativa L.), a fibre crop of great importance. Bast fibres have been sampled from different stem regions. The developmental stages corresponding to active elongation and cell wall thickening have been studied using RNASeq.

40|$|Fibre {{crops are}} {{important}} natural resources, as they sustainably provide bast fibres, an economically-valuable raw material {{used in the}} textile and biocomposite sectors. Among fibre crops, <b>textile</b> <b>hemp</b> (Cannabis sativa L.) is appreciated for its long and strong gelatinous bast fibres. The stem of fibre crops is a useful system for cell wall-oriented studies, because it shows a strong tissue polarity with a lignified inner core and a cellulosic hypolignified cortex, {{as well as a}} basipetal lignification gradient. Along the stem axis of fibre crops, a specific region, denoted snap point, marks the transition from elongation (above it) to fibre thickening (below it). After empirically determining the snap point by tilting the plant, we divided the stem segment containing it into three non-overlapping consecutive regions measuring 1 cm each, and carried out targeted RT-qPCR on cell wall-related genes separately, in outer and inner tissues. Different gene clusters can be observed, two of which are the major gene groups, i. e., one group with members expressed at higher levels in the inner tissues, and one group whose genes are more expressed in the cortex.

A radical possibility of obtaining a new environmentally friendly material with enhanced strength characteristics is shown. The modern developing society has faced the problem of ever increasing demands for the energy intensity of production and the limited potentialities of meeting them. Recently, the worldwide demand for the sources of natural renewable resources has grown, governed by the energy saving and environmentally friendly technologies of their production, and the feasibility of their processing to environmentally friendly, biodegradable materials with a high added value due to the decrease of material and energy costs. One of such resources is hemp, which is rather profitable, requires much less amounts of artificial fertilisers than other cultures, has a favourable effect on the agroecosystem, improves the soil structure, and inhibits weeds, pests and diseases.

Aerobic and anaerobic pectinolytic strains were isolated from hemp or flax sources and characterised. Anaerobic pectinolytic strains had a wide range of acid polygalacturonase (PG) activity, whereas aerobic isolates did not produce any acid PG activity, but only an alkalophylic one, suggesting they could play a minor role in the retting process, except in the early stages. Analysis of 16 S rDNA sequences assigned anaerobic strains to the Clostridium genus and aerobic isolates to the Bacillus and Paenibacillus genus. C. felsineum and C. acetobutylicum were confirmed as the main anaerobic agents. Nevertheless, a high proportion of anaerobic and aerobic pectinolytic strains was assigned to C. saccharobutylicum and B. pumilus, respectively, both species never being described as involved in water retting. Anaerobic and aerobic strains with high PG activity were selected and characterized. PG activity is well correlated with the strain retting efficiency and improvement of the process was obtained by inoculating the retting water with spores of selected aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. An advisable feature of retting strains is the absence of cellulosolytic activity. An aerobic strain with no cellulosolytic activity was identified. In contrast, all the anaerobic isolates showed cellulosolytic activity. Mutagenesis was ineffective for selection of Cel-Pec+ mutants. Localization of the C. felsineum L 1 / 6 PG activity was investigated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is {{generally}} {{assumed that the}} production of plant fibre textiles in ancient Europe, especially woven textiles for clothing, was {{closely linked to the}} development of agriculture through the use of cultivated <b>textile</b> plants (flax, <b>hemp).</b> Here we present a new investigation of the 2800 year old Lusehøj Bronze Age Textile from Voldtofte, Denmark, which challenges this assumption.

Our results thus suggest that the production of woven plant fibre textiles in Bronze Age Europe was based not only on cultivated textile plants but also on the targeted exploitation of wild plants. The Lusehøj find points to a hitherto unrecognized role of nettle as an important textile plant and suggests the need for a re-evaluation of textile production resource management in prehistoric Europe...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Cotton and flax {{are known}} as plants whose fibers {{are used in the}} {{manufacture}} of <b>textiles,</b> and <b>hemp</b> and jute {{are known as}} plants used to make rope. Less well known for its contribution to both textile and rope manufacture is the plant sparto (Spartium iunceum L.; Spanish broom) which grows wild over much of the Mediterranean region in brushwood localities of the mountainous and semi-mountainous zones, including the area of my fieldwork village on the West Coast of the Greek Peloponnesos. Sparto is a perennial broom, growing as a shrub not reaching over 3 m. in height. Its abundant green branches are slender and sharply-pointed. Leaves are small; and tiny, bright yellow flowers form spikes at the ends of stems and appear from May through July. Sparto 2 ̆ 7 s use for rope and textile manufacture may reach back into Greek pre-history as Homer mentions sparto ropes in the Iliad. Writing in the 1 st century A. D., Pliny, in eight books of his Natural History discusses sparto as a source for making ship 2 ̆ 7 s rope, bedding, shepherd 2 ̆ 7 s clothes and footwear. This testimonia gives evidence for the use of sparto in antiquity, but these sources do not furnish complete descriptions of processing methods. On the other hand, though sparto was commonly exploited in rural Greece until less than a lifetime ago, modern documentation on either the plant 2 ̆ 7 s use or its manner of processing is rare. Because the customs surrounding sparto are still within the living memory of older Greeks, recording information is essential. First, the information explains how sparto was processed in the near past and may give clues to ancient processing methods. Second, the information aids in reconstructing the social meaning of hand-producing textiles in the past. Third, the information helps to explain recent changes in modern, rural Greek society. One of my primary contributors is Evagelika. In response to my queries about sparto, she offered to demonstrate the step-by step precedures for processing it. This occurred over two days in August 1990. My narration incorporates information received from a variety of people; but because I participated in most of the steps during Evagelika 2 ̆ 7 s demonstrations, these events form the core of my record of processing methods, as well as my analysis of the social implications...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increase}} of the demand for recyclable materials the usage of natural fibers in technical <b>textiles</b> goes up. <b>Hemp</b> areas just for fibre production slightly grow up every year. Basically foreign varieties are used. To assess the suitability of these Cannabis Sativa varieties in Latvian climatic conditions fibers obtained from the fields of Agricultural Centre of Latgale were studied. Experiments were started in 2010 with the analyse of fibres from nine varieties: Bialobrzeskie, Beniko, Epsilon 68, Fedora 17, Felina 32, Santhica 27, Futura 75, USO 31, Finola. All varieties are devised for obtaining fibre, except of the variety Finola. The fibres of this variety were studied to compare them with fibers of local variety Purini. Variety Purini not only gives very good amount of seed, but also much larger straw yield than the variety Finola. Therefore the task is to examine if hemp of variety Purini is good for both seed as well as fibre production.

The thickness, flexibility and tensile properties were determinedto characterize fibre quality. Fibres were obtained from different places of the straws to determine the type of cutting. The best fibres were in the middle part of straws. Therefor it is better to cut hemp in several levels. From the experiments there was drawn a solution that it is better to cut hemp during blooming. Then it is more time for dew retting. There were examined influence of both seed sowing amount and usage of nitrogen amount on fibre quality and straw yield.

Plywood with different coats, varying their surface physical properties, is developed and introduced in production. In industry, plywood coating with different non-wood materials is widely used. An alternative for the so far used methods is the enhancement of the plywood strength with fibre materials of natural origin. The objective of the study was, using a bicomponent binder, to mutually compare the effect of the long fibres of dried hemp and hemp yarn woven technical fabrics on the changes in the physico-mechanical properties of the plywood composite material. It is shown that, for the composite material with the <b>hemp</b> technical <b>textile</b> introduced in its matrix, bending strength index, in comparison with that for the control sample, increases by 21. 8 % and modulus of elasticity in static bending increases by 23 %. However, introducing individual hemp fibres, these strength indices are lower. Summarising the obtained results, it may be concluded that, in the future experiments, {{it will be necessary to}} investigate the physico-mechanical properties of plywood composite materials, in the matrix of which a technical <b>textile</b> made from <b>hemp</b> is introduced, changing its parameters and the location in different layers of the composite material, as well as the glue, tree species and compressing pressure...|$|R
40|$|The {{earliest}} {{trace of}} cannabis use is an archaeological find of <b>hemp</b> <b>textile</b> in China dating from 4000 B. C. (Li & Lin 1974). Hemp thread and rope from 3000 B. C. {{have also been}} found in Chinese-occupied Turkestan (Fisher 1975). The Rh-Ya (500 B. C., but pointing back many centuries earlier) mentions its use for fiber (Bouquet 1950), as do the Shih-Ching (lOth- 7 th centuries B. C.), the Li-Chi (100 B. C.) and the Chou Li (c. 200 B. C.) (Li & Lin 1974). A grain crop {{was obtained from the}} achene as well, according to the latter three classics (Li & Lin 1974), though the earliest archaeological evidence of this use found to date is from the Han Dynasty (206 B. C. - 220 A. D.). Cannabis grain was not merely an auxiliary crop, for in ancient times it was counted as one of the "five grains, " together with rice, barley, millet and soy beans (Li 1975). To this day a large seeded variety of hemp grows in the far northeast of China, which may well be a relict of its use for grain. Although cannabis ceased to be an important food in China just before the beginning of the Christian era due to the introduction of new crops (Keng 1974), it is still a source of cooking oil and grain in parts of Nepal. There is a peculiar silence on its psychotropic properties in the old scripts, which has led most people to believe that the ancient Chinese were unaware of them. Li, however, notes that inscriptions from the eastern Chou Dynasty (700 - 500 B. C.) have a "negative " connotation accompanying the archaic character for cannabis, Ma, which implies a stupefying effect (Li &...|$|R

This study {{represents}} {{an introduction to}} a more systematic research of the traditional national costumes of Našice area. There has been no written recordings on attire customs of the area {{up to the present}} moment. Našice and pertaining villages are situated in the middle of Slavonia (Croatia), between two rivers the Sava and the Drava. The study has been based on the field data and preserved photos of the women, men and children s garments, whenever possible. The majority of the data is referring to the period {{from the beginning of the}} century to World War II. Small number of data on the last century attire have been mentioned as well. The research comprises also the study of the old Croatian settlements, inhabited by the Croats Catholics, who are calling themselves Šokci. The introductory part of the work discusses the raw materials for the <b>textiles</b> (flax, <b>hemp,</b> wool), types and techniques of weaving, customary decorating of the ready, woven cloth. In short, according to the data from Vukojevci village, the cultivating and processing of flax, i. e. from sowing to weaving, have been described, and as it seems there has been no description yet in the expert literature on the subject. Similar or even the same procedures and terms in processing of flax have been in use in other villages of the area. The study emphasizes the role of cloth for the well being and material life standards of particular families and marriageable young maidens in the history of the area. Particular stress has been put on the role of the cloth in wedding and funeral ceremonies. The description of the traditional national costume of the women relies mainly on the data from three villages Šaptinovci, Koska and Donja Motičina. The costumes are made of home made as well as from the bought material and consist of several parts shirt oplećak, underskirt krilca or skutići, and of skirt and apron. These are the garments completing the national costume i. e. narodna nošnja, the terms differing from the terms describing the clothing pieces of every day (made of bought materials and made to the town fashion). In the period between the wars and nowadays, the costume has been worn only in most ceremonial (formal) occasions (church and state holidays, folklore performances). A special chapter is dealing with the maiden s hair styling and the forms of the head gear of the married women. The national costume of men of the Našice area is a typical Pannonian attire. It consists of the shirt, called rubina and trousers gace, sawn from home made clot...|$|R
40|$|Commonly, {{fibre hemp}} (Cannabis sativa) is not {{considered}} {{for the production of}} soft and easy-care textiles. However, initial tests in the textile industry have shown that certain processes allow improvement in the everyday-wear characteristics of <b>hemp</b> <b>textiles.</b> In the framework of the EU R&D project Hemp-sys [QLRT- 01 - 01363] the potential of hemp as a feedstock in textile processing is investigated. Therefore, a detailed study on the effects of agronomy and fibre extraction processing on fibre properties for textile processing has been carried out. To relate the crop growing conditions with fibre quality and productivity it is required that information is obtained on hemp bast fibre formation. At various stages of the plant development the fibre development has been monitored by microscopic techniques. The two distinct bast fibre types occurring in hemp-the so called primary and secondary fibres-show different and independent development. The primary fibres appear earlier in the development in the rapid growth stage and are formed from the primary meristem in the outer layers (phloem). Primary fibres are thick, extremely long and with compact cell walls and small lumen and are present from bottom to top of the plant. In contrast, the secondary fibres are formed in later stages during thickness growth from the secondary meristem. Secondary fibres are thinner, shorter and with higher lignin content than the primary fibres. In early developmental stages secondary fibres only occur {{at the bottom of the}} stem. Substantial secondary fibre formation is observed at the start of flowering or when the plants grow taller than 2. 25 m and/or thicker than approximately 1 cm. Based upon these observations a selection of conditions can be made for growing and harvesting of hemp to obtain the best quality fibre for textile processing. To produce a crop with maximum amount of primary fibres free from secondary fibres, the recommended practice is to grow hemp at high seed density to avoid thickness growth and to harvest the hemp stems around flowering of the plants...|$|R
