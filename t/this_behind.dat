5|$|The {{first public}} {{announcement}} of the cancellation of the Paramount Television Service and Phase II came {{at the hands of}} the gossip columnist Rona Barrett at the start of December. In response, Paramount released a statement that said the new network had been pushed back to the fall of 1978, and that Phase II had its episode order increased from 13 to between 15 and 22. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>behind</b> the scenes, production continued on Star Trek as a film, not as a series. One of the changes around the same time as Barrett's reports was the realization that all the model work completed thus far had to be restarted from scratch, as it was not detailed enough to be blown up on a motion picture-sized screen. Two further changes took place in December: Collins was dropped as director, for Paramount wanted a motion picture director and not one with experience only in television; and Livingston allowed his contract to run out and left the production, owing to the poor relationship he had with Roddenberry. By January, Paramount no longer pretended that Star Trek was to be anything other than a feature film. Livingston was brought back, but only in a writing capacity, and Robert Wise was hired as director on the film to replace Collins.|$|E

25|$|The Latin Rite of the Catholic Church {{does not}} teach that the {{suffering}} of purgatory is imposed by God.

Knowing the acts of love that those on earth are offering for one might conceivably make more bearable the remorse.|$|E

Farouk Abdulhak remains wanted for the rape and murder of Martine Vik Magnussen. Farouk Abdulhak has known {{for the past eight years}} now that he is wanted for the rape and murder of Magnussen. There have been {{extensive}} diplomatic efforts made over this time to return him to the UK, to no avail. This anniversary should serve as a further reminder that he cannot put <b>this</b> <b>behind</b> him, it will not go away and I appeal to him and those close to him to advise him to return to the UK to stand trial.|$|E

Heidi Holland suggested that due to his [...] "dysfunctional" [...] upbringing, Mugabe had a [...] "fragile self-image", describing him as [...] "a man cut off from his feelings, devoid of ordinary warmth and humanity". According to her, Mugabe had a [...] "marked emotional immaturity", and was homophobic, as well as racist and xenophobic.|$|E
500|$|Tyndall {{has been}} {{described}} as a racial nationalist, and a British nationalist, as well as a fascist, neo-fascist, and a Neo-Nazi. Tyndall adhered to Neo-Nazism during the 1960s, although from the 1970s onward he increasingly concealed <b>this</b> <b>behind</b> the rhetoric of [...] "British patriotism". According to Thurlow, this was because by this time Tyndall had realised that [...] "open Nazism was counter-productive" [...] to his cause. This was in accordance with a wider trend among Britain's far-right to avoid the term [...] "British fascism", with its electorally unpalatable connotations, and instead refer to [...] "British nationalism" [...] as a way of hoping to appeal to the masses. Sykes stated that Tyndall split with Jordan because—in contrast to the latter's Neo-Nazi focus on pan-'Aryan' unity—he [...] "thought more traditionally in terms of British nationalism, the British race and the British Empire". Jordan himself accused Tyndall of being [...] "an extreme Tory imperialist, a John Bull, unable to recognise the call of race beyond Britain's frontiers".|$|E

2500|$|New South Wales had won 10 Sheffield Shields on the trot - {{though they}} would be ousted by Victoria {{by the end of}} the season - and had a team that was {{stronger}} than most Test sides; captain Richie Benaud, vice-captain Neil Harvey, Bobby Simpson, Grahame Thomas, Norm O'Neill, Brian Booth, Alan Davidson, Ray Flockton, Johnny Martin and Frank Misson. Ted Dexter won the toss and batted of course, but the MCC innings hinged on Geoff Pullar's 132. Even that was lucky as the Lancashire opener edged the ball to Simpson in the first over who dropped it, just to show that even the best slip fielders are not infallible. Pullar continued to struggle and give other chances, but he put <b>this</b> <b>behind</b> him and stuck to his work, which was just as well as only Dexter (42) and Cowdrey (50) stayed to help him out. 180/2 sank to 303/9 thanks to Benaud (3/61) and Martin (4/122), but tailend [...] "George" [...] thumped 30 to bring the total up to 348 a few minutes before stumps. Thomas survived one ball from Fred Trueman, successfully appealed for light and they all trooped back to the pavilion. On the second day Dexter resorted to his negative tactics of bowling on the leg stump with an on-side field, which was meant to restrict strokeplay. In this he failed as New South Wales rattled up 408/5 in the day, causing Benaud the remark that he had better change his way of thinking. Grahame Thomas was quickly bowled by Trueman (1/45), who then left the field with fibrositis and the MCC bowling attack lost all its bite. Simpson made 110 – his fourth hundred in four matches – and added 234 for the second wicket with Norm O'Neill, who had lost a few pounds and overcame his bad form to make 143 like a man on a mission. Booth (41), Harvey (63), Davidson (55), Flockton (62 not out) and Benaud (40 not out) kept the scoreboard moving at a fair rate and Benaud declared during the lunch break on the third day having made 124 runs in that morning to bring the total to 532/6. Davidson (1/11) removed David Sheppard for 7 and then it was all the spinners. Benaud took his best first class innings haul of 18-10-18-7 and Martin (2/32) picked up the wickets of Dexter and Cowdrey as the tourists crumbled to 104 all out to lose by an innings and 80 runs. It was New South Wales first innings victory over the MCC, and by definition their greatest victory over the English tourists.|$|E
