5|$|Although Sunday schools such as {{the ones}} {{established}} by Trimmer have often been characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle class to impose their morality on the lower classes, Thomas Laqueur has argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.|$|E
5|$|Life in a workhouse was {{intended}} to be harsh, to deter the able-bodied poor and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply. But in areas such as the provision of free medical care and education for children, neither of which was available to the poor in England living outside workhouses until the early 20th century, workhouse inmates were advantaged over the general population, a dilemma <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> Law authorities never managed to reconcile.|$|E

5|$|After {{the general}} {{election}} in November 1982, the incoming Michigan governor, James Blanchard, appointed Mansour in December to the directorship of the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS); Michigan's biggest agency. The administrative position involved oversight of public health programs including disbursement of some $5million in federal monies from Medicaid for abortions. To accept the appointment, she asked for and received permission from her order and from Szoka. Szoka asked Mansour to publicly state her opposition to abortion; he said he originally gave his approval on this condition. Mansour did not follow his request. Though she personally disapproved of abortion, she knew that many others felt differently, and she determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> should have equal access to abortion {{as long as it}} was legal.|$|E
5|$|In October 1980, he {{interacted with}} a {{delegation}} of Solidarity members that included Lech Wałęsa, future President of the Third Republic of Poland. When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that {{he would try to}} give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981. That month, the government declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> economy was forcing it to cut back on its promise of ensuring that Polish workers did not have to work on Saturdays, and that it would offer a number of Saturdays as work-free instead.|$|E
5|$|No {{subspecies}} are recognised, and {{the degree}} of geographic variation is unclear. Adult male birds which breed on the mainland have been reported as having lighter upperparts and underparts than their Tasmanian relatives, and females are said to be browner, but these differences may also result from worn plumage. Furthermore, migration across the Bass Strait by some birds obfuscates the issue. Mainland and Tasmanian birds are the same size. Ornithologists Richard Schodde and Ian Mason argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> quality of museum collections and partially migratory habits meant that discrete subspecies could not be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} observed variation within the species.|$|E

5|$|Some {{critics have}} seen Swift as hopeless {{in regards to}} actual change for Ireland. The rich could never change from their {{absentee}} landlord mentality that has stripped Ireland of its economic independence, {{and that is why}} Swift spends the majority of his sermon discussing the poor. Swift proposes a remedy of sorts that would help the poor; they should be educated and the free travel of beggars should be restricted. These ideas were intended to limit the amount <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> consumed in society, which, combined with a proposal for the poor to act more virtuously, should correct many of the problems that plague Ireland, but these ideas were never put into effect.|$|E
5|$|The Koryak {{of eastern}} Siberia {{have a story}} about the fly agaric (wapaq) which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity Vahiyinin ("Existence") spat onto earth, and his spittle became the wapaq, and his saliva becomes the warts. After {{experiencing}} the power of the wapaq, Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it. Among the Koryaks, one report said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the English Poor Law system {{can be traced back}} to late medieval {{statutes}} dealing with beggars and vagrancy but it was only during the Tudor period <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Poor</b> Law system became codified. Monasteries, the primary source of poor relief, were dissolved by the Tudors Reformation causing poor relief to move from a largely voluntary basis to a compulsory tax that was collected at a parish level. Early legislation was concerned with vagrants and making the able-bodied work, especially while labour was in short supply following the Black Death.|$|E

5|$|There are {{texts in}} which Isis travels {{in the wider}} world. She moves among {{ordinary}} humans who are unaware of her identity, and she even appeals to these people for help. This is another unusual circumstance, for in Egyptian myth, gods and humans are normally separate. As {{in the first phase}} of the myth, she often has the aid of other deities, who protect her son in her absence. According to one magical spell, seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard Isis as she seeks help for Horus. They even take revenge on a wealthy woman who has refused to help Isis by stinging the woman's son, making it necessary for Isis to heal the blameless child. This story conveys a moral message <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> can be more virtuous than the wealthy and illustrates Isis's fair and compassionate nature.|$|E
5|$|Many {{attempted}} {{methods of}} eradicating meat ants have proven unsuccessful. The first investigations {{were made in}} the 1930s to control meat ant populations in urban areas by fumigation, using carbon disulfide and calcium cyanide. Although these methods successfully eradicated some nests, they were rapidly reoccupied by those living in satellite or rival nests. However, the reoccupation of these nests by incipient colonies (young colonies beginning to develop) does not occur. This is because colony founding is often difficult and rare when most areas are nested by mature colonies. This behaviour has led to long-term maintenance and repeated treatments to ensure the nests are not resettled. In addition, not all nests can be treated, and some may remain undetected from pest controllers. In 1973, Greaves notes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> penetration of insecticides into all nest galleries may be the reason why nests are reoccupied, but owing to the nest structure, the insecticides have to be poured into each individual hole as no gallery connects to one another. Missing a single gallery can mostly lead to the reoccupation of the nest site. Greaves concludes that dieldrin is the most effective insecticide to control meat ants, capable of killing the ants quickly and being the most long-lasting chemical used.|$|E

40|$|Much of {{the current}} popular debate about foreign aid is based on <b>the</b> {{assumption}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> countries are in a poverty trap.

How do these explanations for low growth of <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> countries fare against alternative explanations, such as bad government and institutions? Preliminary results indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> countries grow more slowly than the rest only during some time periods (especially recent ones), but not others. Bad government is the main explanation of the slower growth in these periods rather than the conventional mechanisms for the poverty trap, which in turn would suggest a different role for foreign aid. ...|$|R
