5|$|A {{description}} of thought content would describe a patient's delusions, overvalued ideas, obsessions, phobias and preoccupations. Abnormalities of thought content are established by exploring individuals' <b>thoughts</b> in an open-ended conversational manner {{with regard to}} their intensity, salience, the emotions associated with the <b>thoughts,</b> {{the extent to which the}} <b>thoughts</b> are experienced as one's own and under one's control, and the degree of belief or conviction associated with the <b>thoughts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Preoccupations are <b>thoughts</b> {{which are}} not fixed, false or intrusive, but have an undue {{prominence}} in the person's mind. Clinically significant preoccupations would include <b>thoughts</b> of suicide, homicidal <b>thoughts,</b> suspicious or fearful beliefs associated with certain personality disorders, depressive beliefs (for example that one is unloved or a failure), or the cognitive distortions of anxiety and depression.|$|E
5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his <b>thoughts</b> into words, and organize his <b>thoughts</b> into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{on the role of}} complex <b>thought</b> in the {{development}} of <b>thought</b> and scientific knowledge. According to Vigotsky, the complex <b>thought</b> is the first phase in the ontogenesis and phylogenesis of human <b>thought.</b> It is in this sense pre-conceptual. Also, according to Vigotsky, the complex <b>thought</b> has its internal genesis which begins with associative complexes and ends in pseudo-concepts. Complex also an explanatory role in scientific <b>thought.</b> Complex <b>thought</b> ppears on all levels and stages of the development of scientific knowledge. Metaphors may appear in the complex <b>thought</b> as a dominant mode of <b>thought</b> or in the conceptual structure as the auxiliary in the explanation. Analogies present a certain structuration of the complex <b>thought,</b> which contributes to the creation of conceptual structure. The place of analogy is thus between a complex <b>thought</b> and conceptual <b>thought...</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and more on his immediate surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his own <b>thoughts</b> as he begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's <b>thoughts</b> on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E

50|$|Accordingly, the <b>thought</b> of Thomas Aquinas {{came to be}} {{assessed}} positively in relation to all other ‘modern’ systems of <b>thought.</b> In particular, the Aristotelianism of Thomas was seen {{in contrast to the}} <b>thought</b> of Kant (itself seen as representative of ‘modern’ <b>thought).</b> Other ‘modern’ forms of <b>thought,</b> including Ontologism, Traditionalism, the dualism of Anton Günther, and the <b>thought</b> of Descartes, were also seen as flawed in comparison to Thomism.|$|R

He maintains that if language is the expression of <b>thoughts</b> and language is systematic, then <b>thoughts</b> must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E

5|$|Locke's Some <b>Thoughts</b> Concerning Education was {{a runaway}} best-seller. During {{the eighteenth century}} alone, Some <b>Thoughts</b> was {{published}} in at least 53 editions: 25 English, 16 French, six Italian, three German, two Dutch, and one Swedish. It was also excerpted in novels such as Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1740–1), and it formed the theoretical basis of much children's literature, particularly that of the first successful children's publisher, John Newbery. According to James Secord, an eighteenth-century scholar, Newbery included Locke's educational advice to legitimise the new genre of children's literature. Locke's imprimatur would ensure the genre's success.|$|E

40|$|Even {{after the}} {{characterisation}} of <b>thought</b> experiments {{suggested in the}} introduction of this book, their population — we are a bit tempted {{to speak of a}} bestiary or zoo full of monsters — remains too great for us not to wish to tidy it up a bit: in other words, to distinguish among different types of <b>thought</b> experiment. Several {{attempts have been made to}} do so, and we dispose of various taxonomies. You can distinguish <b>thought</b> experiments by the disciplines to which the matter in question belongs, or by their function in a theory, descriptive or evaluative <b>thought</b> experiments, destructive and constructive <b>thought</b> experiments, <b>thought</b> experiments that result in decidable cases and <b>thought</b> experiments that do not, <b>thought</b> experiments that correspond to a physically possible experiment and <b>thought</b> experiments that correspond only to a metaphysical possibility, <b>thought</b> experiments that justify a law and <b>thought</b> experiments that clarify a concept, and so on. 2 Nonetheless, all these taxonomies miss what will prove to be not only a useful distinction to tidy up our zoo, but a response to the radical objection that could be applied to the very idea of a <b>thought</b> experiment. If imagination is free to wander about in a <b>thought</b> experiment, without anything equivalent to the principle of reality able to intervene, is it ever possible that a <b>thought</b> experiment would not work per se? Of these two options, only one is real: — Either all <b>thought</b> experiments are successful, and there is no need to be a stubborn falsificationist to conclude that the very idea of a <b>thought</b> experiment should be abandoned. — Or there is a distinction between successful and unsuccessful <b>thought</b> experiments, and the idea of a <b>thought</b> experiment could have a certain epistemological depth. 1 We thank Marc Naimark for having revised this text, and John Zeimbekis for having commented on its first version...|$|R
