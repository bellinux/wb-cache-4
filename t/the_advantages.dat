5|$|A {{significant}} number of broadside ironclads {{was built in the}} 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time, and the rigging did not impede the field of fire.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ancient and}} modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae {{as an example of}} the power of a {{patriotic}} army defending its native soil.

5|$|Lagenidium giganteum is a {{water-borne}} mould that parasitizes the {{larval stage}} of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This alga has <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it {{is susceptible to}} many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.|$|E

5|$|Militarily, {{although}} {{the battle was}} actually not decisive {{in the context of}} the Persian invasion, Thermopylae is of some significance on the basis of the first two days of fighting.

5|$|Once it was {{recognized}} that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that re-compression could relieve the symptoms, Paul Bert showed in 1878 that decompression sickness is caused by nitrogen bubbles released from tissues and blood during or after decompression, and showed <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of breathing oxygen after developing decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of {{linezolid}} is {{its high}} bioavailability (close to 100%) when given by mouth: the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, {{as if it}} had been given intravenously. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.|$|E

50|$|After the {{encounter}} with Raghu & Rajiv, the roadies were shocked. Then they are given some choices similar to the Prisoner's dilemma. Both the teams were given an advantage and a choice. They can take a shortcut and give back <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> or keep <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> to face a task. If A takes the shortcut & B does not, team B will have to face a wrestler to win <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> and vice versa. If both do not take the shortcut, they have to fight with a wrestler each and the winner gets <b>the</b> <b>advantage.</b> If both take the shortcut, {{they will have to}} face two wrestlers each.|$|R
5|$|The Irish and British {{authorities}} co-operated in the chartering of ships. They made combined {{purchases of}} wheat, maize, sugar, animal feeds and petrol.

These advantages were not borne out by experience. So they chose to sail alone.|$|E

Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail modifications to the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.|$|E

5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. This process has <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Marine Racecar Board of the National Academy of Science {{conducted}} a survey of industry experts regarding {{the pros and cons}} of double-hull design. Some of <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of the double-hull design that were mentioned include ease of ballasting in emergency situations, reduced practice of saltwater ballasting in cargo tanks decreases corrosion, increased environmental protection, cargo discharge is quicker, more complete and easier, tank washing is more efficient, and better protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, the Spanish {{government}} decided {{to sign a}} contract with the French company GIAT to begin production of the AMX-30. However, it was not <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of the French vehicle itself that influenced the decision. Rather, it was the UK's unwillingness to sell their L7 tank-gun, the low cost of the AMX-30, and the French offer to allow Spain to manufacture the tank, that led the Spanish Army to favor the French armored vehicle.|$|E
30|$|In a nutshell, <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of OPE {{is that it}} {{destroys the}} {{structure}} of the tree and <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of PPE is that it destroys the order information. Thus, by combining OPE with PPE, we remove both order- and structure-based linkages.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Advantage</b> was a 4 MHz Z80a-based {{computer}} with 64 KB of user RAM and 16 KB of graphics RAM. It used two single-sided, double-density 180 KB floppy disk (hard-sectored) drives and an optional 5 MB Winchester disk. <b>The</b> <b>Advantage</b> {{was known for}} its 640×240 graphics capabilities and was sold with four demonstration programs, one of which plotted and calculated a pattern of lines reminiscent of the Arcade game Qix. <b>The</b> <b>Advantage</b> also had an optional 8088 co-processor board available that ran MS-DOS 1.0.

5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> of this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E
5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, {{the response of}} the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again. Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> of both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.|$|E

He was instrumental in the founding of Golders Green Crematorium and designed the gardens there, which replaced the traditional Victorian mourning graveyard with open lawn, flowerbeds, and woodland gardens.|$|E
