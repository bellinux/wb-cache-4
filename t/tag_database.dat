He started by establishing an expressed sequence <b>tag</b> <b>database</b> and transcriptome analyses of Aplysia. He identified a serotonin receptor involved in learning-related synaptic facilitation in Aplysia. In addition, he was successful in finding the novel signaling molecules ApLLP, CAMAP, ApPDE4, and ApAUF1, which are involved in long-term facilitation. With his colleagues at Columbia University, he delineated the molecular networks of the molecules that interplay with other regulatory molecules, such as ApCAM, CREB1, CREB2, C/EBP, and ApAF. Furthermore, Kaang reported that, by genetically controlling the expression of these key molecules in specific neurons, he could induce long-term facilitation that lasted days with a single pulse of serotonin that normally induces short-term facilitation that lasts only several minutes.|$|E

The <b>TAG</b> <b>Database</b> encompasses file- and relational-database-resident event-level metadata, distributed across all ATLAS Tiers. An oracle hosted global TAG relational database, containing all ATLAS events, implemented in Oracle, will exist at Tier O. Implementing {{a system that is}} both performant and manageable at this scale is a challenge. A 1 TB relational <b>TAG</b> <b>Database</b> has been deployed at Tier 0 using simulated tag data. The database contains one billion events, each described by two hundred event metadata attributes, and is currently undergoing extensive testing in terms of queries, population and manageability. These 1 TB tests aim to demonstrate and optimise the performance and scalability of an Oracle <b>TAG</b> <b>Database</b> on a global scale. Partitioning and indexing strategies are crucial to well-performing queries and manageability of the database and have implications for database population and distribution, so these are investigated. Physics query patterns are anticipated, but a crucial feature of the system must be to support a broad range of queries across all attributes. Concurrently, event tags from ATLAS Computing System Commissioning distributed simulations are accumulated in an Oracle-hosted database at CERN, providing an event-level selection service valuable for user experience and gathering information about physics query patterns.

40|$|The {{problem of}} multidrug {{resistance}} requires the efficient and accurate identification of new classes of antimicrobial agents. Endogenous antimicrobial peptides produced by most organisms are a promising source of such molecules. We have exploited the high conservation of signal sequences in teleost and anuran antimicrobial peptides to search cDNA (expressed sequence <b>tag)</b> <b>databases</b> for likely candidates. Subject sequences were then analysed {{for the presence}} of potential antimicrobial peptides based on physicochemical properties (amphipathic helical structure, cationicity) and use of the D-descriptor model to predict the therapeutic index (relation between the minimum inhibitory concentration and the concentration giving 50 % haemolysis). This analysis also suggested mutations to probe the role of the primary structure in determining potency and selectivity. Selected sequences were chemically synthesized and the antimicrobial activity of the peptides was confirmed. In particular, a short (21 -residue) sequence, likely of sticklefish origin, showed potent activity and it was possible to tune the spectrum of action and/or selectivity by combining three directed mutations. Membrane permeabilization studies on both bacterial and host cells indicate that the mode of action was prevalently membranolytic. This method opens up the possibility for more effective searching of the vast and continuously growing expressed sequence <b>tag</b> <b>databases</b> for novel antimicrobial peptides, which are likely abundant, and the efficient identification of the most promising candidates among them...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The ATLAS <b>Tag</b> <b>Database</b> is an event-level {{metadata}} system, {{designed to}} allow efficient identification and selection of interesting events for user analysis. By making first-level cuts using queries on a relational database, {{the size of an}} analysis input sample could be greatly reduced and thus the time taken for the analysis reduced. Deployment of such a <b>Tag</b> <b>database</b> is underway, but to be most useful it needs to be integrated with the distributed data management (DDM) and distributed analysis (DA) components. This means addressing the issue that the DDM system at ATLAS groups files into datasets for scalability and usability, whereas the <b>Tag</b> <b>Database</b> points to events in files. It also means setting up a system which could prepare a list of input events and use both the DDM and DA systems to run a set of jobs. The ATLAS Tag Navigator Tool (TNT) has been developed to address these issues in an integrated way and provide a tool that the average physicist can use. Here, the current status of this work is presented and areas of future work are highlighted. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{the application of}} capillary liquid chromatography (LC) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometric instrumentation for the rapid characterization of microbial proteomes. Previously (Lipton et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002, 99, 11049) the peptides {{from a series of}} growth conditions of Deinococcus radiodurans have been characterized using capillary LC MS/MS and accurate mass measurements which are captured as an accurate mass and time (AMT) <b>tag</b> <b>database.</b> Using this AMT <b>tag</b> <b>database,</b> detected peptides can be assigned using measurements obtained on a TOF due to the additional use of elution time data as a constraint. When peptide matches are obtained using AMT tags (i. e., using both constraints) unique matches of a mass spectral peak occurs 88 % of the time. Not only are AMT tag matches unique in most cases, the coverage of the proteome is high; ∼ 3500 unique peptide AMT tags are found on average per capillary LC run. From the results of the AMT <b>tag</b> <b>database</b> search, ∼ 900 ORFs detected using LC-TOFMS, with ∼ 500 ORFs covered by at least two AMT tags. These results indicate that AMT database searches with modest mass and elution time criteria can provide proteomic information for approximately one thousand proteins in a single run of < 3 h. The advantage of this method over using MS/MS based techniques is the large number of identifications that occur in a single experiment as well as the basis for improved quantitation. For MS/MS experiments, the number of peptide identifications is severely restricted because of the time required to dissociate the peptides individually. These results demonstrate the utility of the AMT tag approach using capillary LC-TOF MS instruments, and also show that AMT tags developed using other instrumentation can be effectively utilized...|$|E
40|$|The ATLAS event-level {{metadata}} infrastructure supports {{applications that}} range from data quality monitoring, anomaly detection, and fast physics monitoring to event-level selection and navigation to file-resident event data at any processing stage, from raw through analysis object data, in globally distributed analysis. A central component of the infrastructure is a distributed <b>TAG</b> <b>database,</b> which contains event-level metadata records for all ATLAS events, real and simulated. This resource offers a unique global view of ATLAS data, and provides an opportunity, not only for stream-style mining of event data, but also for an examination of data across streams, across runs, and across (re) processings. The <b>TAG</b> <b>database</b> serves as a natural locus for run-level and processing-level integrity checks, for investigations of event duplication and other issues in the trigger and offline systems, for questions about stream overlap, for queries about interesting but out-of-stream events, for statistics, and more.
