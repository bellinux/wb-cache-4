5|$|Overall, about 1 {{percent of}} all people have one or more {{cerebral}} aneurysms. Most of these, however, are small and unlikely <b>to</b> <b>rupture.</b>|$|E
5|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD), a hereditary kidney condition, {{is known to be}} associated with cerebral aneurysms in 8 percent of cases, but most such aneurysms are small and therefore unlikely <b>to</b> <b>rupture.</b> As a result, screening is only recommended in families with ADPKD where one family member has had a ruptured aneurysm.|$|E

30|$|Patients {{included}} in the study were those suffering from SAH due <b>to</b> <b>ruptured</b> aneurysms presenting with acute hydrocephalus or developing in-hospital acute hydrocephalus after admission in the acute event. Patients excluded from the study were those presenting with SAH due <b>to</b> <b>ruptured</b> aneurysms developing hydrocephalus of late onset (more than 1  month after SAH), with no radiological evidence of hydrocephalus during hospital stay. Patients with non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (including perimesencephalic SAH) or with hydrocephalus due to other causes were also excluded.|$|R
5|$|Spontaneous {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{is thought}} to result from increased pressures in the lung that cause alveoli <b>to</b> <b>rupture.</b> In spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema, air travels from the ruptured alveoli into the interstitium and along the blood vessels of the lung, into the mediastinum and from there into the tissues of the neck or head.|$|E
5|$|If the {{dissection}} of {{the artery}} {{extends to the}} part of the artery that lies inside the skull, subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur (1% of cases). This arises due <b>to</b> <b>rupture</b> of the artery and accumulation of blood in the subarachnoid space. It may be characterized by a different, usually severe headache; it may also cause a range of additional neurological symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely <b>to</b> <b>rupture.</b> Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E

Five examples of tension pneumothorax secondary <b>to</b> <b>ruptured</b> hydatid cyst of the lung are reported: the mechanism of this tension effect and helpful diagnostic points are discussed. We think that surgical correction is the only satisfactory treatment of tension pneumothorax due <b>to</b> <b>ruptured</b> hydatid cyst: surgery is advocated in any suspected cyst {{as soon as it}} is discovered so as to avoid any such serious complication.

5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent <b>to</b> <b>rupture.</b> The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes are organelles {{that contain}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} for {{intracellular}} digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases which require an acidic environment for optimal performance. Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle. If a lysosome were <b>to</b> <b>rupture,</b> the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.|$|E
5|$|Patterns of seismic {{activity}} detected by paleoseismology {{suggest that the}} filling of Lake Cahuilla might have triggered stress changes that caused earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault and other faults when they were already close <b>to</b> <b>rupture.</b> Such lake-induced seismicity is known from reservoirs and referred to as induced seismicity. Alternatively, earthquakes could have caused course changes in the Colorado River that then caused the lake to flood or to dry up; paleoseismology in Coachella is consistent with this hypothesis. Some earthquakes such as the 1892 Laguna Salada earthquake caused large vertical displacements that could have triggered flooding. Conversely, tectonically driven uplift of the northern side of the Colorado River Delta tends to stabilize the present southward course of the river against diversions to the north.|$|E

30|$|Patellar tendon {{ruptures}} usually {{occur in}} athletic patients aged below 40  years, much more following sport injuries [1]. Its preferred location is the lower pole of the patella at the bone–tendon junction.

5|$|The flame fougasse has {{remained}} in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient {{to the present}} day. Such weapons are improvised from available fuel containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades and are triggered electrically or by lengths of detonating cord. In some designs, detonating cord is used <b>to</b> <b>rupture</b> the container immediately before triggering the propelling charge. In order to guarantee ignition, the improvised devices frequently feature two explosive charges, one to throw {{and the other to}} ignite the fuel. Weapons of this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars as well as other conflicts.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} 5.7(Mw) earthquake occurred inland {{near the}} southern coast of Mexico {{at a depth of}} 24km (14.9mi), with a duration of nearly one minute and an epicenter about 55km (34mi) west of Ometepec, Guerrero. In the region, the Cocos, North American, and Caribbean Plates converge and create a tectonic zone of continuous seismic activity. The quake struck near the eastern periphery of the Guerrero seismic gap, which extends from Acapulco to IxtapaZihuatanejo and contains enough seismic energy to generate an earthquake of up to magnitude 7.5, but it did not cause the gap <b>to</b> <b>rupture.</b> Initial estimates from the USGS placed its intensity at a magnitude of 5.8(Mw); the National Seismological Service registered the earthquake at magnitude 5.5(ML).|$|E
5|$|The mutants {{infiltrate}} Stryker's {{base and}} Magneto and Mystique go to disable Cerebro before the brainwashed Xavier can activate it. Storm and Nightcrawler rescue the captured students, and Jean fights a mind-controlled Cyclops; their battle frees Cyclops but damages the dam, which begins <b>to</b> <b>rupture.</b> Wolverine finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting lab and remembers it as {{where he received}} his adamantium skeleton. Wolverine fights and kills Yuriko, then chases Stryker to a helicopter pad and chains him to the helicopter's wheel. Magneto stops Cerebro and, using Mystique impersonating Stryker to command Jason, has Xavier redirect its powers on normal humans. The two subsequently use Stryker's helicopter to escape, accompanied by Pyro who has been swayed to Magneto's views. Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro, where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason's concentration and free Xavier from his control.|$|E

40|$|Carotid {{cavernous}} fistulae (CCF) are abnormal {{communication between}} cavernous {{segment of the}} internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus. These entities are usually encountered in 0. 2 - 0. 8 % of patients with traumatic skull base fractures. Traumatic cerebral aneurysms are rare and account for less than 1 % of intracranial aneurysms. CCF due <b>to</b> <b>ruptured</b> intradural traumatic aneurysm is very rare and difficult to treat by surgical methods.

5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} propshaft seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's pressure hull, {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, Triton could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the Tritons fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from Tritons high speed caused these cables <b>to</b> <b>rupture,</b> rendering the fathometer inoperable.|$|E
5|$|An {{aneurysm}} may {{be detected}} incidentally on brain imaging; this presents a conundrum, as all treatments for cerebral aneurysms {{are associated with}} potential complications. The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) provided prognostic data both in people having previously had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and people who had aneurysms detected by other means. Those having previously had a SAH {{were more likely to}} bleed from other aneurysms. In contrast, those having never bled and had small aneurysms (smaller than 10mm) were very unlikely to have a SAH and were likely to sustain harm from attempts to repair these aneurysms. On the basis of the ISUIA and other studies, it is now recommended that people are considered for preventive treatment only if they have a reasonable life expectancy and have aneurysms that are highly likely <b>to</b> <b>rupture.</b> At the same time, there is only limited evidence that endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms is actually beneficial.|$|E
5|$|During the match, she {{was knocked}} onto her right side, and {{her right arm}} became trapped {{underneath}} her wheelchair, causing a tendon in her elbow <b>to</b> <b>rupture.</b> Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down tried to block the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her right arm, and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow. Because she had a pre-existing condition, the insurance company refused {{to pay for her}} treatment, although it paid her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot of anger towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use of an electric wheelchair because of the severity of her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.|$|E

25|$|The risk {{of death}} is highest {{in the first two}} years after the acute event, and {{individuals}} should be followed closely during this time period. About 29% of late deaths following surgery are due <b>to</b> <b>rupture</b> of either a dissecting aneurysm or another aneurysm. In addition, a 17% to 25% incidence exists of new aneurysm formation, typically due to dilatation of the residual false lumen. These new aneurysms are more likely <b>to</b> <b>rupture,</b> due to their thinner walls.|$|E
