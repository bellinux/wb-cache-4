5|$|A Falls Count Anywhere {{match between}} Kurt Angle and Abyss followed, lasting 17 minutes. At {{one point during}} the {{encounter}} while Abyss was standing on <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> and Angle was on the stage, Angle performed a running leap off the stage into a somersault senton, connecting with Abyss on the floor. Angle was the victor in the bout, after throwing Abyss off of a scaffold through the Spanish announcers' table, then descending and covering Abyss for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|The stadium hosted {{its first}} concert on 16 April 2011, when Swedish ska group Hoffmaestro & Chraa performed. The concert {{was held at}} Ståplatstorget, the large area behind the Northern Stand terraces. The concert was {{attended}} by 3,000, {{and there were some}} concerns regarding the suitability of the venue after <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> started rocking. However, safety checks the next day showed that the structure had not been damaged, and was suitable to host similar events in the future. On November 1, 2016, the stadium hosted a public mass led by Pope Francis as part of his two-day visit to Scania.|$|E
5|$|For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>floor,</b> but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the ladder, and used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E

5|$|Mugabe {{was arrested}} on his return to Southern Rhodesia in December 1963. His trial lasted from January to March 1964, during which he refused to retract the subversive {{statements}} that he had publicly made. In March 1964 {{he was sentenced to}} 21 months imprisonment. Mugabe was first imprisoned at Salisbury Maximum Security Prison, before being moved to the Wha Wha detention centre and then the Sikombela detention centre in Que Que. At the latter, he organised study classes for the inmates, teaching them basic literacy as well as maths and English. Sympathetic black warders smuggled messages from Mugabe {{and other members of the}} ZANU executive committee to activists outside the prison. At the executive's bidding, ZANU activist Herbert Chitepo had organised a small guerrilla force in Lusaka. In April 1966 it carried out a failed attempt to destroy power pylons at Sinoia, and shortly after attacked a white-owned farm near Hartley, killing its inhabitants. The government responded by returning the members of the ZANU executive, including Mugabe, to Salisbury Prison in 1966. There, forty prisoners were divided among four communal cells, with many sleeping on <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> due to overcrowding; Mugabe shared his cell with Sithole, Enos Nkala, and Edgar Tekere. He remained there for eight years, devoting his time to reading and studying. During this period he gained several further degrees from the University of London: a masters in economics, a bachelor of administration, and two law degrees.|$|E

30|$|The low {{external}} natural {{dose rate}} is {{partly due to}} high attenuation of cosmic and terrestrial radiation by <b>the</b> 30 -cm <b>concrete</b> <b>floors</b> of <b>the</b> hospital. Owing to self-absorption, the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>floors</b> (which also contain some activity) does not seriously affect the gamma exposure rate [9, 10]. As all internal partition walls are made of gypsum panels, little extra contribution to the dose rate from these is expected [9]. Moreover, some of the gypsum walls are clad with 2  mm of lead, also providing some additional shielding against background gamma radiation.|$|R

40|$|Recently, many {{residents}} living in apartment buildings in Korea have been bothered by noise {{coming from the}} houses above. In order to reduce noise pollution, communities are increasingly imposing bylaws, including the limitation of floor impact sound, minimum thickness of floors, and floor soundproofing solutions.

A number of heavy steel grille covers mark the drainage system. To the west, two ramps going in opposite directions take pedestrians to Honour Avenue. To the east there is one ramp. All are made with reinforced concrete retaining walls and slabs. Where the subway walls join the ramp walls the corners are rounded. There are uncovered drains made in each side of the concrete ramp slabs. Lining the tops of the ramp walls are some painted metal railings, the same as those around the stairway opening on the platform serving tracks 3 and 4.|$|E
25|$|The major {{refurbishment}} presented {{an opportunity to}} add to the infrastructure of the venue to make the process of ‘get-in’ and ‘get-out’ in a single day easier, and {{to add to the}} flexibility of the venue. Theatre consultants Carr & Angier worked with ISG Interior Exterior and Stage Technologies to create a new working space over the stage area with four large movable lighting bridges, capable of load sharing to lift large touring productions without the need for custom rigging. Delstar Engineering supplied eleven lifts to form the stage platform. These allow the stage layout to be reconfigured in many ways to suit the nature of the performance taking place. The choir benches can now be wheeled out to provide a level floor for staged and dance performances. The space between seat rows has been extended by 75mm by rebuilding <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> of the stalls, with a loss of only 118 seats. Cooling has been introduced by reversing the airflow in the auditorium.|$|E

The charges against him, which {{included}} criminal damage and threatening members of the public, were reduced to a single count of causing affray, to which he pleaded guilty. He was fined £500 and ordered to psychiatric care with a suspended sentence. In June 2003, he was arrested again by police after a conflict with a neighbour resulted in him attempting to smash in the neighbour's patio door with a shovel, and then lying down on <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> of a café basement with his trousers pulled down, curling up, and trying to sleep. Once again {{he was charged with}} affray and criminal damage and spent time in psychiatric wards.

He was eventually granted a conditional discharge by the judge at Highbury Magistrates Court.|$|E
25|$|A {{native of}} Everett, Massachusetts, English was the {{daughter}} of Ambrose Tobias English, a pipe-fitter and longtime Everett city official, and Anna (née Henneberry) English. Her older brother, Edward, was a high school star third baseman who saw his professional baseball dreams truncated by military service during wartime. She attended parochial grammar schools and graduated from Everett High School, and was a competent athlete in any sport she could find to play. Although there were no organized girls interscholastic sports, English began participating in pickup softball games at age ten on Boston area playgrounds. In 1939 she joined a Massachusetts 14-year-old softball team, which competed against opponents from Connecticut and New York in summer exhibitions. Like her brother, she played at third base and had a strong throwing arm. English and her Bay State teammates were coached by some players of the Boston Bruins hockey team, and they played their home games on <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>floor</b> of the Boston Garden when the Bruins and the Boston Celtics basketball team were out of the town.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after losing}} the Atómicos Championship Charly Manson left Los Vatos Locos to create his own stable called the Black Family. The Black Family {{initially}} featured Chessman, Escoria and Cuervo and was soon joined by Ozz, all of whom shared Manson's Goth-inspired look. On March 30, 2001 Manson suffered a career threatening injury that almost took his life. during a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match Manson was pushed off a ladder to the floor. The plan {{was that he would}} have his fall broken by a stack of tables but unfortunately the tables were not close enough and Manson dropped directly onto <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>floor.</b> The impact broke his femur and gave him a hard blow to the head. The Femur had to be strengthened by a surgical steel plate. In late 2001 Charly Manson returned to the promotion, while still not fully recovered, and began a war of words with the Black Family as Chessman had taken over his leadership role in Manson's absence. Manson displayed a much more cautious ring style upon his return.|$|E
