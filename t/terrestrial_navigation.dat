The emergence of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>navigation</b> is seen in the context of changes taking place in both trade policies and vessel types directly prior to this epoch. Whereas ships had previously remained {{in the vicinity of the}} coast for purposes of protection, now every effort was made to keep a safe distance from the coast. This principle was reflected in new navigational methods completely lacking any theoretical basis, particularly in a specific type of icourse-pointö navigation (Wegpunktnavigation). The new methods depended entirely upon the aid of the sounding Iead, the compass and sailing directions passed along in both oral and written form.

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{plans to}} replace current <b>terrestrial</b> <b>{{navigation}}</b> systems with a satellite-based system called the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The two main systems planned for navigation are the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) and the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS). Both systems {{rely on the}} Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite constellation, augmented {{by a combination of}} additional geostationary satellites and ground reference signals. These augmentations are required to meet aviation requirements for service availability, integrity, continuity, and accuracy. Together, WAAS and LAAS will provide seamless navigation coverage throughout the National Airspace System (NAS). WAAS will provide en route and terminal guidance throughout the NAS and Category I landing guidance at most airports. LAAS will be used exclusively to provide Category II and III landing guidance at all airports, and Category I where it is not provided by WAAS. This paper presents the approach and methodology used in developing a combined cost benefit analysis of both systems. Previous analyses addressed separate and independent implementations of each system. The combined analysis is designed to capture all costs and benefits attributable to both systems, ensuring a comprehensive and fair assessment. The analysis attributes costs and benefits to air carriers and other aircraft operators, passengers of air carriers, airport operators, and the FAA. Cost avoidance is included through the decommissioning of the current <b>terrestrial</b> <b>navigation</b> infrastructure.

40|$|Abstract — When GPS, {{or other}} {{absolute}} positioning, is unavailable, terrain-relative velocity {{is crucial for}} dead reckoning and the vehicle’s pose estimate. Unfortunately, the positiondenied accuracy of the inertial navigation system (INS) is governed by {{the performance of the}} linear velocity aiding sources, such as wheel odometry, which are typically corrupted by large systematic errors due to wheel slip. As a result, affordable <b>terrestrial</b> inertial <b>navigation</b> is ineffective in estimating position when denied position fixes {{for an extended period of}} time. For mobile robots, the mapping between inputs and resultant behavior depends critically on terrain conditions which vary significantly over time and space which cannot be pre-programmed. Past work has used Integrated Perturbative Dynamics (IPD) to identify successively systematic and stochastic models of wheel slip, but treated the pose filter only as input without improving the odometry measurements used for vehicle navigation. We present a unique approach of a predictive vehicle slip model in a delayed state extended Kalman filter. The relative pose difference between the current state and delayed state is used as a measurement update to the vehicle slip model. These results create an opportunity to compensate for wheel slip effects in <b>terrestrial</b> inertial <b>navigation.</b> This paper presents the design, calibration, and verification of such a system and concludes that the position-denied performance of the compensated system is far superior.

40|$|International audienceMany GNSS (Global Navigation Satellites System) {{applications}} need {{high integrity}} performances.

Hence, as the so-called Direct Position Estimation (DPE), we exploit the joint behaviour of all channels to detect any incoherence at an upstream step of the processing.

Depending solely on a system that can be disrupted is not acceptable for safety of life applications, such as aviation.

40|$|The {{presence}} of a wind turbine (WT) {{has the potential to}} distort electromagnetic fields emitted by <b>terrestrial</b> radio <b>navigation</b> aids. In this paper especially the field distortion of a Doppler Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Radio Range (DVOR) surveillance navigation system is investigated as a function of wind direction and rotor position. Therefor, the field distribution of a DVOR is simulated in the surrounding of a WT for 104 combinations of the angles of wind direction and rotor position. Furthermore, these calculations are executed for two different rotor diameters and 10 steps of distance between DVOR and WT in the range of 10  km. Based on the calculated data a method to estimate the maximum field distortion is developed. It is shown that the presented method allows to approximate the worst case field distortion with the results of two general simulation setups. Eliminating the need of simulating all possible geometric constellations of the WT this method hereby offers the benefit of significantly reduced simulation effort...|$|R

40|$|A robust {{electronic}} position, {{navigation and}} timing system (PNT) is {{considered as one}} of the core elements for the realization of IMO-s (International Maritime Organization) e-Navigation strategy. Robustness can be interpreted as the capability of an integrated PNT system to provide PNT relevant data with the desired accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability under consideration of changing application conditions and requirements. Generally an integrated PNT system is a composite of service components – like GNSS, Augmentation Systems and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>Navigation</b> Systems – and an on-board integrated PNT Unit, which uses the available navigation and augmentation signals in combination with additional data of sensors aboard to provide accurate and robust PNT information of the ship.

Rescue operations inside of large-scale office buildings, shopping malls and public buildings are a major challenge in terms of positioning and guidance. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and <b>terrestrial</b> radio <b>navigation</b> systems such as global positioning system (GPS), wireless local area network (WLAN), ultra-wideband (UWB) and radio frequency identification (RFID) are either not fully operative inside of buildings or require a costly system infrastructure.

A novel combination of improved movement recognition or human motion analysis and magnetic field mapping for absolute re-positioning is proposed. This combination allows for a low error of position and the minimization of the IMU-typically drift, respectively.
