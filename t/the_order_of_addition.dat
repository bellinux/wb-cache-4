It was found that <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>addition</b> of the metal precursors greatly affects the performance and properties of these systems, which in turn is closely related to the first impregnated metal. When platinum is impregnated before rhenium and germanium the metals are reduced separately resulting in catalysts with high dehydrogenation activity and low hydrogenolysis activity. On the other hand, the impregnation of germanium before the other metals leads to the production of catalysts with low activities for dehydrogenation and high activity for hydrogenolysis, {{as a consequence of the}} strong interactions among the metals. By adding rhenium before the other metals, catalysts with intermediate behavior are produced. For all catalysts, platinum interacts more strongly with rhenium than with germanium. <b>The</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>addition</b> does not modify the acidic properties of the support but germanium and rhenium seem to change the acidity of the support in the vicinity of the metals, causing differences in the selectivity to aromatic compounds and paraffinic isomers.

Here, using fluorescence measurements, we show that <b>the</b> physiological <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>addition</b> is <b>the</b> opposite, involving rapid binding of ATP, accompanied by nearly as rapid apical domain movements, followed by slower binding of nonnative polypeptide. In order-of-addition experiments, approximately twice as much Rubisco activity was recovered when nonnative substrate protein was added after ATP compared with it being added before ATP, associated with twice as much Rubisco protein recovered with the chaperonin. Furthermore, the rate of Rubisco binding to an ATP-exposed ring was twice that observed in the absence of nucleotide. Finally, when both ATP and Rubisco were added simultaneously to a GroEL ring, simulating the physiological situation, the rate of Rubisco binding corresponded to that observed when ATP had been added first.
