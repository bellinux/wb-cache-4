5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints.

5|$|Before 1914, Lenin's {{views were}} largely in {{accordance}} with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy.

He adapted his ideas according <b>to</b> <b>changing</b> circumstances, including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse.

5|$|By July 2011, Rohrer had {{submitted}} a beta {{version of the}} game for Nintendo approval. This was followed up with the master version in October. An issue raised during the approval process was Rohrer's desire to credit Bailey on the game's cover, which Nintendo rejected.

However, due <b>to</b> <b>changing</b> market conditions, Zoo Publishing was {{no longer able to}} afford the manufacturing of cartridges given the large minimum order of 6,000 units that Nintendo required, and so, Rohrer turned to the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.|$|E

5|$|Many long-distance {{migrants}} {{appear to}} be genetically programmed to respond <b>to</b> <b>changing</b> day length. Species that move short distances, however, may not need such a timing mechanism, instead moving in response to local weather conditions. Thus mountain and moorland breeders, such as wallcreeper Tichodroma muraria and white-throated dipper Cinclus cinclus, may move only altitudinally to escape the cold higher ground. Other species such as merlin Falco columbarius and Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis move further, to the coast or towards the south. Species like the chaffinch are much less migratory in Britain than those of continental Europe, mostly not moving more than 5km in their lives.|$|E

5|$|The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, most {{commonly}} known as Rawlings' Regiment in period documents, was organized in June 1776 as a specialized light infantry unit of riflemen in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The American rifle units complemented the predominant, musket-equipped, line infantry forces of the war with their long-range marksmanship capability and were typically deployed with the line infantry as forward skirmishers and flanking elements. Scouting, escort, and outpost duties were also routine. The rifle units' battle formation {{was not nearly as}} structured as that of the line infantry units, which employed short-range massed firing in ordered linear formations.
