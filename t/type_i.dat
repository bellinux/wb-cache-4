5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are <b>Type</b> <b>I,</b> Type II, Type III and Type IV. <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> is based upon a heavy truck chassis and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. Type II is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The Type III is a van chassis but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under Federal Regulations.|$|E

5|$|Von Willebrand's {{disease is}} a {{hereditary}} bleeding disorder found in both dogs and humans. It {{is caused by a}} lack of von Willebrand factor which plays a role in the clotting process of blood. This can cause abnormal platelet function and prolonged bleeding times. Affected dogs can be prone to nose bleeds, and increased bleeding following trauma or surgery. There are three types of this condition with <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> being the most common, while Type II and III being rarer, but more severe. <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> von Willebrand's disease is relatively common in the Scottish Terrier.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis is {{a disease}} of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore, receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue tropism is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferon receptor, poliovirus not only replicates in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to be infected orally with the virus.|$|E

Both fluids are under scrutiny for their environmental impacts, and it is uncertain if Type II fluid diminishes the runway coefficient of friction since the fluid rolls off the airplane during the takeoff roll. Also, the use of either type fluid may result in a temporary degradation in the airplane's aerodynamic performance, a reduced stall margin, and an increase in drag.|$|E

40|$|Indirect {{immunofluorescence}} {{has been}} used to study the distribution of fibronectin and collagen <b>types</b> <b>I,</b> II, and III in the developing primary and secondary palatal processes and forelimb buds of the Swiss Webster (NIH) mouse. In the palatal processes fibronectin and <b>types</b> <b>I</b> and III collagen are distributed throughout the mesenchyme. Fibronectin is present in the basement membrane, while <b>types</b> <b>I</b> and III collagen are localized in a linear, discontinuous fashion beneath the basement membrane. Fibronectin is not observed in the epithelium, including the presumptive fusion areas. In the forelimb bud these components show a similar distribution prior to chondrogenesis (early day 11). When chondrogenesis commences (late day 11 or early day 12) fibronectin and, to a lesser degree, <b>types</b> <b>I</b> and III collagen are apparently concentrated in the core mesenchyme, suggesting that fibronectin has a role in initiating chondrogenesis, perhaps by increasing cellular aggregation. Type II collagen is observed only in chondrogenic regions. The codistribution of fibronectin and <b>types</b> <b>I</b> and III collagen supports in vitro studies which indicate that cells use fibronectin to bind to collagen in the matrix. The developing chondrogenic regions appear to lose fibronectin gradually, concomitant with the appearance of type II collagen, suggesting that fibronectin is not involved in the maintenance of functional chondrocytes in their matrices.
