5|$|Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action {{game with}} {{strategy}} and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad {{of up to}} four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must use secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for <b>these</b> <b>weapons</b> is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting <b>these</b> <b>weapons</b> can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates – destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion – at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at {{a greater risk of}} depleting ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The British Army's basic {{infantry}} {{weapon is}} the L85A2 assault rifle, sometimes {{equipped with an}} L17A2 under-barrel grenade launcher or other attachments with the Picatinny rail. The rifle has several variants, including the L86A2, the Light Support Weapon (LSW) and the L22A2 carbine (issued to tank crews). <b>These</b> <b>weapons</b> are usually equipped with iron sights or an optical SUSAT, although optical sights have been purchased to supplement these.|$|E
5|$|A 1754 {{enactment}} introduced up to {{one year}} imprisponment for carrying of daggers and pocket pistols ("tercerols") as well as tough sentencing for cases of attacking or resisting law enforcement with use of <b>these</b> <b>weapons.</b> Mere brandishing of a weapon against a state official was to be punished by life imprisonment. Wounding a state official would be punished by decapitation, killing of state official by cutting of hand followed by decapitation. Another 1754 enactment limited possibility of shooting within limits of certain cities to licensed shooting ranges, showing early development of sport shooting in the country.|$|E
50|$|Of <b>these</b> <b>weapon</b> systems, {{the latest}} variant is the Kung Feng VI, which {{commenced}} development in 1975, and was formally {{revealed to the}} public during the National Day Parade in 1981.|$|R
25|$|Most army commanders had {{previously}} envisioned using <b>these</b> <b>weapon</b> systems {{to dominate the}} battlefield on an operational and tactical level but, as events played out, these technological advancements forever altered the capacity in which mankind would wage war.|$|R
5000|$|Target tracking: Various {{military}} {{weapons systems}} use GPS to track potential ground and air targets before flagging them as hostile. <b>These</b> <b>weapon</b> systems pass target coordinates to precision-guided munitions {{to allow them}} to engage targets accurately. Military aircraft, particularly in air-to-ground roles, use GPS to find targets.|$|R
5|$|A {{few minutes}} later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped {{instruments}} attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell {{the public about the}} danger involved with <b>these</b> <b>weapons</b> of mass destruction. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later. In 1949, {{one of the authors of}} the letter, Luis Alvarez, met with Sagane and signed the document.|$|E
5|$|According {{to various}} reports, Hezbollah is armed with {{anti-tank}} guided missiles, namely, the Russian-made AT-3 Sagger, AT-4 Spigot, AT-5 Spandrel, AT-13 Saxhorn-2 'Metis-M', АТ-14 Spriggan 'Kornet'; Iranian-made Ra'ad (version of AT-3 Sagger), Towsan (version of AT-5 Spandrel), Toophan (version of BGM-71 TOW); and European-made MILAN missiles. <b>These</b> <b>weapons</b> {{have been used}} against IDF soldiers, causing many of the deaths during the 2006 Lebanon War. A small number of Saeghe-2s (Iranian-made version of M47 Dragon) were also used in the war.|$|E
5|$|Dao: Daos are single-edged Chinese swords, {{primarily}} {{used for}} slashing and chopping. The {{most common form}} {{is also known as}} the Chinese sabre, although those with wider blades are sometimes referred to as Chinese broadswords. In China, the dao {{is considered one of the}} four traditional weapons, along with the gun (stick or staff), qiang (spear), and the jian (sword). The earliest dao date from the Shang Dynasty in China's Bronze Age, and are known as zhibeidao (直背刀)– straight backed knives. As the name implies, these were straight-bladed or slightly curved weapons with a single edge. Originally bronze, <b>these</b> <b>weapons</b> were made of iron or steel by the time of the late Warring States period as metallurgical knowledge became sufficiently advanced to control the carbon content. Originally less common as a military weapon than the jian– the straight, double-edged blade of China– the dao became popular with cavalry during the Han dynasty due to its sturdiness, superiority as a chopping weapon, and relative ease of use– it was generally said that it takes a week to attain competence with a dao/saber, a month to attain competence with a qiang/spear, and a year to attain competence with a jian/straight sword. Soon after dao began to be issued to infantry, beginning the replacement of the jian as a standard-issue weapon. Late Han dynasty dao had round grips and ring-shaped pommels, and ranged between 85 and 114 centimeters in length. <b>These</b> <b>weapons</b> were used alongside rectangular shields.|$|E

25|$|The Mistel project, a {{composite}} aircraft configuration, was advocated by Peltz at the time. The configuration was a fighter aircraft mounted {{on top of}} a pilot-less bomber aircraft with its crew compartment replaced with a high-explosive warhead. The plan was to use <b>these</b> <b>weapon</b> systems against hardened targets such as bridges and enemy shipping.|$|R
25|$|Iranian media also {{asserted}} that Bandar {{was the source}} of <b>these</b> alleged <b>weapons</b> transfers.|$|R
5|$|Hurst was {{equipped}} with new heavy, RML guns in heavily protected casemated positions. <b>These</b> <b>weapons</b> were slow to reload, so {{to ensure that the}} castle would {{have a good chance of}} hitting enemy ships passing at speed, two long batteries of weapons were built onto either side of the old castle, a west wing with 37 gun positions and an east wing with 24 positions. These were built on top of the two gun batteries constructed there a few years before and also required the castle's moat to be filled in. As work progressed, the decision was taken to reinforce the batteries with additional iron shields.|$|E
5|$|Many of the henchmen {{employed}} by the villains may have unique weapons; Oddjob, Auric Goldfinger's enforcer, carries a bowler hat with a razor-sharp blade concealed in the rim, while Xenia Onatopp is known to crush victims to death with her thighs during intercourse. In addition to <b>these</b> <b>weapons,</b> many of the henchmen are physically different; the over-large Tee Hee had an iron claw, Jaws, an assassin with steel teeth, was played by 2.18m (7'2") actor Richard Kiel, whilst Renard (the henchman to the main villainess Elektra) survived being shot in the head, which progressively killed off his senses {{and his ability to}} feel pain.|$|E
5|$|The Pipil used wooden weapons {{with stone}} blades. Their weapons {{included}} long spears, atlatls (spear-throwers), arrows, and the macana (a wooden sword with inset obsidian blades {{similar to the}} Aztec macahuitl). <b>These</b> <b>weapons</b> proved inferior to elements of Spanish warfare such as steel, the horse and firearms. The Spanish described how the natives of El Salvador wore thick cotton armour, described as three fingers thick, that extended down {{to their feet and}} significantly encumbered them.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{established}} as a Strategic Air Command installation, Thule would periodically serve as a dispersal base for B-36 Peacemaker and B-47 Stratojet aircraft during the 1950s, {{as well as providing}} an ideal site to test the operability and maintainability of <b>these</b> <b>weapon</b> systems in extreme cold weather. Similar operations were also conducted with B-52 Stratofortress aircraft in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Other {{suggestions}} have however {{been made}} regarding {{the nature of}} <b>these</b> <b>weapon</b> depositions. In 1857, the Danish archaeologist Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae suggested that they represented the detritus of nearby battles which had simply fallen into the wetlands. This was contested by fellow archaeologist Christian Engelhardt, who demonstrated that the weapons had been deliberately sorted and organised into categories before being deposited.|$|R
5000|$|The Õhutõrjepataljon is {{currently}} {{armed with the}} 23mm ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft twin autocannons and 90mm Mistral missiles. Since the battalion has no other conventional air defence weapons it {{is currently}} capable of providing a limited short-range air defence for the remaining ground units. Both of <b>these</b> <b>weapon</b> systems are integrated with the Giraffe AMB radar and fire-control systems. The current weapon inventory includes roughly: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{ships were}} also armed with six 45cm torpedo tubes, all in above-water swivel mounts. Four tubes were {{mounted on the}} sides of the ship, another in the bow, and the last in the stern. <b>These</b> <b>weapons</b> were 5.1m (16ft9in) long and carried an 87.5kg (193lb) TNT warhead. They could be set at two speeds for {{different}} ranges. At , the torpedoes had a range of 800m (870yd). At an increased speed of , the range was reduced to 500m (550yb).|$|E
5|$|The two 37mm (1.46in) Bordkanone BK 3,7 cannons were {{mounted in}} {{under-wing}} gun pods, each loaded with two six-round magazines of armour-piercing tungsten carbide-cored ammunition. With <b>these</b> <b>weapons,</b> the Kanonenvogel ("cannon-bird"), {{as it was}} nicknamed, proved very successful {{in the hands of}} Stuka aces such as Rudel. The G-1 was converted from older D-series airframes, retaining the smaller wing, but without the dive brakes. The G-2 was similar to the G-1 except for use of the extended wing of the D-5. 208 G-2s were built and at least a further 22 more were converted from D-3 airframes.|$|E
5|$|The two Scharnhorst-class battleships {{were the}} first capital ships built for the Kriegsmarine {{after the end of}} World War I. They marked the {{beginning}} of German naval rearmament after the Treaty of Versailles. The class comprised two vessels: Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. The ships were armed with nine 28cm (11in) SK C/34 guns in three triple turrets, though there were plans to replace <b>these</b> <b>weapons</b> with six 38cm (15in) SK C/34 guns in twin turrets.|$|E

5000|$|Rentaka: Rentaka (or lantaka) {{is a term}} in Malay {{language}} for cannons smaller in calibre than lela, with long barrel and made from iron. This term is for differing these type of cannon from lela, which is bigger. <b>These</b> <b>weapon</b> mainly used in 16, 17, and 18th century. Filipinos still using rentakas in Philippine-American war. Rentaka is a swivel gun with smoothbore barrel, and is loaded from the front (muzzle loaded).|$|R
5|$|A {{cover system}} {{can be used in}} combat as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of <b>these</b> <b>weapons,</b> players have the ability to dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a laser cannon can be transformed into a wire cutting tool.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} brigade {{continued}} to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out {{an attack on}} Osnabruck, which No. 3 Commando led, on 4 April 1945. The next day, they crossed the Weser River in assault boats and {{under the cover of}} darkness carried out a flanking manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese. As other elements from the brigade attacked from the east, No. 3 Commando, now under the command of Peter Bartholomew after Komrower had been posted to the Commando Training Depot, carried out a follow-up operation to the north. The operation was an attack on a factory that had been producing V-2 rockets and after No. 3 Commando had captured it with the support of a number of tanks, a search found a number of <b>these</b> <b>weapons,</b> along with about 100 scientists who had been working in the factory.|$|E
5|$|As Germany's {{military}} and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took {{the lives of thousands}} of people. Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to <b>these</b> <b>weapons</b> would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{returned}} to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, {{and there is}} no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, {{it is unlikely that the}} Australian Government would have agreed to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial conditions. As the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for <b>these</b> <b>weapons</b> shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace Australias main armament once the Navy's stock of shells reached their expiry date given that it was not possible to produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's lack of interest in retaining the ship.|$|E
5|$|Both {{enemies and}} their bullets can be shot down. Defeating enemies will {{sometimes}} reveal item boxes, which can hold precious metals such as {{gold and silver}} for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs can be held at a time, {{which can be used}} to clear the screen of enemies. Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain enemies. <b>These</b> <b>weapons,</b> such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's firing speed or damage output. When a player's bullets hit an enemy, a gauge {{at the bottom of the}} screen will gradually fill. Once filled, the player will be awarded with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful weapon in the game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty.|$|E
5|$|Certain weapons can be dual-wielded, {{allowing}} the player to trade accuracy, {{the use of}} grenades and melee attacks for raw firepower. The player can carry two weapons at a time (or three if dual-wielding; one weapon remains holstered), with each weapon having advantages and disadvantages in different combat situations. For example, most Covenant weapons eschew disposable ammo clips for a contained battery, which cannot be replaced if depleted. However, <b>these</b> <b>weapons</b> can overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. Human weapons are less effective at penetrating shields and require reloading, but cannot overheat due to prolonged fire. The player can carry a total of eight grenades (four human grenades, four Covenant) to dislodge and disrupt enemies. New in Halo 2 {{is the ability to}} board enemy vehicles that are near the player and traveling at low speeds. The player or AI latches onto the vehicle and forcibly ejects the other driver from the vehicle.|$|E
