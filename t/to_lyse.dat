2500|$|Native gels are run in non-denaturing conditions, so {{that the}} analyte's natural {{structure}} is maintained. [...] This allows the physical size of the folded or assembled complex to affect the mobility, allowing for analysis of all four levels of the biomolecular structure. [...] For biological samples, detergents are used {{only to the extent}} that they are necessary <b>to</b> <b>lyse</b> lipid membranes in the cell. Complexes remain—for the most part—associated and folded as they would be in the cell. One downside, however, is that complexes may not separate cleanly or predictably, as it is difficult to predict how the molecule's shape and size will affect its mobility. Addressing and solving this problem is a major aim of quantitative native PAGE.|$|E
2500|$|Zamilon {{does not}} appear to inhibit the ability of its helper virus to {{replicate}} significantly, nor <b>to</b> <b>lyse</b> its host amoebae cells. Although the helper virus formed a high proportion of abnormal virions in the presence of Zamilon, these were also observed at a comparable level in the virophage's absence. This is again unlike Sputnik, which reduces its helper virus's infectivity, inhibits its lysis of amoeba, and is associated with the generation of an increased proportion of abnormal Mimiviridae virions. Bernard La Scola and colleagues, who isolated both Sputnik and Zamilon, state that, if confirmed, this [...] "would question the concept of virophage", which has been considered to be differentiated from most other satellite viruses in having a deleterious effect on its helper virus.|$|E

40|$|Uncertainty remains {{about the}} {{cellular}} {{origins of the}} earliest phase of the proinflammatory cytokine response to malaria. Here we show by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis that γδ T cells and CD 14 + cells from nonimmune donors produce tumor necrosis factor and that γδ T cells also produce gamma interferon within 18 h of contact with mycoplasma-free Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in vitro. This early cytokine response is more effectively induced by intact than by lysed parasitized erythrocytes. However, the IFN-γ response <b>to</b> <b>lysed</b> parasites is considerably enhanced several days after {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} are primed with low numbers of intact parasitized erythrocytes, and in this case it derives from both αβ and γδ T cells. These data show that naïve γδ T cells can respond very rapidly to malaria infection but that malaria fever may involve a multistage process in which the priming of both γδ and αβ T-cell populations boosts the cytokine response <b>to</b> <b>lysed</b> parasite products released at schizont rupture...|$|R
2500|$|Soil {{moisture}} {{is another}} important factor influencing soil respiration. Soil respiration is low in dry conditions and increases to a maximum [...] at intermediate moisture levels until it begins to decrease when moisture content excludes oxygen. This allows anaerobic conditions to prevail and depress aerobic microbial activity. Studies have shown that soil moisture only limits respiration at the lowest and highest conditions with a large plateau existing at intermediate soil moisture levels for most ecosystems. Many microorganisms possess strategies for growth and survival under low soil moisture conditions. Under high soil moisture conditions, many bacteria take in too much water causing their cell membrane <b>to</b> <b>lyse,</b> or break. This can decrease the rate of soil respiration temporarily, but the lysis of bacteria causes for a spike in resources for many other bacteria. This rapid increase in available labile substrates causes short-term enhanced soil respiration. Root respiration will increase with increasing soil moisture, especially in dry ecosystems; however, individual species root respiration response to soil moisture will vary widely from species to species depending on life history traits. Upper levels of soil moisture will depress root respiration {{with the exception of}} wetland plants, which have developed specific mechanisms for root aeration. Soil moisture levels regulate root respiration, which is essential for nitrogen uptake.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIntracranial hemorrhage, whether due to {{traumatic}} brain injury or ruptured cerebral aneurysm, is characterized by major neurological damage and a high mortality rate. Apart from cerebral vasospasm and mass effect, brain injury results from the release of unclotted blood that contacts neurons causing calcic stress. The combination of memantine with vitamin D, a neurosteroid hormone, may prevent blood neurotoxicity. Our purpose {{was to examine the}} potential protective effects of memantine + vitamin D against lysed or clotted blood in cortical neuronal cultures. We provide the first evidence that cortical axons in contact with lysed blood degenerate less after exposure <b>to</b> <b>lysed</b> blood in microfluidic neuronal cultures enriched with both memantine and vitamin D compared to control medium and cultures enriched with only memantine or only vitamin D. The reported synergistic neuroprotective effect of memantine + vitamin D, the combination originating an effect stronger than the sum, strongly encourages using both drugs following intracranial hemorrhage...|$|R
