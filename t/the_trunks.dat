5|$|Ecologically, {{woodpeckers}} {{help to keep}} trees healthy {{by keeping}} them from suffering mass infestations. The family is noted {{for its ability to}} acquire wood-boring grubs from <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> and branches, whether the timber is alive or dead. Having hammered a hole into the wood, the prey is extracted by use of a long, barbed tongue. Woodpeckers consume beetles that burrow into trees, removing as many as 85 percent of emerald ash borer larvae from individual ash trees.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a nervous}} center {{is between the}} mouth and anus, and a nerve ring {{at the base of}} the lophophore. The ring {{supplies}} nerves to the tentacles and, just under the skin, to the body-wall muscles. Phoronis ovalis has two nerve trunks under the skin, whereas other species have one. <b>The</b> <b>trunk(s)</b> have giant axons (nerves that transmit signals very fast) which co-ordinate the retraction of the body when danger threatens.|$|E

Though <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> shot {{can be produced}} by placing the camera inside <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> <b>the</b> considerable bulk of a conventional movie camera and camera operator makes this difficult. Therefore, the shot is usually [...] "cheated" [...] by having the art department place a trunk door and some of <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> frame {{close enough to the}} camera to make it appear to be shot from within a car. <b>The</b> <b>trunk</b> shot is a specialized type of low-angle shot.|$|R

5|$|In 1901, Jacint Verdaguer {{reported}} that a woodcutter had recently tried to cut down one of <b>the</b> <b>trunks,</b> causing it to lean out; damage from which the tree was unlikely to recover. It was also {{reported that}} around 1895, cuts {{had been made to}} tap the tree for resin, and a fire lit at its base to speed the process. This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union to erect a high stone wall around the tree in 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested that the building work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree. By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{this family}} are chiefly known for their {{characteristic}} behaviour; they mostly forage for insect prey on <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> and branches of trees, and often communicate by drumming with their beak, producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance. Some species vary their diet with fruits, bird's eggs and small animals, and some suck sap. They mostly nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree trunks, and their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity-nesting birds. They sometimes come into conflict with man when they make holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops, but perform a useful service by their removal of insect pests on trees.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} trunk {{performance in}} non-acute and chronic stroke patients {{by means of}} <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Control Test and Trunk Impairment Scale and to compare <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Control Test with <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Impairment Scale and its subscales in relation to balance, gait and functional ability after stroke. Subjects: Fifty-one stroke patients, attending a rehabilitation programme, participated in the study. Main measures: Subjects were evaluated with <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Control Test, Trunk Impairment Scale, Tinetti balance and gait subscales, Functional Ambulation Category, 10 -m walk test, Timed Up and Go Test and motor part of the Functional Independence Measure. Results: Participants obtained a median score of 61 out of 100 on <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Control Test and 11 out of 23 for <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Impairment Scale. Twelve participants (24 %) obtained the maximum score on <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Control Test; no subject reached the maximum score on <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Impairment Scale. Measures of trunk performance were significantly related with values of balance, gait and functional ability. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed an additional, significant contribution of the dynamic sitting balance subscale of <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Impairment Scale in addition to <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Control Test total score for measures of gait and functional ability (model R 2 = 0. 55 - 0. 62). Conclusions: This study clearly indicates that trunk performance is still impaired in non-acute and chronic stroke patients. When planning future follow-up studies, use of <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Impairment Scale has the advantage {{that it has no}} ceiling effect...|$|R
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{has been}} {{recorded}} growing on the fallen wood of oaks of the subgenus Cyclobalanopsis, {{as well as the}} wood of other flowering plants. The species favours <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> of trees, where it feeds as a saprotroph, causing white rot. P.ellipsoideus fruit bodies are perennial growers, allowing them to, in the correct circumstances, grow very large. The species is found in the tropical and subtropical areas of China; it {{has been recorded}} in Fujian Province and Hainan Province. It is not a common species, and fruit bodies are only occasionally encountered.|$|E
5|$|The island's {{proximity}} {{to the river and}} the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise artisan fishing, just to supply their own daily needs. Pirogues cut from <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> of kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.|$|E
5|$|Ascocoryne sarcoides is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The species name {{is derived from the}} Greek sarkodes (fleshy). Formerly known as Coryne sarcoides, its taxonomical history has been {{complicated}} by the fact that it may adopt both sexual and asexual forms. Colloquially known as jelly drops or the purple jellydisc, this common fungus appears as a gelatinous mass of pinkish or purple-colored discs. Distributed widely in North America, Europe and Asia, A.sarcoides is a saprobic fungus and grows in clusters on <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> and branches of a variety of dead woods. Field studies suggest that colonization by A.sarcoides of the heartwood of black spruce confers some resistance to further infection by rot-causing fungi. A.sarcoides contains the antibiotic compound ascocorynin, shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E

5|$|In November 1956, while {{staying in}} Paris, he was {{reminded}} of trunks he had stored in the Ritz Hotel in 1928 and never retrieved. Upon re-claiming and opening <b>the</b> <b>trunks,</b> Hemingway discovered they were filled with notebooks and writing from his Paris years. Excited about the discovery, {{when he returned to}} Cuba in early 1957, he began to shape the recovered work into his memoir A Moveable Feast. By 1959 he ended a period of intense activity: he finished A Moveable Feast (scheduled to be released the following year); brought True at First Light to 200,000 words; added chapters to The Garden of Eden; and worked on Islands in the Stream. The last three were stored in a safe deposit box in Havana, as he focused on the finishing touches for A Moveable Feast. Author Michael Reynolds claims it was during this period that Hemingway slid into depression, from which he was unable to recover.|$|E
5|$|Often farmers {{would leave}} a solitary cabbage tree—or even groves of trees—standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because {{livestock}} eat the seedlings and damage <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> and roots of adult trees. When a cabbage tree {{is the only}} shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees. Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in {{the centre of the}} stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or fungal infections that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die. Other factors thought to contribute to Rural Decline include wood-rotting fungi like Phanerochaete cordylines, micro-organisms which cause saprobic decay and leaf-feeding caterpillars.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} possible transport of cyanogenic glycosides from leaves of rubber tree crown clones (Hevea spp.) resistant to South American leaf blight to <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of <b>the</b> panel clones in which they are grafted. The cyanogenic potential (HCNp) of the crown clones was determined in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> bark, at different distances from the cambium, and its gradient was evaluated along <b>the</b> <b>trunk.</b> <b>The</b> correlation between the HCNp of the crown leaves and that of <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> bark was also evaluated. HCNp determined in leaves showed a wide range variation in the species studied as crown clones, with the lowest values registered in H. nitida clones, and the highest ones in H. rigidifolia. In <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> bark, <b>the</b> tissue layer nearer the cambium showed higher HCNp values. A positive basipetal gradient was observed along <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> i. e., there was an increase in HCNp from the apex toward the base. Although the grafted crowns influence the cyanogenic potential of <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> bark of panel clones, the absence of correlation between the HCNp of <b>the</b> leaves and <b>trunk</b> bark indicates that the crown is not the main source of the cyanogenic glycosides found in <b>the</b> <b>trunk...</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E
5|$|M.regularis is {{a highly}} {{aggressive}} ant that will pursue any intruder to a distance of 1.8–2.7 metres (2–3 yards) if their nests are disturbed. Their stings are very painful and particularly powerful. In some cases, human victims of M.regularis bites have displayed an allergy to the venom. In a 2011 study which investigated the causes of ant sting anaphylaxis in Australia, 265 of the 376 human participants reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, nine serum samples taken from patients were IgE positive to the venom of M.regularis. These ants are both diurnal and nocturnal, foraging on <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> of Eucalyptus trees to feed on sap and nectar, or capturing small insects (such as caterpillars and ants in the genus Camponotus or subgenus Orthocrema). The larvae are carnivorous and exclusively feed on insects, either consuming small portions of the insect or all of it. Unlike most Myrmecia species, trophallaxis takes place among adults or between adults and larvae. All stages of the frog Metacrinia nichollsi are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies, where they use several galleries constructed by the ants. The parasitic ant M.inquilina may attempt to enter M.regularis nests to establish colonies, but M.inquilina queens may be seized and killed {{as soon as the}} two species come into contact.|$|E
