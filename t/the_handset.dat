5|$|The {{following}} day, George thinks Liz {{is breaking}} the rules by taking a personal call; he gets angry and wrestles <b>the</b> <b>handset</b> from her. Later, Andy is upset that he listened to Chloe in her final moments, and Liz, {{who has made a}} complaint about George's conduct, tells him that she took a call from an ex-soldier, in tears because his mother committed suicide following the death of her cat. Andy realises that the man's mother is the caller from the previous night. George advises that Andy will not face any repercussions, and asks Andy to help Michael, new to the centre, with his first call. Chloe calls in and speaks to Michael, again claiming that she has taken an overdose. Andy snatches the phone and shouts at Chloe, hanging up on her.|$|E
25|$|Early modems were {{generally}} very simple devices using acoustic couplers to handle telephone operation. The user would first {{pick up the}} phone, dial a number, then press <b>the</b> <b>handset</b> into rubber cups {{on the top of}} the modem. Disconnecting at the end of a call required the user to pick up <b>the</b> <b>handset</b> and return it to the phone. Examples of direct-connecting modems did exist, and these often allowed the host computer to send it commands to answer or hang up calls, but these were very expensive devices used by large banks and similar companies.|$|E

25|$|At the time, modems {{generally}} came in two versions, {{one for the}} end-user {{that required}} the user to dial the phone manually and use an acoustic coupler for connection, and another dedicated to answering incoming calls that was intended for use on the minicomputer or mainframe the user was calling into. The connection and disconnection was entirely manual, with the user picking up the phone's handset, dialing manually, and then pressing <b>the</b> <b>handset</b> into the coupler if a carrier frequency was heard. Disconnecting {{at the end of}} the session was also manual, with the user lifting <b>the</b> <b>handset</b> out of the coupler and hanging it up on the phone body in order to depress the hook switch and return the phone to the on-hook state and end the call.|$|E
25|$|A {{telephone}} exchange automatically senses an off-hook {{condition of the}} telephone when the user removes <b>the</b> <b>handset</b> from the switchhook or cradle. The exchange provides dial tone {{at that time to}} indicate to the user that the exchange is ready to receive dialed digits. The pulses or DTMF tones generated by the telephone are processed and a connection is established to the destination telephone within the same exchange or to another distant exchange.|$|E
25|$|The {{dialogue}} between <b>the</b> <b>handset</b> and the cell {{site is a}} stream of digital data that includes digitised audio (except for the first generation analog networks). The technology that achieves this depends on the system which the mobile phone operator has adopted. The technologies are grouped by generation. The first-generation systems started in 1979 with Japan, are all analog and include AMPS and NMT. Second-generation systems, started in 1991 in Finland, are all digital and include GSM, CDMA and TDMA.|$|E

25|$|In digital {{wireless}} communication systems (GSM, CDMA etc.), PLLs {{are used to}} provide the local oscillator up-conversion during transmission and down-conversion during reception. In most cellular handsets this function has been largely integrated into a single integrated circuit {{to reduce the cost}} and size of <b>the</b> <b>handset.</b> However, due to the high performance required of base station terminals, the transmission and reception circuits are built with discrete components to achieve the levels of performance required. GSM local oscillator modules are typically built with a frequency synthesizer integrated circuit and discrete resonator VCOs.|$|E
25|$|Telephone {{headsets}} {{connect to}} a fixed-line telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing <b>the</b> <b>handset</b> of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded telephones are {{fitted with a}} standard 4P4C commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless bluetooth headsets are available, and often used with mobile telephones. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by call centre workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.|$|E

25|$|Page led the {{acquisition}} of Android for $50 million in 2005 to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers {{in the possession of}} consumers so that they could access Google from anywhere. The purchase was made without Schmidt's knowledge, but the CEO was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition. Page became passionate about Android, and spent large amounts of time with Android CEO and cofounder Andy Rubin. By September 2008, T-Mobile launched the G1, the first phone using Android software and, by 2010, 17.2 percent of <b>the</b> <b>handset</b> market consisted of Android sales, overtaking Apple for the first time. Android became the world’s most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{overwhelming}} demand and a manufacturing {{problem with the}} blue variant of the phone, there was an extensive shortage of the SIII, especially in the United States. Nevertheless, the SIII was well-received commercially and critically, with some technology commentators touting it as the [...] "iPhone killer". In September 2012, TechRadar ranked it as the No. 1 handset in its constantly updated list of the 20 best mobile phones, while Stuff magazine likewise ranked it at No.1 in its list of 10 best smartphones in May 2012. <b>The</b> <b>handset</b> also won the [...] "European Mobile Phone of 2012–13" [...] award from the European Imaging and Sound Association, as well as T3 magazine's [...] "Phone of the Year" [...] award for 2012.|$|E
500|$|Speculation in {{the general}} public and media outlets {{regarding}} the handset's specifications began gathering momentum several months before its formal unveiling in May 2012. In February 2012, prior to the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain, there were rumors that <b>the</b> <b>handset</b> would incorporate a 1.5GHz quad-core processor, a display of 1080p (1080×1920 pixels) resolution, a 12-megapixel rear camera and a HD Super AMOLED Plus touchscreen. More accurate rumored specifications included 2GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, 4G LTE, a [...] screen, an 8-megapixel rear camera, and a [...] thick chassis. Samsung confirmed the existence of the Galaxy SII's successor on 5 March 2012, {{but it was not until}} late April 2012 that Samsung's Senior Vice-President Robert Yi confirmed the phone to be called [...] "Samsung Galaxy SIII".|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} a huge growth in the prepaid {{business}} in the last few years, and <b>the</b> prepaid <b>handset</b> business has become particularly competitive, with <b>the</b> <b>handsets</b> sold through every kind of outlet including supermarkets and online.

30|$|It is also {{interesting}} that less extraverted individuals used more multimedia and social apps in semester 6 but less in semester 2. The main {{difference between the}} two semesters is that the participants used different types of <b>handsets.</b> <b>The</b> newer <b>handsets</b> in semester 6 have much faster network connectivity while <b>the</b> old <b>handsets</b> may restrict <b>the</b> usage of the phones [22].|$|R
30|$|The {{results from}} [12 – 16] were {{essentially}} from time series analysis {{and focused on}} the network elements without providing the impact of the network issues on the subscribers or the influence of <b>the</b> <b>handsets</b> on <b>the</b> overall network performance.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2014, the {{low-cost}} BlackBerry Z3 {{was introduced}} onto the Indonesian market, where the brand had been particularly popular. The budget handset {{was produced in}} partnership with Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group, which handled the design and distribution of the product. A New York Times analysis stated that the model was an attempt by Chen to generate revenue while he tried [...] "to shift the organization’s focus to services and software." [...] An analyst with London's ABI Research said: [...] "John Chen is just sustaining <b>the</b> <b>handset</b> business as he sorts out the way ahead." [...] As part of the localization effort {{for the promotion of}} the Z3, the handset's back panel was engraved with the word [...] "Jakarta", but skepticism still emerged, as <b>the</b> <b>handset</b> was still more than twice as expensive as Android models in Indonesia at the time of release.|$|E
2500|$|Samsung {{introduced}} the Galaxy Round smartphone in the Korean market in October 2013. The device features a 1080p screen, measuring , that curves on the vertical axis in a rounded case.

50|$|Frequency hopping {{is often}} used to {{increase}} overall BTS performance; this involves the rapid switching of voice traffic between TRXs in a sector. A hopping sequence is followed by <b>the</b> TRXs and <b>handsets</b> using <b>the</b> sector. Several hopping sequences are available, and the sequence in use for a particular cell is continually broadcast by that cell so that it is known to <b>the</b> <b>handsets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Interesting {{features}} of <b>the</b> <b>handset's</b> DVB-H receiver include the program guide and the recording facility. The phone has a constant 30 second rolling record function for instant replay and can record broadcasts to memory card. Providers may charge {{for some of}} these features.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the mobile}} phone or data device is turned on, it {{registers}} with the mobile telephone exchange, or switch, with its unique identifiers, and {{can then be}} alerted by the mobile switch {{when there is an}} incoming telephone call. <b>The</b> <b>handset</b> constantly listens for the strongest signal being received from the surrounding base stations, and is able to switch seamlessly between sites. As the user moves around the network, the [...] "handoffs" [...] are performed to allow the device to switch sites without interrupting the call.|$|E
2500|$|The Ubuntu Edge was a {{proposed}} high-concept smartphone announced by Canonical Ltd. on 22 July 2013.

[...] It had the highest target of any crowdfunded project to date, $32,000,000 over a one-month campaign. The Edge {{was not intended to}} go into mass production after the initial run, but rather to serve as a demonstration for new technologies for the industry. The Edge fell short of its funding goal, raising only $12,809,906, with 5682 pledges to purchase the standard model of <b>the</b> <b>handset.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The main {{technology}} used in home remote controls is infrared (IR) light. The signal between {{a remote control}} handset and the device it controls consists of pulses of infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye, but can be seen through a digital camera, video camera or a phone camera. [...] The transmitter in the remote control handset sends out a stream of pulses of infrared light when the user presses a button on <b>the</b> <b>handset.</b> A transmitter is often a light emitting diode (LED) which {{is built into the}} pointing end of the remote control handset. The infrared light pulses form a pattern unique to that button. [...] The receiver in the device recognizes the pattern and causes the device to respond accordingly.|$|E
50|$|For IPv4 networks, the {{tethering}} normally works via NAT on <b>the</b> <b>handset's</b> existing data connection, so {{from the}} network point of view, there is just one device with a single IPv4 network address, though it is technically possible to attempt to identify multiple machines.|$|R
50|$|The {{digital systems}} were {{designed}} to emit less radio power from <b>the</b> <b>handsets.</b> This meant that cells had to be smaller, so more cells had {{to be placed in}} the same amount of space. This was possible because cell towers and related equipment had become less expensive.|$|R
50|$|Some {{models of}} {{smartphones}} allow {{the user to}} enter letters into <b>the</b> <b>handsets</b> dialing window to allow the completion of phonewords.
