5000|$|On {{aircraft}} using jet engines, thrust reversal {{is accomplished}} by causing the jet blast to flow forward. The engine does not run or rotate in reverse; instead, <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> devices are used to block the blast and redirect it forward. High bypass ratio engines usually reverse thrust by changing the direction of only the fan airflow, since the majority of thrust is generated by this section, {{as opposed to the}} core. There are three jet engine thrust reversal systems in common use: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} {{method is to}} reverse {{the direction of the}} exhaust stream of the jet engine and use the power of the engine itself to decelerate. Ideally, the reversed exhaust stream would be directed straight forward. However, for aerodynamic reasons, this is not possible, and a 135° angle is taken, resulting in less effectiveness than would otherwise be possible. Thrust reversal can also be used in flight to reduce airspeed, though this is not common with modern aircraft. There are three common types of <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> systems used on jet engines: the target, clam-shell, and cold stream systems. Some propeller-driven aircraft equipped with variable-pitch propellers can reverse thrust by changing the pitch of their propeller blades. Most commercial jetliners have such devices, and it also has applications in military aviation.|$|E

40|$|The NASA Langley Configuration Aerodynamics Branch has {{conducted}} an experimental investigation {{to study the}} static performance of innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> concepts applicable to high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines. Testing was conducted on a conventional separate-flow exhaust system configuration, a conventional cascade <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> configuration, and six innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> configurations. The innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> configurations consisted of a cascade <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> with porous fan-duct blocker, a blockerless <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser,</b> two core-mounted target thrust reversers, a multi-door crocodile <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser,</b> and a wing-mounted <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser.</b> Each of the innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> concepts offer potential weight savings and/or design simplifications over a conventional cascade <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> design. Testing was conducted in the Jet-Exit Test Facility at NASA Langley Research Center using a 7. 9 %-scale exhaust system model with a fan-to-core bypass ratio of approximately 9. 0.

40|$|An {{implicit}} {{finite volume}} method is investigated for {{the solution of}} the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for flows within <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> and thrust vectoring nozzles. <b>Thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> nozzles typically have sharp corners, and the rapid expansion and large turning angles near these corners are shown to cause unacceptable time step restrictions when conventional approximate factorization methods are used. In this investigation these limitations are overcome by using second-order upwind differencing and line Gauss-Siedel relaxation. This method is implemented with a zonal mesh so that flows through complex nozzle geometries may be efficiently calculated.

A brief discussion of the take-off and landing requirements {{for the next generation}} fighter aircraft leads to the conclusion that advances in lift coefficient and <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> will be required to allow short-field operation. Typical power-on longitudinal aerodynamic data for the three fighter configurations, indicating different approaches to meeting the high-lift coefficient requirement, are discussed. <b>Thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> is not addressed in this paper. The power-on data are analyzed to determine what power effects are present, that is, direct thrust, boundary-layer control, vortex flows, or supercirculation. The results of the analysis indicate, for the configurations studied, that induced effects are small compared to direct thrust and that boundary-layer control, rather than leading-edge vortex flows or supercirculation, is the only significant thrust-induced effect...|$|E

Twin vertical tails were tested at three longitudinal locations. Two nonaxisymmetric nozzle reverser concepts were studied. The effects of <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> on horizontal tail effectiveness {{were found to be}} very dependent upon vertical tail locations. At approach speeds thrust reverser operation usually resulted in large variations in horizontal tail effectiveness as either nozzle pressure ratio or model angle of attack was varied.

At in-flight conditions there were always decreases in tail effectiveness due to reverser operation regardless of vertical tail location...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the static test facility of the Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel {{to determine the effects}} of rounding and rotating the port corner of a nonaxisymmetric <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> port. High pressure air was used to simulate jet exhaust at nozzle pressure ratios up to 6. 0. The investigation indicates that using a rounded corner in the reverser port passage increases the discharge coefficient significantly compared to that of a sharp cornered <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> port. Incorporating a rotating cylinder into the rounded corner reverser port passage provides no additional increase at cylinder revolutions per minute up to 10, 000. (Revolutions per minute of 390, 000 were necessary to achieve a surface velocity equal to the duct velocity.) Highest levels of discharge coefficient are obtained by providing a large, round, cylindrical surface in the port upstream wall. Locating the reverser port in a constant area duct results in higher discharge coefficients than locating the port in a convergent duct...|$|E
