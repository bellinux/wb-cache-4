5|$|Byrne {{assembled}} a band to tour for the album, performing music throughout {{the latter half}} of 2008 and early 2009 across NorthAmerica, Europe, and Australasia. He hired more singers than he had on previous tours to reproduce the complex vocal harmonies of the album and was inspired <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> dancers after seeing SufjanStevens promote the album Illinois as well as the Japanese films FunkyForest and TheTasteofTea. Byrne was initially uninvolved in the choreography, but made more suggestions as the tour went on and after he saw a live performance by Deerhoof that incorporated dancing with instruments. He began booking tour dates before the album was completed and continued writing his book TheBicycleDiaries throughout the tour.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first two}} days at sea are {{unproductive}} and they return to port each night. On the third day, Hooper wants <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> a shark proof cage. Initially Quint refuses, considering it a suicidal idea, but he relents when Hooper offers him a hundred dollars. On the ocean, the shark finally shows up. Hooper guesses the animal {{must be at least}} twenty feet long, and is visibly excited and in awe. After several unsuccessful attempts by Quint to harpoon the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the cage. He resolves to first take photos of the shark, before trying to kill it with a bang stick. However, the shark attacks the cage, and, after ramming the bars apart, kills and eats Hooper.|$|E

25|$|Because of the restrictively low budget, {{no light}} {{equipment}} was utilized during the shoot. Gregory Sandor shot the entire film in natural light. For the film's many tracking shots, Hellman estimated {{the crew had}} only been able <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> about eight feet of dolly tracks.|$|E
25|$|Royal Brunei {{does not}} serve Alcohol {{beverages}} on board its flights. Passengers are however, permitted <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> their own alcohol for consumption on board. This reflects the Bruneian government's {{policy on the}} sale and importation of alcohol in Brunei, resulting in a weak tourism industry. All inflight meals served are halal.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{contingent}} {{is housed}} in Mount Vernon Camp, which is their one-stop location for {{work as well as}} personal life. While most new recruits come to Singapore alone since they are usually in their late teens or early twenties, they are allowed <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> their wives and immediate family members to Singapore as they move on into the next phases of their personal lives.|$|E

60|$|HARRY. No, he's {{only had}} a bang on the head. He's stunned. I've sent for the doctor. Luckily he was dining at the Carmichaels' and I sent George's {{rickshaw}} <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> him <b>along</b> as quick as he could come.|$|R
25|$|There {{were reports}} of an {{additional}} firearm in a bag that he forced a hostage <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> as he arrived near the campus site. According to TVA's crime reporter Claude Poirier, Gill briefly held a lawyer hostage and demanded that he bring the bag containing the fourth gun and additional ammunition. When the first shots were fired and police arrived, the lawyer fled the scene and hid Gill's bag.|$|E
25|$|Spurrier's disappointing {{tenure as}} an NFL head coach has been heavily {{scrutinized}} and analysed. During {{his first season}} in Washington, Spurrier brought in several of his former stars from Florida, including quarterbacks Danny Wuerffel and Shane Matthews, leading to criticism that he played favorites. Also criticized was his decision <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> most of his coaching staff from Florida {{even though they had}} little or no experience coaching professional football (the exception being Marvin Lewis, who was a veteran NFL coach).|$|E
25|$|In 211, Liu Bei led an army to Yi Province (益州; {{covering}} present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) {{to assist}} the provincial governor Liu Zhang in countering a rival warlord, Zhang Lu of Hanzhong Commandery. He left Zhang Fei and others behind to guard Jing Province in his absence. Earlier in 209, Liu Bei married Sun Quan's younger sister Lady Sun to strengthen the alliance between him and Sun Quan. Because of her brother's strong influence, Lady Sun was arrogant and she allowed her close aides to behave lawlessly. Even Liu Bei was afraid of her. When Sun Quan heard that Liu Bei had left for Yi Province, he sent a vessel to Jing Province to fetch his sister home. Lady Sun attempted <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> Liu Bei's son Liu Shan with her, but Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun led their men to stop her and managed to retrieve Liu Shan.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the text}} was printed in a {{typeface}} resembling typewriter lettering, {{some people thought}} that Suzy Creamcheese was real, and many listeners expected {{to see her in}} concert performances. Because of this, it was decided that [...] "it would be best <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> a Suzy Creamcheese replica who would demonstrate once and for all the veracity of such a beast." [...] Because the original voice of Suzy Creamcheese, Jeannie Vassoir, was unavailable, Pamela Lee Zarubica took over the part.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{falls in}} the winter and early spring, while summer is punctuated with widely scattered thunderstorms. The autumn is usually cool and dry. Due to the altitude and dryness of the atmosphere, vigorous radiative cooling occurs throughout the year, and exceptional daily temperature variances are not uncommon. Consequently, the nights range from very cool in the summer to extremely cold in the winter; therefore, visitors should always remember <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> at least a jacket, even during the summer. Records indicate that the highest temperature ever recorded in the forest was [...] in 1978, while the coldest was [...] in 1972.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{received}} {{moderate to}} poor reviews. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times termed it [...] "a pleasant, lazy romance... Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Hammerstein {{in a minor}} key". John Chapman of the Daily News stated, [...] "Perhaps Hammerstein and Rodgers are too gentlemanly {{to be dealing with}} Steinbeck's sleazy and raffish denizens." [...] Walter Kerr of the Herald Tribune suggested, [...] "Someone seems to have forgotten <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> that gallon of good, red wine." [...] John McClain of the Journal-American stated, [...] "This {{is a far cry from}} the exalted talents of the team that produced South Pacific. They must be human, after all." [...] Steven Suskin, in his book chronicling Broadway opening night reviews, stated that Pipe Dream received one favorable review from the seven major New York critics, two mixed, and four unfavorable. Louis Kronenberger, in Time magazine, summed it up as [...] "roficient, professional, and disappointing." [...] Billy Rose said of Pipe Dream, [...] "You know why Oscar shouldn't have written that? The guy has never been in a whorehouse in his life." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{road for}} Einstürzende Neubauten's release on Nothing Records {{would prove to}} be a long one, however, with {{repeated}} delays pushing the Stateside release of Ende Neu back until late 1998. The album was finally released in the U.S. on October 20, 1998, featuring a bonus track, [...] "Bili Ruben." [...] A music video for [...] "Stella Maris" [...] accompanied the album, which received minor airplay on MTV. Nothing also financed a U.S. tour for the band that autumn, which became expensive, due in part <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>along</b> all of the band's custom instrumentation from Germany. The tour lost an estimated $40,000 for the label, according to Bargeld.|$|R

500|$|Timberlake went on {{to become}} an ordained Presbyterian {{minister}} and a hospital administrator at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, which is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. [...] In 2003, Timberlake joined the faculty of Marquette University where he teaches courses on community service and faith, and mentors the student Habitat for Humanity chapter. [...] In 2007, Timberlake said he saw the community service course as [...] "an excellent opportunity <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> the next generation" [...] to address problems of neighborhood blight, poverty, family disorganization, failure in school, and incarceration for African-American males. [...] He described the problems facing the poor as [...] "a colossal, colossal waste of human life." [...] Timberlake has been a volunteer for several years with Milwaukee's Habitat for Humanity chapter, and one of the courses he teaches at Marquette is called [...] "Decent and Affordable Housing," [...] in which students are instructed in construction methods (and use of power tools), investigate the causes of hyper-segregation, study substandard housing as a social injustice issue, and spend part of the semester at a Habitat for Humanity work site helping to build a house. [...] The course is taught through the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, which has hired Timberlake as an adjunct professor. [...] Timberlake, who is not an engineer by trade, has overseen the construction of eleven garages through the project. [...] Timberlake is a proponent of gay marriage.|$|E
2500|$|Botkin {{first visited}} Anna Anderson in May 1927 at Seeon Abbey, where Anderson was a guest. Anderson had asked Botkin <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> [...] "his funny animals."

2500|$|Ross's {{defense lawyer}} argued that since Scott was powerfully built, {{it had made}} sense <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> others [...] "for security", but that Ross's role had been [...] "limited to {{counseling}} and providing information". [...] "Mr. Ross had no physical contact with Mr. Scott," [...] his attorney said. [...] "He did what he was intended to do – provide information." [...] CAN's defense asserted that none of CAN's leaders or employees {{were aware of the}} deprogramming.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{from the}} 1830s, many emancipated Africans {{who had been}} through forced labour and {{discrimination}} in Brazil began moving back <b>to</b> Lagos <b>bringing</b> <b>along</b> with them some cultural and social sensibilities adapted from their sojourn in Latin America.

2500|$|After leaving Tianjin, {{the convoy}} quickly reached Langfang, but found the railway {{there to be}} destroyed. Seymour's {{engineers}} tried to repair the line, but the allied army found itself surrounded, as the railway both behind {{and in front of}} them had been destroyed. They were attacked from all parts by Chinese irregulars and Chinese governmental troops. Five thousand of Dong Fuxiang's [...] "Gansu Braves" [...] and an unknown number of [...] "Boxers" [...] won a costly but major victory over Seymour's troops at the Battle of Langfang on 18 June. As the allied European army retreated from Langfang, they were constantly fired upon by cavalry, and artillery bombarded their positions. It was reported that the Chinese artillery was superior to the European artillery, since the Europeans did not bother <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> much for the campaign, thinking they could easily sweep through Chinese resistance. The Europeans could not locate the Chinese artillery, which was raining shells upon their positions. Mining, engineering, flooding and simultaneous attacks were employed by Chinese troops. The Chinese also employed pincer movements, ambushes and sniper tactics with some success against the foreigners.|$|E
2500|$|Loo – The {{etymology}} of loo is obscure. The Oxford English Dictionary {{notes the}} 1922 appearance of [...] "How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset." [...] in James Joyce's novel Ulysses and defers to Alan S. C. Ross's arguments that it derived {{in some fashion}} {{from the site of}} Napoleon's 1815 defeat. In the 1950s {{the use of the word}} [...] "loo" [...] was considered one of the markers of British upper-class speech, featuring in a famous essay, [...] "U and non-U English". [...] "Loo" [...] may have derived from a corruption of French [...] ("water"), [...] ("mind the water", used in reference to emptying chamber pots into the street from an upper-story window), [...] ("place"), [...] ("place of ease", used euphemistically for a toilet), or [...] ("English place", used from around 1770 to refer to English-style toilets installed for travelers). Other proposed etymologies include a supposed tendency to place toilets in room 100 (hence [...] "loo") in English hotels, a dialectical corruption of the nautical term [...] "lee" [...] in reference to the need to urinate and defecate with the wind prior to the advent of head pumps, or the 17th-century preacher Louis Bourdaloue, whose long sermons at Paris's Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis prompted his parishioners <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> chamber pots.|$|E
2500|$|Most often, kobolds remain {{completely}} invisible. Although King Goldemar (or Goldmar), {{a famous}} kobold from Castle Hardenstein, had hands [...] "thin {{like those of}} a frog, cold and soft to the feel", he never showed himself. The master of Hundermühlen Castle, where Heinzelmann lived, convinced the kobold to let him touch him one night. The kobold's fingers were childlike, and his face was like a skull, without body heat. One legend tells of a female servant taking a fancy to her house's kobold and asking to see him. The kobold refuses, claiming that to look upon him would be terrifying. Undeterred, the maid insists, and the kobold tells her to meet him later—and <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>along</b> a pail of cold water. The kobold waits for the maid, nude and with a butcher knife in his back. The maid faints at the sight, and the kobold wakes her with the cold water. In one variant, the maid sees a dead baby floating in a cask full of blood; years before, the woman had born a bastard child, killed it, and hidden it in such a cask. Legends tell of those who try to trick a kobold into showing itself being punished for the misdeed. For example, Heinzelmann tricked a nobleman into thinking that the kobold was hiding in a jug. When the nobleman covered the jug's mouth to trap the creature, the kobold chided him: ...|$|E
