5|$|Among the Eolambia {{specimens}} {{found to}} date, the best-preserved sacrum includes seven vertebrae. Given that this individual is immature, and hadrosaurs increase their sacral vertebra count with age, adults {{may have had}} more sacrals. The caudal (tail) vertebrae are amphicoelous, having both {{the front and back}} ends being concave. They have pedestal-like prezygapophyses and tab-like postzygapophyses, the latter of which are separated by a depression. The prezygapophyses lengthen to become stalks and the postzygapophyses shrink in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> rear caudals. Furthermore, the neural spines transition from rectangular to strongly curved (concave in front and convex behind), the centra become more elongated, and the transverse processes disappear as well.|$|E

Marine water measures at 35parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as brackish water. Near the center of Jacksonville, average measures have been collected at 11.40ppt. Farther south at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9ppt and falls again to 0.81ppt at the Shands Bridge near Green Cove Springs.|$|E

5|$|At times, some ox cart trains {{did not go}} all the way through, {{but were}} {{supplemented}} by river craft. First flatboats and then shallow-draft steamboats ascended the Minnesota River to Traverse des Sioux and upstream points, where they were met by cart brigades travelling the West Plains Trail. In 1851, weekly steamboat service on the Mississippi began between Saint Anthony Falls and Sauk Rapids on <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>and</b> Woods trails. In 1859, steamboat machinery was carried overland to the Red River where a boat was built, but service was intermittent.

5|$|By the mid-1970s, disco, a form {{of dance}} music, was {{becoming}} popular, evolving from underground dance clubs to mainstream America. Disco reached its zenith following the release of Saturday Night Fever and the phenomenon surrounding the movie and the soundtrack by The Bee Gees. Disco's time was short, however, and by 1980 was soon replaced {{with a number of}} genres that evolved out of the punk rock scene, like new wave. Bruce Springsteen became a major star, first in the mid to late 1970s and then throughout the 1980s, with dense, inscrutable lyrics and anthemic songs that resonated with <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> lower classes.|$|E
