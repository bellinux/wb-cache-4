5|$|After the Rye House Plot of 1683, {{an attempt}} to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and {{gathered}} supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, {{where he had been}} greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne. The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes.|$|E
5|$|She rekindled {{her studies}} {{too late in}} life to become a truly {{exceptional}} dancer, but she obsessively insisted on grueling daily practice (up to eight hours a day) that contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion. In September 1929, she was {{invited to join the}} ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples, but, as close as this was to the success she desired, she declined the invitation. While the public still believed the Fitzgeralds <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> of glamor, friends noted that the couple's partying had somewhere gone from fashionable to self-destructive—both had become unpleasant company.|$|E

25|$|The changes it {{had already}} {{undergone}} since the Indépendants of 1911 could leave people in no doubt as to its nature. Cubism was not a school, distinguished by some superficial variation on a generally accepted norm. It was a total regeneration, indicating {{the emergence of a}} wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realised that it was destined <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it.|$|E
25|$|With Outworld driven {{back during}} Mortal Kombat Gold, Kung Lao {{decided not to}} return to Shaolin, instead {{allowing}} everyone {{to believe that he}} was dead and went on <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> of peace in respect to the beliefs of his ancestors. This would not last long however, as he was drawn away from his newfound peace to help fight against Shinnok's forces, when word reached him that Goro was still alive. After Shinnok's defeat, Kung Lao attacked Goro, who had signed a peace treaty with the Centaurs under the mediation of Kitana. Instead of being an attempted assassination, however, the blow was a ceremonial strike of vengeance for the Great Kung Lao's death. With this act, the two warriors shook hands, ending their conflict.|$|E

25|$|The {{minister}} {{moving the}} bill argued that since 1973, the government's intention was {{for people who}} had changed gender/sex <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> according to their new gender, {{including the right to}} marry. Through an oversight, the law relating to marriage had not been re-aligned with the official policy to recognise sex reassignment surgery. Now that the courts had illuminated this inconsistency after a landmark case in which a woman sought and won the annulment of her marriage to a trans man (Lim Ying v Hiok Kian Ming Eric), it was necessary to amend the Women's Charter to ensure that the original intent was not undermined. Transgender people were officially granted their wish on 24 January 1996 via an announcement by MP Abdullah Tarmugi without much public fanfare or opposition.|$|E
25|$|Men {{and women}} born in Western countries, who become Buddhists as adults, wish to become monks or nuns.

It is seen as being easier <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> as a monk or nun in countries where people generally live by the culture of Buddhism, since {{it is difficult to}} live by the rules of a monk or a nun in a Western country. For instance; a Theravāda monk or nun is not allowed to work, handle money, listen to music, cook and so on, which are extremely difficult rules to live by in cultures which do not embrace Buddhism.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{refused to}} be rescued by Silas Soule, a friend from Kansas who had somehow {{infiltrated}} the Jefferson County Jail offering to break him out during the night and flee northward. Brown supposedly told Silas that, aged 59, {{he was too old}} <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> on the run from the federal authorities and was ready to die as a martyr. Silas left him behind to be executed. More importantly, many of Brown's letters exuded high tones of spirituality and conviction and, when picked up by the northern press, won increasing numbers of supporters in the North as they simultaneously infuriated many white people in the South. On December 1, his wife arrived by train in Charles Town where she joined him at the county jail for his last meal. She was denied permission to stay for the night, prompting Brown to lose his composure for the only time through the ordeal.|$|E
25|$|In {{her early}} years, Bourgeoys had never held {{much of an}} {{interest}} in joining the confraternity attached to the monastery {{in the town of}} the canonesses regular of the Congregation Notre-Dame, which had been founded in 1597 by the Blessed Alix Le Clerc, C.R.S.A., dedicated to the education of the poor. The canonesses of the monastery helped the poor, but remained cloistered and did {{not have the right to}} teach outside of the cloister. To reach poor young girls who could not afford to be boarded within the cloister as students, they relied upon the confraternity, whose members they would educate in both religion and pedagogy. It seems, however, that she had a change of heart on 7 October 1640, during a procession in honour of Our Lady of the Rosary. Her response to this experience was to seek to give herself wholly to God and <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> that mirrored, as much as possible, that of the Virgin Mary.|$|E
