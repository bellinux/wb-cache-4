5|$|Acarya Ananda Jha, {{the author}} of the Chinnamasta Tattva, prescribes her worship by {{soldiers}} as she embodies self-control of lust, heroic self-sacrifice for the benefit of others, and fearlessness in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her generosity to others. Other goals common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one's foes, removal of obstacles, ability to sway kings, ability to attract others, conquest over other kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|Modern scholarship, {{noting the}} way in which similar {{accounts}} were associated in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures, sees the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to convey a sense of the power of Jesus in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> or a sign of God's displeasure with the Jewish people. Scholars have also noted the ways in which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the Old Testament.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E

25|$|Heideggerians {{regarded}} Søren Kierkegaard as, by far, {{the greatest}} philosophical contributor to Heidegger's own existentialist concepts. Heidegger's concepts of anxiety (Angst) and mortality draw on Kierkegaard and are {{indebted to the}} way in which the latter lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> the temporality of existence, and the importance of passionate affirmation of one's individual being-in-the-world.|$|E

25|$|Many {{churches were}} {{decorated}} {{with images of}} the saint, e.g. St. George's church in Staraya Ladoga, Russia was adorned with magnificent frescoes in 1167.

5000|$|The 1980s saw a {{resurgence}} of mondo movies focusing almost exclusively on (onscreen) <b>death,</b> instead <b>of</b> world cultures. <b>The</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Death</b> series is a notable example {{of this type of}} mondo (or [...] "death") movie.

500|$|Werner Mölders' old unit, Jagdgeschwader 51, {{was renamed}} [...] "Mölders" [...] in his honour, on 22 November 1941, only hours after his death. Its members were {{entitled}} to wear the [...] "Mölders" [...] cuffband. Shortly after Mölders died, the British intelligence agency dropped flyers over Germany. The so-called Möldersbrief (Mölders-letter) was a copy of correspondence supposedly written by Mölders to the provost of Schwerin. In this letter, he expressed his strong belief in Catholicism and stated that, especially in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> many supporters of National Socialism still find strength and courage with Catholicism.|$|E

The fortitude of the martyrs in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> had earned the faith respectability in the past, though it may have won few converts. The thought of martyrdom, however, sustained Christians under trial and in prison, hardening their faith. Packaged with the promise of eternal life, martyrdom proved attractive for the growing segment of the pagan population which was, to quote Dodds, [...] "in love with death". To use Tertullian's famous phrase, the blood of the martyrs was the seed of the Church.|$|E

500|$|Rilke {{uses the}} images of love and of lovers {{as a way of}} showing mankind's {{potential}} and humanity's failures in achieving the transcendent understanding embodied by the angels. [...] In the Second Elegy, Rilke writes that [...] "Lovers, if they knew how, might utter / wondrous things in the midnight air." [...] (Liebende könnten, verstünden sie's, in der Nachtluft / wunderlich reden.) He depicts [...] "the inadequacy of ordinary lovers" [...] and contrasts a feminine form of [...] "sublime love" [...] and a masculine [...] "blind animal passion." [...] At the time the first elegies were written, Rilke often [...] "expressed a longing for human companionship and affection, and then, often immediately afterwards, asking whether he could really respond to such companionship if it were offered to him..." [...] He notices a [...] "decline in the lives of lovers... when they began to receive, they also began to lose the power of giving." [...] Later, during World War I, he would lament that [...] "the world has fallen into the hands of men." [...] In <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> life and love is not cheap and meaningless and Rilke asserted that great lovers are able to recognize all three (life, love, and death) as part of a unity. Rilke asserted that the true meaning of love could be understood through death providing love a meaning in this unity—that [...] "the nature of every ultimate love... is only able to reach the loved one in the infinite." ...|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Górecki {{learned of}} an {{inscription}} scrawled {{on the wall}} of a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane, which lies {{at the foot of the}} Tatra mountains in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna, a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read O Mamo, nie placz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. [...] Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, [...] "I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words". He later explained, [...] "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me." ...|$|E
500|$|The girdle's {{symbolic}} meaning, in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, {{has been}} construed {{in a variety}} of ways. Interpretations range from sexual in nature to spiritual. Those who argue for the sexual inference view the girdle as a [...] "trophy". However, it is not entirely clear who the [...] "winner" [...] is: Sir Gawain or Lady Bertilak. The girdle is given to Gawain by Lady Bertilak in order to keep him safe when he confronts the Green Knight. When Lord Bertilak returns home from his hunting trip, Gawain does not reveal the girdle to his host but, instead, hides it. This introduces the spiritual interpretation, that Gawain’s acceptance of the girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in God, at least in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> To some, the Green Knight is Christ, who overcomes death, while Gawain is the Every Christian, who in his struggles to follow Christ faithfully, chooses the easier path. In Sir Gawain, the easier choice is the girdle, which promises what Gawain most desires. Faith in God, alternatively, requires one’s acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what God has planned. It is arguably best to view the girdle not as an either–or situation, but as a complex, multi-faceted symbol that acts to test Gawain in more ways than one. [...] While Gawain is able to resist Bertilak’s wife’s sexual advances, he is unable to resist the powers of the girdle. Gawain is operating under the laws of chivalry which, evidently, have rules that can contradict each other. In the story of Sir Gawain, Gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks (accepting the girdle) and keeping his promise (returning anything given to him while his host is away).|$|E
