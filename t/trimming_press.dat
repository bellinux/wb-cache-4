40|$|Molten metal {{processing}} is inherently energy intensive and roughly 25 % {{of the cost}} of die-cast products can be traced to some form of energy consumption [1]. The obvious major energy requirements are for melting and holding molten alloy in preparation for casting. The proper selection and maintenance of melting and holding equipment are clearly important factors in minimizing energy consumption in die-casting operations [2]. In addition to energy consumption, furnace selection also influences metal loss due to oxidation, metal quality, and maintenance requirements. Other important factors influencing energy consumption in a die-casting facility include geographic location, alloy(s) cast, starting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process flow, casting yield, scrap rate, cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process flow, casting yield, scrap rate, cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting machine, related equipment (robots, <b>trim</b> <b>presses),</b> and downstream processing (machining, plating, assembly, etc.). Each of these factors also may influence the casting quality and productivity of a die-casting enterprise. In a die-casting enterprise, decisions regarding these issues are made frequently and are based on a large number of factors. Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} energy consumption can vary significantly from one die-casting enterprise to the next, and within a single enterprise as function of time...|$|R

50|$|In {{the most}} common method of high-volume, {{continuous}} thermoforming of thin-gauge products, plastic sheet is fed from a roll or from an extruder into a set of indexing chains that incorporate pins, or spikes, that pierce the sheet and transport it through an oven for heating to forming temperature. The heated sheet then indexes into a form station where a mating mold and pressure-box close on the sheet, with vacuum then applied to remove trapped air and to pull the material into or onto the mold along with pressurized air to form the plastic to the detailed shape of the mold. (Plug-assists are typically used in addition to vacuum {{in the case of}} taller, deeper-draw formed parts in order to provide the needed material distribution and thicknesses in the finished parts.) After a short form cycle, a burst of reverse air pressure is actuated from the vacuum side of the mold as the form tooling opens, commonly referred to as air-eject, to break the vacuum and assist the formed parts off of, or out of, the mold. A stripper plate may also be utilized on the mold as it opens for ejection of more detailed parts or those with negative-draft, undercut areas. The sheet containing the formed parts then indexes into a trim station on the same machine, where a die cuts the parts from the remaining sheet web, or indexes into a separate <b>trim</b> <b>press</b> where the formed parts are trimmed. The sheet web remaining after the formed parts are trimmed is typically wound onto a take-up reel or fed into an inline granulator for recycling.|$|R

40|$|Today, a {{continuously}} increasing {{complexity of}} equipment and processes characterizes the production technologies. This also applies to press hardening, a hot sheet metal forming process, for producing car body components with a high crash performance at low weight. Currently, the challenges in press hardening are not only limited to some single process steps. To increase the process reliability and flexibility, the products quality and the energy and resource efficiency all process steps and its technologies need to be investigated {{in the context of}} the whole process chain. Therefore, the paper gives an overview about alternative approaches for an optimized press hardening process, including pre- and post-processing plus the forming and quenching process. It starts with investigations on direct contact heating, which enables fast and flexible austenitization of sheet metals at compact machinery dimensions. Furthermore, the paper presents new approaches on press hardening tool technologies, especially focused on design of cooling channels for high cooling rates. As an alternative to laser cutting technologies, the paper presents the process integrated mechanical <b>trimming</b> of <b>press</b> hardened car body parts via high speed impact cutting.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, press {{hardening}} {{has become a}} fully established technology in both science and industry {{for the production of}} ultra-high-strength structural components, especially in the automotive industry. Beside the improvement of the car performance such as safety and lightweight design, the production process is also one focus of technology development trends in press hardening. Because of the additional process parameter of temperature, the energy and resource efficiency of such processes {{is one of the most}} important challenges. This includes alternative process steps and process chains as well as zero defect manufacturing by intelligent process control. Beside the high energy effort for heating up the blanks to austenitization temperature, the production floor space requirement is also comparably high, especially for heating devices. Due to the growing product variety in automobile production, combined with shorter product life cycles, the flexibility of production processes becomes more and more significant, which is also true for press hardening. This includes production organization as well as flexibility of production devices. Another topic is part complexity. A trend in automobile car body design is to reduce the number of parts by increasing the complexity – to combine an assembled component to a single part with locally varying properties. By using tailored tempering, the press hardening technology enables a selective approach of material strength in one single component. There are different solutions in production, but the technical effort to create components with tailored properties is relatively high. The article will give an overview about alternative approaches for optimized process chains of press hardening and also includes pre- and post-processing in addition to the actual forming and quenching process.
