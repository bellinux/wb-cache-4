5|$|Another {{special case}} {{is where the}} contact angle is exactly 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared Teflon approaches this. Contact angle of 180° occurs when the liquid–solid surface <b>tension</b> <b>is</b> exactly equal to the liquid–air surface tension.|$|E
5|$|Surface <b>tension</b> <b>is</b> {{the elastic}} {{tendency}} of a fluid surface {{which makes it}} acquire the least surface area possible. Surface tension allows insects (e.g. water striders), usually denser than water, to float and stride on a water surface.|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of acetylcholine (ACh) -, potassium- and caffeine contractures of anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM) of Mytilus coruscus Gould were examined under various conditions, {{and the following}} results were obtained. 1) In the presence of 100 mM choline, ACh contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> reduced by about 90 %, while potassium contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> not reduced. Both ACh- and potassium contractures were not affected by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 2 × 10 - 6 g/m?). 2) ACh- and potassium contracture <b>tensions</b> <b>were</b> dependent on the concentration of extracellular Ca++, and were abolished by the removal of extracellular Ca++. The rate of the decrement of potassium contracture tension after the removal of extracellular Ca++ was somewhat larger than that of ACh contracture tension, but the difference between them was not significant. In Ca++ -free artificial sea water (ASW) containing 3 mM EGTA, caffeine contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> not reduced, while caffeine contracture tension of potassium-depolarized ABRM was reduced by about 50 %. 3) ACh- and potassium contracture <b>tensions</b> <b>were</b> reduced by 5 - 20 mM Mn++ with increasing its concentration; both contracture <b>tensions</b> <b>were</b> reduced by about 75 % by 20 mM Mn++. Caffeine contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> not reduced by Mn++, and caffeine contracture tension of potassium-depolarized ABRM was reduced by only about 20 % by 5 - 20 mM Mn++, 4) In the presence of 2 mM procaine, ACh contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> abolished, whereas caffeine- and potassium contracture <b>tensions</b> <b>were</b> reduced by about 50 % and 10 %, respectively. By 10 mM procaine, caffeine contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> abolished, whereas potassium contracture <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> reduced by about 50 %. 5) Caffeine contracture was followed by catch tension. Catch tensions of ACh- and caffeine contrac-tures were not affected by the removal of extracellular Ca++. These catch <b>tensions</b> <b>were</b> released by the application of high concentration of potassium, with a transient increment of tension. In potassium depolarized ABRM, ACh contracture was abolished while caffeine contracture was induced with a phasic time course. In Na+ -free ASW, caffeine contracture <b>was</b> phasic. Catch <b>tension</b> of ACh contracture was released by the removal of extracellular Na+ and by an addition of 10 mM procaine. On {{the basis of these}} results, the mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling and catch of ABRM were discussed...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, surface <b>tensions</b> <b>were</b> {{measured}} by the drop weight method, and interfacial <b>tensions</b> <b>were</b> determined using the ring method by a KSV Sigma 700 tensiometer. Both measurements were taken at room temperature (22  °C[*]±[*] 1).|$|R
5|$|A {{surface is}} more {{wettable}} when γLV and θ is low. Zisman termed the intercept of these lines when cos θ = 1, as the critical surface tension (γc) of that surface. This critical surface <b>tension</b> <b>is</b> an important parameter {{because it is}} a characteristic of only the solid.|$|E
5|$|Because {{surface tension}} {{manifests itself in}} various effects, it offers a number of paths to its measurement. Which method is optimal depends upon {{the nature of the}} liquid being measured, the {{conditions}} under which its <b>tension</b> <b>is</b> to be measured, and the stability of its surface when it is deformed.|$|E

5|$|Another way to view surface <b>tension</b> <b>is</b> {{in terms}} of energy. A {{molecule}} in contact with a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not in contact with a neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{instrumental}} passage, the tabla rhythm switches to a 10-beat jhaptal cycle. A musical dialogue ensues in 5/4 time, first between the dilruba and sitar, then between a Western string section and sitar. The interplay between these lead instruments adheres to the call-and-response tradition of Indian classical music, known as jawab-sawal. The passage resolves in melodic unison as the instruments together state a rhythmic cadence, or tihai, {{to close the}} middle segment. After this, the drone is again prominent as the rhythm returns to 16-beat tintal for the final verse and chorus. On the finished recording, the tonal and spiritual <b>tension</b> <b>is</b> relieved by the inclusion of muted canned laughter.|$|E
5|$|The rose petal's micro- and {{nanostructures}} {{are larger}} in scale {{than those of}} the lotus leaf, which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture. However, as seen in Figure 9, the liquid can enter the larger-scale grooves, but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves. This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale grooves, the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the water droplet will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down. This effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface <b>tension</b> <b>is</b> surpassed.|$|E

The Social <b>tension</b> <b>was</b> between the poor Ciompi and wealthy merchants who dominated the lucrative wool industry, and the Florentine government, which continued to increase taxation.

25|$|Surface tension {{describes}} {{how difficult it}} is to extend the area of a surface (by stretching or distorting it).

25|$|The second biggest {{factor that}} affects drum sound is head tension against the shell. When the hoop is placed around the drum head and shell and {{tightened}} down with tension rods, {{the tension of}} the head can be adjusted.
