As the production volume increases {{and a new}} product launches, the current capacity will not be sufficient for 2012. In {{order to avoid the}} production loss and increase the operational efficiency, four solutions have been tested, including forklift trucks and labor extension, Kanban redesign in staging areas, conveyor implementation in staging areas and automating the transportation between the warehouse and production via implementing AGVs or <b>transfer</b> <b>cars.</b> In this thesis research we specifically analyze the use of AGVs and <b>transfer</b> <b>cars.</b> By implementing two <b>transfer</b> <b>cars</b> in 2012, the system capacity will remain adequate until 2018.

This versatility and increased use can also lead to a shorter battery life. A phone with video viewing capabilities will be a heavy load on the unit’s battery. With phones utilizing 3 G and 4 G technology, even heavier demands are placed on the battery.

40|$|Abstract—A {{transient}} heat transfer mathematical {{model for the}} prediction of temperature distribution in the car body during primer baking has been developed by considering the thermal radiation and convection in the furnace chamber and {{transient heat}} conduction governing equations in the car framework. The car cockpit is considered like a structure with six flat plates, four vertical plates representing the car doors and the rear and front panels. The other two flat plates are the car roof and floor. The transient heat conduction in each flat plate is modeled by the lumped capacitance method. Comparison with the experimental data shows that the heat transfer model works well for the prediction of thermal behavior of the car body in the curing furnace, with deviations below 5 %.

40|$|The {{application}} of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology within {{the automotive industry}} is turning into reality what was until quite recently a utopian vision. The use of hydrogen as a fuel source is the latest advance in the so-called new wave technologies - earlier technological waves were the development of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) and biotechnology. The paper sketches out the main developments that have taken place in the race among the world's largest car manufacturers to develop hydrogen fuelled cells as an alternative to conventional fuels. As with earlier technologies, however, the successful introduction of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles raises the specter of an even broader technological divide between North and South. The paper argues that developing countries need to start positioning themselves now to 'catch up' with these developments by investing in research, training and the building of strategic alliances and knowledge networksHydrogen Fuel, Innovations, Technology <b>Transfer,</b> <b>Car</b> Industry, Developing Countries...|$|E
40|$|Cell microparticles (MPs) {{released}} {{in the extracellular milieu}} can embark plasma membrane and intracellular components which are specific of their cellular origin, and transfer them to target cells. The MP-mediated, cell-to-cell transfer of three human membrane glycoproteins of different degrees of complexity was investigated in the present study, using a CHO cell model system. We first tested the delivery of CAR and CD 46, two monospanins which act as adenovirus receptors, to target CHO cells. CHO cells lack CAR and CD 46, high affinity receptors for human adenovirus serotype 5 (HAdV 5), and serotype 35 (HAdV 35), respectively. We found that MPs derived from CHO cells (MP-donor cells) constitutively expressing CAR (MP-CAR) or CD 46 (MP-CD 46) were able to <b>transfer</b> <b>CAR</b> and CD 46 to target CHO cells, and conferred selective permissiveness to HAdV 5 and HAdV 35. In addition, target CHO cells incubated with MP-CD 46 acquired the CD 46 -associated function in complement regulation. We also explored the MP-mediated delivery of a dodecaspanin membrane glycoprotein, the CFTR to target CHO cells. CFTR functions as a chloride channel in human cells and is implicated in the genetic disease cystic fibrosis. Target CHO cells incubated with MPs produced by CHO cells constitutively expressing GFP-tagged CFTR (MP-GFP-CFTR) were found to gain a new cellular function, the chloride channel activity associated to CFTR. Time-course analysis of the appearance of GFP-CFTR in target cells suggested that MPs could achieve the delivery of CFTR to target cells via two mechanisms: the transfer of mature, membrane-inserted CFTR glycoprotein, and the transfer of CFTR-encoding mRNA. These results confirmed that cell-derived MPs represent a new class of promising therapeutic vehicles for the delivery of bioactive macromolecules, proteins or mRNAs, the latter exerting the desired therapeutic effect in target cells via de novo synthesis of their encoded proteins...|$|E
50|$|In {{the sharing}} economy, <b>transfer</b> <b>cars,</b> {{relocation}} cars, or driveaways are rental cars {{that need to}} be transferred back to their original branch after a one-way rental. Rental car companies have traditionally used truck and train transporters to re-position their fleet until this model was disrupted by websites which let travelers book those <b>transfer</b> <b>cars</b> for free (e.g. Transfercar in Australia, the US and New Zealand and DriveBack in Sweden) or for a very small amount of money (usually €1, e.g. Driiveme and Luckyloc in France). This new model enables rental car companies to save on their relocation costs while offering a way for travelers to save on their travel costs. There is usually a set number of days to transfer the vehicle and limited availability, so this model usually suits travelers with flexible plans.|$|R
