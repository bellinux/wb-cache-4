5|$|In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, {{defending}} team {{players are}} allowed {{to stay on the}} key for an unlimited amount of time.

Weber, along with his British Columbian teammates from the Olympic <b>team,</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> inducted into the BC Sports Hall of Fame in September 2011.|$|E
5|$|Many of the pre-game and in-game {{strategic}} {{decisions in}} baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters {{tend to be}} more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters {{tend to be more}} successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the <b>team</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting {{one or more of the}} right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder. Furthermore, unlike players in most team sports, baseball players can not return to a game after being replaced; this creates a greater risk when making lineup changes, especially as a team's pitching staff may be increasingly depleted in the late innings of a game, particularly one which goes into multiple extra innings.|$|E
