25|$|I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> {{be taken}} that we owe the sailors' working song {{as we now}} possess it to the Americans. How far do these songs date back? I doubt if the most ancient amongst them is much older than the century. It is {{noteworthy}} that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work. In the navy, of course, this sort of song was never permitted. Work proceeded to the strains of a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and {{to the establishment of}} a Yankee marine.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} about the exact date the club was founded. Some {{authorities}} <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been as early as 1898 due {{to the existence of}} papers addressed to Joseph Whitaker, English consul in Palermo and originally believed to be first club president, about a Palermitan football team founded in the month of April of that year. Actually, there is a probable misinterpretation of some sources: in April 1897, the future founders of Palemo Calcio founded the association Sport Club. The most common and officially stated foundation date is 1 November 1900, as the Anglo Palermitan Athletic and Football Club. The club is thought to have been founded by Ignazio Majo Pagano, a young Palermitan colleague of Whitaker who had discovered football while at college in London, where the modern game of football originated from. The initial staff comprised three Englishmen and nine natives of Palermo, with Whitaker as honorary chairman, Edward De Garston as inaugural president and with red and blue as the original team colours. The first recorded football match, played by the team on 30 December 1900, ended in a 5–0 defeat to an unidentified amateur English team. The first official match, played on 18 April 1901 against Messina Football Club, ended in a 3–2 win to the Palermitan side.|$|E

25|$|The club, {{in common}} with several other Italian teams, has its {{earliest}} roots in England. Football was originally brought to Palermo by English sailors of cargo vessels in the late 19th century who would play football at the muddy port in their spare time. There is some debate about the exact date the club was founded. Some authorities <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been as early as 1898 due {{to the existence of}} papers addressed to Joseph Whitaker, English consul in Palermo and originally believed to be first club president, about a Palermitan football team founded in the month of April of that year.

Walmesley lent his support to Johnson's application, but Johnson was passed over because the school's directors thought he was [...] "a very haughty, ill-natured gent., and that he has such a way of distorting his face (which though he can't help) the gent <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> affect some lads". He was also rejected for a position at a school in Brewood for similar reasons. Johnson did not give up his ambition to teach; with Walmesley's encouragement, he decided to set up his own school.|$|E

500|$|Harrison had {{intended}} to co-produce his long-awaited follow-up to All Things Must Pass with Phil Spector, a mainstay of his career since 1970. Spector's unreliability meant that Harrison was forced to produce Living in the Material World alone – an outcome that music critics Greg Kot and Zeth Lundy find regrettable, in light of how Spector's signature Wall of Sound treatment might have suited ballads such as [...] "Who Can See It" [...] and [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round". Another regular Harrison collaborator, John Barham, provided orchestral arrangements as before, and noted an [...] "austere quality" [...] {{in some of the}} new songs.

500|$|In June 1735, {{while working}} as a tutor for the {{children}} of Thomas Whitby, a local Staffordshire gentleman, Johnson had applied for the position of headmaster at Solihull School. Although Johnson's friend Gilbert Walmisley gave his support, Johnson was passed over because the school's directors thought he was [...] "a very haughty, ill-natured gent, and that he has such a way of distorting his face (which though he can't help) the gents <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> affect some lads". With Walmisley's encouragement, Johnson decided that he could be a successful teacher if he ran his own school. In the autumn of 1735, Johnson opened Edial Hall School as a private academy at Edial, near Lichfield. He had only three pupils: Lawrence Offley, George Garrick, and the 18-year-old David Garrick, who later {{became one of the most}} famous actors of his day. The venture was unsuccessful and cost Tetty a substantial portion of her fortune. Instead of trying to keep the failing school going, Johnson began to write his first major work, the historical tragedy Irene. Biographer Robert DeMaria believed that Tourette syndrome likely made public occupations like schoolmaster or tutor almost impossible for Johnson. This may have led Johnson to [...] "the invisible occupation of authorship".|$|E
500|$|Television critics reacted mostly {{positive}} {{toward the}} episode, calling the storyline [...] "heartfelt." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded and followed the show, respectively, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I spent the entire time expecting the rug to be pulled out {{and the whole thing}} revealed to be Seth MacFarlane just trying to manipulate my emotions." [...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been a little bit too far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we will do for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change." [...] Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian.|$|E

The Torah describes God as actually passing through Egypt to kill all firstborn children and cattle, but passing over (hence [...] "Passover") houses which have the sign of lambs' blood on the doorpost.
