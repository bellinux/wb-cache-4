6000|$|... "You needn't trouble yourself, ma'am," [...] she said, {{as soon as}} {{she could}} make herself heard; [...] "it was the {{creaking}} of the boards <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> somebody was moving overhead." ...|$|E
6000|$|Love {{brought us}} to one grave. The hand that slew [...] Is doom'd to mourn us {{in the pit of}} Cain." [...] Such were the words <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of those two.|$|E
60|$|I laughed {{to myself}} as I took in all this, but, even as I laughed, {{those in the}} field stood still, and sent up a shout <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> we had been perceived.|$|E
60|$|If I {{can help}} {{you in any way}} I'm glad too <b>that</b> you've <b>told</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|DORA. What of <b>that?</b> Eva <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he {{was taking}} her likeness. He's an artist.|$|R
60|$|RUTH. Yes, sir. I {{called at}} his office afterwards, and [pointing to COKESON] <b>that</b> gentleman <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think you'd better {{head for}} the beach," [...] George said abruptly, in a manner <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> his fear had forced him to {{make up his mind}} to some course of action.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} {{like the way}} I talk {{you know what you}} can do," [...] replied Sampson quickly. He stood up then, cool and quiet, with flash of eyes and set of lips <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he was dangerous.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait {{a minute}} now! Wait a minute!" [...] {{returned}} the man sarcastically. [...] "Who was it lent me his uniform {{and who was}} it <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> just what rooms to go into? Answer me those questions, will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bush!" [...] {{interrupted}} the impatient and reckless Paul. [...] "By the Lord, trapper, {{this is the}} very blood-letter <b>that</b> Ellen <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of!" ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{the young}} Fisherman grew pale and clenched {{his hands and}} cried, 'She was a false Witch in <b>that</b> she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I seem to remember, dad, <b>that</b> you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this {{fifty pounds}} was the {{interest}} on a thousand pounds which was invested for me.' ...|$|R
60|$|I followed, {{but there}} was that within me <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I had shot my bolt. The sun blazed down, concentrating its rays on {{my back to the}} {{exclusion}} of the surrounding scenery. It seemed to follow me about like a limelight.|$|E
60|$|FAITH. I know it very well: {{it was not}} {{the first}} time that he has met with me. It was he that came to me when I dwelt {{securely}} at home, and <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he would burn my house over my head if I stayed there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Abel, can you understand--now--at last!" [...] And {{putting her}} lips {{close to my}} ear, she began to murmur soft, melodious sounds <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> nothing. Then drawing back her head, she looked again at me, her eyes glistening with tears, her lips half parted with a smile, tender and wistful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I couldn't {{hear and}} I didn't listen. But after <b>that</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{to drive on}} to Boulevard Waterloo No. 34 and here I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Wayne {{looked at}} him quietly. “There {{is no reason why}} you should not. You will, of course, {{understand}} <b>that</b> Violet <b>told</b> <b>me</b> Miss Harding’s story.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{who sold}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> blade <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it was charmed, {{and could be}} broken only by a caliph,' said Hassan Subah. 'He was a liar.' ...|$|R
6000|$|CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{after we}} left the two {{commercials}} in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs) Sober hearsedrivers a speciality. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what? ...|$|E
60|$|We had parted {{one night}} as usual. No word {{had fallen from}} my lips, at that time or at any time before it, that could betray me, or startle her into sudden {{knowledge}} of the truth. But when we met again in the morning, a change had come over her--a change <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Vesey and Miss Fairlie {{left the}} room together. The kind sorrowful blue eyes looked at me, for a moment, with the prescient sadness of a coming and a long farewell. I felt the {{answering}} pang in my own heart--the pang <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I must lose her soon, and love her the more unchangeably for the loss.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} her husband. I saw their eyes meet across the table, and <b>that</b> look <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how near the past was to their thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not sure}} whether I did that, but I clearly remember, sir, <b>that</b> you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{at the time that}} it was for the Commissary-General." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then if I have no papa, mamma {{must be a}} {{wife that}} has lost her husband, and <b>that,</b> mamma <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at dinner yesterday, was a widow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{but it is}} not Kannoa's {{body that}} is ill," [...] said Ippegoo quickly; [...] "it is her mind that is ill--very ill; and nothing will make it better but a sight of Nunaga. It was Ujarak <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so; and you know, mother, that {{whatever}} he says must be true somehow, whether it be true or not." ...|$|E
60|$|Mood. By the mackings, I {{thought there}} was no good in't, when I saw in fine there; there are some Papishes, I'll warrant, that lie in wait for my daughter; or else they are no Englishmen, but some of your French Outalian-rogues; I owe him thanks, however, this unknown friend of mine, <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> on't. Warner, no wedding to-day, Warner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Waal, them <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> on't, {{said that}} two had fallen before it, and I {{put it up}} to nine at once, {{to make a good}} story better. Nine men had a more desperate sound than two; and when you do begin to brag, a man shouldn't be backward. I thought, howsever, that they was most non-plussed, when I told 'em of the field-piece." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said. [...] "Now, I {{would have}} gone round by the old bridge, only <b>that</b> Allardyce <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you let him ride across this afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{a little}} afraid of that," [...] replied Agatha slowly. [...] "What makes the {{situation}} more difficult is <b>that</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he would ask me again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All <b>that</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{here was}} a tissue of lies then! Helène, I will not leave you with such a man. You cannot {{continue}} to live with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Felix thought: 'I've {{been brought}} up to believe that only Russian girls care for truth. It seems I was wrong. The saints forbid I should be a stumbling-block to my own {{daughter}} searching for it! And yet--where's it all leading? Is this the same child <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> only the other night {{she wanted to know}} everything? She's a woman now! So much for love!' And he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed," [...] {{answered}} Lowiny, with {{an expression}} of countenance <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at once, the better feelings of her sex had all returned again, [...] "and I'll not desart her, though father drive me out of the settlement. I am tired of all this squatting, and think folks ought to live as much in one spot as they can. What's best to be done about Dus Malbone--perhaps she'd like well enough to marry Zeph?" ...|$|E
60|$|Aye, {{it would}} have been a folly, a futile act that would have earned me unbelief, {{contempt}} and anger. And yet there was a moment when jealousy urged me almost headlong to that rashness. For in Madonna Paola's eyes there was a new expression as they rested on the face of Giovanni Sforza--an expression <b>that</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> she had come to love this man whom a little while ago she had despised.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very much}} surprised. It was {{yesterday}} <b>that</b> you <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> when I hinted at this, {{that he was}} no more to you than a cousin,--or a brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please, ma'am," [...] said Sarah, {{opening the}} door, [...] "the {{preserves}} <b>that</b> you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to boil in treacle--the congfiters, {{as you call}} them--is all burnt to the pan." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reverse order: i.e., [...] "now <b>that</b> you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what happened, try to {{remember}} it again but this time starting {{at the end and}} recounting it in reverse chronological order" ...|$|R
