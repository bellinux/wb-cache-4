5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s at <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, the United States Army {{conducted}} a classified feasibility study that proposed {{the construction of}} a manned military outpost on the Moon called Project Horizon with the potential to conduct a wide range of missions from scientific research to nuclear Earth bombardment. The study included the possibility of conducting a lunar-based nuclear test. The Air Force, which at the time was in competition with the Army for {{a leading role in the}} space program, developed its own similar plan called Lunex. However, both these proposals were ultimately passed over as the space program was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency NASA.|$|E

5|$|Cheney's most {{immediate}} issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate {{to cut the}} budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup at <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War. As part {{of the fiscal year}} 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics. Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal began {{a process}} of decolonisation and began a {{withdrawal}} from Portuguese Timor (later East Timor). Australians had long taken {{an interest in the}} colony; the nation had sent troops to the region during World War II, and many East Timorese had fought the Japanese as guerrillas. In September 1974, Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia and indicated that he would support Indonesia if it annexed East Timor. At <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, and {{in the context of the}} American retreat from Indo-China, he felt that incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region, and reduce the risk of the East Timorese FRETILIN movement, which many feared was communist, coming to power.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that Salk was testing his vaccine, both Albert Sabin and Hilary Koprowski {{continued}} working on developing a vaccine using live virus. During a meeting in Stockholm to discuss polio vaccines in November 1955, Sabin presented results obtained on a group of 80 volunteers, while Koprowski read a paper detailing the findings of a trial enrolling 150 people. Sabin and Koprowski both eventually succeeded in developing vaccines. Because of the commitment to the Salk vaccine in America, Sabin and Koprowski both did their testing outside of the United States, Sabin in Mexico and then in the Soviet Union, and Koprowski in the Congo and Poland. In 1957, Sabin developed a trivalent vaccine, containing attenuated strains of all three types of poliovirus. In 1959, ten million children in the Soviet Union received the Sabin oral vaccine. For this work, Sabin was given the medal of the Order of Friendship Among Peoples, described as the Soviets' highest civilian honor, despite having become an American during <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> war. Sabin's oral vaccine using live virus came into commercial use in 1961. Once Sabin’s oral vaccine became widely available, it supplanted Salk’s injected vaccine because it was cheaper to produce and easier to administer.|$|E
