5|$|Another {{international}} {{problem was}} the slave trade, and the African squadron was formed in 1820 <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with this threat. Politically, {{the suppression of the}} slave trade was unpopular, and the squadron was withdrawn in 1823 ostensibly <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with piracy in the Caribbean, and did not return to the African coast until the passage of the Webster–Ashburton treaty with Britain in 1842. After the treaty was passed, the United States used fewer ships than the treaty required, ordered the ships based far from the coast of Africa, and used ships that were too large to operate close to shore. Between 1845 and 1850, the United States Navy captured only 10 slave vessels, while the British captured 423 vessels carrying 27,000 captives.|$|E
