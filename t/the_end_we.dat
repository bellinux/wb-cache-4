500|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} in five weeks, and the recording and mixing lasted three weeks.

Inon Zur described the music as having [...] "some uniqueness to it, that basically it developed throughout the game [...] the [...] of more instruments, taking flutes and percussion and combining them with the standard orchestra." [...] Zur later said, [...] "I thought that we definitely met some high standards; we compared our products to big budget films scores," [...] and, [...] "in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>we</b> were quite happy."

In keeping with her increasingly rocker sound, for this album she left her hair loose and messy and filled it up with little colorful braids, looking like a [...] "modern Medusa" [...] according to biographer Ximena Diego.

500|$|The 2006 final was {{the first}} time that Arsenal had reached the showpiece match; in doing so they became the first club from London to feature in the final. Barcelona were {{appearing}} in the final for the fifth time; their last appearance had been in a 40 loss to Milan in 1994. Two more losses preceded the 1994 final (1961 and 1986), and their only success in the competition came in 1992 when they beat Sampdoria. Barcelona went into the final as domestic league champions, having won La Liga a fortnight earlier. They were regarded as being the best side on the continent because they possessed players such as Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto'o. Barcelona player Deco dismissed the notion of Barcelona being favourites, insisting they would not be complacent: [...] "Milan were winning 30 last year against Liverpool and ended up losing in <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> <b>We</b> need to be serious, calm and fully concentrated so that we don't make any errors".|$|E
500|$|Furst {{and the art}} {{department}} deliberately mixed clashing architectural {{styles to}} [...] "make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable". Furst continued, [...] "e imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going". The 1985 film Brazil by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film's production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference. Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, while Keith Short helped construct the newly created 1989 Batmobile, adding two Browning machine guns. On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, [...] "We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we looked at all sorts of things. In <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>we</b> went into pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s". The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed.|$|E
500|$|Though the {{thousands}} gathered outside the Council House roared [...] "No!" [...] when Boyd said the team {{felt they had}} let the supporters down, there were recriminations concerning Birmingham's performance and team selection. The local press suggested that attempts to combat [...] "Wembley nerves" [...] had resulted in an [...] "over-casual approach to the game". The row at half-time had done little for second-half morale, but speaking fifty years later, Gil Merrick placed the blame less on Boyd's questionable fitness than on a failure to discuss how to stop Revie. Alex Govan, convinced that [...] "if Roy Warhurst had been fit then there would only have been one winner", blamed [...] "bad team selection", saying that even without Warhurst he firmly believed [...] "that if Badham had been in we would have won that game. He would never have given Don Revie the room to run the match." [...] Warhurst himself thought the selection of Newman [...] "meant the team had to adapt its style and in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>we</b> used different tactics to those that had been successful all season".|$|E

[...] According to Slant Magazine, Jacob's Ladder is [...] "a bizarrely {{cohesive}} hybrid of war movie, character study, art film, and horror flick" [...] and [...] "the very act of watching the film is so emotionally draining that the viewer leaves the film feeling worked-in; the thought of repeat viewings is daunting yet insatiable."

500|$|The next day, Churchill filed {{a lawsuit}} in state court {{claiming}} that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views. The jury in Churchill's suit for reinstatement weighed the university's claims of academic misconduct per jury instructions it received in the case. As Stanley Fish said, [...] "It was the jury’s task to determine whether Churchill’s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his constitutionally protected statements." [...] The jury found that the alleged misconduct would not have led to Churchill's firing and rejected the university's academic misconduct claim as the grounds for dismissal. On April 1, 2009, a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired, and awarded $1 in damages. As {{one of the jurors}} said later in a press interview, [...] "it wasn't a slap in his face or anything like that when we didn't give him any money. It's just that [...] David Lane kept saying this wasn't about the money, and in <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>we</b> took his word for that." [...] Churchill's counsel asked Chief Judge Larry J.
