5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going all the time <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In {{the case of an}} electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm, {{residents}} were warned <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> their water and be cautious of potential food contamination due to electrical outages. The War Production Board regional office in Dallas offered {{relief to the}} victims of the storm. In La Porte, a makeshift hospital was set up in city hall. At Point Bolivar, where nearly all houses were destroyed, the now-destitute {{residents were}} transported by the Galveston chapter of the American Red Cross to Galveston for housing.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, United States President Bill Clinton {{declared}} nine Florida counties as disaster areas, which allocated {{federal funding}} for debris removal, emergency services, and restoration of damaged public facilities. In Franklin County, many residents had <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> water before consumption due to contaminated water wells. As a result, the local Red Cross chapter provided water bottles to the affected residents. The Red Cross also deployed two Mobile Feeding Vehicles to Wakulla County, {{and a total of}} 700meals were ultimately distributed.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} Winifred's approach, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) issued cyclone watches and {{warnings}} for various locations along the Queensland coast, prompting evacuations in several towns. Damage after landfall was widespread and severe, {{with thousands of}} homes damaged, flooding {{as a result of}} heavy rainfall along major rivers, and severe damage to crops. Debris obstructed roads across northern Queensland and power outages disrupted electrical service, even at water treatment plants, forcing officials to warn residents <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> water as a precautionary measure. Overall, the cyclone caused $86.4million in agriculture-related damages, with sugar cane and banana harvests suffering the most. Tourist operations were generally uninterrupted by the storm, while ecological and environmental damage, if any, was mild. Even so, high winds uprooted trees in wide swaths of forests, with those not completely defoliated. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and inflicted $130million (1986AUD; $154million USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|No {{attempt to}} arrest Blackburn was made, and he {{returned}} to Kentucky {{with his family in}} early 1873. The family lived in Louisville's Galt House hotel, and Blackburn resumed his medical practice in that city. During a cholera epidemic in 1873, Blackburn rightly theorized that the disease was spread by the consumption of contaminated water, but most citizens accepted the competing theory that cholera was a miasmatic disease. This theory was espoused by Thomas S. Bell, a better-known physician in Louisville. Thousands {{died as a result of}} failing to heed Blackburn's advice <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> potentially contaminated water before drinking it. Blackburn's philanthropic work included treating victims of yellow fever outbreaks in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1873 and Fernandina, Florida, in 1877. He refused to accept compensation for his services in either city, but was presented with gifts from appreciative residents in both cases. Several southern newspapers also carried glowing accounts of Blackburn's service.|$|E

5|$|Rainfall {{and storm}} surge flooded 20 homes in Terrebonne Parish. In addition, several homes in Lafouche Parish {{experienced}} flooding, including two with over {{two feet of}} water. Numerous homes in Golden Meadow experienced flooding, as well. The flooding also forced the temporary closing of numerous roads across the state, including portions of U.S. Route 11 and Interstate 10. Flood waters from the storm cracked a water line in LaPlace, leaving nearly 30,000 residents and many businesses without tap water. The problem was expected to take little time to fix, though residents were advised <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> the water before drinking it. Matthew also left 2,500people without power {{for a short period}} of time. The storm's impact also closed several schools, forcing school administrators to reschedule plans for making up school closings caused by Hurricane Ivan one month earlier. In all, Matthew caused no deaths and $255,000 in damage (2004USD).|$|E
5|$|Teapot: The teapot {{was invented}} during the Yuan Dynasty, tea {{preparation}} in previous dynasties did not utilize a teapot. In the Tang Dynasty, a cauldron was used <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> grounded tea, which was served in bowls. Song Dynasty tea {{was made by}} pouring water boiled using a kettle into a bowl with finely ground tea leaves. A brush was then used to stir the tea. The innovation of the teapot, a vessel that steeps tea leaves in boiling water, occurs during the late Yuan dynasty. Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan Dynasty text, Jiyuan Conghua, which describes a teapot that the author, Cai Shizhan, bought from the scholar Sun Daoming. By the Ming Dynasty, teapots were widespread in China.|$|E
5|$|The John Dory, {{though of}} uninviting appearance, is {{considered}} by some persons as the most delicious fish that appears at table; in the general estimation, however, it ranks next to the turbot, but it is far less abundant in our waters, and is not commonly to be procured of sufficient size for a handsome dish, except in some few parts of our coast which are celebrated for it. It may easily be known by its yellow gray colour, its one large dark spot on either side, the long filaments on the back, a general thickness of form, and its very ugly head. It is dressed in the same manner, and served usually with the same sauces as a turbot, but requires less time <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> it. The fins should be cut off before it is cooked.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the Taiwan flooding in Kaohsiung, officials deployed 7,888troops to the southern portion of the island to assist in rescue and recovery work. Soldiers also set up five medical centers, and utilized amphibious vehicles to rescue people in flooded areas. Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou toured the flooded regions on September23, emphasizing that efforts to drain the flooding should be the main priority. More than 100buildings in Kaohsiung required water pumps and thousands of volunteers to remove standing water from basements and streets. The mayor Kiku Chen temporarily suspended her reelection campaign due to the floods. About 80% of the factories in Kaohsiung were reopened by September21. The high crop damage allowed farmers to qualify for low interest loans. Rail lines took two weeks to reopen due to damage. Power and water service was restored {{within days of the}} storm, although residents in flooded areas were advised <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> water before usage. There was also an increase in dengue fever after the floods. The Red Cross Society of China donated about US$100,000 {{in the days after the}} storm. The government announced on September20 that families affected by the floods would receive NT$30,000 (US$945.92) per house. Throughout Taiwan, exports during September 2010 decreased 6.9% from August's levels due to the storm and an industrial fire.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, 1946, Harrison set {{out from}} Shanghai with {{approximately}} 50 tonnes of supplies. On this train journey, {{he was to be}} accompanied by a Russian UNRRA worker and Chinese welfare representatives. Due to repeated Kuomintang inspections, the train journey constantly suffered from delays. The first such delay occurred at Nanjing and lasted four days; the second such delay, at Xuzhou, was of equal duration. At one station, the medical supplies were unhooked from the train's engine car and left on a bleak plain. The two UNRRA workers did not have clean water to drink and were forced <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> ditch water which was polluted with human waste. To add to the dire situation, Harrison's blanket and shoes were stolen, and due to the cold, he began to suffer from frostbite. Two weeks after Harrison left Shanghai, his train was permitted to move again, but there were problems still ahead. At each one of the 20 stations en route to Kaifeng, the train was delayed for up to three hours. Upon arrival at Kaifeng, the journey had to be completed by truck and ox cart. After completing one delivery, he returned to Kaifeng to pick up a second load, but could not continue past the Zhangqiu branch of the receiving hospital. Harrison died of exposure on January 10, 1947, near Kaifeng in China, aged 66.|$|E
5|$|The floodwaters {{from the}} {{hurricane}} combined with raw sewage in many poor areas of southwestern Mexico, {{leading to a}} widespread threat for a spread of tropical diseases. As a result, government health workers opened vaccination centers in several cities along the Guerrero and Oaxaca coasts. Thousands were inoculated for typhoid fever and tetanus. Officials noted a potential threat for dengue and cholera {{as a result of}} the spoiled water. Health workers also stated mosquitos possessing malaria and dengue fever were likely to breed in large areas of leftover water. In Acapulco, about two days after the hurricane passed, the first day of sun in a week evaporated the areas of leftover water, spreading dust across the region with the deadly diseases. Residents were warned <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> their food and water for 30minutes due to the threat for contamination by the dust. At least twenty cases of cholera and at least six cases of dengue fever were reported. Most significantly, there were 14,630cases of malaria in 616villages in Oaxaca due to Pauline; this represented about 80% of the malaria cases in Mexico during 1998. Army soldiers distributed chlorine tablets to disinfect water pools and wheelbarrows to remove rotting mud and sewage from their damaged homes. Two C-130 Hercules planes and twenty helicopters airlifted food and water to smaller villages south of Acapulco that were stranded for nearly a week after the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Salt mining: Ancient China {{was among}} the {{earliest}} civilizations {{in the world with}} cultivation and trade of salt mining. They first discovered natural gas when they excavated rock salt as the Chinese writer, poet, and politician Zhang Hua of the Jin Dynasty wrote in his book Bowuzhi how people in Zigong, Sichuan excavated natural gas and used it <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> a rock salt solution. The ancient Chinese gradually mastered and advanced the techniques of producing salt. Salt mining was an arduous task for the ancient Chinese, where they faced geographical and technological constraints. Salt was mainly extracted from the sea and salt works in the coastal areas in late imperial China equated to more than 80 percent of national production. In conjunction to this, the Chinese made use of natural crystallization of salt lakes and constructed some artificial evaporation basins close to the shores. In 1041, during the medieval Song dynasty, the Chinese drilled a well with a diameter {{about the size of a}} bowl and several dozen feet deep was drilled for salt production. In Southwestern China, natural salt deposits were mined with bores that could reach to a depth of more than 1000 meters but the yields of ground and salt were relatively low. As salt was a necessity of life for human civilization, salt mining played a pivotal role as one of the most important sources of Imperial Chinese government revenue and state development.|$|E
