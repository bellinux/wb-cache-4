Others bring to my notice <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E

I ask forgiveness for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E

500|$|Emmeline Pankhurst {{was born}} on 15 July 1858 in the Manchester suburb of Moss Side. Although her birth {{certificate}} states otherwise, she believed that her birthday was a day earlier, on Bastille Day – 14 July. Most biographies, including those written by her daughters, repeat this claim. Feeling a kinship with the female revolutionaries who stormed the Bastille, she said in 1908: [...] "I have always thought that <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was born on}} that day {{had some kind of}} influence over my life." [...] The reason for the discrepancy remains unclear.|$|E

And civilised people sense the fact. In my work {{there is nothing that}} can surprise or disconcert, except <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a savage in spite of myself.

500|$|The final debates were nasty, and Holtzman in {{particular}} constantly attacked Ferraro's integrity and finances. In an unusual election-eve television broadcast, Ferraro talked about [...] "the ethnic slur that I am {{somehow or other}} connected to organized crime. There's lots of innuendo but no proof. However, it is made plausible because of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am an Italian-American. This tactic comes from the poisoned well of fear and stereotype..." [...] On the , 1992, primary, Abrams edged out Ferraro by less than a percentage point, winning 37percent of the vote to 36percent, with Sharpton and Holtzman well behind. Ferraro did not concede she had lost for two weeks.|$|E

Editor Chris Crain attracted his own criticism from many in the gay community for this decision, due to Gannon's history of anti-gay reporting as well as Gannon's refusal to disclose his sexual orientation. He has said, “My personal life is a private matter, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have become a public person.” Crain defended his decision in a September 2005 editorial and claimed the [...] "steady stream of feedback/vitriol" [...] had declined [...] "a little" [...] with each new Gannon article.|$|E

Kennedy asked the Massachusetts electorate whether he should stay in office or resign; after getting a favorable response in messages sent to him, Kennedy announced on July 30 that he would remain in the Senate and run for re-election the next year.|$|E
500|$|The {{defending}} champion was seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry who defeated O'Sullivan 9–6 in last year's final. Hendry was still angry at his loss at the Grand Prix to McCulloch, explaining, [...] "The way I {{felt at the}} Grand Prix was down to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know what I'm still capable of". The total prize fund was £200,000 and the host broadcaster was Eurosport. O'Sullivan was considered the favourite, with his mentor Ray Reardon saying [...] "Ronnie {{is in the form}} of his life and looks very close to being unstoppable at the moment". Although few top players reached the final eight in the Grand Prix, O'Sullivan said he would not be surprised if they performed well in this tournament.|$|E

[...] The following year, Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each {{former president}}, and it is likely that Truman's financial status {{played a role in the}} law's enactment. The one other living former president at the time, Herbert Hoover, also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Essay {{is to examine the}} {{establishment}} of the Yugoslav Truth and Reconciliation Commission and to draw some early conclusions on whether it will be capable of rendering <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would so desperately like my uncle to face. The first part will deal with the need for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, while the second part will outline and then comment on its basic documents. The assumption is that the reader is basically familiar with the work of similar commissions around the world and the text will therefore not attempt to repeat the literature on the subject...|$|R

[...] The record closes with [...] "When There's Nothing Left", which {{has been described as a}} [...] "crisp and clean 'love note' to God". The album was described as not being in the vein of the bubble gum pop variety rather evoking comparisons to the Christian pop songstresses Rachel Lampa and Jaci Velasquez.|$|E

[...] "I don't have any really good reason why it took so long other than <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was waiting for Michael Jackson's new album to come out," [...] Yankovic explained. Unfortunately for Yankovic, the new album hit several snags. On November 26, 1991, Michael Jackson's new album, Dangerous was released. After hearing the hit single [...] "Black or White," [...] Yankovic {{approached}} Jackson about a potential parody entitled [...] "Snack All Night." [...] Although Jackson was a big supporter of Yankovic's work, he felt that a parody might damage the song's message. Jackson told Yankovic that he could, if he wanted to, parody another song off his album, but just not [...] "Black or White".|$|E

DeWitt {{was given a}} recurring role in the season as Don's mistress, which lasted for six episodes. She initially felt out of place while playing out her character. DeWitt stated, [...] "They were {{at the end of}} casting, and hadn't found the right Midge yet. Originally they had a scene where she opens the door wearing a red kimono, and I remember thinking 'I'm not that', so I wasn’t sure I was right for the part. Maybe <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't this 'vamp' is what made Matt Weiner give me a shot."
