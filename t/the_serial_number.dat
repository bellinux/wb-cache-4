5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E
5|$|In {{celebration of}} the Millennium 2000, five million $2 bills were printed with the Millennium 2000 logo {{replacing}} the prefix of <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> normally found in other notes under general circulation.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in magnetic materials, magnetic particle inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The irregularities in the metal, in this case <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number,</b> cause the field to deform. When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light {{can be used to make}} it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.|$|E

5|$|Assigned <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 1440, the XSO2U-1 flew for {{the first}} time, as a landplane, in July 1939; its first flight as a {{seaplane}} took place that December. Flight testing of the SO2U showed that the aircraft lacked directional stability; {{the addition of a}} large ventral fin, connecting the rear of the float to the tail, helped to cure the problem.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944 {{the prisoners}} had counterfeited {{the reverse of}} the dollar, and the obverse by January 1945. Twenty samples of the $100 note were produced—without <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number,</b> whose {{algorithm}} was still being examined—and shown to Himmler and banking experts. The standard of engraving and printing was considered excellent, although the paper used was technically inferior to the genuine notes.|$|E

5|$|Progress M1-5, {{which had}} {{originally}} been built to resupply and refuel either Mir or the International Space Station, was selected to perform the deorbit manoeuvre. Its mission earned it the nickname Hearse. It was a Progress-M1 11F615A55 spacecraft, with <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 254. An uninhabited area of the southern Pacific Ocean was selected for the station to be deorbited into, as had been done with five earlier Salyut spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The $500 {{denomination}} {{was first}} issued with red {{as the main}} colour in 2001. The 2003-dated versions were brown.

5|$|In October 1939, the Director General of Medical Services (DGMS), Major General Rupert Downes, tapped Burston for {{the post}} of Assistant Director of Medical Services (ADMS) of the 6th Division. Burston officially joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 13 October 1939 with the rank of colonel, and {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> VX2 (VX1 being Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey). When I Corps was formed in April 1940, Burston was appointed to its staff as Deputy Director of Medical Services (DDMS). As such, {{he was promoted to}} Brigadier on 1 July 1940.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the Australian Army's director general of medical services, Major General Rupert Downes tapped Fairley as consulting physician. Fairley was seconded to the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) with the rank of colonel on 15 July 1940 and given <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> VX38970. He joined the AIF Headquarters in Cairo in September, taking advantage of the initial quiet period to familiarise himself with the AIF's medical units and their commanders. As the British Army in the Middle East had no consulting physician in tropical diseases, Fairley accepted an offer to act in this capacity as well.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939, Mackay was ranked seventh on the army's seniority list. Following formation of a second infantry division for the Second Australian Imperial Force in 1940, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey was elevated to command of the newly created I Corps. Mackay was selected to command the 7th Division {{on the advice of}} General Sir Brudenell White but Cabinet, after consulting with Blamey, switched this appointment to the 6th Division. Mackay assumed command on 4 April 1940, receiving <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> NX363, and sailed from Melbourne for the Middle East on the ocean liner RMS Strathaird on 15 April.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} flying as Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was {{a commercial}} Boeing 747-230B. The jet first flew on January 28, 1972, and was delivered on March 17, 1972, with <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> CN20559/186 and registration HL7442 (formerly D-ABYH operated by Condor). The aircraft departed Gate 15 of John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City on August 30, 1983, bound for Gimpo International Airport in Gangseo District, Seoul, 35 minutes behind its {{scheduled departure time}} of 23:50 EDT (03:50 UTC, August 31). The flight was carrying 246 passengers and 23 crew members. After refueling at Anchorage International Airport in Anchorage, Alaska, the aircraft, piloted on this leg of the journey by captain Chun Byung-in, first officer Son Dong-hui and Flight Engineer Kim Eui-dong, departed for Seoul at 04:00 AHDT (13:00UTC) on August 31, 1983.|$|E

While an accurate print run has never been disclosed by the BEP (as the figures were combined with the intaglio runs), estimates are 1,920,000 notes for <b>the</b> B-L <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> block for <b>the</b> FRBNY, and 640,000 for <b>the</b> F-* <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> block for FRBA.|$|R
50|$|A common {{approach}} to prevent predictable <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> attacks {{is to use}} a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-2 to generate <b>the</b> actual <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> Internally, <b>the</b> issuing organization creates a (pseudo-)random nonce as a salt for generating <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>numbers,</b> and keeps it secret. The issuer increments their internal <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> and appends it to the salt, and the computed message digest is used to create <b>the</b> actual <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b> <b>The</b> issuer does have to take care to prevent collisions between existing values so as not to wrongly issue two identical <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Smoking Man {{meets with}} the Syndicate, who are {{responsible}} for the bees. Soon afterward a swarm of bees attacks a school in Columbia, South Carolina, and one of the teachers dies as a result. Skinner heads to the hospital, where he is met by Covarrubias. She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier for some sort of experiment. Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been working against him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder turns in the gun with <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder. That night Skinner confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will die if he kills him and Skinner leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder what he wants to hear while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone.|$|E
25|$|In the new series, {{there are}} two codes, like in the first series. They are the printer code in the top right hand corner and <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b> Part of <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> is {{horizontal}} {{and part of it}} is vertical. <b>The</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> begins with a letter indicating the printer, which is broadly similar to the first series (Z for Belgium, Y for Greece, etc.). The second letter of the new serial numbers is part of <b>the</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> itself, and has no further significance.|$|E
