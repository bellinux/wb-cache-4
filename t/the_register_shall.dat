The authors concluded that the study of value-sensitive gender awareness is to provide its control and referential function in relation to other registers of consciousness and gender practices. Control functions are associated with the establishment of standards, frames, rules. Referential function relate to the provision of freedom of choice and information required for meaningful interaction with gender environment. The article pointed out that the impact of value register takes place on the basis of such regulatory incentives, as a punishment, encouraging, establishing the terms of activity, competitive situations that reduce intrinsic motivation, denying feelings of self-determination and competence. The author also noted that the impact referential promotes gender competence and confidence in legitimirovannosti relevant gender practices. In each gender culture are the relations of power and subordination, which are caused, first of all, the domination of those or other entities in the value register of gender consciousness.

5000|$|The [...] "Federalism Reform", {{which became}} {{effective}} on 1 September 2006, has moved the legislation for resident registration {{to the federal}} level. The Federal Ministry of the Interior was preparing a federal law to replace the state laws on resident registration which scheduled to get effective by 2010. The new law would assign that a Federal Resident <b>Register</b> (Bundesmelderegister) <b>shall</b> be created to be run in parallel with <b>the</b> local resident <b>registers.</b> <b>The</b> nationwide <b>register</b> <b>shall</b> assemble a number of personal identifying information drawing from multiple sources including resident registers, civil registers and taxation offices. During a scandal with list brokers obtaining large amounts of addresses from catalog selling company databases in 2008, the coalition split up over the question — Brigitte Zypries (SPD) opposed the plans of the ministry of interior led by Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU). She proposed that the current local registration offices should be networked instead. In the new government of CDU and FDP the plans are blocked, as such a central database is in clear opposition to the FDP's aim to increase data privacy.|$|R

40|$|Art. 48 of the Italian Constitution grants {{right to}} vote {{to men and women}} without any difference, {{according}} to art. 3. 1, which enshrines the principle of equality and the prohibition of discrimination based on “sex, race, language, religion, political opinion, personal and social conditions”. The right to be elected is established by art. 56. 3 Cost. for the Camera dei Deputati and by art. 58. 1 Cost. for the Senato della Repubblica, without any reference to the sex of the candidates. In Italy, the {{right to vote}} was established early, on occasion of the vote for the institutional referendum of the 2 nd June 1946; differently, the right to be elected has been the result of a long and hard-fought struggle and the recognition of the right to be elected for Italian women needed the proactive contribution of the State, according to the second part of art. 3 Cost. : “It is the duty of the Republic to remove the economic and social obstacles which by limiting the freedom and equality of citizens, prevent the full development of the human person and the effective participation of all workers in the political, economic and social organization of the country”. Italian women had to fight a lot to seat in Parliament. Only after the 2003 constitutional reform of art. 51 Cost., which establishes that “citizens of either sex are eligible for public offices and for elective positions on equal terms”, and “the Republic shall adopt specific measures to promote equal opportunities between women and men”, in conjunction with case law of the Italian Constitutional Court (especially judgments n. 49 / 2003 and n. 4 / 2010), women’s right to be elected was recognized in the Italian system.

40|$|M. Cur. (Nursing Education) Nursing {{education}} is a process requlrlng the cooperation of all the parties involved. The student nurse receives lectures on the theoretical aspects, at the college while {{the substance of the}} theory must be based on and interpreted in the clinical field. With the passage of time the student nurse finds expression, gains the necessary experience and thus becomes a member of the nursing profession. Internalization of the norms and values of the professional group takes place {{within the framework of the}} student nurse's behavioral patterns and self image. The student nurse enters the profession with fixed expectations regarding her participation and training. In general terms she is still regarded as young and immature and yet she is expected to assume responsibilities which few in the general public are ever required to take. The prerequisites for the successful! professional socialization and the acquisition of proficiency in the functions and tasks of nursing, are based on continuous and optimal accompaniment of the student nurse by her registered counterpart, who operates as an independent professional practitioner. Clinical accompaniment implies that <b>the</b> <b>registered</b> nurse <b>shall</b> be at the side of the student nurse to guide her every step of the way in order to support her in the learning process, or to refine skills she previously acquired. : A descriptive exploratory survey was undertaken by means of a questionnaire submitted to student nurses and registered nurses of hospitals affiliated with one college in the Transvaal. The aim of the study was "to establish whether, and to what extent, the training function of the ward sister is realized in practice. Analysis of the data showed the ward sister to be aware of her training function and her responsibility towards the student nurse as learner. It appears that the ward sister believes herself to be adequately involved with the basic care of patients and making a significant contribution to the training of student· nurses. However, the observations and the experience of the student nurse differ from this point of view. She is of the opinion that more can be done in the ward to help her achieve her training needs. The fact that in many cases she is primarily considered as a worker, comes as a great disappointment...|$|R
