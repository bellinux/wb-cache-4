5|$|In the {{subsequent}} off-season, Cloutier's remaining year {{on his contract}} was bought out by <b>the</b> <b>Kings</b> on June 21, 2008.

However, the NHL ruled in favour of the Kings; the buyout stood and Cloutier became an unrestricted free agent. Consequently, he received $2 {{million over the next}} two years from <b>the</b> <b>Kings.</b>|$|E
