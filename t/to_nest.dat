5|$|Apatosaurus louisae {{was named}} by Holland in 1916, being first known from a partial {{skeleton}} {{that was found}} in Utah. The holotype is CM3018, with referred specimens including CM3378, CM11162, and LACM52844. The former two consist of a vertebral column; the latter two consist of a skull and a nearly complete skeleton, respectively. Apatosaurus louisae specimens all come from the late Kimmeridgian of Dinosaur National Monument. In 2015 Tschopp etal. found the type specimen of Apatosaurus laticollis <b>to</b> <b>nest</b> closely with CM3018, meaning the former is likely a junior synonym of A.louisae.|$|E
50|$|Several cavity-nesting birds, {{including}} the common starling, use yarrow <b>to</b> line their <b>nests.</b> Experiments {{conducted on the}} tree swallow, which does not use yarrow, suggest that adding yarrow <b>to</b> <b>nests</b> inhibits the growth of parasites.|$|R
40|$|The {{class of}} Archimax copulas is {{generalized}} <b>to</b> <b>nested</b> and hierarchical Archimax copulas in several ways. First, nested extreme-value copulas or nested stable tail dependence functions are introduced <b>to</b> construct <b>nested</b> Archimax copulas {{based on a}} single frailty variable. Second, a hierarchical construction of d-norm generators is presented to construct hierarchical stable tail dependence functions and thus hierarchical extreme-value copulas. Moreover, one can, by itself or additionally, introduce <b>nested</b> frailties <b>to</b> extend Archimax copulas <b>to</b> <b>nested</b> Archimax copulas {{in a similar way}} as nested Archimedean copulas extend Archimedean copulas. Further results include a general formula for the density of Archimax copulas...|$|R

5|$|Bee-eaters may nest {{as single}} pairs, loose colonies or dense colonies. Smaller species tend <b>to</b> <b>nest</b> solitarily, while {{medium-sized}} bee-eaters have small colonies, and larger and migratory species nest in large colonies that can {{number in the}} thousands. In some instances, colonies may contain more than one species of bee-eater. In species that nest gregariously, breeding pairs may be assisted by up to five helpers, These birds may alternate between breeding themselves and helping in successive years.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to Southern Florida as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the droppings of birds and other animals that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds <b>to</b> <b>nest</b> in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following Hurricane Andrew, scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E
5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, forcing them <b>to</b> <b>nest</b> {{closer to the}} surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E

5|$|Habitat {{enhancements}} used {{to increase}} the breeding success of terns include floating nest platforms for black, common and Caspian terns, and artificial islands created {{for a number of}} different species. More specialised interventions include providing nest boxes for roseate terns, which normally nest in the shelter of tallish vegetation, and using artificial eelgrass mats to encourage common terns <b>to</b> <b>nest</b> in areas not vulnerable to flooding.|$|E
5|$|Island {{restoration}} techniques, {{pioneered by}} New Zealand, enable {{the removal of}} exotic invaders from increasingly large islands. Feral cats {{have been removed from}} Ascension Island, Arctic foxes from many islands in the Aleutian Islands, and rats from Campbell Island. The removal of these introduced species has led to increases in numbers of species under pressure and even the return of extirpated ones. After the removal of cats from Ascension Island, seabirds began <b>to</b> <b>nest</b> there again {{for the first time in}} over a hundred years.|$|E
5|$|It {{undertakes}} seasonal {{movements in}} response to the availability of water and food. African birds move southwards in the southern summer to breed and return north in the winter, and Asian populations are highly nomadic due to the variability of rainfall. This species has strong colonising tendencies, having expanded its range in Mexico, the US and the West Indies in recent decades. Wandering birds can turn up far beyond the normal range, sometimes staying <b>to</b> <b>nest,</b> as in Morocco, Peru and Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|Shorebirds, pelicans, and gulls {{stop over}} at the refuge en route <b>to</b> their Spring <b>nesting</b> grounds. Plovers, avocets, stilts, ibis, and {{endangered}} least terns nest on the refuge during the spring and summer. Whooping cranes stop over on their way north <b>to</b> <b>nesting</b> areas.|$|R

50|$|Females tend <b>to</b> {{build their}} <b>nests</b> at high locations. This {{may be in}} order <b>to</b> {{minimize}} the <b>nestâ€™s</b> exposure <b>to</b> parasites and predators. This may also be <b>to</b> avoid <b>nest</b> usurpation by other female A. manicatum.|$|R
5|$|Juveniles {{begin to}} court {{at a very}} early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key {{behaviors}} of courting. Once paired, they tend <b>to</b> <b>nest</b> together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.|$|E
5|$|Native trumpeter (Cygnus buccinator) and tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) and {{non-native}} mute swans (Cygnus olor) may all {{be found}} on the lake in winter. Tundra swans are absent in summer as they migrate to the arctic and subarctic <b>to</b> <b>nest,</b> however, the non-native, Eurasian mute swans compete for habitat with the non-migrating trumpeter swan population and is an impediment to restoration of the native trumpeters around the Great Lakes. Additional native birds hosted by the lake include cardinals, blue jays, finches, orioles, woodpeckers, teal, mallards, resident and migratory Canada geese, and an occasional bald eagle.|$|E
5|$|This {{is because}} land birds in high {{northern}} latitudes, where food becomes scarce in winter, leave for areas further south (including the Southern Hemisphere) to overwinter, {{and because the}} continental landmass is much larger in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the Southern Hemisphere {{are more likely to}} migrate. This is because there is a large area of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere, and more islands suitable for seabirds <b>to</b> <b>nest.</b>|$|E
