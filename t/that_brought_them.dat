5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere {{and several of}} its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter {{and the amount of}} polar flattening.|$|E
5|$|Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} South Sandwich Islands. There {{was a heavy}} swell, such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with water. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan {{at the end of}} January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> {{to the edge of the}} pack ice on 4 February.|$|E
5|$|The koala is {{featured}} in the Dreamtime stories and mythology of indigenous Australians. The Tharawal people believed that the animal helped row the boat <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> to the continent. Another myth tells of how a tribe killed a koala and used its long intestines to create a bridge for people {{from other parts of}} the world. This narrative highlights the koala's status as a game animal and the length of its intestines. Several stories tell of how the koala lost its tail. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the koala for being lazy and greedy. Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the koala as a wise animal and sought its advice. Bidjara-speaking people credited the koala for turning barren lands into lush forests. The animal is also depicted in rock carvings, though not as much as some other species.|$|E

25|$|Starting from 1897, the Japanese began a road {{building}} program <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> into the indigenous people's territory. This {{was seen as}} invasive. Contacts and conflicts escalated and some indigenous people were killed. In 1901, in a battle with the Japanese, indigenous people defeated 670 Japanese soldiers. As a result of this, in 1902, the Japanese isolated Musha.|$|E

A small relief force arrived in Apia on 3 April 1915 and the troopship <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> to Samoa transported {{the last of the}} SEF back to New Zealand. Logan remained and would continue to administer the country on behalf of the New Zealand Government until 1919. His term was controversial for he significantly mishandled the arrival of the influenza pandemic in November 1918, resulting in over 7,500 deaths.|$|E
25|$|In early 1960, {{the trio}} began a tour <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> to Boston, San Francisco (at Jazz Workshop club), and Chicago (at the Sutherland Lounge). After {{returning}} in February, the band {{performed at the}} New York City Hall, and then settled at Birdland, Count Basie's headquarters. While the trio did not produce any studio records in 1960, two bootleg recordings from radio broadcasts from April and May were illegally released, something that infuriated Evans. Later, they would be posthumously issued as The 1960 Birdland Sessions.|$|E
25|$|Women in {{polygamous}} relationships at {{the time}} described the experience as a great trial that taught them self-denial. Many were protestant converts and believed that their suffering helped to purify them. Even when the practice was established, {{it was not always}} accepted. Mothers discouraged their daughters from entering into plural relationships. For many, the decision to accept polygamy and practice it was an agonizing and difficult process <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> closer to God. Some women did not accept polygamy at first and had to pray about, study, and question the practice before receiving an answer from God and accepting it. Elizabeth Graham MacDonald saw polygamy as a form of discipline that taught her subordination to God and her family.|$|E

25|$|As {{the first}} MiGs were 20km out and {{approaching}} from the west, Amos Amir led his four aircraft in a 270° climbing turn <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> on a westerly heading. They had, however, turned too tightly. Instead of drawing the MiGs westward, {{they were now}} facing them head-on. As the Mirages were {{closing in on the}} MiGs, the four Phantoms were approaching the area at low altitude and at a line abreast. The original plan had called for the Phantoms to zip in from below, behind and beneath the MiG-21s pursuing the Mirages, and pick them off with their radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrows. This was now no longer possible and as the Phantoms entered the fray, a close-quarters dogfight commenced.|$|E

Their black Flag, under which they had committed abundance of Pyracies and Murders, was affix'd to one Corner of the Gallows. It had in it the Portraiture of Death, with an Hour-Glass in one Hand, and a Dart in the other, striking into a Heart, and three Drops of Blood delineated as falling from it. This Flag they called Old Roger, and us'd to say, They would live and die under it.|$|E
25|$|The Beaver Wars (also {{known as}} the French and Iroquois Wars) {{continued}} intermittently for nearly a century, ending with the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. The French under Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons founded settlements at Port Royal and Samuel de Champlain three years later at Quebec City, quickly joining pre-existing aboriginal alliances <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> into conflict with other indigenous inhabitants. Champlain joined a Huron–Algonquin alliance against the Iroquois Confederacy (Five/Six Nations). In the first battle, superior French firepower rapidly dispersed a massed groups of aboriginals. The Iroquois changed tactics by integrating their hunting skills and intimate knowledge of the terrain with their use of firearms obtained from the Dutch; they developed a highly effective form of guerrilla warfare, and were soon a significant threat to all but the handful of fortified cities. Furthermore, the French gave few guns to their aboriginal allies.|$|E

25|$|Relations {{continued}} to deteriorate during 1663 and early 1664. Charles faced {{the same problem}} {{that his father had}} faced: financial arrangements that kept hm short of money. Parliament had voted him a seemingly generous grant from the customs and excise duties for life, but his financial needs were greater, and he consequently constantly sought additional sources of income. The chartered companies, like the EIC and the RAC, looked promising in this respect, but their profitability depended on a rather predatory method of doing business <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> in conflict with (especially) their Dutch competitors, the VOC and the WIC. The EIC was no match for the VOC, but the WIC was in its turn weaker than the RAC. The latter company managed in 1664 to conquer most of the trading posts of the WIC in West Africa, while in the same year an English expedition, outfitted by the Duke of York, Charles' brother, captured the WIC colony of New Netherland. These acts of war happened in peacetime. The English were confident that the Dutch, because of their supposed internal divisions, would not react forcefully. Again this was a miscalculation. De Witt ordered Vice-Admiral De Ruyter, who was at the time cruising in the Mediterranean, to retake the WIC forts (even though the WIC was supposed to handle its own affairs; in a way by involving the Dutch navy, De Witt was therefore raising the stakes in the conflict).|$|E
