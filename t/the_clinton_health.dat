5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> care plan, was a 1993 {{healthcare}} reform package {{proposed by the}} administration of President Bill Clinton and {{closely associated with the}} chair of the task force devising the plan, First Lady of the United States Hillary Clinton.|$|E
25|$|In late November 1993, {{the bill}} for <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> care plan of 1993 was {{introduced}} in the Congress and made publicly available. The Wall Street Journal then published an op-ed by McCaughey in which said she had pored over the entire bill and concluded that it had price controls that would cause rationing, and the bill was dangerous.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> {{care plan}} {{remains the most}} {{prominent}} national proposal associated with Hillary Clinton and may have influenced her prospects in the 2008 presidential election. There are some similarities between Clinton's plan and Republican Mitt Romney's health care plan, which has been implemented in Massachusetts, though Romney has since distanced himself from Clinton on the issue, in particular arguing that his plan calls for more control {{at the state level}} and the private market, not from the federal government.|$|E

50|$|As {{a part of}} {{the fallout}} from <b>the</b> failed 1993 <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> care plan, both Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy and <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{administration}} were looking for smaller initiatives for publicly funded health care that could gain bipartisan support.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{administration}} in 1993, the group began changing from being a nonpartisan grassroots organization to being a direct player in Democratic Party politics. [...] Citizen Action argued publicly for single-payer health care, but behind the scenes worked to support the managed competition proposals of <b>the</b> 1993 <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> care plan as the only feasible approach. [...] This created some unhappiness among members and aligned organizations.|$|R
25|$|To achieve this, <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> plan {{required}} each US {{citizen and}} permanent resident alien to become {{enrolled in a}} qualified health plan {{on his or her}} own or through programs mandated to be offered by businesses with more than 5,000 full-time employees. Subsidies were to be provided to those too poor to afford coverage, including complete subsidies for those below a set income level. Users would choose plans offered by regional health alliances to be established by each state. These alliances would purchase insurance coverage for the state's residents and could set fees for doctors who charge per procedure. The act provided funding to be sent to the states for the administration of the plan, beginning at $14 billion in 1993 and reaching $38 billion in 2003.|$|E
500|$|As a protégé of House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, Hastert rose {{through the}} Republican ranks in the House, and in 1995 (after the Republicans gained control of the House and Newt Gingrich became Speaker), Hastert became chief deputy whip.

500|$|Republicans made <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> {{care plan}} a major {{campaign}} {{issue of the}} 1994 midterm elections. Republicans saw {{a net gain of}} fifty-three seats in the House election and seven in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be {{a major factor in the}} Democrats' defeat, especially among independent voters. The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton's role in shaping policy. Opponents of universal health care would continue to use [...] "Hillarycare" [...] as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.|$|E

5000|$|Morris' {{funding to}} NET was {{extremely}} small. A March 1994 internal strategy document by Morris revealed that it spent only $200,000 {{to help fund}} NET. One proposed miniseries would 'focus on debunking the myths of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> plan and <b>the</b> use of excises to fund such a plan, and to investigate more market-driven alternatives". [...] Morris planned another miniseries critiquing <b>the</b> proposed <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> care plan, {{as a part of}} a broad-based effort by health care providers and businesses of all types to stop the nationalization of American health care.|$|R
500|$|In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary {{to chair}} a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to {{replicate}} the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform. Unconvinced regarding {{the merits of the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority. The recommendation of the task force became known as <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as [...] "Hillarycare" [...] and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress. Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Kennedy secured an {{increase}} in the minimum wage law, which was one of his favorite issues; there would not be another increase for ten years. [...] Following the failure of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> care plan, Kennedy went against his past strategy and sought incremental measures instead. Kennedy worked with Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum to create and pass the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996, which set new marks for portability of insurance and confidentiality of records. The same year, Kennedy's Mental Health Parity Act forced insurance companies to treat mental health payments the same as others with respect to limits reached. In 1997, Kennedy was the prime mover behind the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which used increased tobacco taxes to fund the largest expansion of taxpayer-funded health insurance coverage for children in the U.S. since Medicaid began in the 1960s. [...] Senator Hatch and Hillary Clinton also played major roles in SCHIP passing.|$|E

25|$|Until the Affordable Healthcare for America Act, a {{combination}} of factors kept health care {{off the top of the}} agenda.

40|$|People {{enrolled}} in Medicare {{account for more}} than one-third of all outpatient prescription drug expenditures in the United States. That being the case, a proposed prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program would insure a substantial part of the market and would create the largest expansion of the program in the past 20 years.

Charles N. Kahn III, a Republican who was executive vice president of the Health Insurance Association in 1993 and 1994, refers to his previous battles with Clinton as [...] "ancient history," [...] and says [...] "she is extremely knowledgeable about health care and has become a Congressional leader on the issue." ...|$|E

[...] Yet <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> care plan of 1993, formulated by a task force led by First Lady Hillary Clinton, was unable to pass {{in part due to}} the filibuster. [...] As early as April 1993, a memo to the task force noted that [...] "While the substance is obviously controversial, there is apparently great disquiet in the Capitol over whether we understand the interactivity between reconciliation and health, procedurally, and in terms of timing and counting votes for both measures...." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1993, Bill Clinton {{appointed}} {{her as the}} United States Surgeon General, {{making her}} the first African American and the second woman (following Antonia Novello) to hold the position. She was a controversial choice and a strong backer of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> care plan, so she was not confirmed until September 7, 1993. [...] As Surgeon General, Elders quickly established {{a reputation for being}} controversial. Like many of the Surgeons General before her, she was an outspoken advocate of a variety of health-related causes. She argued for an exploration of the possibility of drug legalization, and backed the distribution of contraceptives in schools. President Clinton stood by Elders, saying that she was misunderstood.|$|E

2500|$|McCaughey's [...] "No Exit" [...] {{article was}} quickly used by {{conservative}} officials and commentators seeking {{to discredit the}} Clinton plan. Senator Bob Dole, in the Republican Party response to the President's State of the Union, used some of McCaughey's arguments of fewer choices, lower quality, and more government control. Bill Kristol's Project for the Republican Future quickly launched television advertisements featuring quotes from McCaughey's two Wall Street Journal op-ed columns and her The New Republic article. Newsweek columnist George Will used McCaughey's writings {{as a basis for}} predicting that <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> plan would kill patients and make it illegal for patients to pay doctors directly for care, with 15-year jail terms for patients who tried to do so.|$|E
2500|$|One often-cited {{provision}} of the un-passed bill would have authorized Medicare reimbursement for physicians who provide voluntary counseling about such subjects as living wills. The provision {{is based on a}} separate bill that was cosponsored by Republican Charles Boustany of Louisiana, a surgeon, and is similar to end-of-life counseling signed by President George W. Bush. This [...] section was criticized by some Republicans and conservatives such as Betsy McCaughey, a lobbyist for the healthcare industry who also helped to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> care plan of 1993. These critics allege that it includes mandatory language aimed at pressing elderly and disabled patients toward euthanasia. Their interpretation was the basis for the charge about this section by prominent Republican 2008 Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin.|$|E

5000|$|Health {{care reform}} {{was a major}} concern of <b>the</b> Bill <b>Clinton</b> {{administration}} headed up by First Lady Hillary <b>Clinton.</b> <b>The</b> 1993 <b>Clinton</b> <b>health</b> care plan included mandatory enrollment in a health insurance plan, subsidies to guarantee affordability across all income ranges, {{and the establishment of}} health alliances in each state. Every citizen or permanent resident would thus be guaranteed medical care. The bill faced withering criticism by Republicans, led by William Kristol, who communicated his concern that a Democratic health care bill would [...] "revive the reputation of... Democrats as the generous protector of middle-class interests. And it will at the same time strike a punishing blow against Republican claims to defend the middle class by restraining government." [...] The bill was not enacted into law.|$|R
