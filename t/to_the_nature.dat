5|$|Dualism {{is a set}} {{of views}} about the {{relationship}} between mind and matter (or body). It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical. One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance). Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the mind.|$|E
5|$|Eric Henry Stoneley Burhop {{was born}} in Hobart, Tasmania, on 31 January 1911, the third child of two Salvation Army officers, Henry Augustus Burhop and his wife Bertha née Head. He had two older sisters, Edna and Vera. His family was not wealthy, and they moved {{frequently}} owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of his parents' evangelical work. The family moved to Ballarat in 1923, where he attended Ballarat High School {{for most of his}} secondary education, receiving his leaving (Year 11) certificate in 1926.

5|$|Malagasy farmers {{continue}} to use fire to clear out agricultural land and pasture for livestock, promoting grass growth while inhibiting forest regeneration.
