500|$|The VR {{training}} mode {{from the}} original Metal Gear Solid has been expanded into 300 stages, which are now stored on a separate third disc known as the [...] "VR Disc". These new set of missions are divided into four main categories: Sneaking, Weapons, Advanced and Special. The first three categories feature standard training exercises that tests the player's sneaking, shooting and combat skills, while the fourth category contains less conventional tests involving murder mysteries, giant genome soldiers and flying saucers. One particular set of missions has the player controlling the Cyborg Ninja, unlocked by either completing a minigame on the PocketStation and uploading the data to the VR Disc or by achieving the Fox rank on the main game. Completing all 300 missions will unlock a concept artwork of Metal Gear RAY, a mech that would later appear in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. Additional content include preview trailers of Metal Gear Solid from <b>trade</b> <b>events</b> and a photoshoot mode where the player can take photographs of fully expressive polygonal models of Mei Ling and Dr. Naomi after completing the main game.
