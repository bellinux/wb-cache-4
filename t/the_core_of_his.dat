5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely at <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. This portion of the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 {{was taken from the}} trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E
5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of {{people who work for}} him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E
5|$|From his {{experiences}} on board Belgica and Gjøa, Amundsen {{had learned the}} importance on long voyages of stable and compatible companions, and with these experienced personnel {{he felt he had}} <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> expedition. He continued to recruit through 1909; the Fram party would eventually total 19. All of these except one were Amundsen's personal choices; the exception was Hjalmar Johansen, who was taken on at the request of Nansen. Since his epic march with Nansen, Johansen had been unable to settle down. Despite the efforts of Nansen and others to help him, his life became a spiral of drink and indebtedness. Nansen wished to give his former comrade a final chance to show that he was still a capable worker in the field; feeling that he could not refuse Nansen's wishes, Amundsen reluctantly accepted Johansen. The party contained two foreigners: a young Russian oceanographer Alexander Kuchin (or Kutchin), who was a pupil of Bjorn Helland-Hansen, and a Swedish engineer, Knut Sundbeck.|$|E

5|$|Zahir's initial {{military}} forces consisted of his Zaydani kinsmen {{and the local}} inhabitants of the areas he ruled. They numbered about 200 men in the early 1720s, but grew to about 1,500 in the early 1730s. During this early period of Zahir's career, he also had the key military backing of the Bani Saqr and other Bedouin tribes. As he consolidated his hold over Galilee, his army rose to over 4,000 men, many of the later recruits being peasants who supported Zahir for protecting them against Bedouin raids. This suppression of the Bedouin in turn caused the tribes to largely withdraw their military backing of Zahir. <b>The</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> private army were the Maghrebi mercenaries. The Maghrebis' commander, Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, also served as Zahir's top military commander from 1735 until al-Dinkizli's defection during the Ottoman siege of Acre in 1775. From the time Zahir reconciled with Sheikh Nasif al-Nassar of Jabal Amil in 1768 until most of {{the remainder of his}} rule, Zahir also had the support of Nasif's roughly 10,000 Metawali cavalrymen. However, the Metawalis did not aid Zahir during the Ottoman offensive of 1775. Zahir's fortified villages and towns were equipped with artillery installments and his army's arsenal consisted of cannons, matchlock rifles, pistols and lances. Most of the firearms were imported from Venice or France, and by the early 1770s, from the Russian imperial navy.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{uncertainty}} surrounding his origins, {{it is possible}} that Fergus was of Norse-Gaelic and native Gallovdian ancestry. Traditionally, the Gallovidians appear to have looked towards the Isles instead of Scotland, and <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family's lands seems to have centred in valley of the river Dee and the coastal area around Whithorn, regions of substantial Scandinavian settlement.

25|$|During {{the first}} part of his operatic career (1733–1739), Rameau wrote his great masterpieces destined for the Académie royale de musique: three tragédies en musique and two opéra-ballets that still form <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> repertoire. After the {{interval}} of 1740 to 1744, he became the official court musician, and for the most part, composed pieces intended to entertain, with plenty of dance music emphasising sensuality and an idealised pastoral atmosphere. In his last years, Rameau returned to a renewed version of his early style in Les Paladins and Les Boréades.|$|E
25|$|In March 1891, a French force under Colonel Louis Archinard {{launched}} a direct attack on Kankan.

Despite victories against isolated French columns (for example at Dabadugu in September 1891), Ture failed to push the French from <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> kingdom. In June 1892, Col. Archinard's replacement, Humbert, leading a small, well-supplied force of picked men, captured Ture's capital of Bissandugu.

25|$|He {{picks up}} {{narratives}} left hanging from previous albums, magnifies recurring themes and takes signature production techniques to extremes.

Most importantly, though, through these devices, Nash reveals {{more and more of the}} contradictions and complexities at <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work: the instability generated by his obsessive examination of traditional R tropes – love, sex, money – from every possible angle; the frictions of his own fractured self-perception.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, {{with the}} craft of clowning {{seemingly}} neglected and {{with many of the}} clowns in their 50s, he established the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College.

Soon, he split the show into two touring units, Red and Blue, which could tour the country independently. The separate tours could also offer differing slates of acts and themes, enabling circus goers to view both tours where possible.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{synthesis}} of different schools of Jewish thought {{was rooted in}} his studies of the teachings of Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel (1525–1609) a scholar and mystic known as the Maharal of Prague. Various pillars of Hutner's thought system were likely {{the works of the}} Vilna Gaon, Rabbi Elijah, (1720–1797) and of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (1707–1746). He would only allude in the most general ways to other great mystics, in Hebrew mekubalim, such as the Baal Shem Tov (founder of Hasidism), the great mystic known as the Ari who lived in the late Middle Ages, the founder of Chabad Hasidism, the Baal HaTanya Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Leiner of Izbitz and many other great Hasidic masters {{as well as to the}} great works of Kabbalah such as the Zohar.|$|E

25|$|At <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{philosophy}} {{is a view}} of humanity as greater than the contexts {{in which it is}} placed. He sees each individual possessed of the capability to rise to a greater life. At the root of his social thought is the conviction that the world is made and imagined. His work begins from the premise that no natural social, political, or economic arrangements underlie individual or social activity. Property rights, liberal democracy, wage labor—for Unger, these are all historical artifacts that have no necessary relation to the goals of free and prosperous human activity. For Unger, the market, the state, and human social organization should not be set in predetermined institutional arrangements, but need to be left open to experimentation and revision according to what works for the project of individual and collective empowerment. Doing so, he holds, will enable human liberation.|$|E
25|$|Sharp {{taught and}} {{composed}} music. Because music pedagogy {{of his time}} originated from Germany and was entirely based on tunes from German folk music, Sharp, as a music teacher, {{became interested in the}} vocal and instrumental (dance) folk music of the British Isles, especially the tunes. He felt that speakers of English (and the other languages spoken in Britain and Ireland) ought to become acquainted with the patrimony of melodic expression that had grown up in the various regions there. He began collecting folk songs in 1903 when visiting his friend (and lyrics editor) Charles Marson in Hambridge, South Somerset. Over 1,600 tunes or texts were collected from 350 singers, and Sharp used these songs in his lectures and press campaign to urge the rescue of English folk song. Although Sharp collected songs from 15 other counties after 1907, the Somerset songs were <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> experience and theories.|$|E
25|$|In February 1905, Venizelos {{organised}} {{an assembly}} at Theriso {{with a group}} of seventeen other Cretan leaders who became <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> movement. At first they were joined by 300 armed Cretans who, although not posing a significant military threat, would prove very difficult to remove, hidden in the Theriso gorge. The impact of this act was important: within twenty days, some 7,000 sympathisers had flocked to Theriso. Venizelos chose the village of Theriso for its strategic position 14km from Chania, its naturally defenses at the foothills of the White Mountains, and its easy access to other villages and valleys, around Chania as well as toward Sfakia. The passage toward Theriso was defended by narrow gorges, easy for the insurgents to control. Moreover, these gorges concealed numerous grottoes and caverns that served as natural shelters for the insurgents who converged around Theriso. The village was already a symbol of resistance before 1905: in 1821, during the Greek War of Independence, several hundred Greeks there had routed an army of 21,000 Ottomans.|$|E
