He was known for his complicated relationship with the U.S., being described as being its ally and nemesis at the same time.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{alternative}} <b>outcome</b> {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of <b>the</b> unselected option in decision-making tasks, which has {{significant influence on}} <b>the</b> chosen <b>outcome</b> evaluation.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to find out factors that affect <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of {{patients}} with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) treated at king Khalid University Hospital (KKUH). Methods: The medical records of 30 consecutive patients with verified ruptured cerebral aneurysm treated at KKUH (1993 - 1996) were reviewed looking for factors that affect <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of surgery. Statistically significant factors were selected to design a scoring system for prediction of <b>the</b> <b>outcome.</b> Then we used the scoring system to predict <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of <b>the</b> next 40 patients (1997 - 2000) Results: The preoperative Hunt and Hess grade, amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in CT scan, aneurysm size and progressive hydrocephalus were the most significant factors that affect <b>the</b> <b>outcome.</b> There was significant association between the score value and <b>the</b> <b>outcome,</b> patients with low scores had negligible morbidity and mortality. Conclusion: The scoring system is simple, easily applicable and can be used to predict <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of patients with aneurysmal SAH with high degree of accuracy.
