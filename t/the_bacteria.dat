5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. <b>The</b> <b>bacteria</b> in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> to grow.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} <b>the</b> <b>bacteria,</b> sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E

50|$|Zooplankton {{can also}} {{act as a}} disease reservoir. Crustacean {{zooplankton}} {{have been found to}} house <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera, by allowing the cholera vibrios to attach to their chitinous exoskeletons. This symbiotic relationship enhances <b>the</b> <b>bacterium's</b> ability to survive in an aquatic environment, as the exoskeleton provides <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> with carbon and nitrogen.|$|R
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E

50|$|A simple example {{involves}} <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> Escherichia coli (E. coli), <b>the</b> {{best understood}} <b>bacterium.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bacterium</b> is grown on a growth media containing {{two types of}} sugars, {{one of which is}} easier to metabolize than the other (for example glucose and lactose). First, <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> will metabolize all the glucose, and grow at a higher speed. Eventually, when all the glucose has been consumed, <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> will begin <b>the</b> process of expressing the genes to metabolize the lactose. This will only occur when all glucose in the media has been consumed. For these reasons, diauxic growth occurs in multiple phases.|$|R
50|$|Following internalization, <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> must {{escape from}} the vacuole/phagosome before fusion with a {{lysosome}} can occur. Three main virulence factors that allow <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> to escape are listeriolysin O (LLO-encoded by hly) phospholipase A (encoded by plcA) and phospholipase B (plcB). Secretion of LLO and PlcA disrupts the vacuolar membrane and allows <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> to escape into the cytoplasm, where it may proliferate.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{that cause}} urinary tract infections {{typically}} enter the bladder via the urethra. However, infection may also occur via the blood or lymph. It {{is believed that}} <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> are usually transmitted to the urethra from the bowel, with females at greater risk due to their anatomy. After gaining entry to the bladder, E. Coli are able to attach to the bladder wall and form a biofilm that resists the body's immune response.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. <b>The</b> <b>bacteria</b> are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A and B. A and B are neutral alleles meaning {{that they do not}} affect the bacteria's ability to survive and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to survive and reproduce. Suppose that half <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus A and B each have allele frequency 1/2.|$|E

40|$|The {{swimming}} {{properties of}} an E. coli-type model bacterium are investigated by mesoscale hy- drodynamic simulations, combining molecular dynamics simulations of <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> with <b>the</b> multiparticle particle collision dynamics method for the embedding fluid. <b>The</b> <b>bacterium</b> is com- posed of a spherocylindrical body with attached helical flagella, built up from discrete particles for an efficient coupling with the fluid. We measure the hydrodynamic friction coefficients of <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> and find quantitative agreement with experimental results of swimming E. coli. The flow field of <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> shows a force-dipole-like {{pattern in the}} swimming plane and two vor- tices perpendicular to its swimming direction arising from counterrotation of the cell body and the flagella. By comparison with the flow field of a force dipole and rotlet dipole, we extract the force- dipole and rotlet-dipole strengths for <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> and find that counterrotation of the cell body and the flagella is essential for describing the near-field hydrodynamics of <b>the</b> <b>bacterium...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{filamentous}} <b>bacterium</b> Microthrix parvicella causes severe {{separation and}} foaming problems at {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs). An effective control of <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> in activated sludge WWTPs {{can be accomplished by}} dosage with polyaluminium chloride (PAX- 14). The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether addition of PAX- 14 affects surface properties such as the hydrophobicity of <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> and to study the exopolymers of M. parvicella that host surface-associated enzymes. To this end, force measurements by atomic force microscopy were carried out to measure the interactions between hydrophilic and hydrophobized tips and <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> surface. Addition of PAX- 14 caused no changes in the hydrophobicity of <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> surface but <b>the</b> data indicate that it collapsed the polymeric layer likely due to electrostatic screening.

5|$|Archaea are prokaryotic {{unicellular}} organisms, {{and form}} the first domain of life, in Carl Woese's three-domain system.

In 1990 the microbiologist Woese proposed the three-domain system that divided living things into bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, and thereby split the prokaryote domain.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{cultures}} are often performed {{in people with}} fever and evidence of acute infection. These yield <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> causing the infection in 36% of cases, usually after 24–48 hours of incubation. Bile, too, may be sent for culture during ERCP (see below). The most common bacteria linked to ascending cholangitis are gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli (25–50%), Klebsiella (15–20%) and Enterobacter (5–10%). Of the gram-positive cocci, Enterococcus causes 10–20%.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, Lyme {{disease is}} caused by <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> Borrelia burgdorferi. <b>The</b> surface {{lipoprotein}} VlsE can undergo recombination which results in antigenic diversity. <b>The</b> <b>bacterium</b> carries a plasmid that contains fifteen silent vls cassettes and one functional copy of vlsE.

Variety generated of the surface lipoprotein antigen allows <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> to evade <b>the</b> host humoral immune system.|$|R
5|$|Communication in {{the form}} of quorum sensing plays a role in the {{regulation}} of luminescence in many species of bacteria.

5|$|Cyathus helenae {{produces}} {{a series of}} diterpenoid chemical compounds known as cyathins, which have antibiotic properties against <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> Staphylococcus aureus. The capacity to produce cyathins—similar to C.striatus and C.africanus—is limited to haploid strains. The basic chemical structure of the cyathins, known as the cyathane skeleton, is chemically unique and has been investigated using carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR); molecules with this structure have also been created synthetically.|$|E

40|$|Characteristics of a capsulated {{bacterium}} {{isolated from}} an epizootic among goldfish (Carassius auratus) were determined {{as well as}} the ability of <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> to produce experimental infections. <b>The</b> <b>bacterium</b> was found to be a gram-negative rod which oxidized carbohydrates, produced green fluorescent pigment, and otherwise seemed to fit into the genus Pseudomonas, except that it was nonmotile and failed to oxidize gluconate. These last two characteristics are typical of pseudomonads. However, <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> was classified as a pseudomonad, best fitting the description of the nonmotile variety of Pseudomonas fluorescens. Goldfish and rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) were infected experimentally by injection, but not by being fed bacteria-laden food.
