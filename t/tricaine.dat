During the second experiment, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and respiratory irritants were evaluated. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were an organophosphate, Malathion and a carbamate, Carbaryl. The respiratory irritants were Acrolein and Benzaldehyde. In part {{three of the}} experiment series, polar narcotics phenol, 2,4-dimethylphenol, aniline, 2-chloroaniline and 4-chloroaniline were evaluated. In the last experiment, central nervous system seizure agents were analyzed. These included an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Chlorpyrifos; two pyrethroid insecticides, Fenvalerate and Cypermethrin; two cyclodiene insecticides, Endrin and Endosulfan; and a rodenticide, Strychnine. The duration of the exposure depended on the experiment, but the range was from 24 to 48 hours. Therefore, exposure resulted in acute toxicity. The Rainbow trout were exposed to a 24- to 48-hour lethal concentration of the toxicant. The respiratory and cardiovascular responses monitored throughout the exposure were cough rate, ventilation rate, ventilation volume, total oxygen consumption, oxygen utilization, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, arterial blood oxygen, arterial blood carbon dioxide, arterial blood pH, hematocrit, hemoglobin, electrocardiogram, plasma ions (calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and chloride), and osmolality. Pre-dose values were obtained prior to the exposure. The responses were measured at two-hour intervals throughout the exposure, except for blood parameters, which were measured every four to eight hours, and blood ions, which were measured just before death.|$|E

40|$|Fluorescein {{has been}} used for rapid and {{sensitive}} detection of fish skin and corneal ulceration. Effective use of the fluorescein test requires knowledge of conditions that might cause misleading interpretations or otherwise interfere with test reliability. Examination of fish health and the clinical workup often require <b>tricaine</b> {{as one of the most}} commonly used anesthetics. However, <b>tricaine</b> may interfere with correct interpretation of the fluorescein test and might also cause significant fish injury. The effects of <b>tricaine</b> exposure sequence on the fidelity of the fluorescein test was studied in Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis, walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma, and northern rock soles Lepidopsetta polyxystra by examining the fluorescence of experimentally induced epidermal wounding. <b>Tricaine</b> can quench fluorescence that is emitted by fluorescein retained in skin ulcers, causing a false-negative reaction. Thus, for the fluorescein test to work properly, it is important to avoid the exposure of fluorescein-treated and rinsed ulcers to <b>tricaine.</b> The effects of exposure to buffered versus unbuffered <b>tricaine</b> on epidermal and corneal integrity were studied in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus subjected to the fluorescein test and histological examination. Fluorescein could detect not only ulcers but also areas with only a partial loss of epithelium (i. e., erosion). The use of unbuffered <b>tricaine</b> to anesthetize these fish caused serious epidermal and corneal damage. If fish are euthanized with unbuffered <b>tricaine</b> for clinical workup, this severe epidermal or corneal damage could be misinterpreted as an antemortem lesion, leading to misdiagnosis. Even in water with alkalinity exceeding 50 mg/L as CaCO 3, it would seem prudent to always buffer <b>tricaine</b> with sodium bicarbonate to prevent a pH change that might lead to iatrogenic effects from unbuffered <b>tricaine.</b> Thus, current general recommendations suggesting that <b>tricaine</b> does not need to be buffered in waters with alkalinity greater than 50 mg/L might need to be modified...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effects of benzocaine and <b>tricaine</b> methanesulfonate on oxidative stress parameters of juvenile tambaqui tissues. Fish (n= 80) were anesthetized with benzocaine (100 mg L- 1) or <b>tricaine</b> (240 mg L- 1) and two control groups were used (non-anesthetized fish and fish exposed to ethanol-only). After anesthetic induction 10 fish/anesthetic were euthanized after 3, 12 and 24 hours post-anesthesia and tissue samplings (gills, liver and brain) were performed. Samples were submitted to analyses of enzyme activity glutathione-S-transferase (GST), cellular lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and total antioxidant capacity (ACAP). ACAP increased in gills of benzocaine treatment after 12 hours. The liver showed a reduction in ACAP of <b>tricaine</b> treatment after 12 hours. Both anesthetic treatments showed an increase of ACAP at 24 hours compared to control group. The activity of the GST enzyme increased in the gills for treatments benzocaine and <b>tricaine</b> after 3 and 12 hours. Liver showed increased GST activity (benzocaine after 24 hours and <b>tricaine</b> after 3 and 24 hours). Lipid damage decreased in gills (both anesthetics) and brain (<b>tricaine)</b> after 24 hours.

40|$|Movements {{in animals}} arise through concerted action of neurons and {{skeletal}} muscle. General anaesthetics prevent movement and cause {{loss of consciousness}} by blocking neural function. Anaesthetics of the amino amide-class are thought to act by blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. In fish, the commonly used anaesthetic <b>tricaine</b> methanesulphonate, also known as 3 -aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, metacaine or MS- 222, causes loss of consciousness. However, its role in blocking action potentials in distinct excitable cells is unclear, raising the possibility that <b>tricaine</b> could act as a neuromuscular blocking agent directly causing paralysis. Here we use evoked electrical stimulation to show that <b>tricaine</b> efficiently blocks neural action potentials, but does not prevent directly evoked muscle contraction. Nifedipine-sensitive L-type Cav channels affecting movement are also primarily neural, suggesting that muscle Nav channels are relatively insensitive to <b>tricaine.</b> These findings show that <b>tricaine</b> used at standard concentrations in zebrafish larvae does not paralyse muscle, thereby diminishing concern that a direct action on muscle could mask a lack of general anaesthesia...|$|E
40|$|The {{pros and}} cons of using {{anaesthesia}} when handling fish in connection with experiments are debated. A widely adopted practice is to wait thirty minutes after anaesthesia before behavioural observations are initiated, but information about immediate effects of a treatment is then lost. This is pertinent for responses to acute stressors, such as acid injection in the acetic acid pain test. However, omission of anaesthetics in order to obtain data on immediate responses will compromise the welfare of fish and contribute to experimental noise due to stress. We therefore tested the effect of <b>tricaine</b> methanesulfonate on the behaviour of zebrafish. We predicted that <b>tricaine</b> (MS 222) would decrease swimming velocity and that the control fish would show an increased level of anxiety- and stress-related behaviours compared to the <b>tricaine</b> group. Following acclimatization to the test tank, baseline behaviour was recorded before immersion in either <b>tricaine</b> (168 mg l 21, treatment group, N = 8) or tank water (control group, N = 7). Latencies to lose equilibrium and to lose response to touch were registered. The fish was then returned to the test tank, and the latency to regain equilibrium was registered in anaesthetized fish. When equilibrium was regained, and at five, thirty and sixty minutes after the fish had been returned to the test tank, behaviour was recorded. The <b>tricaine</b> fish showed the following responses (mean 6 sd) : latency to lose equilibrium 22. 6 s 63. 9; latency to lose response to touch 101. 9 s 626. 8; latency to regain equilibrium 92. 0 s 654. 4. Contrary to our predictions, neither treatment caused a change in any of the behaviours registered. This indicates that <b>tricaine</b> has n...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{advances}} in microscopy and genetic labeling strategies have created {{new opportunities for}} time-lapse imaging of embryonic development. However, methods for immobilizing embryos for long periods while maintaining normal development have changed little. In zebrafish, current immobilization techniques rely on the anesthetic <b>tricaine.</b> Unfortunately, prolonged <b>tricaine</b> treatment at concentrations high enough to immobilize the embryo produces undesirable side effects on development. We evaluate three alternative immobilization strategies: combinatorial soaking in <b>tricaine</b> and isoeugenol, injection of α-bungarotoxin protein, and injection of α-bungarotoxin mRNA. We find evidence for co-operation between <b>tricaine</b> and isoeugenol to give immobility with improved health. However, even in combination these anesthetics negatively affect long-term development. α-bungarotoxin is a small protein from snake venom that irreversibly binds and inactivates acetylcholine receptors. We find that α-bungarotoxin either as purified protein from snakes or endogenously expressed in zebrafish from a codon-optimized synthetic gene can immobilize embryos for {{extended periods of time}} with few health effects or developmental delays. Using α-bungarotoxin mRNA injection we obtain complete movies of zebrafish embryogenesis from the 1 -cell stage to 3 days post fertilization, with normal health and no twitching. These results demonstrate that endogenously expressed α-bungarotoxin provides unprecedented immobility and health for time-lapse microscopy...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the anesthetic efficacy and determine the lowest effective concentration in the guppy, Poecilia vivipara. Fishes were exposed to benzocaine, <b>tricaine</b> methanesulfonate and eugenol at three different concentrations. After induction, they were transferred to an aquarium free of anesthetic for evaluating their recovery time. At the lowest concentration of the three anesthetics (50  mg L− 1), fish did not reach complete induction. Time to accomplish a light sedation stage was significantly negative-related with concentration using <b>tricaine</b> (145  ±  13. 4  s with 50  mg L− 1 to 4. 7  ±  0. 7  s with 200  mg L− 1) and benzocaine (152. 8  ±  13  s with 50  mg L− 1 to 4. 0  ±  0. 9  s with 200  mg L− 1). For eugenol, significant differences were found between the lowest concentration, 50  mg L− 1 (241  ±  57. 6  s) with 100  mg L− 1 (13. 3  ±  3. 9  s) and 200  mg L− 1 (9. 5  ±  2. 6  s). Recovery times were significantly longer (P <  0. 05) with the increase of eugenol concentration from 100  mg L− 1 to 200  mg L− 1, with no differences found between the different concentrations of benzocaine and <b>tricaine.</b> Complete induction times were significantly greater (P <  0. 05) when using eugenol comparing with the other two anesthetic agents in fish exposed at the highest concentrations (200  mg L− 1). This parameter showed a great dispersion when using eugenol at this concentration. Three fish exposed to 200  mg L− 1 of eugenol did not recovered from the anesthetic after 180  s and presented ventilatory failure.

40|$|Investigating the {{physiological}} state of wild salmonids is challenging on many levels. The sensitive nature {{of an integrated}} physiological stress response directs how biological data is collected in the field and, consequently, how the results are interpreted. This thesis is comprised of two main components. The first component encompasses laboratory-based studies addressing the potential confounding effects of: 1) anaesthesia with either <b>tricaine</b> methanesulphonate (<b>tricaine)</b> or clove oil (eugenol) prior to blood/tissue sampling, and 2) capture by electroshocking, on the immediate and short-term responses of plasma/serum cortisol and glucose concentrations, haematocrit, plasma/serum lysozyme activity, and total leucocyte abundance in juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). The second component involves a field-based exploration of the in situ physiological status, using the same five physiological traits, of wild bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in the Torpy River watershed, B. C., in relation to selected habitat attributes (stream gradient, discharge rate, and riparian canopy-closure). Anaesthetization and electroshocking did not significantly alter values for the five physiological traits provided that post-capture blood sampling occurred immediately. <b>Tricaine</b> and clove oil immobilization produced similar effects on {{the physiological}} stress response of juvenile chinook salmon. Clove oil (eugenol) shows promise as a viable and safe alternative to <b>tricaine</b> for aquacultural purposes and in laboratory- and field-based research. Electroshocking is an acute stressor from which juvenile chinook salmon can recover physiologically (usually within 12 - 24 h). Handling without shocking, however, significantly reduced serum lysozyme activity for up to 2 wks post-stress. Radiographs indicated that while some degree of spinal abnormality exists naturally in domestic chinook juveniles, individuals exposed to a single brief shock incur significantly more spinal deformities. Some {{of the variation in}} the stress physiology and non-specific immune function of wild bull trout in the Torpy River system were explained by the combined effects of stream gradient, discharge rate, and riparian canopy-closure. The physiological measurements of wild bull trout generally did not differ from those reported in the literature for other salmonid species. The "background" effects of these habitat features on the physiology of wild salmonids must be considered when interpreting field-collected data.

40|$|In recent years, use of {{lumpfish}} (Cyclopterus lumpus L.) as cleaner-fish {{to remove}} sea-lice {{have been chosen}} by many salmon farmers in Europe and Canada {{as an alternative to}} medical treatment, which has led to large scale production of lumpfish. At present, there is limited knowledge of how lumpfish respond upon anaesthesia, which anaesthetics and concentrations that are efficient and conditions for euthanasia. We have therefore tested and developed protocols for bath immersion for three commonly used anaesthetics metacaine (Finquel, buffered <b>tricaine</b> methanesulfonate, MS- 222 and <b>Tricaine</b> Pharmaq), benzocaine (Benzoak vet) and isoeugenol (Aqui-S), determined concentration for normal and fast anaesthesia and evaluated safety margin for each condition. Also, a behavioral matrix has been developed. We have examined the effect of fish size (10 - 20 g, 200 - 400 g and 600 - 1300 g) and sea water temperature (6 °C and 12 °C). We found that 200 mg L- 1 metacaine is an efficient dose for deep narcosis independently for fish size and temperature due to good safety margins with regards to both exposure times and doses. However, for many tasks lighter anaesthesia is sufficient, and then 100 mg L- 1 metacaine can be used. Benzocaine is less efficient than metacaine, but can be used as anaesthetic of fish 600 g), benzocaine is not suitable. Isoeugenol cannot be recommended for full anesthesia of lumpfish. The conditions for lethal doses varied with chosen anaesthetic, fish size and temperature. For small fish (10 - 20 g), exposure to 1600 mgL- 1 of metacaine in 10 minutes it lethal. Guided protocols for non-lethal anaesthesia will contribute to ensure safe treatment of lumpfish according to an ethical standard for good fish welfare...|$|E

Glucose was determined colorimetrically according to Trinder ([1969]). Total protein in serum was determined colorimetrically according to Henry ([1964]). Total lipids in serum was determined colorimetrically according to Joseph et al. ([1972]). Uric acid was measured according to Barham and Trinder ([1972]) and creatinine was measured colorimetrically as described by Henry ([1974]). Activities of aspartate amninotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were determined colorimetrically according to Reitman and Frankel ([1957]).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Laparoscopy is a {{surgical}} technique that permit {{to look into}} the abdominal cavity, using a specific instrumentation, through small incisions; for this reason it must be considered as {{a surgical}} method with lower invasiveness than traditional abdominal surgery. This study is aimed at evaluating and adapting the general principles of the technique to teleosts. The study was performed on 15 subjects, belonging to different species and weight: five meagres (Argyrosomus regius), five carps (Cyprinus carpio), five common pandoras (Pagellus erythrinus). All the fishes examined were anaestetized with MS 222 (<b>Tricaine</b> methansulfonate) solution. The laparoscopy was carried out using a rigid cistoscope with an oblique vision at 30 degrees, 1. 9 mm in diameter, connected with a portable video system Medi PackTM by Storz. Our results confirm that laparoscopy could represent an imaging technique with high sensitivity to show and evaluate celomic organ...|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} pressure for Animal Care and Ethics Councils to recommend using analgesics in experiments that involve fish. Although {{we do have}} some data regarding this issue, I argue that we do not know enough to recommend any being used. For example, the doses of morphine used in fish experi- ments range from 10 to 3000 mg/kg relative to doses used in mammals that typically range from 2 to 5 mg/ kg. I recommend that we continue to use anaesthet- ics that are commonly used with fish (<b>tricaine,</b> benzo- caine, and eugenol) because these also probably act as analgesics in fish as they do in mammals, and thus, may have some analgesic properties post-operatively. There are no adequate tests that would allow us to recommend using analgesics for farmed fish that may be consumed by humans or pets. Source type: Print(0...|$|E
40|$|Anaesthesia {{of animals}} {{may be useful}} for {{different}} purposes, particularly for veterinary reasons or in experimental research, for manipulation or treatment of immobilized but alive animals. Its use in crustaceans is not uncommon, but {{it has never been}} described for Ostracoda. We provide brief and preliminary guidelines {{on the use of the}} <b>tricaine</b> mesylate (MS- 222) on the widespread freshwater ostracod Eucypris virens and we show that this compound is an effective anaesthetic used as a bath treatment at minimum concentrations of 500 mg L- 1. This value is considerably higher than that recommended for other aquatic animals like fish. Recovery time, ranging from 5 to 15 minutes, is mostly determined by anaesthetic bath concentration, while bath duration influenced to a lesser extent. Anaesthesia induced with MS- 222 can prove useful for minute manipulation of living ostracods e. g. for identification, marking or image capture under the microscope...|$|E
