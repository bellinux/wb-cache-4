5|$|Greyhound Express routes are {{assigned}} new or refurbished buses that {{are equipped with}} Wi-Fi, power outlets, leather seats, and extra legroom. In many stations Greyhound Express customers {{can take advantage of}} dedicated waiting areas, separate from passengers traveling on other Greyhound services or other carriers. Some stations also board passengers onto Greyhound Express buses using numbers printed on tickets. This number is assigned in the order in which the ticket was purchased, which means that passengers who bought their tickets earlier get to board <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>and</b> choose their seats earlier.|$|E

The {{driver of the}} bus had begun to pass a car. Fourteen people, including both <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>and</b> truck drivers, died. The National Transportation Safety Board determined {{that the cause of}} the crash was the Greyhound driver's overtaking maneuver and his failure to avoid the truck.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>and</b> coach {{operations}} {{of what was}} then Tillingbourne Valley Services were split. The coaching unit {{was taken over by}} Lionel Rhees, previously an employee of Tillingbourne, and operated from a depot in Chilworth under the name Tillingbourne Valley Coaches. This company bought three second-hand coaches to run on excursions and private hire operations. After 14years of operation it launched a bus service between Guildford and Blackheath. Rhees died in 1953 and Tillingbourne Valley Coaches passed to his wife, who sold out to established operator Rackliffe of Guildford a year later. Rackliffe was itself taken over by Cookes Coaches in 1955, and the Blackheath service withdrawn.|$|E

While waiting for the new tires, Homer meets Wally Kogen, a travel agent. They go to Moe's and watch a special on the Super Bowl on TV. Wally says his agency has a charter bus going to the game and suggests to Homer that he can fill <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>and</b> ride for free.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s, with vehicle numbers depleted by wartime service in France and Belgium, the Underground Group's bus operations began to experience a surge in competition from a large number of new independent bus operators. These small operators were unregulated and preyed on the group's most profitable routes taking away a large number of its passengers and a large amount of its income. Albert Stanley (ennobled as Lord Ashfield in 1920) and Pick fought back by calling on parliament to regulate bus operations in the capital. The London Traffic Act 1924 granted their request by establishing the London Traffic Area to regulate road passenger traffic within London and the surrounding districts. Throughout the 1920s, Pick led the Underground Group's efforts to coordinate its services with the municipal tram operators, the Metropolitan Railway and the suburban mainline rail services. The aim was to achieve a pooling of income between all of the operators and remove wasteful competition. At the end of 1930, a solution was announced in a bill for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation which was {{to take control of the}} Underground Group, the Metropolitan Railway and the majority of <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>and</b> tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area covering the County of London and Middlesex and parts of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey and Sussex.|$|E

25|$|Several {{registers}} {{could be}} read onto the read bus simultaneously. When this occurred, data from each register was inclusive-ORed onto the bus. This inclusive-OR feature was used to implement the Mask instruction, which was a logical AND operation. Because the AGC had no native ability to do a logical AND, but could do a logical OR through <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>and</b> could complement (invert) data through the C register, De Morgan's theorem was used to implement {{the equivalent of a}} logical AND. This was accomplished by inverting both operands, performing a logical OR through <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> <b>and</b> then inverting the result.|$|E
