5|$|During post-production, Vasan asked Ramnoth {{his opinion}} of the scene when {{hundreds}} of Veerasimhan's warriors storm the palace to rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan. Although the scene's photography, shots and action had been unanimously praised by others, Ramnoth was quiet before saying that <b>the</b> <b>suspense</b> might be ruined if the scene was shown uncut. This sparked a discussion; Vasan advised Chandru to edit in accordance with Ramnoth's direction, and {{was impressed with the}} result. C. E. Biggs was the film's audio engineer.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2005, he had {{supporting}} {{roles in}} <b>the</b> <b>suspense</b> thriller films The Skeleton Key and Robert Schwentke's Flightplan. In the latter film, Sarsgaard played an air marshall, who is ordered to keep guard of Jodie Foster's character.

Despite the mixed reviews, the film was a financial success, earning $223million worldwide, making it his highest-grossing film {{to the end of}} 2008. Sarsgaard's next feature was Jarhead (2005), opposite Jake Gyllenhaal. The movie is based on U.S. Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 Gulf War memoir of the same name.|$|E
5|$|Other {{similarities}} include {{engaging in}} <b>the</b> <b>suspense</b> {{the speaker is}} attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside {{the knowledge that the}} performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E

5|$|Production {{began on}} 3 August 1943. Many {{details about the}} performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out ahead of {{time in order to}} not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve {{suspense}} on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a dimly lit set to heighten <b>the</b> <b>suspense</b> and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might be, similar to the way Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.|$|E

40|$|In arid regions wind {{storms and}} flood flows carry in {{suspension}} sand or particles {{plucked from the}} soil. On the other hand irrigation and draining channels must have a special design {{in order to avoid}} erosion and the subsequent transportation of sediments. It is of importance in order to explain these phenomena to study the hydrodynamical interaction between the fluid phase and <b>the</b> <b>suspensed</b> particles and this is the principal purpose of this paper. Density currents are examples or two-phase flow, <b>the</b> <b>suspensed</b> material acting as a determining factor. They are particularly discussed as they give a remarkable illustration of the interaction between solids and liquids and play moreover an important part in the study of reservoirs formed by dams in arid regions. This memoir analyses too the similarity between sand or dust storms and density currents...|$|R

5|$|Kurosawa had {{meanwhile}} instructed Toho {{to purchase}} the film rights to King's Ransom, a novel about a kidnapping written by American author and screenwriter Evan Hunter, under his pseudonym of Ed McBain, {{as one of his}} 87th Precinct series of crime books. The director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping, which he considered one of the very worst crimes. <b>The</b> <b>suspense</b> film, titled High and Low, was shot during the latter half of 1962 and released in March 1963. It broke Kurosawa's box office record (the third film in a row to do so), became the highest grossing Japanese film of the year, and won glowing reviews. However, his triumph was somewhat tarnished when, ironically, the film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in Japan about this time (he himself received kidnapping threats directed at his young daughter, Kazuko). High and Low is considered by many commentators to be among the director's strongest works.|$|E
