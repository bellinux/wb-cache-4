5|$|By contrast, {{four of the}} {{original}} thirteen state constitutions contained explicit criminal venue provisions. New Hampshire (1784) and Georgia (1777 and 1789) required crimes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> in the county where committed. Maryland (1776) and Massachusetts (1780) contained similar provisions.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the accused}} Pendle witches, such as Alizon Device, seem to have {{genuinely}} believed in their guilt, but others protested their innocence to the end. Jennet Preston was the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried,</b> at York Assizes.|$|E

5|$|The {{privileges}} {{have been}} lost and eroded over time. Only three survived into the 20th century: the right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> by other peers of the realm instead of juries of commoners, freedom from arrest in civil (but not criminal) cases, {{and access to the}} Sovereign to advise him or her on matters of state. The right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> by other peers was abolished in 1948. Legal opinion considers the right of freedom from arrest as extremely limited in application, if at all. The remaining privilege is not exercised and was recommended for formal abolition in 1999, but has never been formally revoked.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} trial, a further 26 {{defendants}} were still due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> on charges {{relating to the}} riot. The Crown Prosecution Service accepted plea bargains where defendants pleaded guilty to violent disorder {{in exchange for the}} dropping of other charges, or in some cases all charges were dropped completely. On 20 September 1993 the last remaining defendant to maintain a plea of not guilty went on trial, and he was convicted of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and sentenced to thirty months imprisonment.|$|E

The site normally offers a large selection of games at discount during its annual Summer and Holiday sales, including gamification of these sales to incentive users to purchase more games.|$|E

5|$|Maximus' {{refusal to}} accept Monothelitism {{caused him to}} be brought to the {{imperial}} capital of Constantinople <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> as a heretic in 658. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial he was accused of aiding the Muslim conquests in Egypt and North Africa, which he rejected as slander.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{provided}} {{for a number}} of military offences and their punishments, including failure to attend on embodiment, failure to fulfil the conditions of training, and sale or destruction of government property. It also {{provided for}} the method by which offences against this act, or the Army Act, were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried.</b> Members of the Force could, however, not be punished for any absence relating to voting in a Parliamentary election.|$|E
5|$|These three Native American {{leaders were}} the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried,</b> for raids (Warren Wagon Train Raid) and murder, in a United States civil court instead of a {{military}} court.

5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> in {{accordance}} with the Bill of Rights' procedural guarantees and {{in accordance with}} constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of due process was restrictive {{in the sense that it}} was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to the Bill of Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to the Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, No. 6 Commando {{remained}} in Germany to undertake various occupation duties {{along with the rest}} of the 1st Commando Brigade. These duties included searching for German personnel and officials that were wanted for questioning or <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> for war crimes, distributing food to the populace and helping to restore law and order as part of the reconstruction process. In early 1946, the unit returned to the United Kingdom and it was eventually disbanded. At this time the decision was made to disband all the Army commando units and demobilise or return their personnel to their original regiments or branches of service. Consequently, the commando role was maintained solely by the Royal Marines Commandos, although they too were subjected to cut backs, being reduced from eight wartime units to just three.|$|E
5|$|However, after {{less than}} a month back in York, William died, on 8 June 1154, {{allegedly}} due to poison administered in the chalice at Mass. One of William's clerks accused Osbert de Bayeux, an archdeacon of York, of the murder, and Osbert was summoned before the king <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> at the royal court. Before the trial could take place, however, Stephen died, and the trial never took place. William was buried in York Minster and within a few months of his death, miracles were attributed to his intervention and a sweet smell came from his tomb when it was damaged during a fire. Nor was the body decayed or burnt in the fire. Pope Honorius III then ordered an investigation into the miracles. In 1227, he was canonised in Rome by Pope Honorius III.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Weston {{was found}} incompetent {{to stand trial}} due to mental illness as {{he was a man}} with {{schizophrenia}} who stopped taking his medication. A judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered that he be treated with antipsychotic medication without his consent in 2001, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the decision. In 2004, the court determined that Weston still was not competent <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried,</b> despite ongoing treatment, and suspended but did not dismiss the criminal charges against him. Weston was known to the United States Secret Service prior to the incident as a person who had threatened the President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, Wotton {{was granted}} a {{separate}} trial from his co-accused in the Brisbane District Court since the allegations in the prosecution case against the other co-accused were prejudicial to Wotton's case. Wotton then pleaded guilty {{to the charge of}} rioting. In late March, after Wotton had already applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the advice of his legal representatives (including his then barrister Marcus Einfeld), Wotton's co-accused were acquitted by a jury of rioting causing destruction. Wotton's application to withdraw his plea was granted by Nase DCJ on 26 April 2007. A few days later, Wotton was released on bail with strict conditions and ordered to return in April 2008 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, Zhou Yongkang, {{a former}} member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) and head of China's {{security}} agencies, was placed under investigation by the CCDI for abuse of power and corruption, a decision state media announced in July 2014. Zhou was the first PSC member – and the most senior-ranked official – since the founding of the People's Republic of China <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> and convicted of corruption-related charges. Following his investigation, Zhou was expelled from the CPC. On 11 June 2015, Zhou was convicted of bribery, abuse of power and the intentional disclosure of state secrets by the Intermediate Court in Tianjin. Zhou and his family members were said to have taken 129 million yuan (over $20 million) in bribes. He was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E

5|$|López de Salcedo {{was under}} orders to {{investigate}} the state of affairs in the troubled province, and take whatever actions were necessary to impose order. He and his immediate successors promoted their own personal ambitions over the good government of Honduras, sowing division amongst the colonists, and instituting harsh policies against the indigenous population. In 1527 the natives rebelled against their brutal treatment. The punishment meted out to the rebellious Indians only served to incite further revolts. López de Salcedo arrested Saavedra and his supporters and shipped them to Santo Domingo <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> by the Audiencia. The prisoners seized control {{of the ship and}} sailed for Cuba.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 1612, Alizon Device, {{who lived}} {{just outside the}} Lancashire village of Fence, near Pendle Hill, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax. She asked him for some pins, which he refused to give to her, {{and a few minutes}} later Law suffered a stroke, for which he blamed Alizon. Along with her mother Elizabeth and her brother James, Alizon was summoned to appear before local magistrate Roger Nowell on 30March 1612. Based on the evidence and confessions he obtained, Nowell committed Alizon and ten others to Lancaster Gaol <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> at the next assizes for maleficium, causing harm by witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|Several {{of these}} rights {{regulate}} pre-trial procedure: {{access to a}} non-excessive bail, the right to indictment by a grand jury, {{the right to a}}n information (charging document), the right to a speedy trial, and the right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> in a specific venue. Several of these rights are trial rights: the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses at trial, the right to confront witnesses at trial, the right to a public trial, the right to a trial by an impartial petit jury selected from a specific geography, and the right not to be compelled to testify against oneself. Others, such as the assistance of counsel and due process rights, have application throughout the proceeding.|$|E
