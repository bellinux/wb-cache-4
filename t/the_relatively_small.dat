5|$|Due to the episodic {{nature of}} the Axis attacks and <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> number of ships and {{submarines}} committed, Germany and Japan were not successful in disrupting Australian shipping.

5|$|By contrast, French {{observers}} remarked favorably on the industriousness {{and intelligence}} {{of the people of}} Rurutu, as well as the success of Teuruarii in increasing revenues through maritime trade with neighboring islands. In 1899, Rurutu's annual exports were valued at 59,881 French francs, of which 37,919 were exported to the Tahitian port of Papeete - exceptionally high trade volumes in light of <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> size of the island and its population.|$|E

5|$|Solid xenon {{changes from}} face-centered cubic (fcc) to {{hexagonal}} close packed (hcp) crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about 140GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. It is completely metallic at 155GPa. When metallized, xenon appears sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies. Such behavior is unusual for a metal and is explained by <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> width of the electron bands in that state.|$|E

One is reputed to have been drawn by Sir Francis Dashwood himself, while the Tapestry Room, once ante-room to the adjoining former principal bedroom, is hung with Brussels tapestries depicting peasant scenes by Teniers. Dashwood inherited them in 1763 from his uncle Lord Westmorland, {{who is said to}} have been given them by the 1st Duke of Marlborough to celebrate their victories in the Low Countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{south side}} of the {{mountain}} along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> Gotchen Glacier and the Crescent Glacier. The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier is the source of Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the White Salmon River.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{uncertainty}} on employment dynamics. Alternative measures of uncertainty are constructed based on the survey of professional forecasters, and regression-based forecasting models for GDP growth, inflation, S&P 500 stock price index, and fuel prices. Our results indicate that greater uncertainty has a negative impact on growth of employment, and the effects are primarily felt by <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>smaller</b> businesses; <b>the</b> impact on large businesses are generally non-existent or weaker. Our results suggest that to truly understand the effects of uncertainty on employment dynamics, {{we need to focus on}} <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>smaller</b> and entrepreneurial businesses. We discuss implications for the framing of economic policy...|$|R

5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years ago. It formed <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> caldera {{that contains}} the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years ago, has nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas {{such as those that}} can be seen at Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Considering <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> {{size of the}} islands, it has {{a notable}} {{literary}} scene. Tuepokoina Utanga Morgan is credited with writing musical compositions and poetry and producing folk opera. Composer and poet Teate Makirere, who toured as communications adviser of the Pacific Conference of Churches, has been commended for his secular writings. Paiere Mokoroa and Merota Ngamata {{are known for their}} writings on the culture of Atiu Island and Pukapuka, and Tingota Simiona wrote an extensive collection of stories based on the legends of Atiu Island. One of the well-known Cook Islands children's story tellers and poets was Mona Matepi, who produced the Mokopets television series of 52 episodes for children. There is also a number of popular songs and dramas of unknown artists, presented on television and radio, which are available on cassettes and CDs. Radio programs in the islands are broadcast in the native language, English and Tahitian.|$|E
5|$|Coyote {{attacks on}} humans are {{uncommon}} and rarely cause serious injuries, due to <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> {{size of the}} coyote, but have been increasingly frequent, especially in California. There have been two confirmed fatal attacks: one on a three-year-old named Kelly Keen in Glendale, California and another on a nineteen-year-old named Taylor Mitchell in Nova Scotia, Canada. In the 30 {{years leading up to}} March 2006, at least 160 attacks occurred in the United States, mostly in the Los Angeles County area. Data from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services, the California Department of Fish and Game, and other sources show that while 41 attacks occurred during the period of 1988–1997, 48 attacks were verified from 1998 through 2003. The majority of these incidents occurred in Southern California near the suburban-wildland interface.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, {{allowing}} elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation. In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from 4 Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly, within ten million years of the Solar System's origin.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the owners}} of One Times Square filed for {{bankruptcy}} protection. In March 1995, One Times Square was sold to the financial services firm Lehman Brothers for $27.5 million. The new owners felt {{that it would not}} be cost-effective to house new tenants in the tower due to the cost of the extensive renovation required in order to make it suitable for tenants as compared to <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> rental revenue that its limited floor space would have brought in. Instead, they decided to market the tower as a location for advertising to capitalize on its prominent location within the Square. The entire exterior of One Times Square above the ticker was modified to add a grid frame for mounting billboard signs.|$|E
5|$|Mary Tudor, {{daughter}} of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII, spent 19 months at Ludlow overseeing the Council of the Marches between 1525 and 1528, {{along with her}} entourage of servants, advisors, and guardians. <b>The</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> sum of £5 was spent restoring the castle before her arrival. The council's wide ranging role was reinforced in legislation in 1534, and its purpose was further elaborated in the Act of Union of 1543; some presidents, such as Bishop Rowland Lee, used its harsher powers extensively to execute local criminals, but later presidents typically preferred to punish with the pillory, whipping or imprisonment in the castle. The Great Chamber itself {{was used as the}} council's meeting room.|$|E

5|$|McGovern {{switched}} from Wesleyan Methodism to less fundamentalist regular Methodism. Influenced by Walter Rauschenbusch and the Social Gospel movement, McGovern began divinity studies at Garrett Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois, near Chicago. He preached as a Methodist student supply minister at Diamond Lake Church in Mundelein, Illinois, during 1946 and 1947, but became dissatisfied by {{the minutiae of}} his pastoral duties. In late 1947, McGovern left the ministry and enrolled in graduate studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, where he also worked as a teaching assistant. <b>The</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> history program there was {{among the best in}} the country and McGovern took courses given by noted academics Ray Allen Billington, Richard W. Leopold, and L. S. Stavrianos. He received an M.A. in history in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Outside North America and Western Europe, the Labrador arrived later. For example, the Russian Retriever Club {{traces the}} arrival of Labradors to the late 1960s, as {{household}} pets of diplomats {{and others in the}} foreign ministry. The establishment of the breed in the Commonwealth of Independent States (former USSR) was initially hindered by <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> numbers of Labradors and great distances involved, leading to difficulty establishing breedings and bloodlines; {{at the start of the}} 1980s, home-born dogs were still regularly supplemented by further imports from overseas. Difficulties such as these initially led to Labradors being tacitly cross-bred to other types of retriever. In the 1990s, improved access to overseas shows and bloodlines is said to have helped this situation become regularised.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{provided}} an opportunity for improving the visuals and gameplay. The visuals were given more contrast, so objects stood out more. Improvements to the lighting was a major focus for the team. The game's engine was also improved, along with character animations and facial movement. Due to <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> size of the DLC environment, developers {{did not need to}} focus on a raised concern in the main game about repeating character faces and voices. An element that had been generally criticized by both critics and players of the original game was the boss fights, which had been outsourced to Grip Entertainment and consequently did not follow the player-driven gameplay style {{of the rest of the}} game, instead focusing heavily on action. While a boss fight was included in The Missing Link, it was entirely developed in-house by Eidos Montréal staff and allowed for a variety of solution for defeating the boss, including non-lethal options.|$|E
30|$|The {{potassium}} content has {{a significant}} effect on the catalyst performance. Higher K content favors the yield of higher alcohol, and the promotion effect is more significant over the Al 2 O 3 –B 2 O 3 -supported carbide catalysts. This can be explained by <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>smaller</b> Mo 2 C crystallites, which give higher Mo 2 C dispersion over the catalysts.|$|R

5|$|The oil {{campaign}} over Romania {{and against}} the synthetic oil plants in the Ruhr—in which most oilfields had been destroyed, captured or damaged by 1945—triggered a critical fuel shortage from the autumn of 1944 onwards which denied the Luftwaffe the resources to capitalise on its numerical strength. Paradoxically, production was able to replace <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> losses and operational serviceability reached an all-time high since ground crews had more opportunity to work on machines. The Luftwaffe was still capable of taking a toll on Bomber Command on occasion, but unless more powerful radars and communications could be introduced in time it was doubtful British air superiority at night could be challenged. The impotence of the night fighter force as an organisation was demonstrated during the attack on Dresden when the second wave of Allied bombers was hardly opposed. Operation Clarion, launched later that month, was not adequately opposed either.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the Liliaceae {{has a very}} complex history. The family was first described in the eighteenth century, and over time many other genera were added until it {{became one of the}} largest of the monocotyledon families, and also extremely diverse. Modern taxonomic systems, such as the APG which is based on phylogenetic principles using molecular biology, have redistributed many of these genera resulting in <b>the</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small</b> family that is currently recognised. Consequently, there are many different accounts of the Liliaceae in the literature and older uses of the term occur commonly. To distinguish between them, the Latin terms sensu lato and sensu stricto are frequently used (together with their abbreviations, s.l. and s.s.) to denote the broader or stricter sense of the circumscription respectively, e.g. Liliaceae s.s..|$|E
5|$|True to its name, the winghead shark's cephalofoil {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} long, narrow, and gently swept-back blades. The width of the cephalofoil is equal to 40–50% of the shark's total length. The front of the cephalofoil has a slight indentation in the middle and a gentle bump on each side in front of the nostrils. Each nostril is roughly twice as long as the width of the mouth and extends along almost the entire leading margin of each blade. The circular eyes, located at the forward outer corners of the cephalofoil, are equipped with protective nictitating membranes. <b>The</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>small,</b> arched mouth contains 15–16 upper and 14 lower tooth rows on each side, and sometimes also a single row of tiny teeth at the upper and/or lower symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are small and smooth-edged, with angled triangular cusps. Five pairs of gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair over the pectoral fin origins.|$|E
