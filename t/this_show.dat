5|$|Despite stating {{during the}} press tour {{that there would}} be no live album from the tour, the {{performances}} at Sydney Entertainment Centre – Sydney on 7 and 9 November 1987 were filmed and released on video as Glass Spider in 1988. An edit of <b>this</b> <b>show</b> was subsequently aired in the US in an ABC TV concert special, ABC's first concert special since airing Elvis Presley's Aloha from Hawaii in 1973. A 2007 DVD re-release of the show included an audio recording of the performance at the Olympic Stadium, Montreal on 30 August 1987. The 6 June 1987 Platz der Republik (Reichstag – City Of Berlin Festival) performance was broadcast live on FM Radio.|$|E
5|$|During November 1908, Maeda went to Paris, France, {{apparently}} {{to see his}} friend Akitaro Ono. From Paris, he went to Havana, arriving there on December 14, 1908, and his twice-a-day wrestling act quickly proved to be very popular. On July 23, 1909, Maeda left Havana for Mexico City. His debut in Mexico City {{took place at the}} Virginia Fabregas Theater on July 14, 1909. <b>This</b> <b>show</b> was a private demonstration for some military cadets. Shortly afterwards, Maeda began appearing at the Principal Theater. His standing offer was 100 pesos (US $50) to anyone he could not throw, and 500 pesos (US $250) to anyone who could throw him. The Mexican Herald did not record anyone taking his money.|$|E

5|$|During his {{run as a}} variety-show host, Moore {{was tapped}} to host CBS' weekly prime-time TV panel show I've Got a Secret. It premiered on June 19, 1952. On <b>this</b> <b>show,</b> Moore began his friendships with comedian Henry Morgan and game show host and {{panelist}} Bill Cullen, {{with whom he had}} a long working relationship. Morgan later stated that Moore had helped him keep his job as a celebrity panelist on the show.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based on the level set method, there are only two possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly evolve into smooth curves, after which they evolve as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as <b>this</b> <b>show</b> that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Chinese co-production of Sesame Street, Zhima Jie, was created. An auto {{mechanic}} became the head writer of <b>this</b> <b>show,</b> broadcast in Mandarin Chinese, {{because there were}} few people with experience in writing for children in the country. It has aired in 40 local markets, comprising forty percent of all Chinese homes. Its curriculum emphasized aesthetics. The Chinese puppeteers were trained by Kevin Clash and Caroll Spinney. Also in 1998, a fifteen-minute version of the Israeli show was dubbed in Arabic and renamed Shara'a Simsim; this Palestinian co-production promoted children's sense of national identity.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Sisimpur {{aired in}} Bangladesh. This co-production's {{goal was to}} improve school {{achievement}} and decrease drop-out rates for children before the third grade. This difficult co-production, which was beset by political difficulties and severe flooding that delayed production, was depicted in the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street. Also in 2005, the producers of the Kosovo co-production (Rruga Sesam/Ulica Sezam) chose to present the languages of the region more evenly. Instead of showing words on screen, children were challenged to label objects verbally, thus learning that there are different ways {{to say the same}} thing. The Workshop worked in conjunction with UNICEF to produce <b>this</b> <b>show,</b> to aid in the peace process between Albanians and Serbs. One of its goals was to demonstrate to Albanian and Serbian children that their counterparts were like them.|$|E
5|$|In early 1345, Kantakouzenos sent Franciscan monks to the regency to make {{an offer}} of conciliation, but it was rejected. Despite <b>this</b> <b>show</b> of confidence, the regency's {{position}} remained insecure. The defections of the previous winter had weakened their control of the capital, and in response Apokaukos launched a series of proscriptions. He also ordered {{the construction of a}} new prison to house political prisoners. On 11 June 1345, while undertaking an inspection of the prison unaccompanied by his bodyguard, Apokaukos was lynched by the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Japan Airlines {{has been}} the focus of several {{television}} programs in Japan over the years, most being dramas revolving around cabin attendants. Attention Please was a drama in 1970 that followed the story of a young girl who joins JAL to be a cabin attendant while overcoming many difficulties. <b>This</b> <b>show</b> was remade in 2006 again as Attention Please starring Aya Ueto who joins a class of cabin attendant nominees and later graduates. Most of the action of the story of the 2006 series takes place at JAL's Haneda flight operations headquarters. The series has had two specials since the original, marking the main character's transition into JAL's international operations.|$|E

5|$|Playing gay bars such as The Stud and The Endup, in September 1976 Sylvester and {{his band}} gained a regular weekend job at The Palms nightclub on Polk Street, {{performing}} two or three sets a night; most of these were covers, but some were original compositions by Sylvester and his then-guitarist Tip Wirrick. It was through <b>this</b> <b>show</b> that Sylvester {{came to the attention}} of Motown producer Harvey Fuqua, and Fuqua subsequently signed Sylvester onto a solo deal with Fantasy Records in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 tour by American {{alternative}} {{rock band}} the Breeders comprised thirteen concerts {{in central and}} western United States in September of that year. The group's line-up for their 1993 album Last Splash consisted of Josephine Wiggs, Jim Macpherson, Kim Deal, and Kelley Deal; however, Wiggs and Macpherson were not members for the group's next albums, Title TK (2002) and Mountain Battles (2008). In 2013, the foursome reunited for a tour to commemorate Last Splashs 20th anniversary, and the following year, they began working on new material together. Invited to open for Neutral Milk Hotel's September 18 concert at the Hollywood Bowl, they planned a tour to lead up to <b>this</b> <b>show,</b> using the opportunity to practice their recent compositions.|$|E
5|$|The German governor—Eduard Haber—continued to {{hold out}} for several days, hoping that the German East Asiatic Squadron would arrive to relieve them. Unknown to the Germans, however, an Australian {{advanced}} party consisting of a half-battalion of 200men and a 12-pounder naval field-gun had followed them, moving along the Toma road. The Australians surrounded the town and proceeded to bombard it; meanwhile HMAS Encounter arrived on station and fired several shells at a ridge nearby. <b>This</b> <b>show</b> of firepower scattered the Melanesian police and was sufficient to start negotiations, with Toma subsequently occupied. Haber visited Holmes in Herbertshöhe on 15 September, signing terms two days later. All military resistance subsequently ceased and the remaining 40German soldiers and 110Melanesians surrendered on 21 September, leaving no effective opposition to the Australian occupation of the territory.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Union {{dominated}} the ice hockey competition, winning every match {{to take their}} sixth Olympic gold in eight Winter Games. East German sledders fully demonstrated their prowess at the Trebević track. Wolfgang Hoppe and Dietmar Schauerhammer clinched gold in both bobsleigh events, while Bernhard Lehmann and Bogdan Musiol secured both silvers. Led by Steffi Martin, who won the first of her two back-to-back Olympic titles, East German lugers swept the women's singles medals. <b>This</b> <b>show</b> of strength was also observed in the women's speed skating, where East German athletes grabbed nine of the twelve medals in dispute. Four of these were won by Karin Enke (matching the total tallies of Hämäläinen and Svan), and three by Andrea Schöne – in direct competition with Enke. Speed skater Gaétan Boucher won three of Canada's four medals in Sarajevo, including two golds.|$|E
5|$|The comedian Richard Herring {{grew up in}} Cheddar. His 2008 Edinburgh Festival Fringe show, The Headmaster's Son {{is based}} on his time at The Kings of Wessex School, where his father Keith was the headmaster. The final {{performance}} of <b>this</b> <b>show</b> {{was held at the}} school in November 2009. He also visited the school in March 2010 to perform his show Hitler Moustache. In May 2013, a community radio station called Pulse was launched.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert at}} Korakuen Stadium, Tokyo was {{broadcast}} on June 22, 1987 in Japan only. It was later released on VHS and Laserdisc as Who's That Girl: Live In Japan. It {{was the first}} television broadcast using Dolby Surround Sound and was promoted by Mitsubishi, as Madonna had previously starred in television commercials for their video recorders. On September 4, 1987, Madonna's concert special, Madonna in Concerto, filmed at the Comunale Stadium in Turin, Italy was broadcast live on TV in Italy (RAI), France (TF1), Germany (SAT1), Austria (ORF) and Spain (TVE). Other countries including Australia and The Netherlands broadcast <b>this</b> <b>show</b> in 1987.|$|E
