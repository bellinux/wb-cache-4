40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} Noether, Dedekind, and Kähler differents for a 0 -dimensional scheme X in the projective n-space P^n_K over an arbitrary field K. In particular, we focus on studying {{the relations between the}} algebraic structure of <b>these</b> <b>differents</b> and geometric properties of the scheme X. In Chapter 1 we give an outline to the problems this thesis is concerned with, a brief literature review for each problem, and the main results regarding these problems. Chapter 2 contains background results that we will need in the subsequent chapters. We introduce the concept of maximal p_j-subschemes of a 0 -dimensional scheme X and give some descriptions of them and their Hilbert functions. Furthermore, we generalize the notion of a separator of a subscheme of X of degree deg(X) - 1 to a set of separators of a maximal p_j-subscheme of X. In Chapter 3 we explore the Noether, Dedekind, and Kähler differents for 0 -dimensional schemes X. First we define <b>these</b> <b>differents</b> for X, {{and take a look at}} how to compute <b>these</b> <b>differents</b> and examine their relations. Then we give an answer to the question "What are the Hilbert functions of these differents?" in some cases. In Chapter 4 we use the differents to investigate the Cayley-Bacharach property of 0 -dimensional schemes over an arbitrary field K. The principal results of this chapter are characterizations of CB-schemes and of arithmetically Gorenstein schemes in terms of their Dedekind differents and a criterion for a 0 -dimensional smooth scheme to be a complete intersection. We also generalize some results such as Dedekind's formula and the characterization of the Cayley-Bacharach property by using Liaison theory. In addition, several propositions on the uniformities are proven. In Chapter 5 we are interested in studying the Noether, Dedekind, and Kähler differents for finite special classes of schemes and finding out some applications of <b>these</b> <b>differents.</b> First, we investigate <b>these</b> <b>differents</b> for reduced 0 -dimensional almost complete intersections X in P^n_K over a perfect field K. Then we investigate the relationships between <b>these</b> <b>differents</b> and the i-th Fitting ideals of the module of Kähler differentials of the homogeneous coordinate ring of X. Finally, we look more closely at the Hilbert functions and the regularity indices of <b>these</b> <b>differents</b> for fat point schemes...|$|R

5|$|An English {{cultural}} identity first {{emerged from the}} interaction of the Germanic immigrants of the 5th and 6th centuries and the indigenous Romano-British inhabitants. Although early medieval chroniclers described the immigrants as Angles and Saxons, they came from a much wider area across Northern Europe, and represented a range of different ethnic groups. Over the 6th century, however, <b>these</b> <b>different</b> groups began to coalesce into stratified societies across England, roughly corresponding to the later Angle and Saxon kingdoms recorded by Bede in the 8th century. By the 9th century, the term the Angelcynn was being officially used to refer to a single English people, and promoted for propaganda purposes by chroniclers and kings to inspire resistance to the Danish invasions.|$|E

5|$|Heathens {{commonly}} adopt a cosmology {{based on}} that found in Norse mythology. As part of this framework, humanity's world—known as Midgard—is regarded as just one of nine realms, {{all of which are}} part of a cosmological world tree called Yggdrasil. Different types of being are believed to inhabit <b>these</b> <b>different</b> realms; for instance, humans live on Midgard, while dwarves live on another realm, elves on another, giants on another, and the divinities on two further realms. Most practitioners believe that this is a poetic or symbolic description of the cosmos, with the different levels representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence. The world tree is also interpreted by some in the community as an icon for ecological and social engagement. Some Heathens, such as the psychologist Brian Bates, have adopted an approach to this cosmology rooted in analytical psychology, thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps of the human mind.|$|E

In general, the climate {{can be divided into}} two main types: a cold arid or semi-arid climate at the higher altitudes, and warmer subtropical climate in the eastern parts of the region. Under the Köppen climate classification, the region has 5 different climate types: semi–arid (BS), arid (BW), temperate climate without a dry season and with a dry season (Cf and CW respectively), and an alpine climate at the highest altitudes.|$|E
