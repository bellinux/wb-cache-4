5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} the <b>things</b> <b>we</b> know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
5|$|This one I had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} <b>things</b> <b>we</b> wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E

5|$|The day of filming in the salvage yard, {{which took}} place at LA Japanese Auto Parts in Sun Valley, California, was {{abnormally}} hot according to Lauren Vélez. The Airstream trailer in which Dexter's victim is found was brought into the salvage yard for filming externally, but was assembled on a studio sound stage for shooting scenes inside the trailer. Erik King remarked that the trailer was dirty, odorous and humid—"all the <b>things</b> <b>we</b> needed it to be". Other filming locations included a waterfront house on Hibiscus Island in Biscayne Bay, Florida as the Castillos' home, an empty field next to Sun Valley's Tujunga Wash where a young Debra practices shooting with Harry's pistol, and {{a house in a}} residential neighborhood of Long Beach, California which stands in for Dexter's childhood home.|$|E

5000|$|Pastora {{had three}} failed marriages. Lamenting about the {{interpersonal}} strains {{that occur in}} the life of a revolutionary, Pastora said: [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> revolutionaries lose is our wives. The last <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> lose is our lives. In between our women and our lives, we lose our freedom, our happiness, our means of living." ...|$|R

25|$|Linguistic {{determinism}} {{claims that}} our language determines (at least limits) the <b>things</b> <b>we</b> can think and say and thus know. The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis argues that individuals experience the world {{based on the}} grammatical structures they habitually use.|$|E

25|$|After Come to Life, Imbruglia {{moved to}} Los Angeles and hired acting coach Ivana Chubbuck. She {{appeared}} in three movies. In April 2014 {{she made her}} stage debut in an adaptation of Alan Ayckbourn’s <b>Things</b> <b>We</b> Do For Love at the Theatre Royal, Bath.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} <b>things</b> <b>we</b> need to note in this myth is that the underworld controls the death of people. In other words, people will go to the underworld after they die. Also, even Yeomra, the King of the Underworld, can be captured by an officer in the mortal world.|$|E
25|$|In August 1968, before Cream officially disbanded, Bruce {{recorded}} {{an acoustic}} free jazz album with John McLaughlin, Dick Heckstall-Smith and Jon Hiseman. This was issued in 1970 as Bruce's second solo album, <b>Things</b> <b>We</b> Like. The album was {{a precursor to}} the jazz fusion boom in the early 1970s, and more recently has been sampled by many hip hop artists Artifacts and Smif-N-Wessun.|$|E

25|$|I've {{heard it}} {{said of the}} NDP that we are too {{attached}} to the past, but I {{tell you that it}} is our political opponents who are the Jurassic Park of Canadian politics. They would take us back to a meaner time when money was the measure of all <b>things.</b> <b>We</b> stand for the future that was sought and won and which must now be defended and enhanced.|$|E
25|$|Jesus {{repeatedly}} {{denounced the}} Pharisees for their {{additions to the}} Law of God. Thus, we must be extremely careful about what laws we lay down for people. Does the Bible clearly state that contraception is sinful, or that people are obligated {{to have as many}} children as possible? If the Bible does not say these <b>things,</b> <b>we</b> need to fear God and be frightened of adding to His Word.|$|E
25|$|We {{did some}} rather audacious <b>things.</b> <b>We</b> shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All we had to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there. And we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E

25|$|Easterly {{believes}} that aid goals should be small. In his opinion, {{one of the}} main failings of aid {{lies in the fact that}} we create large, utopian lists of <b>things</b> <b>we</b> hope to accomplish, without the means to actually see them to fruition. Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow.|$|E
25|$|The reason Spinoza {{thinks the}} {{parallelism}} follows from this axiom {{is that since}} the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, and this cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, {{there is only one}} substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas of <b>things,</b> <b>we</b> understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are the same modes understood under different attributes.|$|E
25|$|Portillo {{has written}} a regular column for The Sunday Times, {{contributes}} to other journals (he was a theatre critic for the New Statesman until May 2006), and is a regular radio broadcaster on UK radio. He is a long-serving member of the panel in the BBC Radio 4 series The Moral Maze. In September 2011, he presented a two-part series on BBC Radio 4 called Capitalism on Trial. He has also presented a history series on BBC Radio 4 called The <b>Things</b> <b>We</b> Forgot to Remember.. In June 2013, he presented a series of 12 15-minute radio programmes (following the daily World at One news programme) on BBC Radio 4 called 1913 – the Year Before, {{about the state of}} Britain in the years preceding World War I, challenging the view that these years were optimistic and cheerful.|$|E
