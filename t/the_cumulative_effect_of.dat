5|$|In 1994, the {{overpass}} {{bridge over}} Pottery Road, {{north of the}} Bayview/Bloor interchange was rebuilt. It was over 30 years old and it required the replacement of columns and a restructuring of the deck. It was worn down due to <b>the</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> heavy traffic and weather. The replacement necessitated the closure of several lanes of the parkway from April until the autumn that year.|$|E
5|$|Over many orbits, <b>the</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> {{gravitational}} perturbations on comets {{with high}} orbital inclinations and small perihelion distances is generally {{to reduce the}} perihelion distance to very small values. Hale–Bopp has about a 15%chance of eventually becoming a sungrazing comet through this process.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} had by {{now been}} fighting almost continuously throughout the summer. According to divisional commander Hampel, {{it had been}} exhausted even before Operation Hackfleisch began. <b>The</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> this exhaustion, the deteriorating situation that the Germans faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> these delays {{resulted}} {{in the production of}} {{only a small number of}} Mk VIIs; estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and 177. The name 'Tetrarch' was given to the Mk VII, on 22 September 1941, on the orders of the War Office. The last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of 1942 and delivered at the end of the year.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{protected}} from tides and storms by coral reefs {{are often the}} best places for housing in tropical countries. Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, reefs are vulnerable to over-fishing, {{because much of the}} organic carbon they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage reefs in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and <b>the</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> walking on the reefs. Coral, mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery, and demand rose sharply in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{degree to}} which {{any one of these}} forces held sway over others is unclear. Preference for one {{explanation}} over another is sometimes predicated upon a given political viewpoint. <b>The</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> these dynamics is that {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century the Plains Aborigines were almost completely acculturated into the larger ethnic Han group, and had experienced nearly total language shift from their respective Formosan languages to Chinese. In addition, legal barriers to the use of traditional surnames persisted until the 1990s, and cultural barriers remain. Aborigines were not permitted to use their traditional names on official identification cards until 1995 when a ban on using aboriginal names dating from 1946 was finally lifted. One obstacle is that household registration forms allow a maximum of 15 characters for personal names. However, aboriginal names are still phonetically translated into Chinese characters, and many names require more than the allotted space.|$|E

5|$|The {{defendants}} argued: (1) {{that the}} indictment {{should have been}} quashed because {{of the absence of}} women from the grand jury; (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court; (3) that the indictment was duplicitous, inconsistent, and vague; (4) that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict; (5) that the trial judge should have granted a continuance, rather than appoint Stewart to represent Kretske; (6) that Roth should have been severed from the other defendants; (7) that the reports of the Alcohol Tax Unit were hearsay; (7) that the two government exhibits not admitted into evidence were sent to the jury during its deliberations; (8) that Glasser had been cross-examined on matters not pertinent to the charge and not within the scope of his direct examination; (9) that the cross-examination of U.S. Attorney Campbell had been unduly restricted; (10) that evidence beyond the scope of the bill of particulars had been introduced; (11) that there was insufficient corroboration of the accomplice testimony against Kretske; (12) that certain testimony of Alexander Campbell was erroneously admitted; (13) that the admission of various prejudicial evidence had <b>the</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> denying the defendants a fair trial; (14) that the trial judge's cross-examination of witnesses and other comments crossed the line into advocacy; and (15) that the trial judge should have granted a new trial because of the exclusion of women from the jury pool.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} and {{responsibility}} for this exodus are highly controversial topics among commentators on the conflict and even historians who specialize in this era. Among the various possible causes, Efraim Karsh attributes the exodus mainly to Arab authorities' instructions to escape, whereas others argue that a policy of expulsion had been organized by the Yishuv authorities and implemented by Haganah. Others yet reject these two assumptions and see the exodus as <b>the</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> all the civil war's consequences.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> these conquests was {{to prompt}} the kings to appoint their younger sons to territories: the apanages or privileges. This policy {{would allow the}} kings to {{progressively}} impose royal authority on the provinces, since in practice, the apanages would return without difficulty, to the crown whether by inheritance or by confiscation. This happened for example, in Poitou, in 1271 and Anjou, in 1481. These were two provinces taken by conquest from the kings of England by Phillip Augustus and Louis VIII.|$|E

50|$|Financial {{liberalisation}} in {{the early}} 1990s and lax banking supervision had laid the seeds for the crisis, which was then triggered by <b>the</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> a collapse in the oil price, which led to sharply reduced government spending and weakened the Venezuelan economy.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> this {{campaign}} was severe; {{a quarter of}} all wartime sinkings – 3.1 million tons. There were several reasons for this. The American naval commander, Admiral Ernest King, as an apparent anglophobe, was averse to taking British recommendations to introduce convoys, U.S. Coast Guard and Navy patrols were predictable and could be avoided by U-boats, inter-service co-operation was poor, and the U.S. Navy did not possess enough suitable escort vessels (British and Canadian warships were transferred to the U.S. east coast).|$|E
25|$|Alcoholism {{does not}} have uniform effects on all families. The levels of {{dysfunction}} and resiliency of the non-alcoholic adults are important factors in effects on children in the family. Children of untreated alcoholics score lower on measures of family cohesion, intellectual-cultural orientation, active-recreational orientation, and independence. They {{have higher levels of}} conflict within the family, and many experience other family members as distant and non-communicative. In families with untreated alcoholics, <b>the</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the family dysfunction may affect the children's ability to grow in developmentally healthy ways.|$|E
25|$|In late 1944, the German {{defensive}} line now only extended from Denmark to Switzerland. This enabled British bombers to fly toward German territory without interception on the way. The German strength was thus reduced, with more aircraft diverted to reconnaissance over the North Sea {{in an attempt}} to pick up Allied bomber formations. In spite of the problems, the Luftwaffe night fighter force was stronger numerically than ever before. It remained intact and presented a theoretical threat to Bomber Command, particularly when the British made deep penetrations. However, since the first half of 1944, the outlook for the force had changed from increasing efficiency to a probability of declining effectiveness as <b>the</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> poor training, shortage of fuel, diversion of effort and shortage of manpower became perceptible.|$|E

30|$|In summary, the Southern Prealps {{illustrates}} {{the sensitivity of}} the upland environment to land use changes that occurred during the last 150 years.

25|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of insects}} {{that live in}} colonies, such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, {{has always been a}} source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects seem to do their own thing without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner. Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely self-organized. The group coordination that emerges is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, <b>the</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour that emerges in this way is sometimes called swarm intelligence.|$|E
25|$|There are {{preserved}} observations of solar and lunar eclipses from Babylonian astronomy and Chinese astronomy beginning from the 8th century BCE. These observations, {{as well as}} further astronomical historical records from astronomy in the medieval Islamic world and elsewhere, {{can be used to}} determine the actual changes in the rotation of the Earth over the last 27 centuries: The calculation to describe the place and time of eclipse is dependent on the rotation of the Earth. The ancient observations are consistent with the Earth having rotated a significant fraction of a total turn than would result from today's value of the speed of rotation would indicate: The Earth was turning ever faster throughout the past. <b>The</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the faster turn, of a magnitude of milliseconds per day per century, 36,525 days per century, shows up in a magnitude of hours and thousands of kilometers in observations. Scholars have combed the ancient records and calculated by modern models the magnitude of the long term historical slowing down of the Earth's rotation.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, an {{objection}} {{to a request}} for unanimous consent will compel a vote. While forcing a single vote {{may not be an}} effective delaying tool, <b>the</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> several votes, which take at least 15 minutes apiece, can be substantial. In addition to objecting to routine requests, senators can force votes through motions to adjourn and through quorum calls. Quorum calls are meant to establish {{the presence or absence of}} a constitutional quorum, but senators routinely use them to waste time while waiting for the next speaker to come to the floor or for leaders to negotiate off the floor. In those cases, a senator asks for unanimous consent to dispense with the quorum call. If another senator objects, the clerk must continue to call the roll of senators, just as they would with a vote. If a call shows no quorum, the minority can force another vote by moving to request or compel the attendance of absent senators. Finally, senators can force votes by moving to adjourn, or by raising specious points of order and appealing the ruling of the chair.|$|E
50|$|Flame retardants are {{effective}} in reducing the flammability of synthetic materials. The EPA has conducted an assessment of new flame retardants, such as 2,3,4,5-tetrabromo-ethylhexylbenzoate (TBB).
