40|$|Recently, {{there are}} several {{problems}} in space, infra-structure, and facility in the contiguity of existing harbors due to the trend of enlarged container vessels. In this regard, the Mobile Harbor has been proposed conceptually as an effective solution for those problems. This concept {{is a kind of}} <b>transfer</b> <b>loader</b> of the containers from the large container ship to the harbor on land, which is a floating barge of a catamaran type. The catamaran-type vessel is well known for its advantage in maneuverability, resistance, and the effectiveness for working on board. For the safe and effective operation of the two floating bodies, a container ship and the mobile harbor in the near sea apart from the quay, robot arms, novel crane systems, and pneumatic fenders are specially devised with additional mooring facility or DP(dynamic positioning) system. The concept is to be verified through comparison and simulation studies under various environmental conditions. It is shown that the proposed concept is in general feasible but {{there are several}} areas for further investigation and improvement...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHelicase <b>loaders</b> <b>transfer</b> the {{ring-shaped}} replicative helicases onto DNA. They assort {{into two}} classes: ring breakers, which place stabile hexameric rings on DNA via transient gaps at subunit interfaces; and helicase makers, which assemble hexameric rings around DNA from monomeric helicase units...|$|R
50|$|It is {{fitted with}} an {{auxiliary}} power unit to eliminate the need to run the main engine to keep the batteries charged while stationary; electrical servos drive the automated elevation, traverse, magazine, shell <b>transfer</b> arm and <b>loader</b> as well as power for electronics and communications.|$|R
50|$|The Detour was {{a choice}} of By Hand or By Machine. In By Hand, teams had to choose a two-ton tire and, by {{properly}} aligning the bolts and washers, finish securing it to a dump truck. When the work was complete, a foreman would hand them the next clue. In By Machine, each team member {{had to take a}} turn driving a huge front <b>loader,</b> <b>transfering</b> gravel. When they moved enough gravel to cover a marked yellow line on a stick, a foreman would hand them the next clue.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was later}} {{brought to the}} PC (circa 1990) as the x86 {{supports}} the trace vector {{the same as the}} 68000 processor does. (INT 1) It manifested itself in a slightly different way in that the game's executable code was encrypted and [...] "wrapped" [...] by the Copylock loader. At runtime this loader would read 4 sectors from the floppy, and generate checksums from them. These in turn would be used as the keys to decrypt the game code. Once the decryption was done, the <b>loader</b> <b>transferred</b> control to the game program.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>loader</b> <b>transfers</b> {{motion picture}} film from the manufacturer's {{light-tight}} canisters {{to the camera}} magazines for attachment to the camera by the 2nd AC. After exposure during filming, the loader then removes the film from the magazines and places {{it back into the}} light-tight cans for transport to the laboratory. It {{is the responsibility of the}} loader to manage the inventory of film and communicate with the 1st AC on the film usage and remaining stock throughout the day. On small production crews, this job is often combined with the 2nd AC. With the prevalence of digital photography, this role is taken on by the digital imaging technician.|$|R
40|$|Plants load sugars from photosynthesizing leaves {{into the}} phloem of {{exporting}} veins either “apoplastically” (by using H+/sucrose symporters) or “symplastically” (through plasmodesmata). The ability to regulate photosynthesis {{in response to}} the light environment was compared among apoplastic loaders (pea and spinach) and symplastic loaders (pumpkin and Verbascum phoeniceum). Plants were grown under low light (LL) or high light (HL) or transferred from LL to HL. Upon transfer, pea and spinach up-regulated photosynthesis to the level found in HL-acclimated plants, whereas up-regulation in pumpkin and V. phoeniceum was limited. The vein density of pea and spinach was the same in HL and LL. Although spinach did not exhibit anatomical or ultrastructural acclimation to the light environment, in pea, wall invaginations in minor vein companion (transfer) cells were more extensive in HL. Furthermore, upon transfer from LL to HL, these invaginations increased in mature pea leaves. Foliar starch levels in mature leaves of plants transferred from LL to HL were not greater than in HL-acclimated leaves of either apoplastically loading species. In the symplastic loaders, plasmodesmatal frequency per loading cell did not vary with treatment, but vein density and thus total plasmodesmatal frequency were higher in HL. Upon <b>transfer</b> of symplastic <b>loaders,</b> however, vein density remained low, and starch levels were higher than in HL; the incomplete acclimation of photosynthesis upon transfer is thus consistent with a carbon export capacity physically limited by an inability to increase vein and plasmodesmatal density in a mature leaf...|$|R
