5|$|On this planet, {{magic and}} {{witchcraft}} are quite normal. The Megans are an ageless species that had, at one time, lived on Earth, and {{were responsible for}} the legends about witches. During this time, the Enterprise crew begin to experiment with magic: Lt. Hikaru Sulu (voiced by George Takei) conjures up a beautiful woman while Science Officer Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) telepathically moves a Vulcan chess piece. Lucien, their guide, warns the crew that their experiments would draw unwanted attention, but it is too late. The Enterprise splits into two halves and disappears, and the crew are transported to a location on the planet <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be Salem during the middle of a witch trial in 1691.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1990s the {{function}} of the cerebellum was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have brought that view into question. Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown interactions between the cerebellum and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be confined to the cerebellum. In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children. Estimates based on functional mapping of the cerebellum using functional MRI suggest {{that more than half of}} the cerebellar cortex is interconnected with association zones of the cerebral cortex.|$|E

Quatermass and Colonel Breen, recently appointed to lead the Rocket Group over Quatermass's objections, become intrigued by the site. As more of the artefact is uncovered additional fossils are found, which Roney dates to five million years, suggesting that the object is at least that old. The interior is empty, and a symbol of five intersecting circles, which Roney identifies as the occult pentacle, is etched on a wall <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> conceal an inner chamber.|$|E
5|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that spiders' coloration is camouflage that helps them to evade their major predators, birds and parasitic wasps, {{both of which have}} good color vision. Many spider species are colored so as to merge with their most common backgrounds, and some have disruptive coloration, stripes and blotches that break up their outlines. In a few species, such as the Hawaiian happy-face spider, Theridion grallator, several coloration schemes are present in a ratio <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> remain constant, and this may {{make it more difficult for}} predators to recognize the species. Most spiders are insufficiently dangerous or unpleasant-tasting for warning coloration to offer much benefit. However, a few species with powerful venoms, large jaws or irritant hairs have patches of warning colors, and some actively display these colors when threatened.|$|E
5|$|With a stocky, {{powerful}} build, the Exmoor pony {{is strong}} for its height, and {{noted for its}} hardiness and endurance. The chest is deep and the back broad, the croup level. The legs are short, with good bone and hard hooves. Although many sources state that the Exmoor has a distinctly different jaw structure from other horse breeds, which includes the beginnings of development of a seventh molar, this is a misunderstanding based on an incorrect translation of a German study. The study, when properly translated, refers to a feature, found in multiple horse breeds and perhaps all animals with sizable lower jaws, <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be an extra branch of blood supply in the area. While an extra tooth may have eventually developed from this extra blood supply, its frequency among the general horse population makes its appearance in the Exmoor pony unremarkable.|$|E

5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli {{was seated}} on Kola or Kolu, an island <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> refer to Coll or perhaps Colonsay. The saga also states that Gilli {{was married to}} Sigurðr's sister, Hvarflǫð. This marital {{alliance}} appears to further evince the southward extension of Sigurðr's influence. This union, along with the record of apparent amiable dealings with Sigurðr's associates, suggests that Gilli and Sigurðr indeed enjoyed close relations. The earl's family was clearly not adverse to marrying into native dynasties, as Sigurðr's own mother {{was the daughter of}} an Irish king, whilst his wife was the daughter of a Scottish king. In fact, the aforesaid sources appear to indicate that Gilli operated in the Hebrides as a tributary earl to his brother-in-law. Certainly, Eyrbyggja saga states that Sigurðr left menn ("agents") in the Hebrides to collect tax from Mann, whilst Orkneyinga saga reveals that, at a later period in time, Sigurðr's son and successor, Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065), tasked a member of his own wife's family, Kálfr Árnason (died 1051), to impose Orcadian authority in the Isles.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} continues, {{several of the}} vessels are {{destroyed}} by explosions. The Doctor suspects that the crew aboard the Buccaneer, a 17th-century pirate ship, responsible {{as it was the}} closest vessel at the time of destruction. Turlough, while attempting to escape control of the Black Guardian, ends up aboard the Buccaneer, and meets the Eternal Captain Wrack, learning she too is working for the Black Guardian. He finds equipment aboard her ship <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be the source of the device destroying the other ships and hears the Black Guardian's voice nearby. Later, Wrack offers the Edwardian officers a reception aboard her ship. During the reception, Turlough demonstrates the equipment to the Doctor, while Wrack gifts Tegan with a tiara with a red crystal. After the reception and continuation of the race, the Doctor sees the Buccaneer nearing the Edwardian ship, and determines that the red crystal is used as a focal point of the weapon, and gets rid of the tiara before Wrack can destroy the ship.|$|E
5|$|Surveys have {{revealed}} {{an average of}} 436 structures per square kilometer (1118 per square mile) in the site core, falling to 244 structures/km² (626/square mile) in the periphery. At its height in the Late Preclassic, the population has been estimated at 1600 in the site core with a further 8000 dispersed through the periphery, to produce an estimated total population of almost ten thousand. In the Early Classic the population suffered a severe decline, population is estimated to have dropped to 34% of peak population. In the Late to Terminal Classic the population increased to 85% of its Late Preclassic level, an expansion <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have occurred rapidly and spread to {{all parts of the}} site, perhaps as the result of an influx of refugees arriving from other sites around AD 830. This was followed by a population crash to 14% of peak Preclassic population in the Early Postclassic (AD 9001200) prior to the complete abandonment of the site.|$|E
