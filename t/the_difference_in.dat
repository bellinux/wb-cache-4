5|$|<b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> {{the hearing}} ranges for octopus and bigfin reef squids may be {{explained}} by <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> their habitats. The octopus is demersal (bottom-dwelling) with excellent camouflage capabilities. Bigfin reef squids, on the other hand, are usually in open water with limited hiding places. Hearing would thus be more important for the squids to escape predators. The ability to hear is particularly relevant for avoiding mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti (particularly dolphins), who use echolocation to find prey.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} the venom of four Sistrurus pit viper species found {{significant}} variation in the toxicity to mice. This variation {{was related to the}} proportion of small mammals in the diet of those species. The idea that Sistrurus venom had evolved to accommodate a mammal-based diet was supported by phylogenetic analysis. The researchers suggested that the basis for <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> toxicity was <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> muscle physiology in the various prey animals. Two lineages of elapid snakes, common sea snakes and Laticauda sea kraits, have independently colonized marine environments, and shifted to a very simple diet based on teleosts, or ray-finned fish. A 2005 study found that both these lineages have a much simpler set of venom proteins than their terrestrial relatives on the Australian continent, which have a more varied and complex diet. These findings were confirmed by a 2012 study, which compared the venoms of Toxicocalamus longissimus, a terrestrial species, and Hydrophis cyanocinctus, a marine species, both within the subfamily Hydrophiinae (which is also within the Elapid family). Despite being closely related to one another, the marine species had a significantly simpler set of venom proteins. The venoms of the sea snakes are nonetheless among the most toxic venoms known. It has been argued that since sea snakes are typically unable to prevent the escape of bitten prey, their venoms have evolved to act very rapidly.|$|E

40|$|I {{address the}} causes of the gender wage gap with a new dynamic model of wage, hours, and job changes that permits me to {{decompose}} the gap into a portion due to gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> preferences for part-time work and in constraints.

I find that <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> preferences explain no more than 5 % of the gender gap in hourly wages and 7 - 20 % of the gender gap <b>in</b> weekly wages. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> constraints, mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mean offered wages, explain the remaining gender wage gap.

5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw to make up <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> length and account for tooth wear on the teeth {{at the tip of the}} snout. However, <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a topâ€“bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:In {{comparison}} with the ITRF 2000 model, the ITRF 2005 model represents a significant improvement in solution generation, datum definition and realization. However, these improvements cause a frame <b>difference</b> between <b>the</b> ITRF 2000 and ITRF 2005 models, which may impact GNSS data processing. To quantify this impact, <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> of <b>the</b> GNSS results obtained using the two models, including station coordinates, baseline length and horizontal velocity field, were analyzed. After transformation, <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> position were at the millimeter level, and <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> baseline length were less than 1 mm. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> horizontal velocity fields decreased with as the study area was reduced.
