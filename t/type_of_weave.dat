40|$|Background Tens of {{millions}} of people live in mosquito-infested regions and controlling mosquito-borne diseases {{is one of the major}} interventions aimed at alleviating poverty worldwide. The use of insecticide-treated textiles is one of the most widespread control measures. This includes bed nets, battle clothing or, more generally, textiles use for clothing. These textiles are generally treated with permethrin as active ingredient, which is dosed after extraction of the active molecule present throughout the fabric (measured in mg permethrin/g of fabric) and does not take the effective concentration on the textile surfaces into account. The objective of this study was to propose an improved dosage method that enables measurement of the bioavailable or effective part of active ingredients on the surface of textile treated with insecticides. Methods The proposed method relies on mechanical extraction of active molecules on the surface of the textile in direct contact with either the skin or with the targeted arthropod. Results The results showed that the amount of permethrin measured using the current method is about 200 times higher than the effective surface concentration of the insecticide. In addition, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>weave</b> or knit influences the effective concentrations of permethrin on the surface of the textile. With the current dosage method, the variation in the concentration of permethrin depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>weave</b> is maximum 8 %, whereas with the proposed method, it varies by about 50 %. These results were confirmed by bioassays, in which the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>weave</b> significantly affected (p < 10 − 3) the 100 % knockdown time of Anopheles gambiae. Conclusions The bioefficacy of insecticide treatments of fabrics is directly correlated with the effective concentration of insecticide on the textile surface, which can be quantified using the method proposed. This improved method could be used to redefine the limits of actual concentrations of active substance after assessment of the bioefficacy of the treatment and the risk to human health. Further, it enables assessments of the kinetics of insecticide migration in the case of long-lasting insecticide treatment. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the values of}} elastic {{constants}} of woven fabrics for different angles of exten-sion direction were analysed. Four types of fabric samples of different raw material com-position and the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>weave</b> were tested under tensile forces in seven directions oriented with a 15 ° increment {{with respect to the}} weft direction. The elasticity modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the woven fabrics were determined experimentally in a laboratory. Based on the experimentally obtained values, theoretically calculated elastic constants for arbitrarily chosen fabric directions were calculated. A good agreement between the experi-mental results and values of the elastic constants calculated was shown, hence the theoreti-cal equations can be used with high accuracy to calculate the elastic constants of fabric in various directions. Therefore the measurements need to be undertaken when the tensile force is acting on the fabric only in the warp, weft and at an angle of 45 °.

40|$|Yarn made {{of natural}} and {{man-made}} cellulose fibres is nowadays commonly applied in textiles. It is already apparent {{that the type of}} raw material and fabric structure influences the properties of the fin-ished goods. The main aim of this paper was to present a comparative analysis of thermal insulation properties (such as thermal conductivity, absorption and thermal resistance) of fabrics made of cotton and Tencel. 6 samples of cotton fabrics and 9 samples of fabrics from Tencel yarns were produced for the purpose of these tests. All fabrics had warp and weft yarns of nominal linear density of 20 tex. Three kinds of weaves were applied: plain, combined and twill with nominal warp and weft densities of 320 /dm. The measurements were carried out on finished fabrics {{with the use of the}} ALAMBETA device. The results are presented graphically and discussed.

40|$|A routine {{task for}} art historians is {{painting}} diagnostics, such as dating or attribution. Signal processing of the X-ray {{image of a}} canvas provides useful information about its fabric. However, previous methods may fail when very old and deteriorated artworks or simply canvases of small size are studied. We present a new framework to analyze and further characterize the paintings from their radiographs. First, we start from a general analysis of lattices and provide new unifying results about the theoretical spectra of weaves. Then, we use these results to infer the main structure of the fabric, like the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>weave</b> and the thread densities. We propose a practical estimation of these theoretical results from paintings with the averaged power spectral density (PSD), which provides a more robust tool.

40|$|Fabric Porosity is an {{important}} property in determining the functional properties of a fabric. It relates to the count of a yarn {{as well as to}} the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>weave.</b> Twill and satin cotton woven fabrics in three different weft densities (warp density kept constant) were used to investigate the effect of porosity on the dyeuptake within one weave. The effects of change in weave type, keeping yarn densities the same, on the porosity were also investigated. Objective determination of porosity was carried out using an image analysis technique while, colour yield was determined using K/S values. Higher the weft density in a satin fabric low will be the porosity of that fabric. Porosity values varied from 6. 85 - 10. 98 % for S 1 and S 3 respectively. However, for the twill fabric no substantial change in porosity have been observed as the porosity values varied from 6. 4 - 5. 3 % for T 1 and T 3 respectively. Colour strengths for S 1 and T 1 are lower than S 3 and T 3 respectively for all the primary colours at 0. 25, 1. 00 and 2. 00 % depth levels.
