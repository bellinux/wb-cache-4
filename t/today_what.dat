25|$|In the 100 years since, others such as Robert Golka {{have built}} {{equipment}} similar to Tesla's, but long-distance power transmission {{has not been}} demonstrated, and the scientific consensus is his World Wireless system would not have worked. Contemporary scientists point out that while Tesla's coils (with appropriate antennas) can function as radio transmitters, transmitting {{energy in the form}} of radio waves, the frequency he used, around 150kHz, is far too low for practical long-range power transmission. At these wavelengths the radio waves spread out in all directions and cannot be focused on a distant receiver.

25|$|Joe H. Gill and his {{engineering}} friends thoughtfully considered {{how to make}} {{a holiday}} of April Fool's Day. After an unsuccessful attempt involving tying cans around dogs' tails and releasing them to disrupt class, the group of students saw a wooden statue about five feet high while getting refreshments, which they requested to borrow. The next day, Gill presented the statue as their patron saint and traced his ancestry back to ancient times between classes. The presentation successfully broke up classes, and led to his christening as Alexander Frederick Claire, patron saint of UT engineers, exactly one year later. Alec {{was at the center of}} a friendly rivalry between law and engineering students for many years, and was subject to numerous escapades such as kidnappings and amputations. <b>Today,</b> <b>what</b> is left of the original wooden statue is safely preserved in the engineering library.|$|E

25|$|From the mid-18th century, {{what is now}} Wyckoff was a {{community}} within Franklin Township, formed on June 1, 1797, when Saddle River Township (now Saddle Brook) was split, which consisted of most of northern Bergen County west of the Saddle River. Starting in the 1840s, several new municipalities were created from portions of Franklin Township (Pompton Township on April 10, 1797, Hohokus Township (now Mahwah) on April 9, 1849, and Ridgewood Township on March 30, 1876; remaining now the Village of Ridgewood), so that <b>today</b> <b>what</b> is now Wyckoff borders eight different communities. Wyckoff was formed as a township {{by an act of}} the New Jersey Legislature on November 2, 1926, replacing Franklin Township, {{based on the results of}} a referendum held that day. Portions of Wyckoff were ceded to Midland Park based on the results of a referendum held on June 9, 1931.|$|E
25|$|The street {{layout of}} modern central Sydney {{is based upon}} a street plan {{established}} by Macquarie. The colony's most prestigious buildings were built on Macquarie Street. Some of these still stand <b>today.</b> <b>What</b> has survived of the Georgian 'Rum Hospital' serves as the Parliament House {{of the state of}} New South Wales. It is probable that the hospital was designed by Macquarie himself, in collaboration with his wife. The building's wide verandas were evidently inspired by Macquarie's familiarity with English colonial architecture in India. The elaborate stables which Macquarie commissioned for Government House are part of the modern structure housing the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. Both of these buildings were constructed by Macquarie in defiance of the British government's ban on expensive public building projects in the colony and reflect the tension between Macquarie's vision of Sydney as a Georgian city and the British government's view of the colony as a dumping ground for convicts to be financed as cheaply as possible.|$|E

[...] The developers contacted over 2,000 people in order to obtain recording and publishing rights. They even hired a private investigator to locate the relatives of late Skatt Bros. member Sean Delaney to license the band's song [...] "Walk the Night". Citing sources close to the deals, Billboard reported that Rockstar paid as much as $5,000 per composition and another $5,000 per master recording per track. Developers originally considered letting players purchase music by going to an in-game record shop and for Niko to have an MP3 player, but both ideas were cut. DJ Green Lantern produced tracks exclusively for the game's hip-hop radio station The Beat 102.7. Record label owner and record producer Bobby Konders, who hosts the in-game radio station Massive B Soundsystem 96.9, went through the extra effort of flying to Jamaica to get dancehall artists to re-record tracks to make references to the boroughs of Liberty City.|$|E

Samaras went on to score his first goal of the 2011–12 season in a 5–0 win over St Mirren. Manager Neil Lennon said that; [...] "He got his goal, which we've been waiting on a long time. His play was fantastic. He is a talent and all we are asking for is consistency. He has shown everyone <b>today</b> <b>what</b> he is capable of when he is in full flow.

He had been playing as a left midfielder in the previous few weeks, and the Daily Record said that his good form since returning to the team had helped re-ignite Celtic's season. On 24 December, Samaras started as a striker and scored twice as Celtic beat Kilmarnock 2–1.|$|E
