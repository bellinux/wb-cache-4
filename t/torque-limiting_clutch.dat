50|$|Such {{mechanisms}} are not often found since the {{rack and pinion}} is generally more robust for the same job. However the capstan and bowstring is easily fabricated by the home builder from scratch, where accurate rack and pinion {{mechanisms are}} not, and also require much looser tolerances between the working parts. The angle between the capstan shaft and the linear element can also be variable without any special couplings needed, such as universal joints. The cable is typically steel and can be tensioned at the points where it {{is connected to the}} bow. Another feature of the capstan and bowstring is that it can be designed to slip at the ends of its travel if desired by the simple expedient of having the cable slip around the capstan, forming a simple <b>torque-limiting</b> <b>clutch.</b> Capstan and bowstring mechanisms can be used wherever a rack and pinion or other rotary-to-linear conversion is found, such as in the steering mechanism of vehicles, etc.|$|E
50|$|For 2006, the {{swingarm}} {{was extended}} by 20 mm to reduce acceleration instability. In this year, Yamaha also released a limited edition version in original Yamaha racing colors to celebrate its 50th anniversary. The model (LE/SP) had a Kenny Roberts {{front and rear}} custom Ã–hlins suspension units developed by the same team as the YZR-M1 MotoGP bike. Custom forged aluminum Marchesini wheels specifically designed for the LE shaved nearly a pound off the unsprung weight. A back <b>torque-limiting</b> slipper <b>clutch,</b> and an integrated lap timer rounded out the package, making the LE virtually a production racer. Only 500 units were made for the United States with another 500 units for Europe.|$|R
5000|$|The sporty Pacer sedan was {{available}} again, but whereas the VF Pacer was only offered {{with the one}} power output, the new VG Pacer offered 3 {{different versions of the}} new 245 Hemi-6 engine, though Chrysler Australia didn't publish any power output figures for the Pacers. The standard Pacer had a 2-barrel carburettor and produced [...] Option E31 produced [...] and included a two-barrel carburettor, higher-performance camshaft, smaller fan, and windage tray. Option E34 produced [...] and included a 4-barrel carburettor, high-performance camshaft, dual-plate clutch, manual choke, modified instrument cluster, torque-limiting engine mount strut, larger radiator, smaller fan, windage tray, premium engine bearings, shot-peened crankshaft and connecting rods, and high-capacity oil pump. Option E35 included a 4-barrel carburettor, high-performance camshaft, heavy-duty engine bearings, a dual-plate <b>clutch,</b> <b>torque-limiting</b> engine mount strut, and the ordinary Pacer-spec transmission.|$|R
