5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront {{emerging from}} a point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the {{two parts of the}} wavefront to travel <b>through</b> <b>different</b> paths, allows them to recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E
5|$|All {{images from}} Hubble are {{monochromatic}} grayscale, in which its cameras incorporate {{a variety of}} filters each passing specific wavelengths of light. Color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken <b>through</b> <b>different</b> filters. This process can also create false-color versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue.|$|E

5|$|In 1886, Henry P. Ives {{sold his}} {{remaining}} inventory to George S. Parker. George S. Parker reprinted the green cover label to read H. P. Ives, Geo. S.

Parker & Co., part of them in 1887 and the rest of them in 1888. The green printing and circle end space remained <b>through</b> <b>different</b> lithographers until 1886.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{gameplay}} {{elements were}} directly taken from Far Cry 3. Exotic locations, hunting, {{and the freedom}} for players to complete missions <b>through</b> <b>different</b> approaches were maintained in Far Cry 4. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make Far Cry 4 an evolution for the series. As a result, {{the size of the}} game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons. The team also realized that players {{spent a lot of time}} interacting with the open world of Far Cry 3, and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Galaxy is set {{in outer}} space, where Mario travels <b>through</b> <b>different</b> galaxies to collect Power Stars, earned by {{completing}} missions, defeating a boss, or reaching a particular area. Each galaxy contains planetoids and orbiting structures for the player to explore. Each astronomical object has its own gravitational force, allowing the player to completely circumnavigate the planetoids, walking sideways or upside down. The player can usually jump from one independent object and fall towards another one nearby. Although the main gameplay is in 3D, there are several areas in the game in which the player's movements are restricted to a 2-dimensional plane.|$|E

5|$|Tomato plants over-expressing systemin {{produced}} more {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) than normal plants and parasitoid wasps found them more attractive. Systemin also upregulates the expression of genes involved {{in the production of}} biologically active VOCs. Such a response is crucial if antinutritional defences are to be effective, since without predators, developing insects would consume more plant material while completing their development. It is likely that VOC production is upregulated <b>through</b> <b>different</b> pathways, including oxylipin pathway that synthesises jasmonic acid aldehydes and alcohols that function in wound healing.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{spacecraft}} travelling through space. Minogue enters a small room in the spacecraft, wearing a pink spacesuit, and subsequently takes off her helmet and gloves; intercut scenes through the video has the spacecraft travelling <b>through</b> <b>different</b> space fields and atmospheres. By the first chorus, Minogue starts taking off parts of her spacesuit whilst spaceman from different rooms witness her. Next, she turns on a machine that projects smoke and distracts them. She then becomes fully nude by the second chorus; this marks Minogue's first video {{that she has been}} nude in until her 2001 advert campaign with Agent Provocateur. Another spaceman witnesses Minogue nude but covers herself with a red blanket, and closes the window. The video ends with Minogue laying on a soft bedding, turning the lights off, and the spacecraft traveling to another destination.|$|E
5|$|Working in his {{laboratory}} {{to develop new}} corrosion-resistant metals for auto parts, Haynes discovered that mixing tungsten with chromium, steel and iron resulted {{in the formation of}} strong and lightweight alloys that were impervious to corrosion, and could endure high temperatures. In 1912, he formed Haynes Stellite Company to produce one of the new alloys, and received lucrative contracts during World War I, making Haynes a millionaire in 1916. He sold his patent for stainless steel to the American Stainless Steel Company in exchange for enough stock to gain a seat at the company's board of directors, a position he held for 12 years. He merged the Haynes Stellite company with Union Carbide in 1920. After passing <b>through</b> <b>different</b> owners, the company was renamed and is now called Haynes International. Haynes returned his focus to his automotive company, but in the economic recession of the 1920s the business went bankrupt and was liquidated.|$|E
