5|$|Petronas, a Malaysian {{national}} {{oil and gas}} company, {{was formed}} in 1974. As a result, a concession system was changed into production sharing contract system (PSC) between Shell and Petronas. All the foreign oil companies including Shell required to obtain licenses from Petronas. The first two PSCs were signed on 30 November 1976. Foreign oil companies are required to keep not more than 41% of the oil produced until their original costs are recovered. After a return of their investments, the oil companies will keep 30% of the revenue after all operating costs and oil royalties are deducted. Petronas also formed a company named Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd which was {{directly involved in the}} exploration, development, and production of oil and gas in the country. Petronas also initiated the Baram Delta Gas Gathering (Bardegg) project which involves the collection and compression of gas from five fields, namely Betty, Bekor, Baram, Baronia, and West Lutong, located 10km to 45km offshore from Miri. This is to ensure <b>the</b> <b>minimisation</b> of gas loss during oil production. Petronas and Shell are also involved in educational outreach activities such as awarding scholarships to deserving students. Both companies are also involved in Malaysian first rig-to-reef project, in an effort to preserve bio-marine life in the sea offshore Miri. In this project, an abandoned offshore platform was made {{to become part of the}} Siwa reef. Both companies also started to establish Piasau Nature Reserve in 2014.|$|E

500|$|The {{attitude}} (orientation) of {{the station}} was independently determined {{by a set of}} externally mounted sun, star and horizon sensors. [...] Attitude information was conveyed between updates by rate sensors. Attitude control was maintained by a combination of two mechanisms; in order to hold a set attitude, a system of twelve control moment gyroscopes (CMGs, or [...] "gyrodynes") rotating at 10,000rpm kept the station oriented, six CMGs being located in each of the Kvant-1 and Kvant-2 modules. When the attitude {{of the station}} needed to be changed, the gyrodynes were disengaged, thrusters (including those mounted directly to the modules, and the VDU thruster used for roll control mounted to the Sofora girder) were used to attain the new attitude and the CMGs were reengaged. This was done fairly regularly depending on experimental needs; for instance, Earth or astronomical observations required that the instrument recording images be continuously aimed at the target, and so the station was oriented to make this possible. Conversely, materials processing experiments required <b>the</b> <b>minimisation</b> of movement on board the station, and so Mir would be oriented in a gravity gradient attitude for stability. Prior to the arrival of the modules containing these gyrodynes, the station's attitude was controlled using thrusters located on the core module alone, and, in an emergency, the thrusters on docked Soyuz spacecraft could be used to maintain the station's orientation.|$|E

All were interviewed with the SF- 36 Health Survey Questionnaire to measure health related quality of life and with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADs] to measure psychological morbidity. More clients from <b>the</b> harm <b>minimisation</b> programme had previous psychiatric problems than clients on the methadone maintenance programme, with an odds ratio of 4. 3 CI (1. 2, 15. 2). On the HADs clients on the methadone maintenance programme had significantly lower depression scores than clients on <b>the</b> harm <b>minimisation</b> programme. In addition more clients on <b>the</b> harm <b>minimisation</b> programme were severely depressed than clients on the methadone maintenance programme.

Although clients on a methadone maintenance programme had an improved perception of their quality of life in relation to psychological and overall health function from the previous year, compared to clients on a harm minimisation programme, there still existed varying degrees of psychopathology in both groups which needs to be considered when providing future services for drug users...|$|R

60|$|The real Dutch Patriotic {{party is}} not {{to be found in the}} Transvaal, but in the Cape Colony. Their object, which, as affairs now are, is well within the bounds of possibility, is by fair means or foul to swamp the English element in South Africa, and to {{establish}} a great Dutch Republic. It was this party, which consists of clever and well educated men, who raised the outcry against the Transvaal Annexation, because it meant an enormous extension of English influence, and who had the wit, by means of their emissaries and newspapers, to work upon the feeling of the ignorant Transvaal farmers until they persuaded them to rebel; and finally, to avail themselves of the yearnings of English radicalism for the disruption of the Empire and <b>the</b> <b>minimisation</b> of British authority, to get the Annexation cancelled. All through this business the Boers have more or less danced in obedience to strings pulled at Cape Town, and it is now said that one of the chief wire-pullers, Mr. Hofmeyer, is to be asked to become President of the Republic. These men are the real patriots of South Africa, and very clever ones too, not the Transvaal Boers, who vapour about their blood and their country and the accursed Englishman to order, and are in reality influenced by very small motives, such as the desire to avoid payment of taxes, or to hunt away a neighbouring Englishman, whose civilisation and refinement are as offensive as his farm is desirable. Such are the Dutch inhabitants of the Transvaal. I will now give a short sketch of their institutions as they were before the Annexation, and to which the community has reverted since its recision, with, I believe, but few alterations.|$|E
40|$|Automata minimisation is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} key computational resources that drive the cost of computation. Most of <b>the</b> conventional <b>minimisation</b> techniques are based on the notion of bisimulation to determine equivalent states which can be identified. Although minimisation of automata has been an established topic of research, the optimisation of automata works in constrained environments is a novel idea which we will examine in this dissertation, along with a motivating, non-trivial application to efficient tamper-proof hardware compilation. This thesis introduces a new notion of equivalence, coherent equivalence, between states of a transducer. It is weaker than the usual notions of bisimulation, so it leads to more states being identified as equivalent. This new equivalence relation can be utilised to aggressively optimise transducers by reducing the number of states, a technique which we call coherent minimisation. We note that <b>the</b> coherent <b>minimisation</b> always outperforms <b>the</b> conventional <b>minimisation</b> algorithms. <b>The</b> main result of this thesis is that <b>the</b> coherent <b>minimisation</b> is sound and compositional. In order to support more realistic applications to hardware synthesis, we also introduce a refined model of transducers, which we call symbolic finite states transducers that can model systems which involve very large or infinite data-types. ...|$|R
