5000|$|The <b>thrush-like</b> <b>wren</b> (Campylorhynchus turdinus) is a South American {{species of}} {{bird in the}} family Troglodytidae, the wrens. As {{suggested}} by its common and scientific name, its size and coloration are vaguely reminiscent of that of a thrush, although the general impression it gives in life is very different {{and not at all}} [...] "thrush-like".|$|E
50|$|The <b>thrush-like</b> <b>wren</b> inhabits {{three main}} regions; {{each with its}} own subspecies. C. turdinus hypostictus is found in the {{southern}} and western Amazon Rainforest in south-eastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, northern Bolivia and Amazonian Brazil south of the Amazon River. The paler, greyer and much more uniform C. t. unicolor is found in the drier and more open wooded habitats in the Pantanal of Brazil, eastern Bolivia, Paraguay and far northern Argentina (where range is expanding). The nominate subspecies, C. t. turdinus, resembles C. t. hypostictus both in habitat preference and morphology, and is found in the narrow coastal belt of Atlantic moist forests in eastern Brazil from near Salvador da Bahia in north to Esp√≠rito Santo in south. It is relatively common in most of its range.|$|E
