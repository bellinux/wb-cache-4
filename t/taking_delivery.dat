5|$|During the 1970s, Douglas DC-8s {{were also}} taken into use. Pan American World Airways had flights to New York City from 1967 to 1973 and from 1976 to 1978. Braathens SAFE started <b>taking</b> <b>delivery</b> of Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s in 1969, and these {{gradually}} took {{over most of}} the domestic routes. In 1970, Air France and Swissair started flying to Fornebu from Paris and Zurich, respectively. They were supplemented by Aeroflot's Moscow route in 1972.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, President Barack Obama asked Secretary of Defense Robert Gates about {{placing the}} project on hold or {{canceling}} it because of its high cost: over $13billion for the planned 28 helicopters. In June 2009, the U.S. Navy terminated the contract after spending about $4.4 billion and <b>taking</b> <b>delivery</b> of nine VH-71s. In {{the aftermath of the}} cancellation, the delivered helicopters were sold onto Canada for $164 million, where they were used as a source of spare parts for its fleet of AgustaWestland CH-149 Cormorant search-and-rescue helicopters.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, IndiGo was the second-fastest-growing {{low-cost}} carrier in Asia behind Indonesian airline Lion Air. In February 2013, {{following the}} announcement of the civil aviation ministry that it would allow IndiGo to take delivery of only five aircraft that year, the airline planned to introduce low-cost regional flights by setting up a subsidiary. Later, IndiGo announced that it planned to seek permission from the ministry to acquire four more aircraft, therefore <b>taking</b> <b>delivery</b> of nine aircraft in 2013. As of March 2014, IndiGo is the second-largest low-cost carrier in Asia in terms of seats flown.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 the Syrian Air Force was {{reportedly}} <b>taking</b> <b>deliveries</b> of 8 examples of new MiG-31E from Russia, {{as well as}} the MiG-29SMT and Yak-130, although delivery of the MiG-31s may have been cancelled by Russia due to pressure from Western governments.|$|R
5000|$|The airline began {{service with}} Piper PA-31 Navajo {{aircraft}}. Later, Dornier Do 228, Beechcraft Model 99s, and Embraer 120 Brasilia's were added.

50|$|When Mesa started <b>taking</b> <b>deliveries</b> of the CRJ in 1997, it {{returned}} to two Fokker 70 jets {{and placed the}} CRJs in service in Phoenix. Mesa started an independent hub providing CRJ service from Fort Worth Meacham to Houston, San Antonio, Austin, and from Colorado Springs to Nashville and San Antonio. This effort proved to be unsuccessful and the service from Fort Worth ended {{in less than a}} year.|$|R
5|$|In May 2013, the Federal {{government}} {{announced plans to}} purchase twelve Boeing EA-18G Growlers to supplement the Super Hornet fleet. No.6 Squadron was expected to begin <b>taking</b> <b>delivery</b> of the Growlers in 2017; on 1 December 2016 its Super Hornets were transferred to No.1 Squadron. As of 2014, the squadron was expected to achieve initial operating capability with the Growlers in June 2018 and full operating capacity in 2022. On 7 July 2017 the delivery of last of the EA-18G Growlers was completed.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April 1945, 134 B-17 Flying Fortresses {{bombed the}} field at Parchim. In two days, I./JG 1 {{relocated}} to a nearby airfield at Ludwigslust. They moved again a week later to Leck. Around this time, II./JG 1 had moved to airfield at Marienehe and also started <b>taking</b> <b>delivery</b> of the He 162. These new jet aircraft would never see widespread combat with JG 1 due to their late introduction and a shortage of pilots, aircraft and fuel. JG 1 could no longer field their full complement or effectively fly operations as required.|$|E
5|$|As the 1930s progressed and {{the economy}} improved, the Greyhound Corporation began to prosper again. In 1934, {{intercity}} bus lines (of which Greyhound was the largest) carried approximately 400,000,000 passengers—nearly as many passengers as the Class I railroads. The film It Happened One Night (1934) centered on an heiress (Claudette Colbert) traveling by Greyhound bus with a reporter (Clark Gable). The movie is credited by the company for spurring bus travel nationwide. In 1935, national intercity bus ridership climbed 50% to 651,999,000 passengers, surpassing the volume of passengers carried by the Class I railroads for the first time. In 1935 Wickman was able to announce record profits of $8 million. In 1936, already the largest bus carrier in the United States, Greyhound began <b>taking</b> <b>delivery</b> of 306 new buses.|$|E
50|$|In November 1997, Mesa {{negotiated}} a code share agreement {{to provide service}} to US Airways as US Airways Express for 14 regional jets to various cities from its Philadelphia and Charlotte hubs. In 1998 and 2000, the agreement was expanded to 28 jets and then to 52 jets. The first CRJ200 aircraft began operating in 1998. As Mesa began <b>taking</b> <b>deliveries</b> of the Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft in 2000, the CRJs were transferred to the America West division, separating the fleet types.|$|R
5000|$|Tesco {{tried to}} hide its policy of buying {{directly}} from UK suppliers from Irish people. An internal document said that ensuring its policy of <b>taking</b> <b>deliveries</b> directly from UK suppliers went unnoticed and [...] "invisible to the Irish customer" [...] was a key objective.

50|$|In 2005, Westwood One, Inc. and its traffic subsidiary, Metro Networks, sent several {{existing}} {{officers and}} directors of Westwood to Canada and Australia to unify {{a number of}} helicopter aviation companies that were already providing reports to Westwood One and Metro Networks' affiliates. The result was the incorporation of a company called Global Traffic Network, which began <b>taking</b> <b>deliveries</b> of Robinson R44 news helicopters in 2005. The companies signed a three-way content and data sharing agreement in November 2005, {{which is part of}} documents on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in Washington, D.C.|$|R
5|$|Between 1970 and 1973, as a stop-gap pending {{delivery}} of the long-delayed General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber, Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons flew leased F-4E Phantoms. No.2 Squadron continued to fly Canberras until it was disbanded in 1982. After <b>taking</b> <b>delivery</b> of their F-111Cs in 1973, Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons operated the type for 37 years through numerous upgrades, augmented in the mid-1990s by ex-USAF Gmodels. The forward air control unit joined No.82 Wing in 2002. In 2010, the wing retired its F-111s {{and replaced them with}} Super Hornets as an interim force until the planned entry into Australian service of the F-35 LightningII Joint Strike Fighter. Twelve Boeing EA-18G Growlers are scheduled to augment the Super Hornet fleet from 2017.|$|E
5|$|Servicing of No. 32 Squadron {{passed from}} the RAF to the private company Fields Aviation Services in April 1985, then to Lovaux Aircraft Servicing in 1990. In 1991, the Station Flight was established, <b>taking</b> <b>delivery</b> of two Britten-Norman Islanders in December which entered service in January 1992. No. 32 Squadron celebrated its Diamond Jubilee in 1991, {{at a time when}} {{personnel}} became involved in operations during the Gulf War. No. 38 Group RAF assumed control of RAF Northolt on 2 November 1992 following a wider restructuring of the RAF. On 16 December 1994, the new southside Operations Building opened, replacing the old Northolt Airport Terminal building. With the reorganisation of RAF Strike Command on 1 April 2000, No. 38 Group was disbanded and Northolt came under the control of No. 2 Group RAF.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the section}} of the Kolsås Line in Bærum closed due to {{disagreements}} between the two counties of Oslo and Akershus on how much Akershus should pay to purchase services from Oslo Sporveier. After a year of replacement buses, the line was reopened, only to be closed again in 2006 for an upgrade to metro standard. Disagreements between the two counties means the upgrade will be done separately on {{the two sides of the}} municipal boundary, with the Oslo side opening first. By 2010, the upgraded part had reached Bjørnsletta station in Oslo. In 2003, the Ring Line opened from Ullevål Stadion station on the Sognsvann Line to Storo station. The line will create a loop, which will connect to neighbourhoods such as Nydalen and Bjerke north of the city centre. In July 2004, construction caused a tunnel to collapse on the Grorud Line—the system's busiest—forcing a shutdown of this line until December and creating havoc on the overloaded replacement buses. The ring was completed onwards to Carl Berners plass on the Grorud Line via Sinsen in 2006. In 2007, the system started <b>taking</b> <b>delivery</b> of the new MX3000 trains, which replaced all the old stock. By 2010, all T1000, T1300 and T2000 trains had been retired. In 2010, the Holmenkollen Line reopened with metro standard, after it had been closed for renovation for a year.|$|E
50|$|In September 2013, PSA Airlines' pilots {{ratified}} tentative {{agreements with}} the managements of PSA Airlines and its parent company, US Airways Group Inc., that guaranteed the placement of 30 large regional jets at PSA. In December 2013, American Airlines announced that it had ordered 30 Bombardier CRJ900 jets and was assigning them to PSA Airlines. The airline began <b>taking</b> <b>deliveries</b> {{of them in the}} second quarter of 2014 to finish initial delivery in 2015. In addition, American acquired options to purchase up to 40 additional CRJ900 aircraft scheduled to be delivered in the years 2015 through 2016.|$|R
40|$|Introduction : Maxillary {{permanent}} first molars {{are frequently}} found ectopic teeth in mixed dentition. If left untreated, it may cause serious sequel including early {{loss of the}} primary second molar, space loss, and impaction of second premolars. Clinical Innovation: This article describes a new successful innovative method for the correction of ectopically erupting maxillary first permanent molar in an 8 -year-old boy. Discussion: Early correction of ectopically erupting permanent molars {{is an integral part}} of interceptive orthodontics. Several treatment methods have been suggested. Among these, the interproximal wedging techniques are the simplest but are not always appropriate or feasible. The other treatment modalities may be either complicated, expensive, or require impression <b>taking,</b> appliance <b>delivery,</b> and activation appointments. The following case illustrates a new chairside technique that eliminates the need of impression <b>taking,</b> appliance <b>delivery,</b> and activation appointments and is very simple...|$|R
50|$|Since the Lebanon War, the Syrian Air Force has {{attempted}} to procure Russian-made aircraft, but {{the full extent of}} this refurbishment is not known, nor are the exact numbers of planes or what types of aircraft are being supplied to the Air Force. This uncertainty is due to the degree of secrecy maintained by the Syrian government with regard to its military. It is known, however, that the Syrians have procured MiG-29s and Su-24s, which should give its Air Force a major improvement, although a rumor regarding the purchase of Su-27s that circulated in the 2010s has proven to be unfounded. In 2008 the Syrian Air Force was reportedly <b>taking</b> <b>deliveries</b> of 8 examples of new MiG-31E from Russia, as well as the MiG-29SMT and Yak-130, although delivery of the MiG-31s may have been cancelled by Russia due to pressure from Western governments.|$|R
5|$|On 27 September 1965, Minister for Air Peter Howson {{announced}} that No.37 Squadron {{was to be}} re-raised to operate twelve Lockheed C-130E Hercules transport aircraft that had been purchased by the Federal government; the new aircraft would allow the RAAF to support Australian deployments in South East Asia while continuing to meet its domestic commitments. The squadron was formed at RAAF Base Richmond on 21February 1966, {{under the command of}} Wing Commander Ron McKimm. It joined No.36 Squadron, which had been operating C-130A Hercules since 1958. No.486 Squadron, disbanded in 1964, was re-formed at Richmond to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons; major repairs and upgrades to the C-130s were the responsibility of No.2 Aircraft Depot (later No.503 Wing). As the C-130E had a longer range and could carry a greater payload than the C-130A, No.37 Squadron was generally assigned strategic tasks, while No.36 Squadron's responsibilities were primarily tactical in nature. No.37 Squadron began <b>taking</b> <b>delivery</b> of its C-130Es in August, {{and by the end of}} September its staff numbered eighty-six, including twenty-one officers. In February 1967, the squadron commenced long-range missions in support of Australian forces in the Vietnam War, including aero-medical evacuations conveying wounded soldiers back to Australia, generally via RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia. Initially both C-130A and Emodels were employed for such evacuations, but only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967, as they offered more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia if required. By the end of February 1968, No.37 Squadron had a strength of 207 personnel: eighty-five aircrew, including fifty-one officers, and 122 ground staff, including three officers. The squadron transported the last Australian forces out of Vietnam in December 1972, following the Federal government's decision to withdraw from the conflict.|$|E

25|$|A {{year later}} KES started <b>taking</b> <b>delivery</b> {{of the more}} modern Class U trams. In 1902 KES was forced to {{renumber}} all its trams to avoid confusion with its competitor Kristiania Sporveisselskap (KSS), and all trams were thus numbered from 101 and upwards. KES started <b>taking</b> <b>delivery</b> of the larger Class SS trams in 1909. With them the Class A was regarded as small and from 1910 the company started rebuilding them to trailers. The original trailers originally {{did not have any}} braking system, and with increasing speeds this became necessary to install from 1912 to 1914. At the same time the wheelbase was increased. The last motorized versions were taken out of service after the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition. No. 102 was never rebuilt and kept as a shunter. It was therefore possible to retire it as a heritage tram in 1919. It was then rebuilt to its original design at delivery and has since been transferred to the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology.|$|E
