If any previous human translations of the segment exist, Google Translator Toolkit picks the highest-ranked search result and 'pretranslates' the segment with that translation. If no previous human translation of the segment exists, it uses machine translation to produce an 'automatic translation' for the segment, without intervention from human translators.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} <b>Google</b> <b>Translate</b> as a supplementary tool for helping international students at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) to learn and develop their knowledge and skills in learning Bahasa Malaysia (Malay Language). The participants {{of the study were}} 16 international students at the School of Languages, Literacies, and Translation, USM who had registered for the LKM 100 Bahasa Malaysia (I) course. Based on the literature review, analysis of the collected data, and an assessment of the course content and activities inside and outside the language classroom, the findings suggest that most international students at USM recognize <b>Google</b> <b>Translate</b> as an effective supplementary tool for learning vocabulary, writing, and reading in Bahasa Malaysia. In fact, some students reported that they could optimally benefit from their self-learning if they were assisted to use <b>Google</b> <b>Translate</b> effectively. Moreover, using <b>Google</b> <b>Translate</b> for doing classroom tasks and activities can encourage students to study independently, and to shape their own strategies for solving language learning problems.
