5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the scandals}} {{associated}} with this Tour, Desgrange wanted to stop the race. He however changed his mind, and <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> changed to prevent cyclists from cheating: the 1905 Tour de France would be decided with a points system. Tour de France 1904 winner Cornet would enter the Tour de France for seven more times, but would never again play an important role.|$|E
5|$|The EBU later {{confirmed}} {{an attempt}} of cheating in the contest, which was unsuccessful according to EBU as the EBU's system prevent fraud. According to the EBU, {{there is no}} evidence that any broadcaster has been involved in cheating. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> changed the next year to ensure that all broadcasters would be responsible for preventing fraud to their advantage or face a three-year suspension if fraud is revealed.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., {{interested}} parties can sue {{to have a}} judge review the rulemaking process once <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> finalized. Interested parties frequently sue the rulemaking agency, asking the court to order the agency to reconsider. For example, environmental groups may sue, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> too lax on industry; or industry groups may sue, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> too onerous.|$|R
50|$|The {{respondents}} defended {{their actions}} {{by arguing that}} <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR). Namely, that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> required to maintain an acceptable standard for firefighting.|$|R

5|$|Edgar was {{concerned}} about different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule in different monasteries in his kingdom, and wanted to impose uniform rules {{to be followed by}} all. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> set out in the key document of the English reform, the Regularis Concordia, which was adopted by the Council of Winchester in around 970. The Concordia was written by Æthelwold, who had sought advice from Ghent and Fleury Abbeys. A major aim of the Concordia was the regularisation of the form of church services, and Æthelwold tried to synthesise what he regarded as the best Continental and English practice.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Tourist Trophy the Isle of Man had {{hosted the}} English trials for the Gordon Bennett Cup as the English {{government}} had banned motor racing on its roads. The Automobile Club {{wanted to run}} an event to help develop fuel efficiency in motor cars and opted {{to use the same}} route as had been used for the trials. In order to make the event relevant to those cars on general sale they imposed rules to prevent specialist race cars from entering, though there were complaints that <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> too restrictive and detracted from the spectacle.|$|E
5|$|Six {{years after}} the {{creation}} of the Sheffield Rules the Football Association rules were created. These were influenced by the Sheffield game but ongoing disputes meant that the Sheffield rules continued to be used. During this time many of the elements of <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> incorporated into the association game. Regular games were played between Sheffield and London using both sets of rules. This led to an agreement on a single set of laws administered by the Football Association in 1877.|$|E

50|$|In rules-based SDC, a rigid set of <b>rules</b> <b>is</b> used to {{determine}} whether or not the results of data analysis can <b>be</b> released. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> applied consistently, which makes it obvious what kinds of output are acceptable. However, because <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> inflexible, either disclosive information may still slip through, or <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> overrestrictive and may only allow for results that are too broad for useful analysis to be published.|$|R

5|$|Tharoor was in {{the news}} again for {{publicly}} criticising the new visa guidelines adopted by the Indian government {{in the wake of}} the gaps exposed by the arrest of 26/11 terror suspects, David Headley and Tahawwur Rana. For this he was criticised for breaking ranks with the official position of the government. He later met External Affairs Minister, S.M. Krishna, and explained his position on the issue. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> subsequently partly modified.|$|E
5|$|The Sheffield Rules was {{a code of}} {{football}} devised and played in the English city of Sheffield between 1857 and 1877. They were devised by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest {{for use by the}} newly founded Sheffield Football Club. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> subsequently adopted as the official rules of Sheffield Football Association upon its creation in 1867. They spread beyond the city boundaries to other clubs and associations in the north and midlands of England making them {{one of the most popular}} forms {{of football}} during the 1860s and 70s.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is a music chart {{compiled}} by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom.

5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions could be taken) were created to protect the civilian population of the country. To the American pilots that conducted the missions, however, they became complex {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on the ground. There were different rules for every type of activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E
5|$|The {{game had}} {{more than three million}} players around the world by 1981, and copies of <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> selling {{at a rate of about}} 750,000 per year by 1984. Beginning with a French {{language}} edition in 1982, Dungeons & Dragons has been translated into many languages beyond the original English. By 2004, consumers had spent more than US$1billion on Dungeons & Dragons products and the game had been played by more than 20million people. As many as six million people played the game in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The initial Tour de France of 1903 {{had been}} a large success, and it was quickly decided to {{organize}} it again in 1904. The route was identical, with the same six stages. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> {{the same as in}} 1903, with one exception: cyclists could not enter in just one stage, but had to join for the entire race. The favourites for the victory were Garin, Pothier and Aucouturier, who had performed well in the 1903 Tour de France. Among the competitors was Henri Paret who, at 50 years old, still holds the record of oldest Tour de France cyclist.|$|E

5|$|The rules {{had been}} in use since the {{establishment}} of the club. Although a selection of rules from public schools were seen there, the 1858 rules show little evidence of their influence. Many of the original members were from the local Collegiate School, which favoured the kicking style of the game, rather than handling the ball. The kicking game was also prevalent in the local villages of Penistone and Thurlstone. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> the first to penalise foul play with a free kick, introduce the throw-in and eliminate the offside rule. They also had the unique feature of preventing a goal being scored directly from a free kick or throw-in.|$|E
5|$|Women in {{athletics}} often wear bikinis of similar size as those worn in beach volleyball. Amy Acuff, a US high-jumper, {{wore a black}} leather bikini instead of a track suit at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Runner Florence Griffith-Joyner mixed bikini bottoms with one-legged tights at the 1988 Summer Olympics, earning her more attention than her record breaking performance in the women's 200 meters event. In the 2007 South Pacific Games, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> adjusted to allow players to wear less revealing shorts and cropped sports tops instead of bikinis. At the West Asian Games in 2006, organizers banned bikini-bottoms for female athletes {{and asked them to}} wear long shorts.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, {{the electoral}} laws were {{reformed}} leading to {{elections for the}} 15 seats on the city council. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> initially very strict allowing only the wealthiest citizens to run. In the 1844 elections only 174 citizens qualified {{out of a total}} population of more than 7,000. The first city council, mainly composed of wealthy merchants and industrialists, quickly looked to improve the harbour, situated along the Aarhus River. Larger ships and growing freight volumes made a river harbour increasingly impractical. In 1840, the harbour was moved to the coast, north of the river where it became the largest industrial harbour outside Copenhagen over the following 15 years. From the outset, the new harbour was controlled by the city council, as it is to this day.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in {{an attempt}} to avoid losing large {{quantities}} of circulating nickels to melting, the United States Mint introduced new interim rules on December 14, 2006, that criminalized the melting and export of pennies (which as of 2013 cost 1.83 cents to produce) and nickels. Violators of these rules can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000, five years imprisonment, or both. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> finalized on April 17, 2007. The melt value of a nickel for some time was more than five cents, including nearing over one-and-a-half times its face value in May 2007. Since then, the supply and demand of the coin's composition metals have stabilized. A nickel's melt value fell below its face value from late 2008 through mid-2010, and more recently again from late mid-2012 through the present. In February 2014, it was reported that the Mint was conducting experiments to use copper-plated zinc (the same composition used for the United States 1 cent coin) for the nickel.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 1876, {{representatives from}} Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia {{met at the}} Massasoit House in Springfield, Massachusetts to {{standardize}} a new code of rules based on the rugby game first introduced to Harvard by McGill University in 1874. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> based largely on the Rugby Football Union's code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring (a change that would later occur in rugby itself, favoring the try as the main scoring event). Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, {{as a result of}} the meeting. Yale did not join the group until 1879, because of an early disagreement about the number of players per team.|$|E
5|$|Start and end dates {{vary with}} {{location}} and year. Since 1996, European Summer Time {{has been observed}} from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> not uniform across the European Union. Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year. The 2007 U.S. change {{was part of the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and Congress retains the right {{to go back to the}} previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done. Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31.|$|E
