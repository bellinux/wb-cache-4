5|$|In early January 1944, {{in order}} to rectify a {{shortage}} of labour in the primary production sector of the New Zealand economy, the New Zealand Government, {{in consultation with the}} United States and the United Kingdom, decided that it was necessary to release manpower from the military back into the civilian workforce. After some debate, it was decided that this manpower would come from the 3rd Division, while the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was fighting in Italy, would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>intact.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1876, the {{curriculum}} was widened {{so that it}} comprised reading, writing, arithmetic, English, mathematics, history, geography, Latin, a foreign language, music, natural science and drawing, with Greek as an optional extra. The County Council supported technical and commercial subjects in the late 19th century, but after 1904 it was empowered to support secondary education in general, allowing Latin and other classical components of {{the curriculum}} <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>intact.</b> After World War I, sixth form courses were developed allowing students to commence advanced studies {{in the arts and}} sciences. By the 1950s, a wide range were available: English language and literature, mathematics, French, German, Latin, Greek, art, history, geography, physics, chemistry and woodwork; biology was taught at Kesteven and Sleaford High School.|$|E
5|$|Leicester's {{gatehouse}} {{was built}} {{on the north side of}} the base court, replacing an older gatehouse to provide a fashionable entrance from the direction of Coventry. The external design, with its symbolic towers and, originally, battlements, echoes a style popular a century or more before, closely resembling Kirby Muxloe and the Beauchamp gatehouse at Warwick Castle. By contrast the interior, with its contemporary wood panelling, is in the same, highly contemporary Elizabethan fashion of Leicester's building in the inner court. Leicester's gatehouse is one of the few parts of the castle <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>intact.</b> The stables built by John Dudley in the 1550s also survive and lie along the east side of the base court. The stable block is a large building built mostly in stone, but with a timber-framed, decoratively panelled first storey designed in an anachronistic, vernacular style. Both buildings could have easily been seen from Leicester's building and were therefore on permanent display to visitors. Leciester's intent may have been to create a deliberately anachronistic view across the base court, echoing the older ideals of chivalry and romance alongside the more modern aspects of the redesign of the castle.|$|E
50|$|Xizhimen, {{the last}} gate <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> fully <b>intact,</b> was {{completely}} dismantled in 1969. During demolition, workers discovered that {{parts of the}} barbican gate's archway were the originals from the 13th century.|$|R

25|$|Perjury is the act {{of lying}} or making verifiably false {{statements}} on a material matter under oath or affirmation {{in a court of}} law, or in any of various sworn statements in writing.

25|$|Crystal Beach, a populous {{community}} located roughly at {{the midpoint}} of the peninsula, was submerged and destroyed; waves and wind pounded houses, and even some houses elevated on 14-ft (4.3m) stilts rolled into the waters. The tiny beachfront community of Gilchrist, which sat astride the north-facing Rollover Bay on Bolivar, was completely swept away, save for only a few homes. One of these homes, the only one in its neighborhood <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>intact</b> (although it was rendered uninhabitable), attracted widespread media interest after images of it began to appear in newspapers and on television.

25|$|The Campbells, {{and their}} patriarch, Robert Campbell, were a {{particularly}} influential {{group in the}} area's early history. The Campbells were Scottish and brought many other Scots to the district as workers. The land that they owned included Duntroon House that is now the Officers Mess at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Yarralumla and the Oaks Estate. The latter most got its name from a mansion built there by Campbell called the Oaks. When the Campbell family later sold the land it was on for subdivision and development, it was on condition that the Oaks and the land that it <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>intact</b> and not be renamed.

25|$|The {{varieties}} of rice are typically classified as long-, medium-, and short-grained. The grains of long-grain rice (high in amylose) tend <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>intact</b> after cooking; medium-grain rice (high in amylopectin) becomes more sticky. Medium-grain rice {{is used for}} sweet dishes, for risotto in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as arròs negre, in Spain. Some {{varieties of}} long-grain rice that are high in amylopectin, known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed. A stickier medium-grain rice is used for sushi; the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when molded. Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for rice pudding.|$|E
25|$|Polyandry is {{believed}} to be more likely in societies with scarce environmental resources, as it {{is believed}} to limit human population growth and enhance child survival. It is a rare form of marriage that exists not only among poor families, but also the elite. For example, in the Himalayan Mountains polyandry is related to the scarcity of land; the marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife allows family land <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>intact</b> and undivided. If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. In Europe, this was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance (the disinheriting of most siblings, many of whom went on to become celibate monks and priests).|$|E
25|$|The apostolic {{succession}} of the Church is considered <b>to</b> have <b>remained</b> <b>intact</b> through the proper ordination of bishop Mikael Agricola, {{but it was}} broken in 1884 when all the Finnish Lutheran bishops died within a year. The succession remained valid in the Church of Sweden from where it was returned in the 1930s by the ordination of the bishop of Tampere. However, the concept of apostolic succession is important foremost in ecumenical contexts, particularly in dealings with the Anglican Communion.|$|R

50|$|The {{state is}} named after its capital, Tlaxcala, which was also {{the name of the}} Pre-Columbian city and culture. The Tlaxcalans allied {{themselves}} with the Spanish to defeat the Aztecs, with concessions from the Spanish that allowed the territory <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> mostly <b>intact</b> throughout 300 years of colonial period.

For example, disinheriting most siblings where many of whom then became celibate monks and priests.|$|E
25|$|Glass {{was used}} to frame the new areas of the {{building}} as the additions had to be sympathetic to but not similar to the original building exterior. To maintain {{the integrity of the}} original building, the brick exterior of the Old Courthouse was left undisturbed. Some leniencies were allowed in order for current building codes to be met; however, strict requirements, as set out by Alberta Historical Resources, were followed when it came to restoring and renovating the original courtroom, which now serves as Council Chambers. The wood panelling covering {{the lower half of the}} walls needed <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>intact,</b> as did the original cast iron radiators (which now tie in to the geothermal heating and cooling system). The only changes made to the courtroom were the restoration of the wall paint to its original 1920 splendour and the installation of a new carpet. The result of this renovation was a fabulous new City Hall that provides both employees and citizens the opportunity to showcase this beautiful community structure.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Bailen and the {{subsequent}} French surrender on 21 July 1808, the myth of French military invincibility was exploded. In the sequel, King Joseph Bonaparte withdrew the remaining Imperial French forces behind the Ebro River. Determined to conquer Spain, Napoleon resolved to go there himself with a large army. He ordered three army corps to march from Germany to reinforce Joseph's badly shaken survivors. Among other reinforcements, one light cavalry and five dragoon divisions were transferred to Spain {{under the command of}} Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg, Milhaud, Armand Lebrun de La Houssaye, Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge, Jacques Louis François Milet and Jean Baptiste Marie Franceschi-Delonne. La Tour-Maubourg led the 1st Dragoon Division with 3,695 troopers, Milhaud the 2nd with 2,940, Houssaye the 3rd with 2,020, Lorge the 4th with 3,101, and Milet the 5th with 2,903. Franceschi led the 2,400-man light cavalry division. Two of Milhaud's regiments were assigned to other units and Milet was soon replaced by Kellermann. On 9 November 1808, Marshal Bessières was replaced by Marshal Nicolas Soult in charge of the II Corps and ordered to lead the Cavalry Reserve. However, the Cavalry Reserve was not destined <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>intact.</b> In December, Franceschi was already assigned to Soult, Houssaye and Lorge were directed to join Soult, and Milet was still on the march to Spain. Meanwhile, La Tour-Maubourg and Milhaud were assigned to help defend Madrid. Bessières remained with the cavalry near Madrid. Meanwhile, the French won the Battle of Tudela on 23 November 1808. Alexandre, vicomte Digeon participated in this combat with two regiments of La Tour-Maubourg's division, 1,200 strong. While Marshal Jean Lannes and the Imperial infantry put the Spanish center and right wing to flight, Digeon's and a second brigade of French cavalry immobilized 10,000 soldiers of the Spanish left wing.|$|E
