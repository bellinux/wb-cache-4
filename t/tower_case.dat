500|$|The first-generation Mac Pro has a {{rectangular}} <b>tower</b> <b>case</b> which outwardly resembles the last {{version of the}} Power Mac G5, and has similar expansion capabilities. [...] The first Mac Pro offered a dual Dual-core Xeon Woodcrest processors. It {{was replaced by a}} dual Quad-core Xeon Clovertown model on [...] April 4, 2007, and again on January 8, 2008 by a dual Quad-core Xeon Harpertown model. The 2012 Mac Pro is largely based on a model that was announced on July 27, 2010. It features Nehalem/Westmere architecture Intel Xeon processors. These CPUs offer optionally twelve processing cores. The machine itself at its most evolved is able to accommodate up to four 2 TB hard disk drives or 512 GB solid state drives, as well as the ATI Radeon HD 5770/5870 GPU units, one per slot.|$|E

50|$|Original IBM power {{supplies}} for the PC (model 5150), XT and AT included a line-voltage power switch that extended through {{the side of the}} computer case. In a common variant found in <b>tower</b> <b>cases,</b> the line-voltage switch was connected to the power supply with a short cable, allowing it to be mounted apart from the power supply.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{personal}} computers, {{like the}} original IBM Personal Computer, were enclosed in a [...] "desktop case", horizontally oriented {{to have the}} display screen placed on top, thus saving space on the user's actual desk, although these cases had to be sturdy enough to support the weight of CRT displays that were widespread at the time. Over {{the course of the}} 1990s, desktop cases gradually became less common than the more-accessible <b>tower</b> <b>cases</b> (<b>Tower</b> was a trademark of NCR created by ad agency Reiser Williams deYong) that may be located on the floor under or beside a desk rather than on a desk. Not only do these <b>tower</b> <b>cases</b> have more room for expansion, they have also freed up desk space for monitors which were becoming larger every year. Desktop cases, particularly the compact form factors, remain popular for corporate computing environments and kiosks. Some computer cases can be interchangeably positioned either horizontally (desktop) or upright (mini-tower).|$|R

50|$|The Amiga 3000T is a {{computer}} manufactured by Commodore. It {{is closely related to}} the Amiga 3000, although it came in a <b>tower</b> <b>case</b> which offers greater expandability. The case for the prototype, the 3500, was derived from Commodore's PC compatible line.|$|E
50|$|In the past, many <b>tower</b> <b>cases</b> {{intended}} to house file servers featured a locking door covering the external drive bays. This was a security feature {{intended to}} prevent the theft of the CD-ROM discs the drives would be holding. At the time, CD-ROM capacity was larger than the hard disks available, and many business-critical databases were distributed on this media. These databases were often very expensive or held proprietary data, and hence would be likely targets for casual theft.|$|R
50|$|For example, a case {{designed}} for an ATX motherboard and power supply may take on several external forms {{such as a}} vertical tower (designed {{to sit on the}} floor, height > width), a flat desktop (height < width) or pizza box (height ≤ 5 cm designed to sit on the desk under the computer's monitor). Full-size <b>tower</b> <b>cases</b> are typically larger in volume than desktop cases, with more room for drive bays and expansion slots. Desktop cases—and mini-tower cases under about 18 in high—are popular in business environments where space is at a premium.|$|R
50|$|Desktop {{computers}} that used <b>tower</b> <b>cases</b> could easily swap parts such as hard drives, memory, and graphics cards. Among early mobile devices, the Handspring Visor PDA had a Springboard Expansion Slot which could {{give it the}} capabilities such as a phone, GPS, a modem, or a camera - but only one at a time. The Israeli startup Modu created a phone+screen core that could be added to various cases that gave the device features such as a keyboard or camera; the company failed and sold its patents to Google in 2011.|$|R
50|$|On 20 November 2000, Hussain Muhammad Ershad {{was convicted}} and sentenced for Janata <b>Tower</b> <b>Case.</b> As a result, he was {{declared}} ineligible to contest the general election of 2001. Ershad is also the main accused of the murder case of Major General Muhammad Abul Manzoor.|$|E
50|$|Ershad {{has been}} convicted and served time for only one case that has been upheld by the Supreme Court of the nation - Janata <b>Tower</b> <b>Case.</b> When his {{relations}} with the ruling Awami League subsequently deteriorated as he joined hands with the other main opposition BNP of Khaleda Zia.|$|E
50|$|Prefer cool intake air, avoid inhaling {{exhaust air}} (outside air above {{or near the}} exhausts). For example, a CPU cooling air duct {{at the back of}} a <b>tower</b> <b>case</b> would inhale warm air from a {{graphics}} card exhaust. Moving all exhausts {{to one side of the}} case, conventionally the back/top, helps to keep the intake air cool.|$|E
5000|$|... "It was {{intended}} to be ironic, to illustrate what I perceived at the time to be an elitist attitude among a certain kind of PC gamer. People who invest in expensive gaming PCs and continually spend money to make sure the tech in their brightly-lit <b>tower</b> <b>cases</b> is up to date. Who actually prefer games that are temperamental to get running and that have complicated keyboard interfaces, just because it discourages new or 'casual' players who will in some way taint the entire community with their presence. I meant it as a dig." ...|$|R
50|$|In August 2014, {{the brand}} be quiet! {{introduced}} its first midi <b>tower</b> PC <b>case</b> Silent Base 800 {{to the market}} and since then introduced two further product series (Dark Base and Pure Base).|$|R
50|$|Used to aerate {{the case}} of the computer. The {{components}} inside the case cannot dissipate heat efficiently if the surrounding air is too hot. Case fans move air through the case, usually drawing cooler outside air in through the front or bottom (where it may also be drawn over the internal hard drive racks) and expelling it through the top or rear. Some ATX <b>tower</b> <b>cases</b> have one or more vents and mounting points in the left side panel where one or more fans may be installed to blow cool air directly onto the motherboard components and expansions cards, which are ones of the largest heat sources.|$|R
5000|$|About {{the same}} time with Lira XT Tower, the new Lira AT was {{released}} with similar looking slimline <b>tower</b> <b>case.</b> Lira AT was compatible with IBM PC AT and it was equipped with Intel 80286 CPU, 1MB of RAM, EGA compatible video adapter, 2x3.5" [...] floppy drives and 40MB hard disk.Serial production of Lira AT started in December 1989.|$|E
50|$|With {{dimensions}} of 15 xx 15 cm, a Mini-ATX motherboard {{can be placed}} into a single DIN space for standardized application conditions such as a car, rack mount, <b>tower</b> <b>case,</b> wall mount, etc. which may be impossible for a Mini-ITX form factor. The smaller form factor Nano-ITX motherboard lacks a CPU socket module which limits its flexibility for different applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower was}} {{repurposed}} as an Software park {{by the government}} of Bangladesh. Matiur Rahman Chowdhury, editor of the daily Manab zamin was sentenced to jail in May 2002 for contempt of court. The paper had published a transcript of a phone conversation between Ershad and a High court judge in which Ershad was seeking a more favourable verdict in the Janata <b>tower</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} usage of PCs, {{a computer that}} could fit on a desk was remarkably small, leading to the [...] "desktop" [...] nomenclature. More recently, the phrase usually indicates a particular style of computer case. Desktop computers {{come in a variety}} of styles ranging from large vertical <b>tower</b> <b>cases</b> to small models which can be tucked behind an LCD monitor. In this sense, the term [...] "desktop" [...] refers specifically to a horizontally oriented case, usually intended to have the display screen placed on top to save desk space. Most modern desktop computers have an external display screen and an external keyboard, which are typically plugged into the computer case.|$|R
