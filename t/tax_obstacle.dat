40|$|In December 2014, OECD {{issued a}} Discussion Draft on Transfer Pricing aspects of {{cross-border}} commodity transactions through BEPS action 10, where {{the adoption of}} the sixth method {{in the form of the}} quoted commodity price and its adjustments were primarily driven as a starting point for transfer pricing purpose. In this paper the analysis of the proposed sixth method and the experience with the sixth method in Argentina were used for the consideration whether this method can be used as simplified measurement for SMEs. SMEs are facing <b>tax</b> <b>obstacles</b> mainly in the area of the international taxation which impede in cross border transactions and internationalization of SMEs. One of <b>tax</b> <b>obstacles</b> represent transfer pricing. Its costs can be disproportionately large for SMEs in comparison to LSEs. Moreover, SMEs are not able to bear the high administrative burden to comply with the transfer pricing rules as they do not posses the sufficient human and economic capital. Based on the results of the research, we can concluded, that there are a lot of questions related to the proposed sixth method, notwitstanding, it has a potential to be a new method for SMEs for they need to face lower tax administrative burden in the area of transfer pricing issues...|$|R

The main problems could be described as follows:- intragroup profits are allocated on an arm's length basis, according to the rules on transfer pricing, giving rise to high compliance costs and potential double taxation;- the flow of income (dividends, interest, and royalties) between associated companies is often subject to withholding taxes, with potential double taxation;- the relief of cross-border losses is subject to severe limitations;- companies suffer considerable tax charges when they engage in cross-border restructuring operations (mergers and acquisitions);- the network of double taxation treaties among member states is incomplete and is far from perfect in preventing double taxation; and- some tax measures are biased towards domestic investment, such as the imputatio...|$|R
40|$|Non-profit {{organizations}} are increasingly {{subjected to the}} forces of globalization. Although this should not come as a surprise, it is curious {{to note that the}} taxation of international philanthropy is an area where discrimination as to residence is still very obvious. Whereas domestic philanthropic flows of money enjoy substantial tax privileges throughout the democratic western world, these privileges often do not apply in situations where borders are crossed. In recent years the importance of support from charities and social investments has increased substantially, but cross-border philanthropy still remains hampered by numerous tax issues. By comparing the relevant legal and tax systems in selected countries, and by taking into account other legal developments relevant to international philanthropy, the author attempts to find a common approach to solve the <b>tax</b> <b>obstacles</b> of international philanthropy. The book begins by defining the scope of the study including the concept of 'landlock', political philosophies substantiating tax relief for philanthropic organizations and an analysis of bilateral treaties. This is followed by a comprehensive and comparative overview of the approach taken in three legal and tax systems regarding international philanthropy, i. e. Germany, the Netherlands and the United States. The work also examines whether EU law allows states (within and without the EU) to maintain 'landlocked' tax positions and, if so, under what type of conditions this may be permitted. Finally, the book concludes with a proposal of a new paradigm of non-discriminating treatment of philanthropy by examining ways to abolish landlocks...|$|R

Tax policy is becom-ing {{the part of the}} EU integration policies. The main aim of the EU tax policy is to eliminate differences in individual tax systems of the EU member states mainly through minimization of disproportions in the impacts on competition and through enabling free movement of goods, services, persons and capital on the EU internal market. There was introduced the value added tax system with differentiated rates, which remained in competency of governments of the individual states in 1973. The primary effort, after the implementation of the value added tax, was to complete the structural harmonization at first and then to try to harmonize the tax rates. The aim of all the above introduced efforts is to contribute to smooth functioning of the internal market (Široký 2007).

5000|$|The government's {{economic}} policy {{tried to make}} up for the loss of jobs in heavy industry through growth in other sectors, especially the services sector. Important legislative and regulatory measures supported the development and diversification of financial activities. In 1979, a government commission was set up to study the improvement of the legislative infrastructure of the financial centre. The law of 23 April 1981 enshrined banking secrecy. Bankers were now subject to the same confidentiality that applied to certain professions, such as doctors or midwives. Disclosure of confidential information was considered a crime punishable by prison or a fine. The law of 25 August 1983 on investment companies created a legal framework for investment funds and gave them a specific tax status. It created a new form of entity: the Société d’investissement à capital variable (SICAV). While the development of the Euromarket was at the basis of the boom of the financial centre in the 1970s, private banking and off-balance-sheet operations generating commissions took the lead during the 1980s. The financial sector became the engine of growth after the steel crisis. The number of banks grew relatively slowly: 143 banks in 1988, compared with 111 in 1980. But the number of investment funds exploded. In 1980, 76 investment funds represented global net assets of 118 billion francs. In 1988, 473 entities represented holdings equivalent to 1,668 billion francs. The Luxembourgish government certainly benefited from the <b>tax</b> <b>obstacles</b> - especially the withholding tax - encountered by this type of companies in their countries of origin. However, the financial centre's success was also based on a skilful niche policy which required flexibility and quick decision-making.|$|R
40|$|In the Communication on "Tax {{policy in}} the European Union - Priorities for the years ahead" (COM/ 2001 / 260 of 23 May 2001), the Commission reiterated its belief {{that there is no}} need for an across the board {{harmonisation}} of Member States' direct tax systems. For tax policy, the Communication established, as a main priority, the need to address the concerns of individuals and businesses operating within the Internal Market by focusing on the elimination of <b>tax</b> <b>obstacles</b> to all forms of cross-border economic activity, in addition to continuing the fight against harmful tax competition. This approach was confirmed in the Communication "The contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon strategy" (COM/ 2005 / 532 of 25 October 2005) (European Commission, 2006). The Spanish Law No 35 / 2006, 28 th November of Personal Income Tax, reformed that tax. The long-term capital gains will be taxed at 18 % (before 15 %);the tax scale will be comprised of only 3 or 4 brackets (before 5) and the top marginal rate (before 45 %) will be reduced; and some tax credits and allowances (acquisition of permanent home and contributions to pension funds for example) were readjusted in order to make them more accessible to low-income earners. The present paper makes a brief approach to the harmonisation in the European Union, explains the reform of the Spanish Personal Income Tax, introduces new figures and formulas never seen before at book of taxes, analyses the concept of the Spanish Personal Income Tax, studies the elements of this tax as the beneficiary, taxable person, territoriality, basis of assessment, exemptions, explains the basic mechanism of the tax, deductions, the taxable base, the tax rates, collections and examples.

40|$|The current {{rules for}} {{corporate}} taxation in Europe do not longer fit the globalized economic activities. Taxing corporate income {{on a national}} level leads to many <b>tax</b> <b>obstacles</b> for European multinationals. European multinationals, for example, face high compliance costs, suffer limitations to cross-border loss compensation and have to deal with transfer pricing issues. In an attempt to provide a comprehensive solution for the underlying <b>tax</b> <b>obstacles</b> that currently harm the international competitiveness of European multinationals, the European Commission (EC) launched a proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base directive (EC, 2011). The proposal includes one set of tax rules, allowing multinationals to calculate a common consolidated corporate tax base on a group level. The consolidated tax base would then be reapportioned to the different group members by means of an apportionment formula, which includes the factors active, sales and labour. The Member States preserve the right to apply their own tax rate to their specific share of the consolidated tax base. This dissertation contributes to the rather limited academic research concerning CCCTB. The core aims are (i) to explore the design of the European apportionment formula, (ii) to investigate the EU apportionment formula regarding the role of intangible assets in Belgium and (iii) to attain insights in the voting behaviour of the Members of the European Parliament (MEP). In the first study we focus on the design of the European apportionment formula, which {{plays a major role in}} Member States’ concern for protecting their tax revenue, as well as for the multinational companies’ tax minimizing opportunities. More specifically, we investigate the effect of changing the number of factors that make up the formula and the weight given to each factor. We used unpublished firm level data from a listed multinational, which enabled us to study the factor definitions in detail. Our simulation results indicate that including more factors and applying more equal weights distributes the consolidated tax base more equally, which reduces tax planning opportunities. Moreover, for our multinational, using more simplified factors definitions does not change the allocation of the consolidated tax base to a great extent. This advocates the inclusion of simplified factor definitions to reduce the compliance costs for multinationals. In the second study we focus on the factor assets in the apportionment formula. Namely, it is the commission’s intention to only partly and temporarily include intangible assets into this factor. The main reason for this is that the inclusion of intangibles could create tax planning opportunities for multinationals caused by location and valuation issues. However, excluding intangible assets from the apportionment formula could lead to an unfair distribution of the consolidated tax base. Member States that invest highly in a more knowledge-based economy, would lose taxable income they are entitled to. We empirically investigate this issue in a Belgian context. More precisely, using firm specific data from the Belfirst database, we investigate the profit generating capacity of both the proposed allocation factors, i. e. tangible fixed assets, sales and labour, as well as the additional allocation factor, viz intangible assets. Our results show that intangible assets, defined as the sum of ‘capitalized R&D costs’ and ‘concessions, patents and licences’, have a significant and positive impact on the creation of profit. We also include the factor capitalized R&D costs separately and find a positive and significant contribution of this factor to the generation of profit. In addition, our results show both the formula adding intangible assets to the proposed allocations factors, and the formula adding capitalized R&D costs, perform significantly better than the formula only including the proposed factors. Moreover, the formula adding intangible assets is more precise in explaining profit than the formula including capitalized R&D costs. The proposal for a CCCTB directive concerns a decision about direct taxation, meaning that the consultation procedure is applied. This procedure implies that the final decision rests with the Council of the EU and that the European Parliament plays a consultative role. In April 2012, the Member of the European Parliament approved the amended CCCTB proposal (452 votes in favour, 172 against and 36 abstentions). The third study gives insight into the voting behaviour of MEPs concerning the CCCTB directive. We focus on the question whether or not the voting behaviour of MEPs is influenced by the economic impact of CCCTB for their country. The economic impact of CCCTB is measured through the impact of CCCTB for each MS on their corporate income tax revenue. We collected the voting results from the independent organization VoteWatch Europe. Our results show that a higher impact of CCCTB on the corporate income tax revenue, increases the likelihood of a MEP to vote in favour of the proposal. As a robustness check we also measured economic impact by using the impact on employment and GDP. Again, we find that MEPs are significantly and positively influenced in their voting behaviour by the impact of CCCTB on employment and GDP for their country. Finally, we find that political party and country variables also have a significant effect on the voting behaviour of MEPs, whereas the individual characteristics of MEP did not have a significant influence...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{primary concern}} of this {{dissertation}} is {{the reduction of}} cross-border <b>tax</b> <b>obstacles</b> by improving the VAT rules governing cross border supplies of services and intangibles. These cross-border transactions are on the increase for many countries around the world. Cross-border transactions come with many challenges which impact current VAT rules and systems negatively and expose serious shortcomings in the application thereof. The dissertation examines {{the nature of the}} current cross-border VAT rules in South Africa (SA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and analyses the effectiveness and adequacy thereof. As a result of globalization rapid growth in international trade, specifically by electronic means, is inevitable. Today businesses are certainly becoming more focused internationally and are able to conduct their business activities across borders without constraints. Many VAT rules were designed only taking into account national economic activities and not international activities. The supply of services and intangibles across borders may be made without being reported, recorded and taxed. Many cross-border trading activities may potentially fall outside of the tax net and result in the non-collection of VAT revenues. Many countries have introduced a place of supply rule to mitigate the challenges and uncertainties arising from cross-border transactions. South Africa's value-added tax system does not include a place of supply rule. South Africa's Revenue authorities are currently faced with many challenges and uncertainties regarding the tax consequences of cross border transactions. The effectiveness of SA's existing VAT rules governing exports and imports are increasingly challenged by the growth in online web-based commerce. The difficulty in establishing the most effective rules to ensure compliance with VAT obligations on web-based transactions is growing. There is no standard set of VAT rules for cross-border transactions that can readily be applied internationally to every circumstance to determine the place of supply. The aim of this research is to determine whether the introduction of a place of supply rule is an effective solution to resolve the challenges and uncertainties resulting from cross border electronic transactions and ultimately increase VAT revenue. The dissertation specifically includes information on the practical application of the place of supply rule and the challenges facing the UK. A comparison between the VAT rules applied in South Africa for imports versus the UK place of supply rules is made and the significant differences are highlighted. In conclusion it is proposed that the introduction of a place of supply rule in South Africa would be beneficial and would contribute to the development an d improvement of South Africa's VAT system...|$|R
40|$|The Article {{offers a}} new {{perspective}} on the way international income tax has developed from its nascency, 85 years ago, to the present day. Its main claim is that, {{due to the lack of}} a clear normative tax agenda, trade considerations unduly eroded the income tax base. Such trade considerations highlight the importance of reducing <b>tax</b> <b>obstacles</b> on trade and investment to liberalize and integrate international markets. These considerations penetrated international income tax discourse during the Cold War period, when liberalizing trade was part of a broader western agenda to establish dominance through the liberalization of international markets. The Article demonstrates that the tax allocation conventions developed in the periods prior to the Cold War—and thereafter—were unable to counter successfully an endemic trend of tax erosion. To establish this claim, the Article frames three novel chronological phases and shows how different themes governed each phase. It then connects each theme and the relevant parallel global geo-political occurrences of that phase. The Article presents an original 2 ̆ 2 macro 2 ̆ 2 perspective of the development of international taxation sourcing conventions. It encapsulates this broad topic by focusing on a number of key issues arising from the conventions regarding the allocation of interest income. Access to foreign capital markets and foreign lenders is paramount to economic growth. Therefore, the tax treatment of interest income has always been a pivotal and controversial issue. The centrality of interest income allocation conventions and their modifications over the years make them a good proxy for understanding the more general evolution of international tax law. Since tax law research is the art of tying big themes with devils hiding in the details, the Article engages in an in-depth critical analysis of a number representative interest allocation mechanisms to demonstrate the dynamics of the income tax erosion it identifies. The Article builds on its historical analysis to open a wider discussion over the proper allocation method for taxing financial income. The mobility and tax sensitivity of capital assets make them the subject of tax planning (by taxpayers) and tax competition (by sovereigns). This renders the analysis important and interesting, but also more multilayered and difficult. The Article concludes with a discussion of the principled normative pillars of any future reform in the allocation of tax revenues arising from financial income. This discussion promotes the notion that, at least in the case of financial transactions within multinational enterprises, there is a need for an immediate strategic shift, if tax authorities wish to maintain the integrity of the corporate income tax...|$|R
40|$|The {{power to}} tax enables a State to organise its tax law {{on the basis of}} its {{national}} standards with respect to economic effectiveness and equity.   Taxes are a decisive financial factor for the governmental expenditure, the regulation of business, the promotion of the public goods and the competition between States.   The revenue of taxes can represent a method of income and wealth distribution, a social control by increasing taxes on products regarded as harmful such as tobacco and alcohol, and pollution can be limited by tax concessions.   Tax sovereignty is therefore one of the most sensitive issues for the member States and its transfer considered an undesirable diminution in national sovereignty. Improvements in communication and transport are creating new opportunities but also posing complex challenges for tax systems (e. g. the sale of goods and services via the Internet has noticeably increased in recent years).   In the light of the increasing globalisation, States are forced to create a favourable environment for the investments of international enterprises.   Thus, States try to prevent a shift of economic activities from home to abroad and at the same time to attract investments of foreign enterprises.   This competition is generally acceptable since it avoids a spiralling increase of taxes, provides better State performance and public structures, unless it does not turn into harmful tax competition. Member States are required to eliminate <b>tax</b> <b>obstacles</b> for private individuals and businesses, which wish to work and operate freely within the Single Market since the defences in national tax systems have become increasingly evident and have a growing influence on economic decisions of individuals and enterprises. In addition to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice with regard to the provisos of the EC Treaty, in particular the fundamental freedoms, the Commission has aimed at harmonising or co-ordinating the Member States tax system within the field of indirect as well as direct taxation with varying degrees of success.   This has mainly been caused by the reluctance of the Member States to agree to the measures demanded by the Commission. This processor will become even more difficult in face of the European Union’s fifth and biggest enlargement with ten new Member States on 1 May 2004.   However, the European Union has the chance to lay down the fundamental provisions towards a “European Tax System” in the European Constitution.   Agreement not only upon these important issues has still not been reached.

Simultaneously, the business performance of the countries whose innovation indicators lag behind the desired levels seems relatively poor. Often emphasized problems in post-transition countries regard the relations of fi rms with government institutions. We analyze perceptions of innovative and non-innovative fi rms in dealing with government offi cials, aiming to explore if these two groups of fi rms share similar experiences with tax administration, business licensing and courts offi cials. The analysis is focused on 17 European post-transition countries that are either EU members or accession countries.

Concrete policy proposals for reducing CO 2 emissions have been developed by the IPCC. One of the major instruments proposed is a carbon <b>tax.</b> A main <b>obstacle</b> for its implementation, however, are concerns about the short-term effects on employment and output. In order to miti-gate possible negative effects of enviromental taxes on output and employment, several European countries have introduced so-called environmental tax reforms (ETR) which are designed in a budget neutral manner: Revenues from the tax {{can be used to}} reduce existing distortionary taxes or to subsidize less polluting activities. We apply this idea to a carbon tax scheme by performing a vector autoregression (VAR) with output and employment data of nine industrialized countries. We impose a simultaneous policy shock on the economy whereby a carbon tax is levied on high-carbon intensive industries and the resulting tax revenue is redistributed to low-carbon intensive industries. Impulse response analysis shows that such a policy allows for net gains in terms of output and employment. ...|$|R
