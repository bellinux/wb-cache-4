5|$|In {{the male}} frog, the two testes are {{attached}} to <b>the</b> <b>kidneys</b> and semen passes into <b>the</b> <b>kidneys</b> through fine tubes called efferent ducts. It then travels on through the ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside <b>the</b> <b>kidneys</b> and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.|$|E

5|$|Excess calcium in {{the urine}} (hypercalciuria) occurs due to {{increased}} bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones {{are mainly composed of}} calcium phosphate. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is excreted by <b>the</b> <b>kidneys.</b>|$|E

50|$|In mammals, gluconeogenesis {{has been}} {{believed}} to be restricted to <b>the</b> liver, <b>the</b> <b>kidney,</b> <b>the</b> intestine, and muscle, but recent evidence indicates gluconeogenesis occurring in astrocytes of the brain. However, these organs use somewhat different gluconeogenic precursors. The liver preferentially uses lactate, alanine and glycerol (especially alanine) while <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> preferentially uses lactate, glutamine and glycerol (especially glutamine). Lactate from the Cori cycle, however, is quantitatively the largest source of substrate for gluconeogenesis, especially for <b>the</b> <b>kidney.</b> <b>The</b> liver uses both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to produce glucose, whereas <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> only uses gluconeogenesis. After a meal, the liver shifts to glycogen synthesis, whereas <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> increases gluconeogenesis. <b>The</b> intestine uses mostly glutamine and glycerol.|$|R
25|$|Proper kidney {{function}} {{depends upon}} adequate {{blood flow to}} <b>the</b> <b>kidney.</b> Kidney blood flow is a complex, tightly regulated process that relies {{on a number of}} hormones and other small molecules, such as prostaglandins.

40|$|Numerical {{estimation}} {{of the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> is useful in evaluating conditions of <b>the</b> <b>kidney,</b> especially, when serial MR imaging is performed to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> function. This paper presents a new method for automatic segmentation of <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> in three-dimensional (3 D) MR images, by extracting texture features and statistical matching of geometrical shape of <b>the</b> <b>kidney.</b> A set of Wavelet-based support vector machines (W-SVMs) is trained on the MR images. The W-SVMs capture texture priors of MRI for classification of <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> and non-kidney tissues in different zones around <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> boundary. In <b>the</b> segmentation procedure, these W-SVMs are trained to tentatively label each voxel around <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> model as a kidney or non-kidney voxel by texture matching. A probability kidney model is created using 10 segmented MRI data. The model is initially localized based on the intensity profiles in three directions. The weight functions are defined for each labeled voxel for each Wavelet-based, intensity-based, and model-based label. Consequently, each voxel has three labels and three weights for the Wavelet feature, intensity, and probability model. Using a 3 D edge detection method, the model is re-localized and <b>the</b> segmented <b>kidney</b> is modified based on a region growing method in the model region. The probability model is re-localized based on the results and this loop continues until the segmentation converges. Experimental results with mouse MRI data show the good performance of the proposed method in segmenting <b>the</b> <b>kidney</b> in MR images...|$|R

5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{produces}} aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, {{which is important}} in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In <b>the</b> <b>kidneys,</b> aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in <b>the</b> <b>kidneys,</b> which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} (also known as suprarenal glands) are {{endocrine}} glands that produce {{a variety of}} hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol.

The adrenal cortex itself {{is divided into three}} zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} may not develop at all, {{or may be}} fused in the midline behind the aorta.
