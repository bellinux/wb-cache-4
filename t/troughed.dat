The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the frequency of early <b>trough</b> measurements and to evaluate whether pharmacokinetically extrapolating mistimed concentrations may locate sub-therapeutic concentrations. Vancomycin <b>troughs</b> were retrospectively reviewed. For <b>troughs</b> ≥ 10 mg/L and measured > 0. 5 h early, the true <b>trough</b> was estimated using pharmacokinetic extrapolation methods to identify sub-therapeutic outcomes. Differences ≥ 2 mg/L between the measured and estimated true <b>trough</b> level was considered to have potential clinical significance. Of 143 <b>troughs</b> evaluated, 62 (43 %) were measured too early and 48 of those <b>troughs</b> were ≥ 10 mg/L. 25 % of those 48 <b>troughs</b> were sub-therapeutic. The potential for a difference ≥ 2 mg/L between the measured and estimated true <b>trough</b> was found to be greatest when the measured <b>trough</b> was ≥ 10 mg/L, the patient’s creatinine clearance (CrCl) was ≥ 60 mL/min, and the timing error was ≥ 2 h.

30|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the <b>trough</b> structure averaged longitudinally {{over the course of}} a day. The longitudinal average of the <b>trough</b> structure depends not only on the longitude effect of the <b>trough</b> occurrence rate (He et al. 2011) but also on the longitude effect of the <b>trough</b> structure (Karpachev 2003). The occurrence rate of the <b>trough</b> shows significant variations depending on the season, solar activity, and MLT (Ishida et al. 2014). The longitude effect of the <b>trough</b> minimum position primarily depends on the Kp (Karpachev et al. 1996). These factors can lead to the large scatter of the data and make the interpretation of the data in terms of physical processes more difficult. Although these limitations exist, our results are consistent with those found in many earlier studies. During disturbed conditions, the temperature associated with the disturbed electric field increases in the <b>trough</b> region, and the plasma density at a <b>trough</b> minimum decreases. However, in this study, the TEC at the <b>trough</b> minimum remained constant with increasing Kp. Pryse et al. (2006) investigated the TEC <b>trough</b> in the United Kingdom and found the same feature. Therefore, the relationship between the TEC value at the <b>trough</b> minimum and the temperature at the <b>trough</b> minimum is needed to study at different geomagnetic activities, which can help us understand the physical mechanism of <b>trough</b> formation. In addition, a quantitative test of the wind effect in the <b>trough</b> is also needed in the future.|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{incorporation}} of conveyor systems throughout industry has seen {{an increase in}} demand for systems that exceed the specification of conventional conveyors. This coupled with the demand to convey bulk materials over larger distances, at higher speeds and efficiencies, requires {{the development of a}} versatile design approach. This thesis explores the design aspects associated with modern pouch conveying systems, and how they vary, and can be adapted from theories used with conventional <b>troughed</b> conveyors. In particular, the indentation rolling resistance (IRR) is explored in detail, as this can account for up to 60 % of the drag forces of a system. This is the drag force that arises due to an asymmetric pressure distribution as the idler roll shell indents the bottom cover of the belt. The potential idler roll arrangements for a generic pouch conveying system are analysed, and compared with experimental values. In addition to this, the drive traction attainable from suitable drive stations is analysed. <b>Troughed</b> conveyors typically wrap the conveyor belt around a large drive pulley, generating large amounts of traction. Given the layout of pouch conveying systems, a different approach is required, at multiple locations. As such, pouch conveyors are typically driven through simply supported drive stations, with small areas of contact with the belt. The useable traction from these point contact drives is considered. These theories are then united and applied to a dynamic package capable of handling multiple conveyor designs. This package utilises Finite Element Modelling (FEM) to model the viscoelastic nature of the system, based on the distributed drag forces, and inputs of the conveyor. Lastly, to qualify this theory, experimental analysis is conducted on an on-site installation, and compared with the theoretical results...|$|E

Our primary focus is on free cash margin, or free cash flow measured as a percent of revenue. In the current study we look at the non-financials of the S&P 500. During the twelve months ended September 2008, free cash margin for the S&P 500 nonfinancials declined to 6. 70 % from 7. 13 % for the twelve months ended September 2007. Interestingly, operating cash margin improved slightly during the same period, helped by improvements in operating cushion and the operating cycle. It appears that increased capital spending pushed net cash margin lower even as operating cash margin improved. As a point of reference, free cash margin <b>troughed</b> at 4. 36 % in the 2001 recession. Thus, by all indications, we can expect a significant decline in free cash margin from current levels.

A time-series {{analysis}} was conducted to evaluate the trend, seasonality of active TB in Xinjiang, and explore the underlying mechanism of TB seasonality by comparing the seasonal variations of different subgroups. Monthly active TB cases from 2005 to 2014 in Xinjiang were analyzed by the X- 12 -ARIMA seasonal adjustment program. Seasonal amplitude (SA) was calculated and compared within the subgroups. A total of 277, 300 confirmed active TB cases were notified from 2005 to 2014 in Xinjiang, China, with a monthly average of 2311 ± 577. The seasonality of active TB notification was peaked in March and <b>troughed</b> in October, with a decreasing SA trend.

40|$|As {{electricity}} prices continue to rise, the increasing need for energy management requires {{better understanding of}} models for energy-consuming applications, such as conveyor belts. Conveyor belts are used {{in a wide range}} of industries, including power generation, mining and mineral processing. Conveyor technological advances are leading to increasingly long conveyor belts being commissioned. Thus, the energy consumption of each individual belt conveyor unit is becoming increasingly significant. This paper proposes a generic energy model for belt conveyors with long <b>troughed</b> belts. The model has a two-parameter power equation, and it uses a partial differential equation to capture the variable amount of material mass per unit length throughout the belt length. Verification results show that the power consumption calculations of the newly proposed simpler model are consistent with those of a known non-linear model with an error of less than 4 %. The online parameter identification set-up of the model is proposed. Simulations indicate that the parameters can be identified successfully from data with up to 15 % measurement noise. Results show that the proposed model gives better predictions of the power consumed and material delivered by a long conveyor belt than the steady-state models in the current literature.

One hundred and six third-year dental students at one Faculty of Dentistry performed simulated root canal treatment with the aid of 2 x magnification loupes on extracted teeth. A postgraduate endodontic student subsequently made a reasonable search for an untreated MB 2 canal {{with the aid of a}} dental operating microscope. The mesiobuccal roots were then sectioned horizontally for determination of the canal configuration. The dental students were able to treat an MB 2 canal in 15. 8 percent of the teeth, but this was not associated with satisfactory access criteria.
