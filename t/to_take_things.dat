Adam is determined <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> one step further with Tina so they can move in with one another, though she doesn't want to rush things and especially not with David now living with Adam and Matthew following his divorce from Robyn. Pete has landed on his feet as a chauffeur, and Jenny is finding herself seeing a lot less of her husband. Matthew's relationship with Olivia is taken to the next level, to the shock of Karen and Adam.|$|E

He is a retired gentleman who drives an obsolete Renault 4CV and lives {{in the suburbs of}} Paris, France. He maintains a wide range of contacts in government and scientific circles as well as with many experts in fields outside the mainstream such as ufology, telepathy, and sorcery. He is also a pigeon fancier and uses his carrier pigeons to relay messages between some of his contacts. Unlike Valérian he tries to avoid getting involved {{in the thick of the}} action and never acts impulsively, always preferring to take his time about things. He enjoys the finer things in life: gourmet cuisine, fine wines and likes <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> easy.|$|E

5000|$|On 5 November 2015, the LA Times {{reviewed}} {{the film as}} [...] "an exercise in excess" [...] and drew parallels of the film making style to that of Danny Boyle's films. The film criticized the plot as a [...] "bombastic, overlong melodrama that doesn't recognize the occasional need <b>to</b> <b>takes</b> <b>things</b> down a decibel or three" [...] while praising the lead performances.|$|R
5|$|Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tells Aden that {{he should}} behave in a manner his {{grandfather}} would be proud of. This upsets Aden, and he tries to cause trouble at school. When Cassie discovers she has HIV, Aden becomes irate at the prospect {{that she may have}} infected him in the car accident. After his tests come back negative, he cries in disappointment. His doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews), suggests that Aden may need counselling, but he refuses. When Aden's alcoholic father Larry throws him out, he is taken in by his friend Roman. Aden is upset to learn that Roman was in the army like his grandfather, and visits the structurally damaged local diner to be alone. The ceiling collapses and Aden is seriously injured. In the aftermath, Larry tells Rachel that Aden was abused by his grandfather as a child. Aden cannot face going home, so moves in with Roman more permanently. He is attracted to Roman's daughter Nicole, but does not pursue her out of respect for Roman. Instead, Aden kisses Belle, but deflects her attempts <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> further. She goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz), which prompts a jealous Aden to admit that he could not sleep with her because of the abuse he suffered as a child. When Larry injures himself while drunk, he is found by his son, and admits that Aden's grandfather also abused him. Aden holds Larry, Rachel and Belle hostage so that his father cannot receive medical assistance, but they are rescued by Angelo. Aden is forced into counselling, and begins {{to come to terms with}} his abuse.|$|E
25|$|In modern astrology, Mercury is {{regarded}} as the ruler of the third house; traditionally, it had the joy in the first house. Mercury is the messenger of the gods in mythology. It is the planet of day-to-day expression and relationships. Mercury's action is <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> apart and put them back together again. It is an opportunistic planet, decidedly unemotional and curious.|$|E
25|$|While a few {{writers and}} {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} assign such a retrospective diagnosis to Turing, {{and it is true}} that he had his share of eccentricities, the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film – social awkwardness, difficulty working cooperatively with others, and tendency <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> too literally – bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing, who, despite enjoying working alone, was sociable and had friends, was also viewed as having a sense of humour, and had good working relationships with colleagues.|$|E

25|$|After {{several months}} {{living with the}} Riglers, Genie's {{behavior}} and social skills improved {{to the point that}} she started going to first a nursery school and then a public school for mentally retarded children her age. The Riglers also taught her some basic self-help skills, including simple chores such as ironing, using a sewing machine, and preparing simple meals for herself. She made substantial progress with controlling herself both at home and in public, and although it was extremely hard to prevent her socially inappropriate masturbation she had almost entirely ceased it by the end of her stay. In February 1973 Curtiss recorded the first time Genie shared something with her, and while she continued <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> from other people her responses clearly indicated that she knew she was not supposed to.|$|E
25|$|The {{good news}} is, I'm finally {{working on my}} debut retail album. It sounds amazing so far. Everyone is excited about it. The bad news is, no more free music. Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, Vampire Sunlight {{might be the last}} free release, and The Evil Microchip will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, some people call it nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> away from me, and the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't know I have and then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning that I have to defend myself. I {{have to stand up}} and fight the fucking gorilla. Once I've got the diamond and I run away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} month, in November 1906, Hogan {{responded to}} rumors that Walter East, {{manager of the}} Akron Rubbernecks, had agreed to [...] "lay down" [...] to the Youngstown club, enabling them to win the pennant. [...] "Instead of laying down to us, Akron loaded up with catcher [...] Munson and pitcher Bob Spade", Hogan {{said in an interview}} with the Pittsburgh Press. [...] "They worked their heads off to down us, but could not do so". [...] Hogan went on to assert that the Akron club, and its manager, received generous incentives to defeat Youngstown. [...] "The Akron owner offered the players a bonus of $500 if they would beat us out in addition to a $300 wad for East", Hogan said. [...] Then, he accused East himself of attempting to [...] "fix" [...] a game during the 1906 season, claiming that the Akron manager had [...] "tried to get another club <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> easy against Akron so that Akron could beat us for the pennant".|$|E
500|$|Concerned for his health, Irving's {{brothers}} financed {{an extended}} tour of Europe from 1804 to 1806. Irving bypassed {{most of the}} sites and locations considered essential {{for the development of}} an upwardly mobile young man, to the dismay of his brother William. William wrote that, though he was pleased his brother's health was improving, he did not like the choice to [...] "gallop through Italy... leaving Florence on your left and Venice on your right". Instead, Irving honed the social and conversational skills that would later make him one of the world's most in-demand guests. [...] "I endeavor <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> as they come with cheerfulness", Irving wrote, [...] "and when I cannot get a dinner to suit my taste, I endeavor to get a taste to suit my dinner". While visiting Rome in 1805, Irving struck up a friendship with the American painter Washington Allston and nearly allowed himself to be persuaded into following Allston into a career as a painter. [...] "My lot in life, however", Irving said later, [...] "was differently cast".|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song {{describe}} a [...] "tortured romantic scenario" [...] of a newly formed couple's relationship, which, according to McCall, is enhanced by the piano and guitar arrangements. Kelley and Scott alternate on lead vocals. It speaks of the couple who prefer not to take their romantic relationship further anytime soon, want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> slow, and are satisfied with [...] "just a goodnight kiss". McCall {{also noted that the}} lyrics portray how the female character's lines, sung by Scott, attempt to fight back her lustful feelings, and precariously sighs the line [...] "I don't want to mess this thing up." [...] Scott told Billboard that [...] "there is so much excitement {{at the beginning of a}} new relationship ... all the butterflies and that optimistic feeling that this person could be 'the one'. This song is about one of those times when your brain kicks in and tells your heart 'good things are worth waiting for.'" [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that the song's production is [...] "emblematic of the album's midtempo complacency." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix noted that the strings [...] "give a nice lift at the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after her}} character's arrival on-screen, Robbie said [...] "There is some love {{coming up for}} Donna. She gets into a long term {{relationship}} and really falls for someone." [...] Donna first kisses Ringo Brown (Sam Clark) at a kissing booth to get in with the established teen group. Donna and Ringo later begin a relationship, but when Donna wants <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> further, Ringo tells her {{that he wants to}} slow things down. Donna believes that she is being rejected and when she hears about Ringo's relationship with Carmella Cammeniti (Natalie Blair) and then sees them together, she confronts Ringo. Ringo then tries to convince Donna that his heart belongs to her. The couple's relationship goes through various problems. During a moment of time together at home, Donna leaves Ringo to retrieve the cat and the house is set alight. Donna is forced to rescue Ringo and drag him outside. After Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) returns to Ramsay Street, Ringo believes that Donna had cheated on him with his friend and breaks up with her. Donna then goes to Zeke to seek solace and it leads to a love triangle between the three of them.|$|E
2500|$|Schuyler is {{also noted}} for his {{distinct}} ability <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>things</b> that are [...] "normal," [...] and bring out their greatness.
