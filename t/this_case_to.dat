5|$|Macbeth {{eventually}} {{sees that}} Banquo {{can no longer}} be trusted to aid him in his evil, and considers his friend a threat to his newly acquired throne. Thus he has him murdered. Banquo's ability to live on in different ways is another oppositional force, in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> Macbeth's impending death. His spirit lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly presence at the banquet.|$|E
5|$|The River Welland {{was one of}} {{the earlier}} on which improvements, in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> allow {{navigation}} to Stamford, were authorised by an act of Parliament. The act was granted in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in 1571, and the preamble explained how Stamford had prospered {{as a result of the}} river, but also stated that mills built between Stamford and Deeping had resulted in it no longer being navigable, as they had diverted the water. Powers were granted to restore the river using either the old channel or the new one, although it is not clear exactly what was meant by this. There is no evidence that any work was carried out under the terms of the act.|$|E

25|$|Eisner v. Macomber {{is a key}} case {{in income}} tax law. Its rather narrow but {{important}} application is often misapplied or misunderstood by tax protesters. Anti-tax activists often use <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> argue that wages from labor cannot be taxed as income. The decision in Eisner v. Macomber, however, was not about wages, and the exception for stock dividends was narrow.|$|E
25|$|Unit #1809 {{was also}} sent for cold-weather testing, in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> the Alaska Railroad for a 3-year trial period. Shipped back in 1955, its engine was rebored {{to a larger}} size and {{slightly}} greater power output, then placed into storage. In 1969 it was reactivated {{and sent to the}} Vandenberg Air Force Base for service hauling supplies for the proposed Manned Orbiting Laboratory and components for Titan launch vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Research {{has also}} found that {{corporate}} social marketing, a form of CSR promoting societal good, {{is being used to}} direct criticism away from the damaging practices of the alcohol industry. It has been shown that adverts which supposedly encourage responsible drinking simultaneously aim to promote drinking as a social norm. Companies may engage in CSR and social marketing in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> prevent more stringent government legislation on alcohol marketing.|$|E
25|$|Hatip Dicle (BDP) was {{stripped}} of his seat after losing an appeal against a prior conviction for spreading terrorist propaganda. His seat went to Oya Eronat of the AKP. There are speculations that the remaining BDP MPs boycotted parliament because of this incident, but that attitude did not bring him to the parliament. Both AKP and CHP favoured amending the law in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> allow Dicle to take his seat; a similar case had already applied to PM Erdoğan in 2003, when the law was also changed to allow for his seating.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} that the Court of Chancery was acting, here, in its most ancient role, that of a court of conscience. This entailed the moral law applied to prevent peril to {{the soul of the}} wrongdoer through mortal sin. The remedy was given to the plaintiff (the Crown, in <b>this</b> <b>case)</b> <b>to</b> look after the wrongdoer's soul; the benefit to the plaintiff was only incidental. This is also the explanation for specific performance, which compels the sinner to put matters right. The whole conception is mediæval in origin.|$|E

25|$|The Titans {{advanced}} {{to their first}} Super Bowl in team history, after originating as a charter member of the American Football League. From 1960 to 1996, the team was owned by Houston, Texas businessman Bud Adams and known as the Houston Oilers. By 1995, however, Adams, like Frontiere, was lured to move his team from Houston, in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> a new stadium in Nashville, Tennessee. Since this new stadium was not ready until the 1999 season, Adams decided to move his team to Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee in 1997 after playing before small Houston crowds in 1996.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Richard North filed a {{complaint}} of discrimination with the Manitoba Human Rights Commission when the Government of Manitoba again refused to register his marriage to Chris Vogel in the Unitarian Church. The Commission has referred <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> an adjudicator who will hear and decide the complaint in November 2017. The marriage certificate issued {{to them by the}} Unitarian Church in 1974 is now on display at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. A portrait of Vogel and North, by artist Rosey Goodman, is held by the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives in its National Portrait Collection.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in BB84 is quantum transmission. Alice creates a random bit (0 or 1) and then {{randomly}} selects one of her two bases (rectilinear or diagonal in <b>this</b> <b>case)</b> <b>to</b> transmit it in. She then prepares a photon polarization state depending both on the bit value and basis, {{as shown in the}} adjacent table. So for example a 0 is encoded in the rectilinear basis (+) as a vertical polarization state, and a 1 is encoded in the diagonal basis (x) as a 135° state. Alice then transmits a single photon in the state specified to Bob, using the quantum channel. This process is then repeated from the random bit stage, with Alice recording the state, basis and time of each photon sent.|$|E

25|$|Although {{individual}} members of Congress {{have every right to}} express their views and the views of their constituents with respect to their religious beliefs and principles and their personal standards of who may marry whom, this court cannot conclude that Congress is entitled to solemnize such views in the laws of this nation in disregard of the views, legal status and living arrangements of a significant segment of our citizenry that includes the Debtors in <b>this</b> <b>case.</b> <b>To</b> do so violates the Debtors' right to equal protection of those laws embodied in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. This court cannot conclude from the evidence or the record in this case that any valid governmental interest is advanced by DOMA as applied to the Debtors.|$|E
25|$|Harold Macmillan link: On 26 November 1950 His Grace The 10th Duke of Devonshire {{had a heart}} attack. Adams tended him and was by {{his side}} when he died, 13 days {{after the death of}} Morrell. The coroner should have been notified, since the Duke had not seen a doctor in the 14 days before his death. Because of a {{loophole}} in the law, Adams, though present at death, could sign the death certificate to state that the Duke died naturally. The Duke's sister was married to Harold Macmillan, and some have argued that Macmillan, who became Prime Minister during preparations for the trial, might not have wanted <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> be investigated further: The Attorney-General, Manningham-Buller, attended Cabinet meetings regularly.|$|E
25|$|The first Arab {{tribes to}} adopt Christianity were likely Nabataeans and Ghassanids. During {{the fifth and}} sixth centuries, the Ghassanids, who adopted Monophysitism, formed {{one of the most}} {{powerful}} confederations allied to Christian Byzantium, being a buffer against the pagan tribes of Arabia. The last king of the Lakhmids, al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir, a client of the Sasanian Empire in the late sixth century, also converted to Christianity (in <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>to</b> the Nestorian sect). Arab Christians played important roles in al-Nahda movement in modern times, and because Arab Christians formed the educated upper class and the bourgeoisie, they have had a significant impact in politics, business and culture of the Arab world. Today Arab Christians still play important roles in the Arab world, and Christians are relatively wealthy, well educated, and politically moderate.|$|E

25|$|I defend {{absolutely}} Mr Farage's {{right to}} disagree about the policy or {{institutions of the}} Union, but not to personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country from which they may come... I myself fought for free speech as the absolute cornerstone of a democratic society. But with freedom comes responsibility– in <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>to</b> respect the dignity of others and of our institutions. I am disappointed by Mr Farage's behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European Parliament. I invited him to apologise, but he declined to do so. I have therefore– {{as an expression of}} the seriousness of the matter– rescinded his right to ten days' daily allowance as a Member.|$|E
25|$|Jovan Vraniškovski {{is facing}} a detainment order for a third retrial of a third case {{in which he was}} {{initially}} acquitted by the Veles Trial Court in April 2006 on charges of embezzling 324,000 Euro from MOC funds while he was a bishop with the MOC. The case was returned to the Veles Trial Court for retrial by the Court of Appeals in Skopje, and he was acquitted for a second time in April 2007. On November 14, 2007, the Court of Appeals in Skopje returned <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> the Veles Trial Court for a third trial. Vraniškovski's attorney claimed that neither he nor Vraniškovski was asked to appear in court to testify in the case. On March 17, 2008, the Veles court issued a detention order for Vraniškovski for failing to appear in court.|$|E
25|$|In October 2005 it was {{discovered}} that civil servants of the Immigration & Naturalisation Services had informed the Congolese embassy and authorities that several of the people sent back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo had applied for asylum in the Netherlands. The Congo had long been struggling with civil war. This information is considered confidential and should not have been disclosed to the Congolese authorities. Verdonk at first denied any wrongdoing, but later admitted that she had lied. In several cases, the Congolese embassy had been informed that several returnees had applied for asylum in the Netherlands. According to members of the opposition, this information could put returnees (in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> Congo) at risk of torture or other oppression, but no party or organization provided documentation for the claim. Verdonk maintains that no other sensitive information was given to the Congolese authorities, in accordance with the findings of a special committee (Commissie Havermans).|$|E
