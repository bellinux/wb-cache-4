25|$|The main {{celebrations}} {{of the town}} are Carnival and the Feast of the Señor del Sacromonte, which overlap each other. Carnival begins on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday with the traditional accompaniments such as food, amusement rides, local dances such as Los Doce Pares de Francia, Moros y Cristianos and Los Arrieros. However, most of these end on the following Monday, rather than on <b>Tuesday.</b> <b>On</b> Tuesday night, the Señor del Sacromonte is taken from his sanctuary in procession to the parish of La Asuncion {{in the center of}} Amecameca. He remains there until Easter Sunday. One last vestige of Carnival takes place on Ash Wednesday, when the Dance of the Chinelos is performed. People costumed in large turbans, robes and bearded masks, perform just after midday. After that point, the celebrations {{for the rest of the}} week are focused on the Señor del Sacromonte with masses, pilgrimages and a dance called the Azteca-Chichimeca which dates back to the Conquest. The best-known group to perform this dances under the banner of the Señor del Sacromonte and visits many local and national religious festivities in places like Chalma, the Basilica of Guadalupe and others. Pilgrimages are made to both the La Asunción Church and to the Sanctuary on the hill above. Tradition states that first time visitors to the Sanctuary place a crown of flowers on their heads.|$|E

2500|$|The footage shows {{interviewer}} Steve Murphy asking Dion the question: [...] "If {{you were}} the Prime Minister now, {{what would you have}} done about the economy, and this crisis, that Mr. Harper has not done?".

[...] Eventually, after three start overs to the interview, Dion responded with what he would do if elected Prime Minister in the future. CTV initially agreed to restart the interviews and not air the false starts but changed their minds and announced that they felt it was their responsibility to show it. Harper responded to the clips by saying that [...] "When you're running a trillion-and-a-half-dollar economy you don't get a chance to have do-overs, over and over again" [...] and [...] "What this incident actually indicates very clearly is Mr. Dion and the Liberal Party really don't know what they would do on the economy", and when told that the difficulties were in part due to English being Dion's second language, Harper said: [...] "I don't think this is a question of language at all. The question was very clear. It was asked repeatedly".|$|E
