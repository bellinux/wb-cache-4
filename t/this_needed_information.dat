30|$|In this paper, {{a unified}} {{approach}} is proposed for nonblind and quasiblind NPT-based watermarking. In the quasiblind case, the extraction technique requires little {{information about the}} original host image that is needed for the complete recovery of both the host image and watermarking logo. <b>This</b> <b>needed</b> <b>information</b> is conveyed by the watermarked image itself with no or negligible degradation. Illustrative examples are given to show {{the quality of the}} watermarked images, as well as the extracted watermarking logo and its performance in the presence of attacks. Hardware implementations using DSP have experimentally proved computer simulations. In fact, apart from its simplicity, the method is virtually insensitive to cropping attacks and performs well in case of compression and noise attacks. The proposed approach also delivers an extracted watermark that is not only perfect/semiperfect but also can be visually seen by the user, which gives the application more user confidence and trust.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{disconnect}} between how legal and sporting authorities, {{on the one}} hand, and many elite athletes, on the other, view the use of performance-enhancing substances. While official and popular narratives portray {{the use of these}} substances as isolated examples of deviant behavior, to the elite athletes who daily push their bodies beyond societally normal limits of pain and risk, enhancement is oftentimes an accepted part of the job. As a result, efforts to regulate and detect athletes’ use of these substances have consistently captured {{only a small fraction of}} the use that exists. This Article describes the ways in which this disconnect is produced (at least in part) by the regulatory regimes surrounding performance-enhancing substances: Substances are prohibited for athletic use in the absence of solid evidence concerning how they act on healthy bodies, and whether, in many instances, they even enhance performance. This ignorance is perpetuated by prohibition, increasing the use — and the potential for harm from the use — of the very substances that are prohibited. The Article identifies specific information needed to align the interests of athletes and governing bodies in an effort to reduce the harm from use of these substances. Additionally, it identifies sources from which <b>this</b> <b>needed</b> <b>information</b> may be gathered effectively and ethically. In conclusion, it emphasizes an approach to regulating the use of performance-enhancing substances that is consistent with the values and practices of elite sport, while reducing the risk of unnecessary harm...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIt {{is obvious that}} information is becoming increasingly important in todays society. This {{can be seen by}} the widespread availability of high-speed Internet in homes and the ubiquity of smart phones. This new information centric paradigm is possible because of a large supporting infrastructure without which the Internet, the volumes of information, and the speed we can access them would not exist. The military has recognized the potential value of this trend because the greatest hindrance that any commander has is the fog of warthe absence of the information necessary to make critical decisions. On a battlefield, a commander would like to know the status and location of all of his soldiers, the same for enemy troops, and optimal strategies to accomplish their mission. Unfortunately <b>this</b> <b>needed</b> <b>information</b> is currently impossible to obtain in a timely manner. This thesis addresses these problems by presenting an architecture for ad-hoc distributed computing among mobile devices. Our results show that our system does indeed, as devices are added, speed up a distributed calculation and does {{it in a way that}} does not rely on the presence of a routable network. We also show that the speedup obtained nears optimal as the size of the computation necessary to calculate an update increases. Additionally, we have shown that we can chain distributed computations together resulting in a decreased amount of time needed to perform an SVD, an important step in many data-mining algorithms.

With the coming of age of the electronic journals, it has totally altered the way scholarly information is disseminated throughout the world. There {{is no doubt that}} this particular innovation has changed the information usage of scientists. Invariably the role of the librarians has dramatically changed to meet the ‘vibrant electronic needs’ of the scientists and engineers. Electronic journals have greatly affected not only the way information has spread, but also the way in which electronic information is acquired and how the scientists, engineers, scholars researchers seek <b>this</b> <b>needed</b> <b>information.</b> However, electronic journals are not free from issues and problems. A research survey was undertaken to study the ‘Problematic Issues with E-Journal Features’ faced by the Aerospace Scientists and Engineers of the selected 16 aerospace organizations of Bangalore.

40|$|After the 1 st of July 2006, all {{electronic}} products {{should be}} free of materials defined by RoHS. This includes the use of lead. Basically, conventional solder contains lead as base material. To distinguish products according to their content and as a transition process towards the lead-free electronics, marking of electronic products to support the supply chain is required. Main driver for developing marking is the legislative requirements. The paper collects different solutions and shows the complexity between marking for awareness and the costs aspects. The standardisation organisations have to combine their efforts to make a useful label, {{but it is possible}} too, that various component manufacturers will change nothing in its inner identification system. But under which conditions marking can enforce environmental issues beneath the legislative requirements? This paper will discuss labelling/marking of electronic products base on {{the point of view of}} legislative requirements as well as the technical requirements to support environmental friendly electronic products. In the paper scenarios for service and repair as well as collection and recycling of waste electronics will be developed. Service has the aim to return products to its use with the same or a higher functionality. Repair is a process that enable the use of a product for a further period and can be combined with an upgrading. The possibility whether a product can be reused or not will be decided by an adapted collection process. At the end, if reuse is impossible or not economically realizable, the recycling of the material content is required. We have to investigate the details of these processes to define the flow of different kinds of information. Different technical solutions should be analysed regarding a higher potential of good business. From this it follows that the technical information can enable more and better business processes with a positive environmental effect. The amount of <b>this</b> <b>needed</b> <b>information</b> defines the kind and the dimensions of a label. The paper is interesting for developers and designers of electronic assemblies.

Software security and reliability {{have become increasingly}} important in the mod- ern world. An effective approach to enforcing software security and reliability is to monitor a program’s execution at run time. However, instrumentation-based imple- mentation of a dynamic program monitor on single-core systems suffers significant performance overhead. As multi-core architecture becomes more mainstream, im- plementing efficient dynamic program monitoring by assigning monitoring activities onto separate processor cores and thus reducing performance overhead becomes not only a feasible but an appealing way to enforce software security and reliability. To achieve efficient and flexible multi-core based dynamic program monitoring, however, three challenging issues must be carefully considered and adequately addressed: the hardware support, the monitoring model, and the parallelization of monitoring tasks. This dissertation proposes novel solutions to these challenging problems. The hardware support proposed in this dissertation, which {{is referred to as}} extraction logic, selectively extracts execution information from the monitored program and forwards it to a monitor running on a separate CPU core. The extraction logic is generic and configurable by the monitor so that it can support a large spectrum of monitoring tasks. Based on this generic hardware support, this dissertation proposes a novel monitoring model, referred to as the distill-based monitor model. Monitors in this execution model is generated by special compiler supports. The distill-based monitor model is based on the observation that a monitor needs only partial informa- tion from the monitored execution and that of <b>this</b> <b>needed</b> <b>information,</b> some can be easily computed by the monitor from other information that has already been com- municated. We implemented a code generator and optimization techniques to decide which set of information to forward and which set to compute so as to minimize the total execution time of the monitor. This compiler support can optimize a variety of monitors with diverse monitoring requirements, taking as input the control flow graph of the monitored program and the set of monitoring requirements. To parallelize monitoring tasks, this dissertation proposes a novel paralleliza- tion paradigm built on General-purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) architecture. In the following chapters, we first propose a generic, purely software-based GPGPU monitor framework that is flexible enough to support par- allelization of various kinds of monitoring tasks. Furthermore, we propose software- based optimization techniques built on this framework that effectively take advantage of various characteristics of monitoring tasks such as taint-propagation and memory- bug detection, and thus achieve significant performance improvement. This dissertation reports the performance improvement achieved by the proposed monitoring model and parallelization paradigm. Relative to the performance of traditional instrumentation-based monitor for taint-propagation and memory-bug- detection, the proposed compiler support is able to bring down performance overhead by 3. 7 times and 2. 2 times for SPEC 2006 INT benchmarks. The proposed GPGPU- based monitor with optimization even achieves more for memory-bug detection, re- ducing performance overhead by 5. 2 times...|$|E

We demonstrate the performance of these components — separately and together — for a 52 -week forecasting horizon and then validate the model on a number of actual new product tests. The model’s excellent performance makes it possible to shorten the timeframe required for model calibration from a typical six-month interval down to a twelve-week period, a very significant improvement for today’s highly competitive new product marketplace. ...|$|R
