5|$|Mediterranean tropical-like cyclones, {{sometimes}} referred to as Mediterranean hurricanes or medicanes, are rare meteorological phenomena observed in the Mediterranean Sea. Due to the dry nature of the Mediterranean region, formation of tropical cyclones is infrequent, with only 99recorded tropical-like storms between 1948 and 2011. No agency, however, is officially responsible for monitoring the formation and development of medicanes. Tropical cyclogenesis typically occurs within two separate regions of the sea. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>region,</b> encompassing areas of the western Mediterranean, is more conducive for development than the other, the Ionian Sea to the east. The rough mountainous geography of the region raises additional difficulties despite being favorable for the development of severe weather and convective activity in general, and only with abnormal meteorological circumstances can medicanes form. Numerous studies have been conducted on the impact of global warming on Mediterranean tropical cyclone formation, generally concluding that fewer yet more intense storms would form.|$|E
5|$|The Lincolnshire {{area was}} {{originally}} {{a part of}} the town of Half Day, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>region</b> settled by non-Native American peoples in Lake County. The first white settler in the Lincolnshire area was Captain Daniel Wright, who arrived in 1834. Chief Halfda allowed Wright to build his cabin {{at the south end of}} the Potawatomi village at the site of the intersection of present-day Milwaukee Avenue and Aptakisic Road. The Potawatomi tribesmen were ousted a year later in the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which was implemented two years after its ratification, and faced relocation.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>region</b> {{on either}} side of the bilayer is the {{hydrophilic}} headgroup. This portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9nm thick. In phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5nm outside the hydrophobic core. In some cases, the hydrated region can extend much further, for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head. One common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane, which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration.|$|E

25|$|The cuticle is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>region</b> of {{the hair}} that is {{attacked}} in an A. fulvescens infection. This attack resembles that of true dermatophytes in that some lateral hyphae give rise to fronded mycelium. However, some hyphae also give rise to appressoria, or flattened hyphal pressing organs, which are characteristic of non-keratinophilic fungi. Dermatophytes digest the hair cuticle rapidly, unlike A.fulvescens, which breaks the cuticle down so slowly that the scales are still visible for weeks after the hair has been infected.|$|E

25|$|Around 1500BC a tribe {{called the}} Oenotri ("vine-cultivators"), {{settled in the}} region. According to Greek mythology they were Greeks who were led to the region by their king, Oenotrus. The Greeks used the term 'italoi', which {{according}} to some ancient Greek writers was derived from a legendary king of the Oenotri, Italus and according to others from the bull. Originally the Greeks used 'italoi' to indicate Calabria and later it became synonymous {{with the rest of}} the peninsula. Calabria therefore was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>region</b> to be called Italia (Italy).|$|E
25|$|Battisti was {{released}} on 9 June 2011 from prison after the Brazilian Constitutional Court denied Italy's request to extradite him.

25|$|New England is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>region</b> of {{the country}} where all states within it have granted {{marriage}} rights to same-sex couples. The rapid makeover of its legal landscape made New England a notable standout within the United States. In other parts {{of the country}}, while support for same-sex marriage had been gaining steadily, it was still a minority view. Only two states and one district outside the region, Iowa, neighboring New York and the District of Columbia, had allowed same-sex marriage before the 2012 election; voters in California struck down a law supporting such marriages during the fall of 2008.|$|E

25|$|Belgium was {{the second}} country, after Britain, in which the Industrial Revolution took place and the first in {{continental}} Europe: Wallonia (French speaking southern Belgium) was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>region</b> to follow the British model successfully. Starting {{in the middle of}} the 1820s, and especially after Belgium became an independent nation in 1830, numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around Liège and Charleroi. The leader was a transplanted Englishman John Cockerill. His factories at Seraing integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, {{a steady}} stream of under-performing vintages and {{excessively}} high prices caused a significant drop in sales, while other Spanish wine regions like the Ribera del Duero began to emerge, capturing more international attention and sales. In response, modern Rioja winemakers began experimenting with more international styles of wine, younger, more powerful and deeply colored than the traditional Rioja. The heavy use of oak was restrained with the aim of releasing wines onto the market sooner, so that they could be enjoyed earlier. Sales began to improve and in 1991, Rioja was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>region</b> to be awarded Denominación de Origen Calificada status, with which the Spanish recognised the Rioja as its premier wine region.|$|E
25|$|Brittany, {{apart from}} some {{areas such as}} Lorient, Nantes and Saint-Nazaire, has never been heavily industrialised. Today, fishing and {{agriculture}} remain important activities. Brittany has more than 40,000 agricultural exploitations, mostly oriented towards cattle, pig and poultry breeding, and cereals and vegetables production. The number of exploitations tends to diminish, but as a result, they are merged into very large estates. Brittany is the first producer in France for vegetables (green beans, onions, artichokes, potatoes, tomatoes...). Cereals are mostly grown for cattle feeding. Wine, especially muscadet, is made in a small region south of Nantes. Brittany is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>region</b> in France for fishing. The activity employs around 9,000 people, and more than 60 firms work in fish and seafood processing.|$|E
25|$|After the 1757 Battle of Plassey, Bengal was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>region</b> of the Indian subcontinent conquered by the British East India Company. The company {{formed the}} Presidency of Fort William, which {{administered}} the region until 1858. A notable aspect of company rule was the Permanent Settlement, which established the feudal zamindari system. A number of famines, including the great Bengal famine of 1770, occurred under company rule. Several rebellions broke {{out during the}} early 19th century (including one led by Titumir), but British rule displaced the Muslim ruling class. A conservative Islamic cleric, Haji Shariatullah, sought to overthrow the British by propagating Islamic revivalism. Several towns in Bangladesh participated in the Indian Mutiny and pledged allegiance to the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, who was later exiled to neighboring Burma.|$|E
30|$|Model fitting is {{performed}} in the lavaan package in R [23]. For identifiability, we fix the loading of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> brain <b>region</b> measurement per region group (latent variable) to 1.
