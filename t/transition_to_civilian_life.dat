5|$|The {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military after World War II involved discharging almost 600,000 men {{and women}} from the military, supporting their <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>life</b> and reducing the three armed services to peacetime strengths. Planning for the demobilisation process began in 1942 and thousands of service{{men and women}} were discharged {{in the last years of}} the war in response to shortages of labour in the domestic war economy. The general demobilisation of the military began in October 1945 and was completed in February 1947. The demobilisation process was largely successful, though some military personnel stationed in the South West Pacific complained that their repatriation to Australia was too slow.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{discussion}} paper is to explore the existing literature from Canada on <b>transitioning</b> from military <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>life</b> for veterans of recent deployments. A number of topics relating <b>to</b> the <b>transition</b> experience emerged: interpersonal readjustment, emotional including mental health needs, school needs, and social needs. Implications for nursing {{will be discussed in}} terms of veterans as a cultural group and culturally competent nursing care. Recommendations for future nursing research include how well current services are meeting the needs of the younger, more recent veterans <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> life; conducting longitudinal studies on the impact of <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>life</b> for veterans and their families; comparing the transition experience at an international level; developing a transition model that situates the veteran culture as the overarching framework for testing and understanding the experience of <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>life...</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the health}} and {{wellbeing}} of military veterans has generated soaring interest politically and in the media, highlighting {{the need to develop}} services <b>to</b> support the <b>transition</b> and resettlement <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>life</b> of ex-service personnel. Research in the UK indicates that after leaving military service the majority of ex-service personnel have favourable outcomes; however there is a significant minority who will experience difficulties in this transition. Military veterans will confront various obstacles in their return <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> life: many will experience a lost sense of purpose, thus finding it harder to resume social activities and re-organizing family life will challenge both the veterans and their families. Many of these difficulties in <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>life</b> can be associated with a common mental health problem (anxiety, depression, and alcohol misuse), family violence, child abuse and neglect, and offending behaviour. This presentation will explore some of these gaps in our knowledge about the mental health needs of military veterans and it will report on the preliminary findings of a study exploring veterans’ engagement with and experience of mental health services. The discussions will address the distinctive gap in UK research about the impact of <b>transitioning</b> back <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>life</b> on veterans’ families and the best practices for delivering services to military veterans’ and their families...|$|R

40|$|Few {{colleges and}} {{universities}} have adopted the practice to provide credits for the majority of undergraduate coursework for military career training. Easing the <b>transition</b> from military <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>life</b> has become a priority for the Department of Defense, yet there is a significant gap in empirical knowledge regarding the potential benefits of a college degree on soldiers exiting the military. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the lived experiences of Army Medics who have transitioned back into <b>civilian</b> <b>life</b> after graduating from a college degree program that grants significant credit for military training. This phenomenological study used a conceptual framework derived from Schlossbergâ??s adult transition theory. Data were collected from a focus group, semi-structured interviews, and interviewer notes. Seven participants were identified through purposive sampling. Interview transcripts and interviewer notes were analyzed using the Van Kaam method and yielded 4 pre-transition and 6 transitional themes. Findings indicated that the participantsâ?? initial fears of the transition were replaced with higher perceptions of self-worth and confidence, which benefitted them as they assimilated back into civilian society. The implications for positive social change include informing the Department of Defense and policymakers who are supporting soldiers <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>life</b> about study participantsâ?? increased feelings of self-worth and confidence upon degree completion...|$|R

50|$|The United States Army Correctional Brigade is {{a prison}} which prepares prisoners for <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>life</b> as useful {{citizens}} or, {{in a few}} select cases, for return to military service. Prior to 1 October 1992, Camp Funston was {{the home of the}} brigade. The Correctional Brigade environment was unique in that prisoner control was maintained by military discipline, instead of walls and bars for most of the typical prisoners’ stay. The Correctional Brigade's philosophy is that the minimum custody/military discipline environment when coupled with correctional treatment, educational programs, military and vocational training best prepared the typical first-time prisoner for a crime-free life after prison as either a productive soldier or a useful citizen in civilian life. Moreover, this correctional system was asserted to be less expensive to establish and operate than the traditional prison.|$|E
