5000|$|Unlike Bernal Díaz, who was {{recording}} {{his memories}} {{many years after}} the fact, Cortés wrote his Cartas de relación (Letters from Mexico) to justify his actions to the Spanish Crown. His prose is characterized by simple descriptions and explanations, along with frequent personal addresses to the King. In his Second Letter, Cortés describes his first [...] with Moctezuma thus:Mutezuma [...] came to greet us and with him some two hundred lords, all barefoot and dressed in a different costume, but also very rich in their way and {{more so than the}} others. They came in <b>two</b> <b>columns,</b> <b>pressed</b> very close to the walls of the street, which is very wide and beautiful and so straight that you can see {{from one end to the}} other. Mutezuma came down the middle of this street with two chiefs, one on his right hand and the other on his left. And they were all dressed alike except that Mutezuma wore sandals whereas the others went barefoot; and they held his arm on either side. (Translation: Anthony Pagden 1986:84) ...|$|R
5000|$|A later adding machine, {{called the}} comptometer, {{did not require}} that a crank be pulled to add. Numbers were input simply by {{pressing}} keys.

Using the above example, four fingers would be used to press down twice on the 3 (fourth column), 4 (third column), 7(second column) and 2 (first column) keys. That finger shape would then move left <b>two</b> <b>columns</b> and <b>press</b> once. Usually a small crank near the wheels would be used to zero them.|$|R
40|$|For {{production}} of components, {{which are made}} by open die forging, are used forging hammers and hydraulic presses. The project contains a dividing of machines, short description, advantages and disadvantages and using of concrete types of forging hammers and hydraulic presses in practice. Advantages of forging hammers are simple construction, high range of choice from many types and simple maintenance. Disadvantages are big shakes and danger of accident. Forging hammers can be chosen from spring, pneumatic, hydraulic and steam air types with or without acceleration. Hydraulic presses are divided into push -down presses (two and four - <b>column</b> <b>presses)</b> and pull - down presses (two and four - <b>column</b> <b>presses).</b> Advantages consist in simple operating and controlling via computer. Disadvantages are complicated construction and difficult maintenance...|$|R
