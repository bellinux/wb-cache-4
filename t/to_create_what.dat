5|$|Liman's directorial {{method was}} often hands-on. Many times he {{operated}} the camera himself in order <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>what</b> he believed {{was a more}} intimate relationship between himself, the material, and the actors. He felt that this connection was lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he developed from his background as a small-scale indie film maker.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and I (2003), a {{documentary}} by Danish director Anders Høgsbro Østergaard based on Numa Sadoul's 1971 interview with Hergé, includes restored {{portions of the}} interview that Hergé had heavily edited and rewritten in Sadoul's book. With full access to the audio recordings, the filmmaker explored the personal issues that the author had while he was creating Tintin in Tibet and how they drove him <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>what</b> is now regarded as his most personal adventure.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of captive breeding methods {{has led to}} peregrines being commercially available for falconry use, thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry. The main reason for taking wild peregrines {{at this point is}} to maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines. Hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also available that can combine the best features of both species <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>what</b> many consider to be the ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse. These hybrids combine the greater size, strength, and horizontal speed of the gyrfalcon with the natural propensity to stoop and greater warm weather tolerance of the peregrine.|$|E
50|$|Some artistic {{individuals}} combine digital scrapbooking {{with traditional}} scrapbooking <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>what's</b> known as hybrid scrapbooking. Hybrid scrapbooking involves creating layouts {{on the computer}} using digital supplies that will then be printed and combined with traditional supplies such as buttons, ribbons and other elements.|$|R

5000|$|The {{instrumental}} scoring for {{the film}} was composed by Mark Mancina, who had previously produced music for The Lion King, and the musical of the same name. Mancina and Collins worked closely <b>to</b> <b>create</b> music that would complement the film's setting, and used many obscure instruments from Mancina's personal collection in the score. [...] "The idea of score and song arrangement came together as one entity, as Phil and I worked in tandem <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>what's</b> heard in the film," [...] Mancina said.|$|R
5|$|The film follows {{rock band}} Thirty Seconds to Mars as they first learn of and then begin {{to fight a}} $30 million lawsuit brought by record label EMI. At the time, they had been writing songs in {{preparation}} for the follow-up to their 2005 album A Beautiful Lie. For the bulk of the film, the band, consisting of Jared Leto, his brother Shannon Leto, and Tomo Miličević, is shown working with producers Flood and Steve Lillywhite <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>what</b> would eventually become This Is War. Between recording sessions, they meet with lawyers to negotiate for the band's survival.|$|E
5|$|Freda's {{ambition}} {{to make a}} horror film derived from his desire to make films in the fantastique style, feeling that only the Americans and German expressionists {{were able to make}} such films in the past. Freda approached film producer Luigi Carpentieri with the idea of the film despite not having a treatment ready. Promising them that he would have something for them by the next day, he returned with a tape of his treatment that was complete with sound effects. Carpentieri phoned Goffredo Lombardo to convince him further. Freda followed up his tape with the promise that his script could pass the censors and could be filmed in 12 days. This convinced the producer who allowed Freda <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>what</b> became I Vampiri. I Vampiri was a low-budget production with Donati and Capentieri of Athena and Lombardo's Titanus investing 32 million lire each initially into the film. The initial budget was 97 million Italian lire which increased to 142 million for its post-production and release after the films format was switched to panoramic CinemaScope.|$|E
5|$|John Gilchriese {{became friends}} with John Flood, who had been Wyatt Earp’s secretary, confidante, and best friend for many years. When Earp died, Flood {{inherited}} many of his personal belongings. Flood in turn willed them to Gilchriese, who amassed {{over a number of}} years one of the largest collections of personal items belonging to Wyatt and Virgil Earp, along with many unpublished photos of them and their family. Gilchriese opened the Wyatt Earp Museum in Tombstone in 1966 and commissioned Western artist Don Perceval to paint the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The oil on masonite painting titled The Street Fight is 6 feet 4 inches by 4 feet (1.93 m by 1.22 m). It was the largest work ever executed by Perceval. He referred to original documents in Gilchriese's collection, including Wyatt Earp's own diagram of the shootout, and unpublished notes made by John Flood, <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>what</b> is regarded as the most accurate depiction of the shootout. Gilchreise had 500 lithographic prints reproduced from the original, which Perceval signed. The prints were sold by the museum for $10.|$|E
5000|$|Alternative futures: it {{is helpful}} to examine {{alternative}} paths of development, not just what is currently believed to be most likely or business as usual. Often Foresight will construct multiple scenarios. These may be an interim step on the way <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> <b>what</b> may be known as positive visions, success scenarios, aspirational futures. Sometimes alternative scenarios will be {{a major part of the}} output of Foresight work, with the decision about what future to build being left to other mechanisms.|$|R

Sometimes, Slavic Native Faith groups send guests to the religious meetings of other groups, including those in other countries. Most Slavic Native Faith groups strongly emphasise the commemoration of ancestors in their religious practices. For many Rodnovers, greater importance is given <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> <b>what</b> they perceive as [...] "genuine" [...] Slavic rituals rather than those which will be psychologically empowering.|$|R
5000|$|The Great Salt Lake {{effect is}} a small but {{detectable}} influence on the local climate and weather around the Great Salt Lake in Utah, United States. In particular, snowstorms are a common occurrence over the region and have major socio-economic impacts due to their significant precipitation amounts. The Great Salt lake never freezes and can warm rapidly which allows lake-effect precipitation to occur from September through May. Lake-enhanced snowstorms are often attributed <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> <b>what</b> is locally known as [...] "The Greatest Snow on Earth." ...|$|R
5|$|The nuckelavee's {{breath was}} thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and it was {{considered}} responsible for epidemics and drought. Seaweed burning <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>what</b> was known {{at the time as}} kelp began on Stronsay in 1722. The product– soda ash– was an alkali mainly used to treat acidic soil, although as time went on its commercial importance in soap and glass manufacture increased. The pungent smoke emitted during the process was believed to enrage the nuckelavee, resulting in a wild rampage of plague, the deaths of cattle and the destruction of crops. The nuckelavee was said to have infected horses on Stronsay with the deadly disease known as mortasheen, to demonstrate its fury and exact its revenge against the islanders for burning seaweed; the infection subsequently spread to all the other islands involved in the industry. The creature was also blamed for prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water shortages and poor harvests.|$|E
25|$|The {{major problem}} in visual {{perception}} is that what people see {{is not simply a}} translation of retinal stimuli (i.e., the image on the retina). Thus people interested in perception have long struggled to explain what visual processing does <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>what</b> is actually seen.|$|E

In 1931, he attempted to merge the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company with Bethlehem Steel, a move that was bitterly, and successfully, opposed by other local industrialists.

25|$|Mathematically, the Solow–Swan {{model is}} a {{nonlinear}} system consisting of a single ordinary differential equation that models {{the evolution of the}} per capita stock of capital.
