5|$|After {{retiring}} from the IAEA, Smyth remained active. On the 40th anniversary of the Trinity test in 1985, he denounced President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative and called for joint arms reductions between the United States and the Soviet Union. He died September 11, 1986, in Princeton. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> cardiac arrest, though he had long battled cancer.|$|E
5|$|In November 1992, B-1B (s/n 86-0106) {{from the}} 7th Bomb Wing, 337th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas, flying on a {{low-level}} training flight {{crashed into a}} mountain near Van Horn, Texas. All {{four members of the}} crew were killed, and <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> attributed to pilot error.|$|E
5|$|On 11 December 2015, a train {{pulling into}} the station caught fire, causing it to be evacuated. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> {{believed}} to be a fault in its air conditioning unit.|$|E
50|$|IST and POTS. Beta {{blockers}} <b>are</b> useful if <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> sympathetic overactivity. If <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> due to decreased vagal activity, it {{is usually}} hard to treat and one may consider radiofrequency catheter ablation.|$|R
50|$|Acute RBD, occurs {{mostly as}} a result of a side-effect in {{prescribed}} medication—usually antidepressants. But if not then 55% of <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> unknown <b>the</b> other 45% <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>is</b> associated with alcohol.|$|R

5|$|On 20 August 1927, {{locomotive}} No. 890 River Frome was hauling {{a passenger}} train which was derailed at Bearsted, Kent. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> attributed to track defects. The locomotive was repaired and re-entered service on 23 August. It {{was involved in}} a serious accident the next day.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March 1913, a train {{leaving for}} High Wycombe {{collided}} with another arriving from Leicester, killing one passenger and injuring 23 {{people on the}} incoming train. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> blamed on the intermediate starter signal being lowered before the main starter was ready; {{the view of the}} latter was obscured by the smoke.|$|E
5|$|Æthelstan invaded Scotland {{with a large}} {{military}} and naval force in 934. Although {{the reason for this}} invasion is uncertain, John of Worcester stated that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> Constantine's violation of the peace treaty made in 927. Æthelstan evidently travelled through Beverley, Ripon and Chester-le-Street. The army harassed the Scots up to Kincardineshire and the navy up to Caithness but Æthelstan's force was never engaged.|$|E

5|$|At 10:52am on 26 March 1907, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on {{the approach to}} Felling station. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> {{a combination of a}} sharp frost in the morning and unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink. The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.|$|E
5|$|Combat trials {{began in}} mid-September 1944 and were {{generally}} very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory {{service in the}} La-5FN. One cause was the lower position of the engine air intakes in the wing roots of the La-7 which caused the engine to ingest sand and dust. One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October which caused the fighter to be grounded until <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> determined to be a defect in the wing spar.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was suggested that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E

5|$|Loring {{also had}} its share of {{incidents}} that did not result in fatalities over the years. On 6 March 1955, a B-36 Peacemaker crashed and burned in a snowbank at Loring. All crewmembers were able to escape unharmed. On 26 June 1958, a B-52D (55‑0102) burned on the ground at Loring and was destroyed. On 25 May 1969, a KC-135A (56–3602) broke in two after aborting takeoff. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> a frozen water injection surge tube. On 19 July 1970, a B-52G (58‑0208) also caught on fire and was destroyed on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the film}} was {{temporarily}} shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, {{one of which was}} adjacent to the set for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire hoses to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place would burn down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes {{in the side of the}} building had to be covered with heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{the most}} {{important}} rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known.|$|E

5|$|The deadliest fire in Davenport history came on January 7, 1950, when 41 {{people were}} killed in a fire at the St. Elizabeth's Hospital, a mental ward {{operated}} by Mercy Hospital. Most of the people who lost their lives were female patients trapped behind windows locked shut by rusty, iron bars. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> attributed to a patient who was lighting curtains on fire with a cigarette lighter.|$|E
5|$|There were problems. Inflated bomb damage {{assessment}} reports during operations in northeastern Laos were common, but <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> {{not difficult to}} discern. Mountainous terrain, poor weather, ground cover, the lack of ground forces for confirmation, and the language barrier all contributed to overestimation of the damage inflicted on communist forces by the bombing effort. The result was a skewed sense of the effectiveness and {{the capabilities of the}} campaign. The results of the campaign (which were made obvious by the repeating seasonal nature of PAVN and Pathet Lao offensives), however, indicated that American airpower was quite effective.|$|E
5|$|A {{much larger}} power-related {{incident}} than the December 2011 event occurred on 7 July 2015, when train services {{on both the}} North South and East West lines were shut down in both directions following a major power trip. The disruption lasted for more than 3 hours, affecting 250,000 commuters. This was considered the worst disruption to the MRT network since it first began operations in 1987 – surpassing the December 2011 event. Independent experts from Sweden and Japan were hired to conduct investigation into {{the cause of the}} disruption. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> identified as damage to a third rail insulator due to a water leak at Tanjong Pagar station. Consequently, a program was implemented to replace insulators liable to similar failure. For the July 2015 disruption, LTA imposed a higher penalty of S$5.4 million on SMRT.|$|E

5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E
5|$|For some years, {{the cause}} of the disease was unknown, and {{hypotheses}} included tree ageing, fungi, viruses, and environmental factors such as an increase in ultra-violet light. Another hypothesis was that a genetic problem may have been induced in Northland and Auckland by the thousands of cabbage trees brought into the area from elsewhere and planted in gardens and parks. The Lands and Survey Department had a native plant nursery at Taupo in the central North Island, which was used to grow plants for use in parks, reserves and carparks. In many Northland parks, cabbage trees from the central North Island were growing and flowering within metres of natural forms. Any offspring produced might have been poorly adapted to local conditions. After nearly five years of work, scientists found <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> a bacterium Phytoplasma australiense, which may be spread from tree to tree by a tiny sap-sucking insect, the introduced passion vine hopper.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>was</b> this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E
