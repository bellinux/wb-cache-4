We treat the grain boundaries separating adjacent smectic blocks as interfaces with an anisotropic interfacial tension. At moderate chiral strengths we find a TGBA-TGBC-SmC* sequence.

Collagen-rich structures like tendons and ligaments are materials with {{various levels of}} order, from molecules to bundles of fibers, which affect their biomechanical properties and cellular interactions. Poly-benzyl-L-glutamate (PBLG) displaying helicity was used here to test the development of wave-like structures as those occurring in collagen fibers. Birefringence of PBLG under various crystallization conditions was studied with a lambda/ 4 compensator according to Sénarmont.

We find that a twist boundary configuration with arbitrary misorientation angle can be well described by two modes, and obtain the equations for their slowly varying amplitudes.

50|$|Log {{splitting}} is {{the act of}} splitting firewood from logs {{that have}} been pre-cut into sections (rounds, bolts, billets). This {{can be done by}} hand, using an axe or maul, or by using a mechanical log splitter. When splitting a log by hand, it is best to aim for the cracks (called checks), if there are any visible. Some types of wood are harder to split than others, including extremely hard woods, as well as types like gum which an axe will often bounce off of, and cherry, which is typically so twisted it's near impossible to get a clean split, and elm. Any type of wood, being thick or tall, having large knots or <b>twisted</b> <b>grain</b> can make it difficult to split. In some cases, it is easiest to aim for the edges and split the log into multiple pieces. Batoning is splitting small pieces of wood for kindling or other purposes sometimes with a batoning chisel, a special chisel with one sharp side used for splitting.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present {{competition}} of graphene electronics demands an efficient route which produces high quality and large area graphene. Chemical vapour deposition technique, where hydrocarbons dissociate in to active carbon species and form graphene layer on the desired metal catalyst via nucleation is considered {{as the most}} suitable method. In this study, single layer graphene {{with the presence of}} few layer single crystal graphene grains were grown on Pt foil via chemical vapour deposition. The higher growth temperature changes the surface morphology of the Pt foil so a delicate process of hydrogen bubbling was used to peel off graphene from Pt foil samples with the mechanical support of photoresist and further transferred to SiO 2 /Si substrates for analysis. Optical microscopy of the graphene transferred samples showed the regions of single layer along with different oriented graphene domains. Two type of interlayer stacking sequences, Bernal and twisted, were observed in the graphene grains. The presence of different stacking sequences in the graphene layers influence the electronic and optical properties; in Bernal stacking the band gap can be tunable and in twisted stacking the overall sheet resistance can be reduced. Grain boundaries of Pt provides low energy sites to the carbon species, therefore the nucleation of grains are more at the boundaries. The stacking order and the number of layers in grains were seen more clearly with scanning electron microscopy. Raman spectroscopy showed high quality graphene samples due to very small D peak. 2 D Raman peak for single layer graphene showed full width half maximum (FWHM) value of 30 cm− 1. At points A, B and C, Bernal stacked grain showed FWHM values of 51. 22, 58. 45 and 64. 72 cm− 1, while <b>twisted</b> stacked <b>grain</b> showed the FWHM values of 27. 26, 28. 83 and 20. 99 cm− 1, respectively. FWHM values of 2 D peak of Bernal stacked grain showed an increase of 20 – 30 cm− 1 as compare to single layer graphene which showed its dispersive nature and confirmed Bernal sequence. On the other hand, the slightest decrease in FWHM values of 2 D peak in <b>twisted</b> <b>grain</b> comparing to single layer confirmed the <b>twisted</b> sequence of <b>grains.</b> Atomic force microscopy analysis showed an increasing trend in grain height profile with {{an increase in the number}} of layers...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of chirality, i. e., {{the lack of}} mirror symmetry, has {{a profound effect on}} liquid crystals, not only on the molecular scale but also on the supermolecular scale and phase.

40|$|Abstract. The {{annealing}} {{behavior of}} cold rolled Type 430 {{ferritic stainless steel}} {{is the subject of}} this paper. The steel was cold rolled 79 %, then heated at 6 °C/s to the soaking temperature of 841 °C, which is just below the Ae 1 temperature. During heating, specimens were quenched from selected temperatures between 650 and 841 °C and after various times at 841 °C. These quenched samples underwent metallographic examination and micro-hardness determination. The results indicated that under the prevailing experimental conditions, the hardness appeared to correlate strongly with the extent of recrystallization. The kinetics of recrystallization appeared to originate in the cold worked state, where three kinds of grain were found: (i) “smooth elongated, featureless ” of α-fiber orientation { 001 }; (ii) “irregular fishbone grains ” of the γ-fiber orientations { 111 } plus { 111 }; and (iii) “twisted grains ” of the η-fiber orientation { 001 }. It was found that the <b>twisted</b> <b>grains</b> of the η-fiber were the first to recrystallize, with the fishbone grains of the γ-fiber second, and the smooth elongated, featureless grains of the α-fiber last.

40|$|AbstractHulled barley {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} recovered cereals in European archaeological sites from Roman and medieval periods. In southern France this cereal is common in carbonized contexts such as cultural layers, ditches, pits, hearths, etc. The distinction between the two subspecies, two-rowed (Hordeum vulgare subsp. distichum L.) and six-rowed barley (H.  vulgare subsp. vulgare L.) is usually based on morphological characters. The following criteria can be used to discriminate both subspecies from archaeological remains: the number of fertile spikelets per rachis segments, the linear or horseshoe shape depression of the lemma base, the maximum width of the caryopses and the proportion of <b>twisted</b> <b>grains.</b> The recovery of thousands of caryopses, some clearly twisted, and of rachis segments with sterile spikelets from the site of Petit Clos (Perpignan, Pyrénées-Orientales, France) dating to the Roman period suggests that both subspecies were cultivated during this time in southern Gaul. However evidence for two-rowed barley is usually scarce in archaeobotanical reports from Roman and medieval sites. To confirm the presence of two-rowed barley in the carbonized assemblage from Petit Clos and its cultivation, we developed a new method for analysing caryopses shape using geometric morphometrics with landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks. We compared modern reference specimens to the archaeological grains from several excavations from southern France dating from the 1 st to the 11 th century AD. Several varieties of both subspecies were correctly identified in the modern reference sample using GMM, both before and after carbonization. Archaeological specimens could then be accurately identified. The results confirm that both subspecies of barley were cultivated in southern France during the Roman period...|$|R

Molecular dynamics simulations with the empirical Terso potential were performed to evaluate the energy of the (001), 90 ë twist boundary at T = 0 K.
