Over the following centuries, trade through Nyon remained very profitable and by 1772-73, it was again {{the highest in the}} region. In the 18th century trade and commerce grew strongly. The flow of goods allowed four (after 1738, five) yearly markets. A granary was built in the 18th century. The Bernese rebuilt the Asse canal system to drive tanneries, sawmills and mills. The Faïencerie Baylon earthenware factory was founded in 1769.
