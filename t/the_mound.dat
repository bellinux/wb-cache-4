5|$|Interest {{continued}} in {{the origins of the}} castle, which for a period were forgotten. Local medieval tradition suggested that <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> had been made by the devil, after he completed the dykes at Narborough and Newmarket, but by the Victorian period academics had concluded that <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> was either of Celtic or Norman origin, with late Victorian scholars correctly concluding that the Norman period was the most likely. Other traditions claimed that <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> covered a palace filled with treasure, or six silver bells from Thetford Priory. Archaeological investigations into Red Castle by G. Knocker between 1957–58, and during the early 1960s by R. R. Clarke and Barbara Green revealed the design and date of this castle site.|$|E
5|$|Various {{methods were}} used to build mottes. Where a natural hill could be used, scarping could produce a motte without the need to create an {{artificial}} mound, but more commonly much of the motte {{would have to be}} constructed by hand. Four methods existed for building a mound and a tower: <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> could either be built first, and a tower placed on top of it; the tower could alternatively be built on the original ground surface and then buried within the mound; the tower could potentially be built on the original ground surface and then partially buried within <b>the</b> <b>mound,</b> the buried part forming a cellar beneath; or the tower could be built first, and <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> added later.|$|E
40|$|With 1 figure) This paper {{reports on}} ant and termite species inhabiting <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> (murundus) found in three wetland sites in Santo Antonio da Patrulha. Ants and {{termites}} {{were found in}} 100 % of <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> of two sites and in 20 % {{of those in the}} third site. Colonies of Camponotus fastigatus were found inhabiting all <b>the</b> <b>mounds,</b> while colonies of Brachymyrmex sp., Linepithema sp., Pheidole sp., and/or Solenopsis sp. were collected in less than 30 % of <b>the</b> <b>mounds.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> of <b>the</b> three sites, colonies of Anoplotermes sp. and/or Aparatermes sp. termites were found together with the ant colonies. Another cohabiting termite species, Cortaritermes sp., was found only in <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> of one site. The results suggest that C. fastigatus is the species building <b>the</b> <b>mounds,</b> with <b>the</b> other species, whether ants or termites, being the inquilines...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> two <b>mounds</b> on <b>the</b> site {{were built}} between 1200 and 1500 AD in the Mississippian Period. The first survey of <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> was in 1938; a later survey in 1940 {{revealed}} nine distinctive pieces of pottery. <b>The</b> <b>mounds</b> were excavated in 1964, revealing sixteen bodies. <b>The</b> <b>mounds</b> {{were added to}} the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.|$|R

5|$|As {{the oldest}} parts of Monte Testaccio {{are at the}} bottom of <b>the</b> <b>mound,</b> it is {{difficult}} to say with any certainty when it was first created. Deposits found by excavators have been dated to a period between approximately AD 140 to 250, but it is possible that dumping could have begun on the site as early as the 1st century BC. <b>The</b> <b>mound</b> has a roughly triangular shape comprising two distinct platforms, the eastern side being the oldest. At least four distinct series of terraces were built in a stepped arrangement. Layers of small sherds were laid down in some places, possibly to serve as paths for those carrying out the waste disposal operations.|$|E
5|$|Group F is to {{the west}} of Group E. Mound F is the main {{structure}} within Group F. It slopes gradually away to the west and was not easily defensible on that side, however it lay outside the strong retaining walls of the fortress and appears to have been an observation platform covering the western pass to the city. A retaining wall supported <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> above the pass and a round earth platform upon <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> may have supported a perishable watchtower.|$|E

Stan Rojek pinch hit for Higbe, and walked, loading the bases. Stanky grounded into a double play, ending the inning without the Dodgers scoring any runs. In the bottom of the fifth, Hal Gregg replaced Higbe on <b>the</b> <b>mound,</b> and retired the side in order. The sixth inning contained just one baserunner — Schoendienst — who was stranded on first after hitting a single.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mounds</b> {{overlook}} <b>the</b> floodplain of the Mississippi River. <b>The</b> northern <b>mound</b> {{consists of}} hard clay dirt; <b>the</b> southern <b>mound</b> is more porous. They were first dated in 1982. Due to their location in a heavily trafficked area of campus, <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> gradually {{began to show}} signs of degradation as well as natural erosion. In order to alleviate the issue, the university installed a sidewalk between <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> in 1985. In addition, a low brick wall was placed around <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> in order to prevent vehicles from dangerously crossing <b>the</b> <b>mounds.</b> Unfortunately, erosion continued to take its toll until a restoration project was initiated in 1996. Using river silt, the LSU Facility Services patched damage on both mounds and seeded a hybrid Bermuda grass to prevent future problems. In 2009, LSU professor Brooks Ellwood took core samples that revealed a layer of charcoal, possibly from a pit barbecue or a cremation. Since 1999 they are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
