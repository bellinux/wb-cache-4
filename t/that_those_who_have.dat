5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus is <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> little shall have less, and <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> much shall take all {{that others have}} left. The people are poor; therefore {{they ought to be}} starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya {{answers that}} one may {{complete}} Brahmacharya (the student stage of life), then Grihastha (householder), followed by Vanaprastha (retirement) and finally Sannyasa (pilgrimage as Parivrajaka Bhikshu, renunciation). Or, continues Yajnavalkya, one may renounce immediately {{after completing the}} student stage of life, or after the householder stage, {{regardless of whether or}} not one has completed the sacred fire ritual or any other rituals. Olivelle interprets the sacred fire ritual reference as an indirect reference to marriage, and thus the text asserts <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> married or never married can both renounce. The Jabala Upanishad herein recommends that a person may renounce on the day he feels detached from the world, regardless of which stage of life he is in, and whether he has completed that stage.|$|E

He writes this is due to a fear of failure, and ascribes business success to the experience of learning from failures. Trump compares this to the business sector, writing <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> learned from failures in business simultaneously learn how to become successful entrepreneurs. He differentiates between practical intelligence and academic intelligence.|$|E

25|$|It is {{stated that}} if a student is {{successful}} in awakening consciousness, {{he or she will}} eventually experience a continuous state of vigilance not only during the day but also while the physical body is sleeping, and most importantly after death. This is significant because Aun Weor states <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a sleeping consciousness are not aware of their postmortem condition, just as they are not aware when they are physically sleeping. The awakening of consciousness allows a student to continue to work regardless of their physical state.|$|E
25|$|Amusia is also {{similar to}} aphasia {{in that they}} affect similar {{areas of the brain}} near the {{temporal}} lobe. Most cases of those with amusia do not show any symptoms of aphasia. However, a number of cases have shown <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> aphasia can exhibit symptoms of amusia, especially in acquired aphasia. The two are not mutually exclusive and having one does not imply possession of the other. In acquired amusia, inability to perceive music correlates with an inability to perform other higher-level functions. As musical ability improves, so too do the higher cognitive functions which suggests that musical ability is closely related to these higher-level functions, such as memory and learning, mental flexibility, and semantic fluency.|$|E
25|$|Baptism for {{the dead}} {{is best known as}} a {{doctrine}} of the Latter Day Saint movement, which has practiced it since 1840. It is currently practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), where it is performed only in dedicated temples, as well as in several other current factions of the movement. Those who practice this rite view baptism as an essential requirement to enter the Kingdom of God, and therefore practice baptism {{for the dead}} to offer it by proxy to those who died without the opportunity to receive it. The LDS Church teaches <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> died may choose to accept or reject the baptisms done on their behalf.|$|E

25|$|Bešlagić {{asserted}} <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{raised and}} decorated them were not completely Christianized because they practiced the old custom of putting attachments with the dead, and many artefacts made of metals, textiles, ceramics and skin, coins, earrings of silver, gilded silver and solid gold {{have been found}} in graves beneath stećci. The customs like placing coin in mouth (Charon's obol), and placing drinking vessel near graves and heads, are from antique time. Tomb pits were mostly used for one burial, but sometime were for two and more. Bešlagić considered that there existed a pre-Christian custom of re-burial in which the bones were washed and returned to the pit, supported by one stećak inscription in Montenegro.|$|E
25|$|The double {{jeopardy}} rule {{means that a}} person cannot be tried more than once for the same offence. It is an important safeguard to acquitted defendants, {{but there is an}} important general public interest in ensuring <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> committed serious crimes are convicted of them. The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report recognised that the rule is capable of causing grave injustice to victims and the community in certain cases where compelling fresh evidence has come to light after an acquittal. It called for a change in the law to be considered, and we have accepted that such a change is appropriate. The European Convention on Human Rights (Article 4(2) of Protocol 7) explicitly recognises the importance of being able to re-open cases where new evidence comes to light.|$|E
25|$|Some believe <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a {{high degree}} of {{cognitive}} impairment, such as an intellectual disability, are unable to process the loss of those around them, but this is untrue, those with cognitive impairments such as an intellectual disability are able to process grief in a similar manner to those without cognitive impairment. One of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without, is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss, which is why non-verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important, because these are usually signs of distress and expression of grief among this population. It is important when working with individuals with these such impairments that caregivers and family members meet them where their level of functioning is and allow them to process the loss and grief with assistance given where needed, and not to ignore the grief that these individuals undergo. An important aspect of treatment of grief for those with an intellectual disability is family involvement where possible, this can be a biological family or a family created in a group home or clinical setting. By having the family involved in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual it helps them to process. However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated. The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a soci-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling. In this approach the individual with intellectual disability has the opportunity to see how those around them handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling behavior. This approach also helps the individual know that their emotions are ok and normal.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the relative disorder of English eighteenth century cookery books such as Eliza Smith's The Compleat Housewife (1727) or Elizabeth Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper (1769), Mrs Rundell's text is strictly ordered and neatly subdivided. Where those books consist almost wholly of recipes, Mrs Rundell begins by explaining techniques of economy ("A minute account of the annual income and the times of payment {{should be kept in}} writing"), how to carve, how to stew, how to season, to [...] "Look clean, be careful and nice in work, so <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> to eat might look on", how to choose and use steam-kettles and the bain-marie, the meanings of foreign terms like pot-au-feu ("truly the foundation of all good cookery"), all the joints of meat, the [...] "basis of all well-made soups", so it is page 65 before actual recipes begin.|$|E
500|$|Rhinehart {{comments}} <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{taken part}} in the est training feel {{the need for a}} sense of community: [...] "Most graduates indicate that the value of the seminar series depends not so much on it's ostensible data content or on the processes introduced, but on the sharing on an intimate basis with others." [...] He notes that some of the graduates of the est training [...] "treat him [...] with the love and awe normally associated with that of disciples for spiritual teachers". He likens Erhard's relationship to his staff members {{to the way in which}} a guru interacts with disciples: [...] " [...] the essentially eastern phenomenon of a powerful being [...] (usually a guru or a spiritual teacher) attracting other powerful beings who nevertheless choose to channel their power through their leader." [...] Rhinehart argues that est [...] "may be seen as in many ways the culmination to date of the 'Easternization of America', a process that first became notable in the late fifties and early sixties".|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, in the Great Catechism, Gregory {{suggests}} that while every human will be resurrected, salvation {{will only be}} accorded to the baptised, although he also states that others driven by their passions can be saved after being purified by fire. While he believes {{that there will be}} no more evil in the hereafter, it is arguable that this does not preclude a belief that God might justly damn sinners for eternity. Thus, the main difference between Gregory's conception of ἀποκατάστασις and that of Origen would be that Gregory believes that mankind will be collectively returned to sinlessness, whereas Origen believes that personal salvation will be universal. This interpretation of Gregory has been criticized recently, however. Indeed, this interpretation is explicitly contradicted in the [...] "Great Catechism" [...] itself, for at the end of chapter XXXV Gregory declares <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not been purified by water through baptism will be purified by fire in the end, so that [...] "their nature may be restored pure again to God". Furthermore, in the next chapter (ch. XXXVI), Gregory says that those who are purified from evil will be admitted into the [...] "heavenly company".|$|E

500|$|After this point, {{the story}} {{continues}} differently {{depending on the}} Hero's alignment. If it is [...] "law", the Law Hero gets killed in a battle with the Chaos Hero, while the Hero and the Heroine go to the basement. On their way they have to kill the Chaos Hero and fight Yuriko, who {{turns out to be}} the demon Lilith in disguise; she calls the Hero [...] "Adam", and says she wanted to create a new age and live with him forever, which is why she tried to execute the Heroine. After defeating her in battle, the Hero and the Heroine reach the basement and kill the demon Asura-ou; they then go to the cathedral's roof, where they are thanked by a messenger from God. If the Hero's alignment instead is [...] "chaos", he and the Heroine must go to the top floor and kill the archangel Michael, and on their way kill the Law Hero; the Chaos Hero dies, too, because of the magical ring he has been wearing. On the roof, they meet Lucifer, who says that a new era will begin, where both demons and humans are free; he also warns them that God still is alive. If the Hero's alignment instead is [...] "neutral", he and the Heroine must kill the Law Hero, the Chaos Hero, Asura-ou, and Michael, and fight Yuriko. On the roof, they meet Taishang Laojun, who thanks them and says that balance is needed to achieve happiness; he asks the Hero and the Heroine to lead humanity to a future that doesn't rely on gods or demons. The game ends with the Heroine saying <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> died will be reborn, and that it is time for creation and rebuilding.|$|E
