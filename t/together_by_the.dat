5|$|A hadron is a {{composite}} particle made of quarks held <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) made of one quark and one antiquark. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.|$|E

During the next three seasons, the Kingsport Indians were very successful, gaining two state titles. They were helped by Dodd, who moved from receiver to quarterback and kicker.

5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} A.subrubescens are usually solitary, but {{sometimes}} several (typically {{between two and}} eight) are stuck <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> stem bases or {{on the sides of}} their caps. A strictly terrestrial species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine. It is suspected that A.subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with David Arora, wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in California containing mostly knobcone pine (a three-needle pine), manzanita, huckleberry and a few mandrones.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to further Cossack attacks Tatar incursions continued as well, in 1623 and 1624 reaching almost as far west as the Vistula, with the attendant plunder and taking of captives. More effective defense was put <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> freed Koniecpolski and Stefan Chmielecki, who defeated the Tatars {{on several occasions}} between 1624 and 1633, using the quarter army supported by the Cossacks and general population. More warfare with the Ottomans took place in 1633–1634 and ended with a peace treaty. In 1644 Koniecpolski defeated Tugay Bey's army at Okhmativ and before his death planned an invasion against the Crimean Khanate. King Władysław IV's ideas of a grand international war-crusade against the Ottoman Empire were thwarted by the inquisition sejm in 1646. The state's inability to control {{the activities of the}} magnates and the Cossacks had contributed to the semi-permanent instability and danger at the Commonwealth's south-eastern frontiers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, the {{establishment}} of Russian naval power in the Baltic challenged the interests of Sweden, at the time {{one of the major}} powers in the Baltic. The Swedish Empire at the time included territory in Northern Germany, all of modern Finland and most of the Baltic states, a dominion held <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Baltic sea routes. Russian Tsar Peter the Great had established a new capital and naval base in Saint Petersburg in 1703. During the Great Northern War 1700–1721 Sweden lost its Baltic state territories, and experienced destructive Russian raiding in Finland and along the chain of islands and archipelagos that stretched {{all the way from the}} Gulf of Finland to the capital of Stockholm. The traumatic experience led to {{the establishment of}} inshore flotillas of shallow-draft vessels. The first of these consisted mainly of smaller versions of the traditional Mediterranean warship, the galleys. Most of these more akin to galiots and were complemented with gun prams. The disastrous war against Russia 1741-43 and the minor involvement in Prussia in the Pomeranian War 1757–62 showed the need for further expansion and development of the inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels.|$|E

5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} held <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular}} the ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E
5|$|The HV and the HVO fielded Operational Group Rujani, a {{combined}} force {{controlled by the}} HV Split Corps under command of Lieutenant General Ante Gotovina. The Operational Group comprised approximately 8,500 troops arranged in two groups, and was directed against Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč. The HVO troops were deployed against Glamoč and the HV force was arrayed in the Glamoč and Bosansko Grahovo areas. The defending force consisted of approximately 5,500 troops drawn from the VRS 2nd Krajina Corps, commanded by Major General Radivoje Tomanić. The 2nd Krajina Corps {{was supported by the}} Vijuga battlegroup put <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> RSK 7th North Dalmatian Corps and initially deployed to the Bosansko Grahovo area as a 500-strong unit in late 1994. The area was additionally reinforced following the HV's Operation Leap 2 in June 1995, using three VRS brigades deployed to Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč. The VRS-deployed units were strengthened by platoons and companies transferred from seven brigades of the VRS 1st Krajina Corps and from three brigades of the VRS East Bosnian Corps.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the AdS/CFT correspondence in late 1997 {{was the culmination of}} a long history of efforts to relate string theory to nuclear physics. In fact, string theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a theory of hadrons, the subatomic particles like the proton and neutron that are held <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> strong nuclear force. The idea was that each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode of a string. In the late 1960s, experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called Regge trajectories with squared energy proportional to angular momentum, and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from the physics of a rotating relativistic string.|$|E
