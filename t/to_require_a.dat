5|$|Sometimes {{in areas}} where the new wages were applied, {{factories}} would struggle to recruit workers for important tasks because the reform had given a low pay grade to a task that was considered <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> lower level of skill. For example, machine-tool operation was given a low pay grade, and at one factory in Kotlyakov some 30 machine-tools sat unused as factory managers were unable to recruit workers to operate them.|$|E
5|$|After {{a stormy}} debate {{in which the}} {{survival}} of the government was called into question, a compromise was reached whereby Aberhart's government relinquished considerable power to a committee of backbenchers. This committee, dominated by insurgents, recruited two British social credit experts to come to Alberta and advise on the implementation of social credit. Among the experts' first moves was <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> loyalty pledge from Social Credit MLAs. Almost all signed, thus ending the crisis, though most of the legislation the experts proposed was ultimately disallowed or struck down as unconstitutional.|$|E

5|$|Because of its durability, {{titanium}} {{has become}} more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, titanium rings). Its inertness makes it {{a good choice for}} those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and is more durable than pure 24-carat gold.|$|E

5|$|Early {{forecasts}} remarked {{the potential}} {{to be more of a}} threat to Hawaii than Pauline because Rick was further south than Pauline and thus less likely to weaken since Rick was over of warmer sea surface temperatures than Pauline. It did indeed approached the islands, coming close enough <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> high surf advisory. Even though Rick's intensity was much greater than Pauline's, Hurricane Pauline re-curved sooner than Rick. While the surf did rise somewhat, the waves were significantly lower than the heights experienced during Pauline. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report of an overdue sailing vessel en route to the Hawaiian Island group. However, it is unknown if Pauline or Rick affected the boat's course.|$|E

5|$|Hours after Humberto made landfall, Rick Perry {{declared}} Galveston, Jefferson, and Orange counties as disaster areas, which allocated {{state resources}} {{to assist the}} affected residents. The governor applied for a presidential disaster declaration on September 21. Four Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) teams assessed the hurricane damage in the three most affected counties. Following their assessment, they determined that {{the damage caused by}} Humberto was not significant enough <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> disaster declaration. As such, Governor Rick Perry's request from FEMA was denied. Across the Bolivar Peninsula, an estimated 1,500 cubic yards of structural debris and 3,000 cubic yards of tree limbs were needed to be removed {{in the wake of the}} storm.|$|E

Bolton Wanderers were drawn away at Accrington Stanley but, following a request to the FA, the match was switched to Bolton for crowd safety reasons.

To the resentment of the Bolton crowd, Ted Vizard was sent off {{for the first time in}} his career, leading the referee <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> police escort to the railway station. In the fourth round Bolton were held to a surprise draw at Third Division Bournemouth. The Wanderers lost Bill Cope to injury after fifteen minutes.

The administration immediately entered into negotiations {{to amend the}} Stanley plan to allow parents to sue a school district to force it to accept state funds (and resegregate). The Boothe-Dalton and McCue plans were also filed. Backers of the Gray Commission plan filed 14 bills to implement the Commission's proposals, but the Gray plan's supporters said they would abandon their pupil assignment plan {{in favor of the}} Mann-Fenwick pupil assignment plan. Delegate C.W.

5|$|Hurricane Rick {{was a very}} {{powerful}} hurricane that threatened Hawaii during September 1985. Rick originated from a tropical wave moved slowly westward over the warm waters south of Salina Cruz. Moving westward, the EPHC upgraded the low into a tropical depression on 0000UTC September1. The depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Rick midday on September2. Initially, further intensification was slow to occur; the storm did not attain hurricane status until September7, nearly a week after it first formed. After becoming a hurricane, Rick began to intensify more rapidly. Early the next day, the EPHC re-assessed the intensity of Rick to Category4 status. Shortly thereafter, Rick reached its peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h). A weakening trend commenced on September10; Hurricane Rick began to rapidly deteriorate while turning northwest. Within a few hours, the storm had weakened considerably. By September11, Tropical Storm Rick merged with a trough. Early forecasts noted uncertainty in the storm's path; the hurricane approached the Hawaiian island group, coming close enough <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> high surf advisory. Even though Hurricane Rick turned north sooner than Pauline, the surf did rise slightly.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Sadler began hosting Sunday tea gatherings at his home, {{which could}} {{accommodate}} fifty guests. Many attendees {{worked in the}} medical establishment, and typically adhered to a progressive ideology. The group often held a forum to discuss the patient with the sleep issue and devise questions for him. The observers withheld the man's name from the group, but relayed some of his statements. In 1925, the forum, which then had thirty members, closed their meetings to visitors and began <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> pledge of secrecy. Sadler instructed forum members not to publicize what they learned, telling them that they had an incomplete picture of what was occurring. He also feared that the patient would face criticism if his identity were known. His identity has never been confirmed; Joscelyn Godwin, of Colgate University, and skeptic Martin Gardner posit that the sleeping man was Wilfred Kellogg, the husband of Lena's sister Anna.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, YouTube {{launched}} its Partner Program, a {{system based on}} AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site. YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader. There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program. According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually no {{more than half of}} eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, {{due to a lack of}} interested advertisers. In 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos. YouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels.

5|$|The bank bailouts and the {{economic}} downturn increased the country's deficit and debt levels {{and led to a}} substantial downgrading of its credit rating. To build up trust in the financial markets, the government began to introduce austerity measures and in 2011 it passed a law in congress to approve an amendment to the Spanish Constitution <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> balanced budget at both the national and regional level by 2020. The amendment states that public debt can not exceed 60% of GDP, though exceptions would be made in case of a natural catastrophe, economic recession or other emergencies. As one of the largest eurozone economies (larger than Greece, Portugal and Ireland combined) the condition of Spain's economy is of particular concern to international observers. Under pressure from the United States, the IMF, other European countries and the European Commission the Spanish governments eventually succeeded in trimming the deficit from 11.2% of GDP in 2009 to an 7.1% in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{new group}} of drugs was {{initially}} greeted with optimism by the medical profession, but gradually concerns arose; in particular, the risk of dependence became evident in the 1980s. Benzodiazepines have a unique history in that they {{were responsible for the}} largest-ever class-action lawsuit against drug manufacturers in the United Kingdom, involving 14,000 patients and 1,800 law firms that alleged the manufacturers knew of the dependence potential but intentionally withheld this information from doctors. At the same time, 117 general practitioners and 50 health authorities were sued by patients to recover damages for the harmful effects of dependence and withdrawal. This led some doctors <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> signed consent form from their patients and to recommend that all patients be adequately warned of the risks of dependence and withdrawal before starting treatment with benzodiazepines. The court case against the drug manufacturers never reached a verdict; legal aid had been withdrawn and there were allegations that the consultant psychiatrists, the expert witnesses, had a conflict of interest. This litigation led to changes in the British law, making class action lawsuits more difficult.|$|E

5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action.
