500|$|Playing for the LSU Tigers {{football}} team, Van Buren {{was used}} primarily for blocking until his senior season, when head coach Bernie Moore moved him to tailback {{because of a}} lack of players due to World War II conscription. Van Buren received a class IV-F exemption due to an eye defect, so he was able to avoid conscription. [...] "He probably was the greatest running back in Southeastern Conference history," [...] Moore recalled, [...] "and I used him as a blocking back until his last year. <b>The</b> <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> Baton Rouge never let me forget that." ...|$|E
500|$|In a February 2009 {{interview}} with Jalylah Burrell of Vibe magazine, Gil Scott-Heron discussed the album's concept and title, {{as well as}} the social and political atmosphere at the time of Winter in Americas recording. In retrospect, he stated [...] "We felt as though we had come across something that people did not understand or did not recognize but that's the season that we were going into, not for three months but {{for an extended period of}} time. A lot of the folks who represented summer and spring and fall had been killed and assassinated. The only season left is winter. ...Bobby Kennedy and Dr. King and John Kennedy, those were folks who represented spring and summer, and they killed them. So we wanted to do an album about where we were. And we weren't trying to depress people, hell, they were living it, they already knew but we were trying to describe it and were certainly not alone... we felt as though a part of it was <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> charge of the political structure. They were snowmen..." ...|$|E

500|$|Computer Gaming World writer Arinn Dembo {{called the}} storyline {{of a couple}} buying a haunted mansion [...] "a cliché so {{familiar}} that it needs no explanation", but said it still worked in a computer game because the player could directly experience it in that medium, rather than simply watching it in a film. Dembo also praised the game for featuring a female protagonist, though she said Adrienne {{was too much of}} an exaggeratedly feminine [...] "girlie-type girl". Overall, Dembo said the game [...] "achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game" [...] and was [...] "an important technological leap, and represents a step forward for the whole industry". Another Computer Gaming World review said Phantasamagoria [...] "appears to deliver on its ambitious promises" [...] and that although the puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers, the appeal of the game is exploring a setting that [...] "would have had even <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> Amityville making tracks". Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman said some of the acting was [...] "hilariously bad" [...] and the storyline was predictable, but that the game keeps you engaged, the story draws you in and the controls were well executed. Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer Andy Greiser said the game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer-built backgrounds, but said the action doesn't start to pick up until the halfway point. In a mixed review, Phil LaRose of The Advocate praised the game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects, and said it had gone further toward merging the realms of film and game than any other computer game. He also said the game was too linear, with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with [...] "so many recycled concepts in this game, players will feel like they've seen it all before".|$|E
2500|$|The {{tendency}} to incorporate place names known to <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>in</b> the idiom {{of the poems}} is another characteristic feature of Tevaram. [...] The poems also involved glorifying the feat of Shiva in the particular location - the usage of locale continuously occurring in the verses is a testament. [...] According to Prentiss, the poems do not represent social space as a contested space, the hymns represent the hymnists were free to wander and to offer their praise of Shiva. The emotional intensity of the hymns represent spontaneous expression of thought as an emotional responses to God.|$|E
