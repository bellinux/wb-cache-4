5|$|At {{one point}} a {{proposal}} {{was on the}} table to protect the uranium in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used <b>to</b> <b>solder</b> the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{is three}} times as dense and more {{expensive}} than aluminium. Copper heat sinks are machined and skived. Another method of manufacture is <b>to</b> <b>solder</b> the fins into the heat sink base. Aluminium heat sinks can be extruded, but the less ductile copper cannot.|$|E
25|$|Sealants are an {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>solder</b> where additional strength is not required. In most cases, sealants {{should not be}} necessary with a properly designed copper installation. They are at best a relatively short-term solution requiring frequent maintenance. Regardless, sealant-filled joints have been used successfully as a secondary waterproofing measure for standing seam and batten seam roofing applications where low-sloped roofs are less than three inches per foot. Sealants {{can also be used}} in joints that are primarily designed to accommodate thermal movement of the copper.|$|E

25|$|The {{workflow}} of {{the manufacturing}} process consisted of a few steps that required {{a great amount of}} skill. Batches of silver were melted in crucibles with the addition of copper for a subtler alloy. The melted silver was cast into flat ingots and hammered into intermediate plates. For the relief work, the sheet-silver was annealed to allow shapes to be beaten into high repoussé; these rough shapes were then filled with pitch from the back to make them firm enough for further detailing with punches and tracers. The pitch was melted out, areas of pattern were gilded, and the eyes of the larger figures were inlaid with glass. The plates were probably worked in a flat form and later bent into curves <b>to</b> <b>solder</b> them together.|$|E
500|$|The tank {{broke down}} twice. The distributor's rotor arm broke and a {{replacement}} {{had to be}} sourced from Madrid. Then two of the device's valves used to cool the oil exploded, due <b>to</b> <b>solder</b> melting and mixing with the oil. It was very hot in the tank, despite the installation of ten fans, {{and the lack of}} suspension meant the driver was unable to stop shaking during filming breaks. The tank only moved at , which Vic Armstrong said made it difficult to film Indiana riding a horse against the tank while making it appear faster. A smaller section of the tank's top made from aluminum and which used rubber tracks was used for close-ups. It was built from a searchlight trailer, weighed eight tons, and was towed by a four-wheel drive truck. It had safety nets on each end to prevent injury to those falling off. A quarter-scale model by Gibbs was driven over a [...] cliff on location; Industrial Light & Magic created further shots of the tank's destruction with models and miniatures.|$|E

60|$|In {{following}} this course of conduct, Fergus had a further object than merely being {{the great man}} of his neighbourhood, and ruling despotically over a small clan. From his infancy upward he had devoted himself {{to the cause of}} the exiled family, and had persuaded himself, not only that their restoration to the crown of Britain would be speedy, but that those who assisted them would be raised to honour and rank. It was with this view that he laboured to reconcile the Highlanders among themselves, and augmented his own force to the utmost, to be prepared for the first favourable opportunity of rising. With this purpose also he conciliated the favour of such Lowland gentlemen in the vicinity as were friends to the good cause; and for the same reason, having incautiously quarrelled with Mr. Bradwardine, who, notwithstanding his peculiarities, was much respected in the country, he took advantage of the foray of Donald Bean Lean <b>to</b> <b>solder</b> up the dispute in the manner we have mentioned. Some, indeed, surmised that he caused the enterprise to be suggested to Donald, on purpose to pave the way to a reconciliation, which, supposing that to be the case, cost the Laird of Bradwardine two good milch cows. This zeal in their behalf the House of Stuart repaid with a considerable share of their confidence, an occasional supply of louis-d'or, abundance of fair words, and a parchment, with a huge waxen seal appended, purporting to be an earl's patent, granted by no less a person than James the Third King of England, and Eighth King of Scotland, to his right feal, trusty, and well-beloved Fergus Mac-Ivor of Glennaquoich, in the county of Perth, and kingdom of Scotland.|$|E
