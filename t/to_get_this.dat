5|$|The {{preparation}} of haleem {{has been compared}} to that of Hyderabadi biryani. Though Hyderabadi haleem is the traditional hors d'oeuvre at weddings, celebrations and other social occasions, it is particularly consumed in the Islamic month of Ramadan during Iftar (the evening meal that breaks the day-long fast) as it provides instant energy and is high in calories. This has made the dish synonymous with Ramadan. In recognition of its cultural significance and popularity, in 2010, it was granted Geographical Indication status (GIS) by the Indian GIS registry office, making it the first non-vegetarian dish in India <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> status.|$|E

25|$|With the Ministry of Human Resource Development giving {{its green}} signal {{for setting up}} of an IIT in Dharwad, the 17-year long wait ended.

In 1998, a committee headed by former ISRO chairman and space scientist U R Rao submitted its report recommending an IIT in Hubballi-Dharwad. In the 2015-16 union budget, an IIT was sanctioned for Karnataka state and the state government suggested three locations for IIT in Karnataka. The short listed cities were Dharwad, Mysuru and Raichur. The high powered committee appointed by the HRD ministry chose Dharwad city, after visiting all the three short listed cities.

25|$|Drs Dayun Tao and Prapa Sripichitt, {{working at}} the Department of Agronomy, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, made {{numerous}} crosses between rice and wild, rhizomatous species. The difficulty of this work {{is illustrated by the}} case of the single successful hybrid they obtained between Oryza sativa and O. longistaminata. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> one plant, 119 rice florets were pollinated, which produced 51 seeds. Of these seeds, 33 had culturable embryos, and only one of these embryos developed into a viable plant. Put another way, this hybridization was relatively easy: over 3000 pollinations had to be made between rice and O. rhizomatis to get a single viable plant. It was a fortunate cross in other respects: the hybrid was healthy and rhizomatous (it is still alive) and partially fertile, allowing F2 seed to be obtained.|$|E

25|$|The Residence Act of 1790, which {{established}} {{the site for}} the nation's capital, provided for the appointment of three commissioners by the President (and without the need for Senate confirmation) to govern the District of Columbia, survey its land, purchase property from private landowners, and construct federal buildings. On September 23, 1793, Greenleaf purchased 3,000 city lots from the commissioners. The city offered him the lots at $66.50 each, a significant discount from the going price of $200 to $300 per lot. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> low price, Greenleaf was required to construct 70 homes on the lots before 1800, not sell any of the land before 1796, and lend the commissioners $2,200 a month until certain public buildings were constructed. To raise money to improve the lots, Greenleaf executed a power of attorney on November 2, 1793, with Sylvanus Bourne, the American vice consul in Amsterdam. Bourne, who served as vice consul in Amsterdam under Greenleaf, was empowered to sell lots or obtain mortgages on them.|$|E
25|$|The band's {{first tour}} was in {{supporting}} The Red Chord across the United Kingdom. As with other early tours, {{they were able}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> slot by tricking venue promoters. Kean and Oliver's mother Carol Sykes were the de facto managers of the band at this time, a role they continued to occupy right up until 2008. For The Red Chord support, Kean emailed promoters and pretended they were opening {{on all of the}} dates, when in reality they were supposed to only play at their local show. This led them to being booked for the whole tour. In another case, Sykes created an e-mail account in the name of Johnny Truant vocalist Oliver Mitchell, which he used to contact a promoter requesting Bring Me the Horizon on their tour. Their live performances in their early history were fueled by alcohol consumption where the band would get so drunk they would vomit on stage and would damage their own equipment.|$|E

25|$|Metal toothed {{watertight}} zippers rely {{on pressure}} {{between the two}} rubberized contact surfaces of the zipper tapes alongside the teeth for sealing. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so the zipper requires more force to close than regular zippers. If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together {{in front of the}} pull it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the sealing edge, and allow the zipper to be closed with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on the zipper when wet. There should not be an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to particles of grit and cause wear and additional friction. The plastic tooth zippers have less friction than the metal teeth and need less force to close.|$|E
25|$|Dupuytren's contracture, {{a disease}} of the fasciae in the palm and fingers that {{permanently}} bends the fingers (usually the little and ring fingers) toward the palm, was first noted to be highly prevalent in epileptic people in 1941 by a Dr. Lund, fourteen years before primidone was on the market. Lund also noted that it was equally prevalent in individuals with idiopathic and symptomatic epilepsy and that {{the severity of the}} epilepsy did not matter. However, only one quarter of the women were affected vs. half of the men. Thirty-five years later, Critcheley et al. reported a correlation between how long a patient had had epilepsy and his or her chance of getting Dupuytren's contracture. They suspected that this was due to phenobarbital therapy, and that the phenobarbital was stimulating peripheral tissue growth factors. Dupuytren's contracture is almost exclusively found in Caucasians, especially those of Viking descent, and highest rates are reported in Northern Scotland, Norway, Iceland, and Australia. It has also been associated with alcoholism, heavy smoking, diabetes mellitus, physical trauma (either penetrating in nature or due to manual labor), tuberculosis, and HIV. People with rheumatoid arthritis are less likely <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this,</b> and Drs. Hart and Hooper speculate that this is also true of gout due to the use of allopurinol This is the only susceptibility factor that is generally agreed upon. Anticonvulsants do not seem to increase the incidence of Dupuytren's contracture in non-whites.|$|E
