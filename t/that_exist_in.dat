5|$|A final {{difference}} in Plutarch's account is Horus's birth. The form of Horus that avenges {{his father has}} been conceived and born before Osiris's death. It is a premature and weak second child, Harpocrates, who is born from Osiris's posthumous union with Isis. Here, two of the separate forms of Horus <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> Egyptian tradition have been given distinct positions within Plutarch's version of the myth.|$|E

5|$|Many LARPs have game {{rules that}} {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} the setting. The rules may be defined in a publication or created by the gamemasters. These rules may define characters' capabilities, what can be done with various objects <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> the setting, and what characters can do during the downtime between LARP events. Because referees are often not available to mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E
5|$|The Northwest Territories {{political}} system used {{at this time}} was run by an early form of consensus government.

5|$|Various {{types of}} tornadoes include the {{multiple}} vortex tornado, landspout and waterspout. Waterspouts {{are characterized by}} a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirls, and steam devil.|$|E
5|$|The SIII {{comes in}} two {{distinct}} variations that differ {{primarily in the}} internal hardware. The international SIII version has Samsung's Exynos 4 Quad {{system on a chip}} (SoC) containing a 1.4GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 central processing unit (CPU) and an ARM Mali-400 MP graphics processing unit (GPU). According to Samsung, the Exynos 4 Quad doubles the performance of the Exynos 4 Dual used on the SII, while using 20percent less power. Samsung had also released several 4G LTE versions—4G facilitates higher-speed mobile connection compared to 3G—in selected countries to exploit the corresponding communications infrastructures <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> those markets. Most of these versions use Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4 SoC featuring a dual-core 1.5GHz Krait CPU and an Adreno 225 GPU. The South Korean and Australian versions are a hybrid of the international and 4G-capable versions.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{widespread}} in the tropical and subtropical regions <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> a broad band around the equator. This includes much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In 2015, there were 296 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 731,000 deaths. Approximately 90% of both cases and deaths occurred in Africa. Rates of disease have decreased from 2000 to 2015 by 37%, but increased from 2014 during which there were 198 million cases. Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a major negative effect on economic development. In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and negative effects on tourism.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} time {{anything}} other than a canoe or other oar-powered vessel had sailed into Lake Huron, and La Salle's voyage was thus germinal in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes. Located in the natural harbour, the Sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products. The natural port and the salt caverns <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> the surrounding areas, together with the oil discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 led to the massive growth of the petroleum industry in this area. Because Oil Springs {{was the first}} place in Canada and North America to drill commercially for oil, the knowledge that was acquired there led to oil drillers from Sarnia travelling the world teaching other nations how to drill for oil.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-four of Saturn's moons are regular satellites; {{they have}} {{prograde}} orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane. They include the seven major satellites, four small moons <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> a trojan orbit with larger moons, two mutually co-orbital moons and two moons {{that act as}} shepherds of Saturn's F Ring. Two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in Saturn's rings. The relatively large Hyperion is locked in a resonance with Titan. The remaining regular moons orbit near {{the outer edge of}} the A Ring, within G Ring and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus. The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Language contact {{may also}} lead {{to a variety of}} other {{linguistic}} phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a creole language. An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin, the official language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages; others are Kreyòl ayisyen, the French-based creole language spoken in Haiti, and Michif, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language Cree and French.|$|E

5|$|Strange {{travels to}} Venice and meets Flora Greysteel. They become fond {{of each other}} and Strange's friends believe he may marry again. However, after experimenting with {{dangerous}} magic that threatens his sanity to gain access to Faerie, he discovers that Arabella is alive and being held captive in Lost Hope. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair curses him with Eternal Night, an eerie darkness that engulfs him and follows him wherever he goes. Thereafter, Strange's strenuous efforts to rescue Arabella take their toll, and his letters to his friends appear crazed. At Strange's request, Flora moves with her family to Padua and secludes herself within her home, along with a mirror given to her by Strange. Drawlight is sent by Lascelles and Norrell to Venice {{to find out more about}} Strange's activities and Strange uses his magic to bring Drawlight before him. Strange instructs Drawlight to deliver messages to Norrell, Childermass and the magical community within England before dismissing him. Strange then re-invokes the old alliances <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> England between the forces of nature and John Uskglass. This sparks a magical renaissance, but Norrell fails to grasp its significance.|$|E

On the other hand, short second generation reads have been used to correct errors in <b>that</b> <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> the long third generation reads.
