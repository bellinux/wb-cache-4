5|$|Although {{the senate}} could do little short of {{assassination}} and open rebellion to contravene <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor, it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four Emperors {{to retain its}} symbolic political centrality during the Principate. The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates (legati) to serve as generals, diplomats, and administrators. A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple emperors.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, Taylor was {{attacked}} by Democratic opponents because of his party's support from black voters and its ties to big business, including the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. They also charged that Governor Bradley had run a corrupt administration. Republicans answered with charges of factionalism and use of political machinery by Democrats. In particular, they derided the Goebel Election Law, which Taylor claimed subverted <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people.|$|E
5|$|Even liberal {{senators}} were agitated by {{the proposed}} changes, fearing their own lands would be confiscated. Senators arranged for other tribunes {{to oppose the}} reforms. Tiberius then appealed to the people, and argued that a tribune who opposes <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people in favour of the rich is not a true tribune. The senators were left with only one constitutional response – to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This necessitated Tiberius to stand for a second term.|$|E

On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children {{are not able to}} wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice {{other than a}} submission to <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E
5|$|On October 29, 1861, a {{group of}} Kentuckians—Johnson among them—met at Russellville, Kentucky to discuss the {{formation}} of a Confederate government for the Commonwealth, believing the Unionist government in Frankfort did not represent <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority of Kentucky's citizens. Johnson chaired the committee that authored the convention's final report, and personally introduced some of its key resolutions. The report called for a sovereignty convention to sever ties with the Federal government. Johnson, Breckinridge, and Humphrey Marshall were among the notable members of the Committee of Ten that made arrangements for the convention.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tension between}} eunuchs in <b>the</b> service <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor and virtuous Confucian {{officials}} {{is a familiar}} theme in Chinese history. In his History of Government, Samuel Finer points out that reality was not always that clear-cut. There were instances of very capable eunuchs who were valuable advisers to their emperor, and <b>the</b> resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "virtuous" [...] officials often stemmed from jealousy on their part. Ray Huang argues that in reality, eunuchs represented <b>the</b> personal <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emperor, while the officials represented <b>the</b> alternate political <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bureaucracy. The clash between them would thus have been a clash of ideologies or political agenda.|$|R

5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E

5|$|Characteristic of Marko was his reverence {{and love}} for his mother, Jevrosima; he often sought her advice, {{following}} it even when it contradicted his own desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good {{on the path of}} moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem in which he was the only person who knew <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.|$|E
5|$|George IV {{spent most}} of his later reign in {{seclusion}} at Windsor Castle, but he continued to intervene in politics. At first it was believed that he would support Catholic emancipation, as he had proposed a Catholic Emancipation Bill for Ireland in 1797, but his anti-Catholic views became clear in 1813 when he privately canvassed against the ultimately defeated Catholic Relief Bill of 1813. By 1824 he was denouncing Catholic emancipation in public. Having taken the coronation oath on his accession, George now argued that he had sworn to uphold the Protestant faith, and could not support any pro-Catholic measures. The influence of the Crown was so great, and <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tories under Prime Minister Lord Liverpool so strong, that Catholic emancipation seemed hopeless. In 1827, however, Lord Liverpool retired, to be replaced by the pro-emancipation Tory George Canning. When Canning entered office, the King, hitherto content with privately instructing his ministers on the Catholic Question, thought it fit to make a public declaration to the effect that his sentiments on the question were those of his revered father, George III.|$|E
5|$|Gods were worshiped in cult temples {{administered}} by priests {{acting on the}} king's behalf. At {{the center of the}} temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos. After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of oracles to communicate <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gods directly to the people.|$|E

50|$|According to Rousseau, {{by joining}} {{together}} into civil society through {{the social contract}} and abandoning their claims of natural right, individuals can both preserve themselves and remain free. This is because submission to <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people as a whole guarantees individuals against being subordinated to <b>the</b> <b>wills</b> <b>of</b> others and also ensures that they obey themselves because they are, collectively, <b>the</b> authors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law.|$|R
50|$|Abilene paradox: Consensus {{decision-making}} is {{susceptible to}} all forms <b>of</b> groupthink, <b>the</b> most dramatic being the Abilene paradox.

5|$|Having {{seen the}} court through the Old Court-New Court controversy, Chief Justice Boyle {{resigned}} in 1826. In December 1828, Mills and Owsley also resigned. Their resignations were {{an attempt to}} silence criticism from the defeated New Court faction that they held their seats in defiance of <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people. Old Court supporters hoped both men would be re-nominated and re-confirmed by the legislature, making the New Court's charge less credible. Accordingly, newly elected governor Thomas Metcalfe submitted both men to the legislature for confirmation, but the nominations were defeated in the state senate. Thus ended Owsley's tenure on the court. It was, at the time, the longest tenure of any Court of Appeals justice except John Boyle. Owsley returned to his legal practice, and his case load soon compelled him to move to Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Rowan was {{appointed}} to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, serving until his resignation 1821. He was again elected to the state legislature in 1823. With the state reeling from the Panic of 1819, Rowan became the leader of a group of legislators dedicated to enacting laws favorable to the state's large debtor class. He believed <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people was sovereign and roundly denounced the Court of Appeals for striking down debt relief legislation as unconstitutional. He led the effort to impeach the offending justices, and when that effort failed, spearheaded a movement to abolish the court entirely {{and replace it with a}} new one, touching off the Old Court – New Court controversy. New Court partisans in the legislature elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate in 1824. During his term, the nascent Whig Party ascended to power in the state legislature, and at the expiration of his term in 1831, the Whigs replaced him with party founder Henry Clay.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{attacks from}} both sides followed, but none were fatal, and the two groups quickly {{realized}} the futility of their attempts to drive the other out. In February 1690, the French began peace negotiations with the Iroquois. The French returned captured natives {{in exchange for the}} beginnings of peace talks. Through the 1690s, there were no major French or native raids and, even against <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English, peace talks continued. This time of relative peace eventually led to the Montreal Treaty of 1701, by which the Iroquois promised to remain neutral in case of war between the French and English.|$|E
