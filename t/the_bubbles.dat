40|$|We present <b>the</b> <b>Bubble</b> Lens, a new target {{acquisition}} technique that remedies {{the limitations of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bubble</b> Cursor {{to increase the speed}} and accuracy of acquiring small, dense targets—precisely those targets for which <b>the</b> <b>Bubble</b> Cursor degenerates to a point cursor. When targets are large and sparse, <b>the</b> <b>Bubble</b> Lens behaves like <b>the</b> <b>Bubble</b> Cursor. But when targets are small and dense, <b>the</b> <b>Bubble</b> Lens automatically magnifies nearby targets, making them larger in both visual- and motor-space. Importantly, magnification is not governed by an explicit user-invoked mode-switch. Rather, magnification is activated through kinematic triggering, a technique that continuously examines an unfolding velocity profile to automatically trigger mode changes based on observed features. In a first study, we found <b>the</b> <b>Bubble</b> Cursor performed poorly when targets had an effective size smaller than 10 pixels. Using this threshold for <b>the</b> <b>Bubble</b> Lens in a second study, we found that <b>the</b> <b>Bubble</b> Lens significantly outperformed <b>the</b> <b>Bubble</b> Cursor, decreasing movement time by 10. 2 % and error rates by 37. 9 %, making <b>the</b> <b>Bubble</b> Lens <b>the</b> fastest current pointing technique.

50|$|As an {{air bubble}} rises, {{there is a}} {{difference}} in pressure between {{the top and bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>bubble.</b> <b>The</b> higher pressure at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>bubble</b> pushes <b>the</b> <b>bubble's</b> bottom surface up faster than the top surface rises. This creates a fluid jet that moves up through the center of <b>the</b> <b>bubble.</b> If <b>the</b> fluid jet has enough energy, it will puncture the top of <b>the</b> <b>bubble</b> and create a bubble ring. Because of the motion of the fluid moving through the center of <b>the</b> <b>bubble,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bubble</b> begins to rotate. This rotation moves the fluid around <b>the</b> <b>bubble</b> creating a toroidal vortex. If the surface tension of the fluid interface or the viscosity of the liquid is too high, then the liquid jet will be more broad and will not penetrate the top of <b>the</b> <b>bubble.</b> This results in a spherical cap bubble. Air bubbles with a diameter greater than about two centimeters become toroidal in shape due to the pressure differences.|$|R
5000|$|As <b>the</b> <b>bubble</b> ring rises, a {{lift force}} {{pointing}} downward that {{is generated by}} the vorticity, acts on <b>the</b> <b>bubble</b> in order to counteract the buoyancy force.

5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{also provides}} {{an explanation for}} the criticality of the initial ascent phase. Bubbles associated with symptoms are not necessarily generated on site.

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{occurs when}} gas, {{which has been}} breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive.

While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers.

5|$|The English-language Adventures of Tintin {{books were}} {{originally}} published with handwritten lettering created by cartographer Neil Hyslop. 1958's The Crab With the Golden Claws {{was the first}} to be published with Hyslop's lettering.

In the early 2000s, Tintin's English publishers Egmont discontinued publishing books featuring Hyslop's handwritten lettering, instead publishing books with text created with digital fonts.

5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in ambient pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, <b>the</b> <b>bubbles</b> grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E

5|$|An ice core is a {{vertical}} column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into firn. Firn is not dense {{enough to prevent}} air from escaping; but at a density of about 830kg/m3 it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture {{the composition of the}} atmosphere at the time the ice formed. The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64m to 115m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At Summit Camp in Greenland, the depth is 77 m and the ice is 230 years old; at Dome C in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500m the crystal structure of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a clathrate. <b>The</b> <b>bubbles</b> disappear and the ice becomes more transparent.|$|E
