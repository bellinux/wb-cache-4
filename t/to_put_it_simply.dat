On the Sunset Boulevard set in Broadway, the staircase steps had to be raised six inches (15cm) {{in order to accommodate}} Paige's short stature, or it would have been hard to see her behind the banister. [...] Paige was welcomed to the Broadway stage with a long standing ovation from the audience, and received largely positive reviews for her New York performance as Norma Desmond: [...] "The lush sound and the sheer power of her voice are, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply,</b> incredible", wrote one critic, whilst another said [...] "Her voice has great range, remarkable clarity and emotional force". Paige was the first Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard to sing one of the show's key songs, [...] "With One Look", which she did first at Lloyd Webber's wedding to Madeleine Gurdon, although at the time the song was called [...] "Just One Glance". Lloyd Webber noted, regarding Paige's performance of one of the show's other prominent songs, [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye", that it was [...] "as good, if not the best, of anything I've ever heard of mine". [...] Regarding the key lyric in the song, [...] "This world's waited long enough. I've come home at last", Paige had sought to change the way the melody was sung, despite being fully aware of Lloyd-Webber's fastidious tendencies. To her, the moment was not exploited to its fullest potential, so she approached the show's musical director, David Caddick, and expressed her wish to hold the word [...] "home", to which he agreed. Although she had been disappointed when she hoped to perform on Broadway in Evita, Cats and Chess, Paige stated of her debut there, [...] "It was just the most perfect time to go with that particular show". After Sunset Boulevard finished, she suffered from depression, commenting that the show's closing [...] "was the most terrible feeling.... I'd felt I'd lost something so very important to me.

60|$|If you {{ask that}} {{convenient}} fiction, the Man in the Street, {{what sort of}} plant a cactus is, he will probably tell you it is all leaf and no stem, {{and each of the}} leaves grows out of the last one. Whenever we set up the Man in the Street, however, you must have noticed we do it in order to knock him down again like a nine-pin next moment: and this particular instance is no exception to the rule; for the truth is that a cactus is practically all stem and no leaves, what looks like a leaf being really a branch sticking out at an angle. The true leaves, if there are any, are reduced to mere spines or prickles on the surface, while the branches, in the prickly-pear and many of the ornamental hot-house cactuses, are flattened out like a leaf to perform foliar functions. In most plants, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply,</b> the leaves are the mouths and stomachs of the organism; their thin and flattened blades are spread out horizontally in a wide expanse, covered with tiny throats and lips which suck in carbonic acid from the surrounding air, and disintegrate it in their own cells under the influence of sunlight. In the prickly pears, on the contrary, it is the flattened stem and branches which undertake this essential operation {{in the life of the}} plant--the sucking-in of carbon and giving-out of oxygen, which is to the vegetable exactly what the eating and digesting of food is to the animal organism.

40|$|The quest {{was to look}} at {{the role}} of the natural {{resources}} regulatory regime in Aboriginal rights disputes in Ontario. The fact that there are Aboriginal disputes is, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> quite <b>simply,</b> indisputable. The fact that such disputes have been a feature of the history of Ontario from its inception is also indisputable. The reason for these Aboriginal rights disputes is simple to identify. Aboriginal peoples resist dispossession of their lands and resources. This paper sets out several examples of these Aboriginal rights disputes. The examples cover almost two hundred and fifty years, from the late 1700 s to the events of this past year. The examples cover the entire geography of Ontario and they represent all of the Aboriginal peoples who live in Ontario. The examples show how and where the disputes are fought—in courts, on blockades, in parks, on roads, and in the political back rooms of the province. The natural resources regulatory regime plays a significant role in Aboriginal rights disputes because it functions as the many-armed mechanism by which Ontario, at the expense of Aboriginal peoples, originally settled the province and now implements its development. The norm is that the natural resources regulatory regime is applied with full force and vigour to Aboriginal peoples without accommodation of their Aboriginal rights. There are however, som...|$|R
