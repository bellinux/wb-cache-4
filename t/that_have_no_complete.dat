40|$|The {{lower bound}} for the {{classical}} Ramsey number R(4, 6) is improved from 35 to 36. The author has found 37 new edge colorings of K 35 <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>complete</b> graphs of order 4 in the first color, and no complete graphs of order 6 in the second color. The most symmetric of the colorings has an automorphism group of order 4, with one fixed point, and is presented in detail. The colorings were found using a heuristic search procedure. This note deals with a new lower {{bound for the}} classical Ramsey number R(4, 6). Recall that the classical Ramsey number R(s, t) is the smallest integer n such that in any two-coloring of the edges of Kn there is a monochromatic copy of Ks in the first color or a monochromatic copy of Kt in the second color. A recent summary {{of the state of}} the art for Ramsey numbers can be found in the Dynamic Survey [10]. Theorem 1. R(4, 6) ≥ 36. Proof. The proof is given by the coloring of K 35 which can be derived from Table 1, below. This table contains an adjacency list for the color one graph of a two-coloring of K 35. Al...|$|E

In order to avoid confusion and misunderstanding, we use the term ‘dissection variant IMH’ for a thrombosed AD <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>complete</b> flow channel, but tiny communications between the true and false lumen commonly exist and clearly show differentiation from other aortic diseases with haemorrhagic content within the aortic wall.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Description Logic EL has {{recently}} drawn considerable attention since, {{on the one}} hand, important inference problems such as the subsumption problem are polynomial. On the other hand, EL is used to define large biomedical ontologies. Unification in Description Logics has been proposed as a novel inference service that can, for example, be used to detect redundancies in ontologies. The main result {{of this paper is}} that unification in EL is decidable. More precisely, EL-unification is NP-complete, and thus has the same complexity as EL-matching. We also show that, w. r. t. the unification type, EL is less well-behaved: it is of type zero, which in particular implies that there are unification problems <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> finite <b>complete</b> set of unifiers. ...|$|R

40|$|Starting {{with the}} paper of Baker, Gill and Solovay [BGS 75] in {{complexity}} theory, many results have been proved which separate certain relativized complexity classes or show <b>that</b> they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>complete</b> language. All results of this kind were, in fact, based on lower bounds for boolean decision trees of a certain type or for machines with polylogarithmic restrictions on time. The following question arises: Are these methods of proving "relativized" results universal? In {{the first part of}} the present paper we propose a general framework in which assertions of universality of this kind may be formulated and proved as convenient criteria. Using these criteria we obtain, as easy consequences of the known results on boolean decision trees, some new "relativized" results and new proofs of some known results. In the second part of the present paper we apply these general criteria to many particular cases. For example, for many of the complexity classes studied in the literature all relativiza [...] ...|$|R

The moduli space of smooth genus g curves Mg, g ≥ 2, is covered by g − 1 affine open subsets and the universal genus g curve Cg, g ≥ 2, is covered by g affine open subsets. This theorem answers Problem (6. 5) of the survey paper [6] (more than) affirmatively. Since a projective variety of dimension d cannot be covered by d affine open subsets, it immediately implies a theorem of Diaz [4] that says that Mg doe...|$|R
40|$|The nuclear oxysterol-receptor paralogues LXRα and LXRβ share a {{high degree}} of amino acid {{identity}} and bind endogenous oxysterol ligands with similar affinities. While LXRα has been established as an important regulator of cholesterol catabolism in cholesterol-fed mice, {{little is known about the}} function of LXRβ in vivo. We have generated mouse lines with targeted disruptions of each of these LXR receptors and have compared their responses to dietary cholesterol. Serum and hepatic cholesterol levels and lipoprotein profiles of cholesterol-fed animals revealed no significant differences between LXRβ–/– and wild-type mice. Steady-state mRNA levels of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and squalene synthase were increased in LXRβ–/– mice compared with LXRβ+/+ mice, when fed standard chow. The mRNA levels for cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase, oxysterol 7 α-hydroxylase, sterol 12 α-hydroxylase, and sterol 27 -hydroxylase, respectively, were comparable in these strains, both on standard and 2 % cholesterol chow. Our results indicate that LXRβ–/– mice — in contrast to LXRα–/– mice — maintain their resistance to dietary cholesterol, despite subtle effects on the expression of genes coding for enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. Thus, our data indicate <b>that</b> LXRβ <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>complete</b> overlapping function compared with LXRα in the liver...|$|R

For more on this problem, see [4], [5] and [1, p. 664]. Properties of complete Boolean algebras correspond to properties of generic models obtained by forcing with these algebras. (See [6], pp. 266 – 270; we also follow [6] for notation and terminology of forcing and generic models.) When in [7] McAloon constructed a generic model with all sets ordinally definable he noted that the corresponding complete Boolean algebra is rigid, i. e. admitting no nontrivial automorphisms.
