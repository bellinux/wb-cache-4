5|$|Wrigley Field is {{featured}} in two interwoven and consecutive scenes. In the first scene, Rooney {{is looking for}} Ferris at a pizza joint while the voice of Harry Caray announces the action of a ballgame that is being shown on TV. From the play-by-play descriptions, the uniforms, and the player numbers, this game {{has been identified as}} the June 5, 1985, game between the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs. The batter rips a foul ball into the left field stands, and as Rooney looks away from the TV briefly, <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>cameras</b> show a close up of Ferris a moment after catching it. The scene in the pizza joint continues as Rooney tries to banter about the game with the guy behind the counter.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate {{to land a}} man on the Moon {{before the end of the}} 1960s, Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>camera</b> from <b>the</b> MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod [...] from <b>the</b> LM. <b>The</b> <b>TV</b> <b>camera</b> cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.|$|R
25|$|In January 1962 the {{national}} Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show was cancelled {{and replaced by}} The Channel 9 Show hosted by Bert Newton. Kennedy continued to fine-tune his IMT performances. Kennedy had a strong understanding of key technical elements of television and perfected his comic timing, and watched the lenses on <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>cameras,</b> adjusting his performance depending on whether {{he was in a}} wide shot or a close up. Compilation highlight programs of IMT segments were screened in Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide in May 1963 under the title The Best of Kennedy. The Best of Kennedy continued until December 1963. On IMT, Noel Ferrier was appointed the new Friday night host. Also in 1963 writer Mike McColl-Jones joined. Kennedy had often disliked having writers on the program, was reluctant for them to be publicly acknowledged, and often ignored all their material. In the case of McColl-Jones, Kennedy seemed to like him and his comedy material, which was apparently the key requirement by which Kennedy would use a writer's material. McColl-Jones continued as a writer on the series for several years. Also in 1963 Ernie Carroll joined the writing team. Kennedy had apparently relaxed his attitude towards writers by this stage and seemed happy to use their material with few complaints.|$|E
500|$|He {{promoted}} aggressive {{measures against}} the insurgents, {{and in so}} doing, he also sought to raise his own political profile. Clad in immaculately tailored battledress, he would fly by helicopter to a beleaguered army outpost; wearing dark glasses and sporting a swagger stick, deliver a rousing speech {{for the benefit of}} the troops and <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>cameras</b> – then return to Salisbury in time for dinner. He drew heavily on Winston Churchill's oratory style for some of his inspiring speeches. As Minister of Defence, Van der Byl was known to join army counter-insurgency operations while armed with a hunting rifle (with the words [...] "I'd like to bag one of these chaps ..."), and would regularly visit army positions and entertain the troops with his own generous supply of [...] "scotch whisky and fine wines." [...] Such behaviour endeared him to many in Rhodesia: he was far more popular with the troops than his predecessor as Minister of Defence, Jack Howman. However, this popularity did not extend to senior members of the South African and Rhodesian governments.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was paid}} £20 a week, {{and set up}} with a house and car by the Arsenal {{management}} – a Sunbeam-Talbot with the license plate 'MEL 9'. Not used to the complexities of a rapidly modernising game, he endured a frosty relationship with coach Ron Greenwood after numerous humorous mix-ups over new terms such as 'blind-side run' and 'marking space', and embarrassed {{himself in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>cameras</b> when he fumbled and said [...] "I'm okay, I've just got clitorises in my eyes", instead of cataracts.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the students' slogans, the president said: [...] "We have been standing up to dictatorship {{so that no one}} will dare to establish dictatorship in a millennium even in the name of freedom. Given the scars inflicted on the Iranian nation by agents of the US and British dictatorship, no one will ever dare to initiate the rise of a dictator." [...] It was reported that even though the protesters broke <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>cameras</b> and threw hand-made bombs at Ahmadinejad, the president asked the officials not to question or disturb the protesters. In his blog, Ahmadinejad described his reaction to the incident as [...] "a feeling of joy" [...] because of the freedom that people enjoyed after the revolution.|$|E

On the ensuing kickoff, Jets return {{specialist}} Joe McKnight fumbled; the Patriots' Julian Edelman recovered the fumble in mid-air, {{and returned it}} 22 yards for yet another touchdown. The Patriots' lead widened to 28–0, as the Patriots scored 21 points in 52 seconds of game time. <b>The</b> <b>TV</b> <b>cameras</b> found Rex Ryan on the sideline exclaiming, [...] "Un-fucking-believable!" [...] Some Jets fans left MetLife Stadium; others booed and chanted for backup quarterback Tim Tebow to take over. By the two-minute warning before half time, the score was 35–0, and the stadium loudspeakers played [...] "It Ain't Over 'til It's Over."

2500|$|On November 12, 2007, the PGA Tour {{announced}} that Timberlake, an avid golfer who plays to a 6 handicap, {{would become the}} host of the tour's Las Vegas tournament starting in 2008. With Timberlake's agreement to host the tournament, its name was changed to the Justin Timberlake Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. He played in the celebrity pro-am on the day before the competitive tournament and hosted a charity concert during the week of the tournament. The activity was a success, and was repeated in 2009. A review of the value of celebrities to fundraising concluded that Timberlake's contribution to Shriners Hospitals for Children was the single most valuable celebrity endorsement in the U.S. during 2009, and worth over $US9 million. However, in 2012, the event's chair Raoul Frevel told reporters Timberlake would no longer be involved with the event: [...] "We tried everything we could to get him more involved with our kids and the hospitals. But it seemed that when <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>cameras</b> weren't on, he disappeared." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving as}} {{boss of the}} Luciano family in the 1950s, Costello {{suffered}} from depression and panic attacks. During this period Costello sought help from a psychiatrist, who advised him {{to distance himself from}} old associates such as Genovese and spend more time with politicians. In the early 1950s, U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee began investigating organized crime in New York in the Kefauver hearings. The Committee summoned numerous mobsters to testify, but they refused to answer questions at the hearings. The mobsters uniformly cited the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, a legal protection against self-incrimination. However, when Costello was summoned, he agreed to answer questions at the hearings and not take the Fifth Amendment. As part of the agreement to testify, the Special Committee and the U.S. television networks agreed not to broadcast Costello's face. During the questioning, Costello nervously refused to answer certain questions and skirted around others. When the Committee asked Costello, [...] "What have you done for your country Mr. Costello?", he famously replied, [...] "Paid my tax!". <b>The</b> <b>TV</b> <b>cameras,</b> unable to show Costello's face, instead focused on his hands, which Costello wrung nervously while answering questions. Costello eventually walked out of the hearings.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{publicity}} stunt for Sharp's, three Bond Minicar Mark Es, (two Saloon Coupes and a Tourer) were the first cars to drive along Britain's first motorway, the Preston By-pass when it opened {{on the morning of}} 5 December 1958. The Sales Department {{thought it would be a}} good idea for Bonds to be the first in the line-up when <b>the</b> <b>T.V.</b> <b>cameras</b> recorded the opening. (The Bonds were actually not the first to arrive as an Austin Healey Sprite had already beaten them to it. However, after a bit of negotiating and no doubt some financial recompense, the Sprite owner obligingly moved over and the Bonds lined up as planned!) [...] The idea was for the first and third cars fitted with only 197 cc engines (driven by Doug Ferriera in LRN 963 and Alan Pounder in car 3) to hold up the traffic by blocking both lanes (the Preston By-pass was only a dual carriageway when it was first opened) whilst the second car, LCK 479 a Tourer driven by John Woods the Production Manager (and fitted with one of the new Villiers 247 cc engines- as available in the new Mark F), would pull out, overtake the first car and speed off into the lead, ready to be photographed by the BBC But the plan back-fired, because the Bond beat the camera crew to the bridge where the shot was to take place! Consequently, the evening news only showed the second and third Bonds amongst the traffic on the opening day. [...] Now part of the M6, this event was recreated for the motorways 50th anniversary by the BBC's Inside Out programme in 2008.|$|E
