25|$|Since {{many have}} {{undertaken}} {{to set down}} an orderly account {{of the events that}} have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word, I too decided, after investigating everything carefully from the very first, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the truth concerning <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> which you have been instructed.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I think one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic {{within the framework of the}} drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|Supported by the Canningites, Hall was by then {{staying at}} the Gatehouse Prison, {{although}} still not charged with any crime. [...] Hill immediately communicated his concerns to Gascoyne, who sent for the young woman. [...] Accompanied by a contingent of Canningites, her answers were at first noncommittal, but once isolated from Canning's friends she soon admitted to Gascoyne that she had perjured herself. [...] She was committed to the Poultry Compter, where the Canningites continued to support her until they learnt that [...] "particular persons only" [...] were allowed to visit. [...] Hall was again questioned on 7March, by both Gascoyne and Canning's supporters. [...] When asked why she had lied to the court, she said [...] "when I was at Mr Fielding's I at first spoke the truth, but was told {{it was not the}} truth. [...] I was terrified and threatened to be sent to Newgate, and prosecuted as a felon, unless I should speak the truth." [...] She was asked by one of her supporters if she was still lying, but her replies were deemed inconclusive and having confessed to and denied most of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> which she was questioned, each side began to see her as a liability.|$|E

500|$|The {{focus of}} the episode is Lady Gaga's song [...] "Born This Way", which she {{approved}} for use in Glee before the song premiered. This will be the second episode to highlight Gaga's music, the first one being season one's [...] "Theatricality". According to Monteith, the focus of [...] "Born This Way" [...] is the characters [...] "embracing <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> selves that [...] don't like and tailoring [...] performances around that." [...] It features homophobic Dave Karofsky starting {{to come to terms}} with his homosexuality. The plot arc, which began in the season's sixth episode, [...] "Never Been Kissed", is intended by series creator Ryan Murphy to have a happy ending. He explained that, while someone like Karofsky could turn to drugs or alcohol or commit suicide, Glee is [...] "by nature optimistic", so he plans to conclude the storyline positively. For fellow closeted character Santana, [...] "Born This Way" [...] set up the final three episodes of the season, which will increase focus on her love for her best friend Brittany. The episode additionally marked the first appearance of guest star Dr. Shane, [...] "a very smart, cool and kind psychiatrist" [...] who may become a recurring character. Other characters seen in [...] "Born This Way" [...] include glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Sam Evans and Lauren Zizes, Kurt's boyfriend Blaine Anderson, school bully Azimio (James Earl), Principal Figgins, and Karofsky's father, Paul (Daniel Roebuck).|$|E
500|$|Returning to the West End, Gielgud {{starred in}} JBPriestley's The Good Companions, adapted {{for the stage}} by the author and Edward Knoblock. The {{production}} ran from May 1931 for 331 performances, and Gielgud described it as his first real taste of commercial success. He played Inigo Jollifant, a young schoolmaster who abandons teaching to join a travelling theatre troupe. This crowd-pleaser drew disapproval from the more austere reviewers, who felt Gielgud should be doing something more demanding, but he found playing a conventional juvenile lead had challenges of its own and helped him improve his technique. During {{the run of the}} play he made another film, Insult (1932), a melodrama about the French Foreign Legion, and he starred in a cinema version of The Good Companions in 1933, with Jessie Matthews. A letter to a friend reveals Gielgud's view of film acting: [...] "There is talk of my doing Inigo in the film of The Good Companions, which appals my soul but appeals to my pocket." [...] In his first volume of memoirs, published in 1939, Gielgud devoted two pages to describing <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> filming that he detested. Unlike his contemporaries Richardson and Laurence Olivier, he made few films until after the Second World War, and did not establish himself as a prominent film actor until many years after that. As he put it in 1994, [...] "I was stupid enough to toss my head and stick to the stage while watching Larry and Ralph sign lucrative Korda contracts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Describing single [...] "You Don't Know Anything", Rabid {{noted that}} the use of guitars on the {{production}} make the song sound [...] "mean". He later would refer to it as a modern version of a My Bloody Valentine song. [...] "Ba Ba Ba" [...] and [...] "Get Out of the City" [...] are the album's eighth and ninth tracks, respectively, and both include drums played by Demeski. [...] "These Are <b>the</b> <b>Things</b> <b>About</b> You" [...] contains [...] "rhythmic activity" [...] and makes use of several guitars in the instrumentation. The album's 11th track, [...] "Quick, Painless and Easy", features Durand singing with deeper vocals that display her French accent. [...] "Back in Our Town" [...] was co-written by the guitarist of the Smashing Pumpkins, James Iha. Described as [...] "gently haunting" [...] by AllMusic's Rabid, it serves as the closer to Apartment Life, except on the Japanese edition where bonus tracks [...] "Sleeping Late" [...] and [...] "Sweet Mary" [...] follow.|$|E
