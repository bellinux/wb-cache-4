5|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the threat of invasion by continuing air attacks on military <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British capital. Hans Jeschonnek still pushed for attacks on civilian morale. He argued that military and civilian industries were located too far apart to achieve a collapse of morale by attacking the former. Instead, he pressed for attacks against residential areas. Hitler refused. He ordered that only military targets in London were to be attacked.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{stood out}} of Hampton Roads on 11 September 1952 and arrived at Yokosuka on 17 October. Vice Admiral Joseph J. Clark, {{commander}} of the 7th Fleet, brought his staff onboard on 19 October. Her primary mission was to provide seagoing artillery support by bombarding enemy <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chaho-Tanchon area, at Chongjin, in the Tanchon-Sonjin area, and at Chaho, Wonsan, Hamhung, and Hungnam during the period 25 October through 2 January 1953.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1995, the CAF had at its {{disposal}} 17 MiG-21s, five {{attack and}} nine transport helicopters, three transport airplanes and two reconnaissance aircraft. On that {{first day of the}} operation, thirteen MiG-21s were used to destroy or disable six <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gospić and Zagreb Corps AORs, at the cost of one severely and three slightly damaged jets. The same day, three Mi-8s were used for medical evacuation. US Navy EA-6Bs and F/A-18s on patrol as part of Operation Deny Flight fired on ARSK surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites at Udbina and Knin as SAM radars locked onto the jets. A few sources claim that they were deployed as a deterrent as the UN troops came under HV fire, and a subsequent UN Security Council report only notes that the deployment was a result of the deterioration of the military situation and resulting low security of the peacekeepers in the area. Also on 4 August, the RSK 105th Air Force Brigade based at Udbina, deployed helicopters against the Croatian special police on Velebit Mountain and against <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gospić area virtually to no effect.|$|E

Tech's No. 1 receiver was Emmett Johnson, who caught 34 passes for 574 yards and three touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Secondly, quotas {{were raised}} {{to limit the}} ability of workers to overfulfill <b>targets.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of time workers, this was {{sometimes}} done by keeping quotas the same but reducing hours; for example, coal miners saw their working day shortened to six hours.

Over half of the 7,524 F-84s produced served with NATO nations, {{and it was the}} first aircraft to fly with the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds demonstration team.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element. The long half-life of the isotope uranium-238 (4.51 years) makes it well-suited for use in estimating {{the age of the}} earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating, including uranium–thorium dating, uranium–lead dating and uranium–uranium dating.

5|$|A flight {{lieutenant}} {{when war}} broke out, Balmer {{was promoted to}} squadron leader in June 1940, becoming the inaugural commanding officer of No.13 Squadron, which operated Lockheed Hudsons out of Darwin, Northern Territory. He was raised to temporary wing commander in April 1941, and within a year had taken charge of the RAAF's first Bristol Beaufort unit, No.100 Squadron. Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in June 1942, he led the Beauforts on bombing and torpedo missions against Japanese <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New Guinea campaign.|$|E
5|$|A {{revision}} to Allied plans {{meant that}} Morotai played {{a much greater}} role in the liberation of the Philippines than had been originally envisioned. The invasion of Mindanao was postponed in September 1944 in favour of a landing at Leyte in the central Philippines in late October. The air bases at Morotai were the closest Allied air strips to Leyte, and fighters and bombers based on the island attacked <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern Philippines and NEI {{in support of the}} landing at Leyte on 25 October. After airfields were completed at Leyte, Morotai was also used as a staging point for fighters and bombers traveling to the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|After Christmas, Neuner won both {{individual}} races in Oberhof – her World Cup wins 27 and 28. In the women’s relay, she incurred 4 penalties {{in the final}} shooting, which foiled a likely German victory. Neuner suffered {{one of the biggest}} mishaps of her career, when she fired on the wrong <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nove Mesto pursuit, dropping from first to seventh place. She recovered quickly by winning the sprint race in Antholz one week later. In February, Neuner claimed a double sprint and pursuit victory in Oslo despite suffering from a cold, which forced her to withdraw from the mass start. At the last World Cup stop before the world championships in Kontiolahti, she reached her sixth sprint win of the season, and extended her World Cup lead over Darya Domracheva.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{played a}} minor {{role in the}} Japan {{campaign}} in {{the last months of}} the war and was preparing to participate in the invasion of Japan at the time the war ended. Several Australian warships operated with the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) during the Battle of Okinawa and Australian destroyers later escorted British aircraft carriers and battleships during attacks on <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Japanese home islands. Despite its distance from Japan, Australia was the BPF's main base and a large number of facilities were built to support the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E

5|$|Commissioned only a {{few years}} before the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the ships had limited service careers. All three of the battleships conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean Sea in 1912. In 1913, they took part in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea that protested the Balkan Wars. After Italy declared war on Austro-Hungary and the other Central Powers in 1915, the three Radetzky-class ships bombarded coastal <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Adriatic Sea. After 1915, their participation in the war became minimal. All three ships were handed over to Italy {{after the end of the}} war, and broken up for scrap between 1920 and 1926.|$|E
5|$|During the {{bombardment}} of 19 February, Gaulois bombarded Turkish forts covering {{the mouth of}} the Dardanelles, although Charlemagne did not participate that day. During the day's action, the ship was hit twice, but was only lightly damaged. The two ships traded positions during {{the bombardment}} of 25 February, although Charlemagne was not damaged. On 2 March, the French squadron bombarded <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Saros, {{at the base of the}} Gallipoli Peninsula. Five days later, the French squadron attempted to suppress the Turkish guns while British battleships bombarded the fortifications. Gaulois was hit by one shell during this attack that failed to detonate. Admiral Guépratte and his squadron returned to the Gulf of Saros on 11 March where they again bombarded Turkish fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand was {{a complex}} plan, {{involving}} misinformation and extensive physical deception. The underlying plot was the Allied forces had been {{surprised to find}} the Germans had not moved forces from the Mediterranean to re-inforce Normandy. Therefore, plans to invade southern France and the Balkans were looking less appealing. Instead the Allied commanders had decided to focus all of their resources on the Italian campaign. The real force assigned to Dragoon, the US VI Corps, would land in Genoa. Meanwhile, notional formations, such as the Seventh Army and the British 5th Airborne Division would support pushes along the Italian front and threaten <b>targets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans. Ferdinand also recycled some of Zeppelin's threats against Turkey with the fictional British Ninth and Twelfth Armies.|$|E
