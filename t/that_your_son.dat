2500|$|Mozart's string quartets are {{considered}} the pinnacle of the classical art. The six string quartets that he dedicated to Haydn, his friend and mentor, inspired the elder composer to say to Mozart's father, [...] "I tell you before God as an honest man <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>son</b> is the greatest composer known to me either in person or by reputation. He has taste, and, what is more, the most profound knowledge of composition." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "By the way, I {{suppose that}} you have no {{objection}} to my mentioning, at the meeting this evening, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>sons</b> have joined?

Duty then wrote a letter to Wise's mother Mary, in which he stated: [...] "Well {{by the time you get}} this letter you will already know <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>son</b> is dead. I know now because I just killed him an hour ago. Gee you'd think I'd be feeling some remorse but I'm not." [...] The letter was intercepted at the prison.|$|E
2500|$|A {{portion of}} the letter from No. 20 Squadron {{commanding}} officer to Kemp's parents reads: [...] "You have no doubt been advised by the War Office <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>son</b> has unfortunately been killed in action. It happened during a fight with about 15 enemy machines. One enemy machine with the sun behind him surprised your son and his pilot and dived on them before anything could be done. Before your son was killed however he had shot {{down one of the}} enemy machines and his pilot eventually shot down another. He and his pilot have done excellent work together and both have been recommended for awards. I am particularly sorry to lose your son as he was just the type of conscientiously brave officer that one looks forward to having. He was extraordinarily keen on his work and looked forward to the day when he could learn to fly himself. Death must have been instantaneous as he was hit in the head and heart..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's a' varra weel--it's a' varra weel, Torwoodlee," [...] said he; [...] "but {{who would}} ha' thought <b>that</b> <b>your</b> father's <b>son</b> would ha' sold two gude estates {{to build a}} shaw's (cuckoo's) nest {{on the side of}} a hill?" ...|$|R
