500|$|When you win a race {{like this}} {{the feeling is}} very, very good. There {{have been times when}} I have been {{flat-out}} to finish sixth, but you can't see that from the outside. In [...] I finished three or four times in seventh place. I pushed like mad, yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were thinking that I was just trundling around. But that's motor racing. So in fact <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> judge in this sport is the long term. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Havins {{was asked}} if she felt that Babe had been {{redeemed}} since the baby switch. Havins replied, [...] "More or less. That's not {{something that can be}} done overnight; it takes time. And I don't think it's necessarily acts, like one heroic act, that redeem someone." [...] She clarified: It's just showing change. She's very remorseful and there's regret with the whole situation. It's one thing if somebody didn't feel sorry for what they did, but she repented for her sins. Everyone has a past. Everyone makes mistakes. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do is move on and try to be a better person from that point forward. When Bianca forgives Babe in 2007 for keeping her child from her, there were viewers who still felt that it was due to Bianca being in love with Babe, and were upset that Bianca could not seem to resist any interaction with her. In a 2007 interview with TV Guide, Havins seemed perplexed that a significant number of viewers had still not forgiven Babe for the baby switch, and felt that the character had been redeeming herself.|$|E
2500|$|Writing in Melody Maker, Michael Watts {{described}} Living in the Material World as [...] "Harrison's personal statement" [...] documenting {{his journey}} towards [...] "a spiritual goal {{which for the}} first time he has been able to define". Watts continued: [...] "now he stands as something more than an entertainer. Now he's being honest. When you've been through all the bullshit and come out the other side, that's <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be." [...] In his review for Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden praised the album's [...] "inspirationally, opulently, romantic" [...] qualities, and he wrote of [...] "That Is All" [...] and [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round" [...] as [...] "two devotional prayers whose solemn mantra-influenced melodies are barely able to sustain their lush orchestration. Yet they do, so that at the end we are left suspended in ethereality..." [...] Holden added that [...] "a close listening from start to finish is roughly equivalent to participating in a mass spectacle of religious re-dedication – one that does not end with rousing anthems but in heavenly choirs." [...] Some reviewers objected to the preponderance of ballads on the album, however, as well as the overt religiosity of many of its songs.|$|E

2500|$|To {{complement}} the gameplay, distinctive, stylistic visuals were decided upon {{and carried out}} through the CANVAS graphics engine. Adding a touch of fantasy to the mix, the development team hoped {{to be able to}} garner attention from gamers who did not play games with similar settings but more realistic combat. The use of a warm color palette took emphasis away from the [...] "grotesque, realistic nature of war itself," [...] as Nonaka had stated, and focused instead on the characters and story. Tanaka added that, [...] "we wanted to show that realism isn't <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do with 3D graphics." [...] The character designs for the game were created by Raita Honjou, who, {{along with the rest of}} the development staff, aimed for a look that was described by 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish as [...] "rustic." [...] In early stages designs drew more directly on examples from World War II, however they proved to be too modern for what the team wanted to achieve. Thus, Raita aimed for a motif closer to that found in World War I, first creating Alicia and Welkin's concept illustrations and using them as a basis for the rest of the Gallian cast. World War II influence can still be seen in the designs of Imperial characters such as Gregor, whose uniform is heavily based on German officers' uniforms from that period. The end result of these efforts was described by Japanese director Mamoru Oshii as giving him [...] "an impression similar to ... the Nausicaä manga," [...] and Nonaka admits to aiming for the style found in World Masterpiece Theater.|$|E
2500|$|While on set filming for The Back-up Plan in June 2009, Lopez {{revealed}} to MTV's Larry Carol {{that she had}} been working on the follow-up album to 2007's Brave. She had been working on the album during pregnancy, {{but it was not until}} the birth of her twins, Max and Emme, that she was able to focus on the project. Carol asked about the direction of the album, but Lopez refused to comment, instead saying [...] "You can't help but put not only your kids into it, but to put anything you are going through in your music. [...] <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> really sing or write is stuff that you know. The more music you make and the more that you get into it and the more you write, the more you realize that's all you can write." [...] At the time of the interview, two of the album's songs had leaked. The first, titled [...] "(What Is) Love?", was written by Wynter Gordon and co-written and produced by Emile Dernst II (D'Mile). After expressing dismay at the song's leak, its writer (Wynter Gordon) spoke of why the song was very personal to her: [...] " [...] not knowing what love is ...I felt like so many woman have that same story. No fathers, families, abusive boyfriends and husbands..no parental support, they feel alone [...]. I've had my few relationships and have yet to feel love [...]" [...] Jean Baptist produced a 'part-two' for the song, which was mentioned at one of the album pre-release parties, attended by Rap-Up magazine, however the second part of the song was omitted from the track listing. The original version of the song, under the title [...] "What Is Love", was included on the soundtrack to the 2010 film, The Back-up Plan, starring Lopez.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Stacey. [...] "So," [...] he continued, with a self-satisfied {{smile to}} Cressy, [...] "far from being hard on you, Mr. McKinstry, we're rather {{inclined}} {{to put you}} on velvet. We offer you a fair price for <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> give us--actual possession; and we help you with your old grudge against the Harrisons.

Disabuse {{her mind}} of her Suspicions {{regarding}} the Princess of Conde; make my peace with her; convince her of my sincerity, of my firm intention {{to have done}} with gallantry, so that she on her side will make me the sacrifice of banishing the Concinis. You will do this, my friend?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then the}} {{knowledge}} {{they have that}} they must subsist on charity, and so often reluctant charity, it would renew their lives {{if they could have}} something to do with their hands and pass their time and at the same time earn their bread, and know the sweetness of the bread which is the result of the labor of one's own hands. They need that cheer and pleasure.

I told her to remain awake and watch for you, and call me at once. She did watch. You can't believe her. You can't believe any woman. Who can tell what's inside their heads? No one. You can know nothing. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> know is that it isn't anything like what comes through their lips. They live by the side of you. They seem to hate you, or they seem to love you; they caress or torment you; they throw you over or stick to you closer than your skin for some inscrutable and awful reason of their own--which you can never know! Look at her--and look at me. At me!--her infernal work. What has she been saying?" ...|$|E
