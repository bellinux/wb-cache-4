25|$|England won the toss {{and chose}} to field – a {{decision}} which looked correct {{as the new}} ball bowlers found plenty of movement of the pitch. However, they failed {{to take advantage of}} this situation, and the two wickets earned during the first session of play were due to lbw decisions that the batsmen could consider themselves unlucky <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>to.</b> The biggest wicket of the day for England was that of Kumar Sangakkara, who pulled a ball out to deep square leg into the waiting hands of Monty Panesar. He had scored 46, but looked set for a much larger score. At the end of the day’s play, Sri Lanka were 147/4, but with Mahela Jayawardene still at the crease.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} Baltimore Colts {{in the fourth}} game of the season. Baltimore scored a {{touchdown}} {{and a pair of}} field goals in the second quarter <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a 13–0 halftime lead, but Cleveland launched a comeback in the third and fourth quarters. The Browns' scoring began in the third quarter with a 17-yard touchdown run by Edgar Jones that was set up by a 47-yard return of a Colts missed field goal by Cliff Lewis. Cleveland then took a 14–13 lead when a fourth-quarter punt by Charlie O'Rourke slipped off his foot and went sideways, going out of bounds at his own 22-yard line. The Browns took over and Graham scored a touchdown on a six-yard rush. Another touchdown followed about a minute later when linebacker Bill Willis intercepted Colts quarterback Y. A. Tittle and returned it to Baltimore's 2-yard line. Marion Motley ran it in for a touchdown from there. Baltimore responded with a long touchdown pass from Tittle to Billy Stone, but Cleveland sealed the 28–20 victory with an eight-yard rush by Edgar Jones. Cleveland trailed Baltimore in total yards, with 104 yards of passing and 107 yards of rushing against Baltimore's 181 passing yards and 140 rushing yards. Groza handled kicking {{for the first time in}} the season after recovering from his injury.|$|E

500|$|The Dutch States' troops {{quartered}} in {{the village}} of Borgerhout numbered 25 or 40 infantry companies which comprised from 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers, plus 100 additional mounted troops. They were the backbone of the rebel army and William of Orange referred to them as [...] "his braves". Moreover, they were led by officers of renown such as François de la Noue and John Norreys. To confront the Spanish Army, they were detached along the village of Borgerhout, which they had fortified by digging a moat and building an earth rampart around the village, from the bridge of Deurne over the Groot Schijn stream, which flowed into the Scheldt, to the road of Voetweg, which ran parallel to the canal of Herentals. Orange deployed four additional French infantry regiments and Walloon troops from the nearby garrisons of Ath and Termonde behind Borgerhout and under the protection of Antwerp's citadel and moat. The city's civic guard, numbering 80 flags of armed and trained burghers, was ready to defend the city if necessary, but not willing <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> join the battle nor to allow the regular troops to come within Antwerp. The Spanish soldier and chronicler Alonso Vázquez claimed that Orange's army had, in all, 25,000 men.|$|E
500|$|Desiring {{their own}} home stadium, in the early 1970s the Giants reached an {{agreement}} with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority to play their home games at a brand-new, state-of-the-art, dedicated football stadium. Some New Yorkers were furious and Mayor John Lindsay had attempted to keep the team in the city by proposing to buy Yankee Stadium and renovate it at a cost of $24 million. Lindsay estimated that they brought $3 million to the city, and was anxious to keep that revenue, as well as satisfy New York Giant fans. Axthlem characterized the Giants fan base at the time as mostly [...] "white, suburban and fairly well to do, and its members drive cars to football games." [...] The battle became nasty with members of the New York City side claiming that the Maras [...] "complained of how inconvenient it was for them to park, or for them <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the neighborhood." [...] They claimed the Maras [...] "never really negotiated. They just listened...I think they were afraid if they asked for something, we might give it to them—and they wanted to keep us from offering a deal that they couldn't turn down." [...] In fact, the Maras had already made the agreement {{to move out of the}} city, even though Wellington was still placating the city. He felt this was a factor in the Mara's decision to move the stadium, as the attendees could drive to their New Jersey stadium as opposed to traveling through the Bronx to Yankee Stadium. The new stadium, which would become known as Giants Stadium, was to be built at a brand new sports complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The decision met with outrage from some New Yorkers, and the city's mayor John Lindsay sought legal action to prevent the team from playing in Yankee Stadium — or anywhere else in New York — and demanded a congressional investigation into the deal.|$|E

He later commented on his aggressive batting style: [...] "That's my natural game – I don't want to change because I feel confident playing that way.

2500|$|At the 1986 French Open, Evert {{asked for}} and {{received}} a Wednesday start (due to her left knee). She play her long-time foe Navratilova {{for the last time}} in a grand slam final. [...] In the first set, Evert double faulted four-times {{in the first two games}} of the match, which basically let Navratilova have the first set in only 30 minutes time. [...] In the second set, Evert dealt with the weather conditions better, which consisted on high winds, and was able to break Navratilova's serve in the fourth game of the set. [...] That break of serve allowed Evert <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a five games to three lead, which it gave her an opportunity to serve for the set. [...] In the ninth game of the set, Evert would find herself into a love to 40 hole, but would save all three break points, which was done with an ace and a stop volley shot to win six games to three. [...] During the third set, Evert gave up a break of serve first on her first service game, which was the second game of the set to go down love to two games. [...] Evert would not allow this to stand and quickly broke back in the third game and held her serve in the next to tie-up the set two games-all. [...] Evert would not let Navratilova back into the match after that because of her sublime playing, which allowed her to take the third set six games to three. [...] This would be an all-time and Open Era record seventh French Open title for Evert, which brought the French Open record between the two, three to one title advantage in Evert's favor in the finals when they played in them.|$|E
