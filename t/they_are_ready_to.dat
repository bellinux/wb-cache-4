5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the {{starship}} USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far {{from the rest of}} the Federation. In this episode, Voyager encounters a swarm of space-borne lifeforms, which mistake the vessel for a member of their species. The presence of the aliens induce a premature mating cycle in Kes (Jennifer Lien), causing her and Neelix (Ethan Phillips) to question whether or not <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> have children.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is hatched, the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go out to sea on their own.|$|E
50|$|Nicolas Sarkozy, François Fillon and Valérie Pécresse {{declared}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> grant {{some points}} to the representatives. <b>They</b> said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> modify the text on administration councils to include more people in it, but refused to include more students. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> discuss the selectiveness.|$|R

5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, while others have developed a number of mechanisms for {{holding on to the}} eggs until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E
5|$|Steiner, Mitchell, and Hill feel <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> present, {{but at the}} event, Blanchard places acid on {{the machine}} when {{everyone}} is unaware, causing an explosion. The funding for Steiner's project is ended instantly, however, Mitchell later discovers that the device has been tampered with. Steiner goes to Blanchard's house, where Lembach and Latham are having dinner. He presents the men with the evidence that his machine was deliberately tampered with, and Lembach allows him to have another chance. Steiner decides to try to project himself to Lembach's house, and, with help from his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp), he begins the procedure. However, right then, Mitchell and Hill return to the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of D.sayi begins with copulation, which {{normally}} takes place shortly after the female has moulted, while her exoskeleton is still soft. Spawning occurs within hours or days of copulation, and the eggs are brooded on the female's pleopods (swimmerets) until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> hatch. Females have been found carrying eggs from April to October; {{in a study of}} crabs caught at Gloucester Point, Virginia in 1978, females were observed to carry between 686 and 14,735 eggs. The number of eggs increases with carapace width according to a power law; extrapolation of the power law suggests that the largest D.sayi females are capable of carrying over 32,000 eggs each.|$|E

5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E
25|$|Before <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be used, most {{techniques}} {{would require}} technical development {{processes that are}} not yet in place. As a result, many promising proposed climate engineering {{do not yet have}} the engineering development or experimental evidence to determine their feasibility or efficacy.|$|E
25|$|After aging at {{the winery}} most wood-aged Ports, Sherries, Vins doux naturels, Vins de liqueur, basic level Ice wines and {{sparkling}} wines are bottled when the producer feels that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be consumed. These wines {{are ready to}} drink upon release and will not benefit much from aging. Vintage Ports and other bottled-aged Ports & Sherries will benefit from some additional aging.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, the New Wafd Party and other {{opposition}} political forces have announced that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> support ElBaradei if {{he decided to}} run for the election. However, Mohamed ElBaradei stated that if he decides to run for the 2011 elections, he prefers to run as an independent candidate, rather than running as a candidate of any of the existing political parties.|$|E
25|$|Female gray langurs do {{not make}} it obvious {{that they are in}} estrous. However, males are still somehow able to deduce the {{reproduction}} state of females. Females signal that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> mate by shuddering the head, lowering the tail, and presenting their anogenital regions. Such solicitations do not always lead to copulation. When langurs mate, they are sometimes disrupted by other group members. Females have even been recorded mounting other females.|$|E
25|$|The {{offspring}} {{remain in}} the fresh water until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> migrate to the ocean as smolts. In a few years, the surviving adults return, climb the fish ladder, and reach their spawning ground to continue the life cycle. Of the millions of young fish born, only a relative few survive to adulthood. Causes of death include natural predators, commercial and sport fishing, disease, low stream flows, poor water quality, flooding, and concentrated developments along streams and lakes.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of their}} large size, king penguin chicks take 14–16 months before <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go to sea. This is {{markedly}} different from smaller penguins, who rear their chicks through a single summer when food is plentiful. King penguins time their mating so the chicks will develop over the harshest season for fishing. In this way, {{by the time}} the young penguins are finally mature enough to leave their parents, it is summer when food is plentiful and conditions are more favorable for the young to survive alone.|$|E
25|$|The Hawaiian {{women are}} anxious to vote and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> do {{all they can to}} gain equal suffrage. One of the members said {{yesterday}} that up to the present time the native women have not known just what steps to take and therefore have made no progress but she said that with Mrs. Dowsett as the president they feel that the cause will surely advance. All of the members {{are anxious to}} be active and want to arouse Interest among all {{of the women in the}} city irrespective of nationality.|$|E
25|$|As most {{nutrient}} supplements feed {{all living}} microorganism in the must (whether desirable or not), winemakers will often wait {{to add the}} nutrients until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> inoculate the must with their desired S. cerevisiae strain. Producers who are using wild ferments may also wait until after sulfur dioxide additions have killed off unwanted microbes or feed early because they would like the potential complexity that other microbes could add to the wine. When added, the nitrogen is usually {{in the form of}} amino acids, combined with vitamins and minerals to help kick start the fermentation.|$|E

25|$|LRRP {{units have}} been {{successful}} in carrying out several attacks behind enemy lines. Operations use small groups, who go into and out of enemy territory clandestinely through jungle routes and seek their targets. These groups may stay in safehouses or camp in the jungles until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> take their designated target. Many of the attacks launched by LRRP units targeted high-profile LTTE commanders and were carried out in the manner of roadside ambushes. Before the 2002 ceasefire agreement was signed, the government denied allegations from the LTTE that state-backed deep-penetration units were targeting their leaders.|$|E
25|$|Females of the Geophilomorpha and Scolopendromorpha show {{far more}} parental care. The eggs, 15 to 60 in number, are laid in a {{nest in the}} soil or in rotten wood. The female stays with the eggs, {{guarding}} and licking them {{to protect them from}} fungi. The female in some species stays with the young after they have hatched, guarding them until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> leave. If disturbed, the female either abandons the eggs or eats them; abandoned eggs tend to fall prey to fungi rapidly. Some species of Scolopendromorpha are matriphagic, meaning the offspring eat their mother.|$|E
25|$|Mating {{is mainly}} {{done during the}} month of April, after mating the male has minimal to no role in the new baby spiders life. The female is the main {{caregiver}} for the young, before laying the eggs she will make a silk pouch to protect and give shelter to the eggs, up to 70 eggs can be produced at once. The female will stay in the silk pouch with the eggs, protecting, and waiting for them to hatch. After hatching the mother cares for her new babies and will stay together until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go out on their own. The spider's bite is not poisonous to people but is painful do to their large fangs and wide jaw. However, the bite does leave an itchy, swollen, red bump.|$|E
