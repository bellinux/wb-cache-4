5|$|Ohio's {{governor}} had {{relatively little}} power—for example, he could recommend legislation, but not veto it—but with Ohio a key swing state, its governor {{was a major}} figure in national politics. Although McKinley believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> of the nation depended on that of business, he was evenhanded in dealing with labor. He procured legislation that set up an arbitration board to settle work disputes and obtained passage of a law that fined employers who fired workers for belonging to a union.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevention}} of dengue fever in Taiwan was always most successful in Tainan City. In 2007, however, outbreaks {{in the city}} was almost unstoppable. The fever outbreaks originally occurred only in Annan District, where the first case was reported in June. The health department failed to control {{the spread of the}} fever, and all six districts ended up having confirmed cases. There were also an outbreak in an old soldiers' home. On August 22, Mayor Hsu apologized for the disastrous outbreak of the dengue fever; he announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> department would be reorganized and new officials would be appointed in six months.|$|E

25|$|Despite the criticism, Hewitt {{managed to}} balance the books of the NHS, which had {{previously}} been in huge debt. After having vowed to resign should the NHS complete another year with debts, Hewitt ensured <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> Service ended 2006/2007 with a £510 million surplus.

By June 2007, whilst the overall budget was balanced, one in five NHS hospital trusts were still in debt.|$|E

25|$|The {{remediation}} {{process in}} Palmerton has been contentious. Both the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the citizens' group Palmerton Citizens for a Clean Environment (PCCE) believe that extensive cleanup of the town's soil {{is necessary to}} protect human health. On the other hand, many citizens, including the Pro-Palmerton Coalition (PPC), argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> risks are exaggerated and that the town's Superfund status stigmatizes it.

25|$|Human {{rights groups}} and the UN use the Gaza Health Ministry's number of Palestinians killed in Gaza as {{preliminary}} and add to or subtract from it after conducting their own investigations. For example, human rights groups say that the casualty count provided by the Health Ministry most likely includes victims of Hamas executions, domestic violence, and natural deaths, but they (the human rights groups) remove the accused collaborators (who were shot as close range) from their own counts. Israel contends <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> Ministry's casualty count also includes deaths caused by rocket or mortar malfunctions.|$|E

The executives of the British Phosphate Commission surveyed the island to determine the extent of war damage to mining infrastructure, and found the phosphate factory totally destroyed.

The side where there is resistance to the descent of the fingers toward the pubis is greatest is where the brow is located. If the head of the fetus is well-flexed, it should be on the opposite side from the fetal back. If the fetal head is extended though, the occiput is instead felt and is located on the same side as the back.|$|E
25|$|The Ganges {{suffers from}} extreme {{pollution}} levels, {{caused by the}} 400 million people who live close to the river. Sewage from many cities along the river's course, industrial waste and religious offerings wrapped in non-degradable plastics add large amounts of pollutants to the river as it flows through densely populated areas. The problem is exacerbated {{by the fact that}} many poorer people rely on the river on a daily basis for bathing, washing, and cooking. The World Bank estimates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> costs of water pollution in India equal three percent of India's GDP. It has also been suggested that eighty percent of all illnesses in India and one-third of deaths can be attributed to water-borne diseases.|$|E
25|$|According to the Japanese Government, 180,592 {{people in}} the general {{population}} were screened in March 2011 for radiation exposure and no case was found which affects health. Thirty workers conducting operations at the plant had exposure levels greater than 100 mSv. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> effects of the radioactivity release are primarily psychological rather than physical effects. Even in the most severely affected areas, radiation doses never reached {{more than a quarter of}} the radiation dose linked to an increase in cancer risk (25 mSv whereas 100 mSv has been linked to an increase in cancer rates among victims at Hiroshima and Nagasaki). However, people who have been evacuated have suffered from depression and other mental health effects.|$|E
