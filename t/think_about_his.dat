500|$|In 2004, Antestor {{changed their}} style {{into a more}} modern black metal, and {{released}} their first set of new songs since The Return of the Black Death in an EP called Det tapte liv ("The Lost Life"). Det tapte liv concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor's style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. [...] However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken.

500|$|His debut novel, the satirical De frafalnes klubb, was {{published}} in 1960. It tells a story of some disillusioned cynics in Paris who create a new philosophical and literary [...] "-ism," [...] which gains worldwide popularity. According to reviewer Brikt Jensen, Hambro offered a critique of [...] "the modern type of man [...] the first philosophical system that comes to his sight." [...] Jensen also commended Hambro for his [...] "un-Norwegian" [...] perspective, calling him a [...] "distinguished European." [...] The literary scholar Willy Dahl opined that the novel denoted Hambro's declared scepticism towards [...] "every sort of intellectual or political pigeonholing," [...] a scepticism that he shared with his father C. J. Hambro, whose disdain for radical and totalitarian ideologies was well known. The elder Hambro was also, according to literary scholar Per Thomas Andersen, vital for the next literary work of the younger Hambro: he provided biographical context for a trilogy comprising the novels Frels oss fra det gode (1963; [...] "Deliver us from the good"), Utfor stryket (1964; [...] "Down the River") and Vi vil oss en drøm (1966; [...] "We Want a Dream"), which describe the adolescence {{of a young man}} named Nico Dietmeyer. Living in the upper-class society of Western Oslo in the 1930s, Dietmeyer has an authoritarian father who commits adultery, despite emphasising decorum in his own moral system. The first of them was favourably reviewed by Brikt Jensen in Verdens Gang, who called it [...] "a declaration of love for Oslo"; reviewing for the same newspaper, Ragnhild Lorentzen gave the next novel a laudatory review, praising Hambro for having taken an important task upon his shoulders, whilst also criticising him for blurring the line between adolescence and adulthood. Dahl argues that these novels constitute an unpretentious, yet perspicacious criticism of conformity in that milieu, whilst Andersen considers them to be stories about double standards and liberation from one's own father. Rottem maintains that the novel is self-biographic, and that Hambro tries to polemize against the extramarital relationship that his father had with actress Gyda Christensen. 1966 proved to be a productive year for Hambro: he first contributed to the semi-pornographic literary collection Norske sengehester ("Norwegian Bedposts"), and subsequently, in September, delivered a vehement critique of the Norwegian education system in the pamphlet Er gymnasiaster mennesker?. The last novel of his trilogy about Nico Dietmeyer was released in November of the same year; Lorentzen considered {{the first part of the}} book to be somewhat verbose and anticipative, concluding her review by calling the novel an unoriginal yet well written book. In 1967 Hambro continued with Bjørnen sover ("The Bear Is Sleeping"), a marriage novel that disappointed the critics, before releasing his semantic and psycholinguistic study Ting, tanke, tale in 1969. The journalist Iver Tore Svenning recognized that work as one of the very few successful attempts at a popular scientific treatment of structural linguistics, a view supported by Dahl. Hambro's last novels were Nødhavn ("Harbour of Refuge") and Lekkasje ("Leakage"), released in 1971 and 1974. The former book is about a love affair between an erstwhile cultural radical and a young woman with aggressive political opinions. The affair makes, according to Dahl, the cultural radical <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> nonconformist past, yet he abandons it, and seeks safety in the bourgeoisie class.|$|E

2500|$|Bradshaw {{returned}} on {{an episode}} of SmackDown! in 2003, which saw him and his old friend Faarooq saving the Undertaker {{from the hands of}} Chuck Palumbo and Johnny Stamboli. Layfield returned with a new look by cutting his long hair, returning it to its natural color, and going clean shaven. His new look would only be referenced once when, in a scripted segment, Faarooq asked him directly about it. Bradshaw insisted that he had already told the story to Faarooq, who rejected this claim. The duo would return to perform their regular segments, as they did before the brand extension, such as playing poker, drinking beer, and bribing superstars of their money. Unlike before, they would not attack or protect other superstars at the employment of other superstars as none would hire them. At Vengeance, Bradshaw won a bar room brawl match which featured Faarooq and a variety of mid-card superstars and other WWE employees. The duo wrestled tag teams such as the Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny) at No Mercy and The World's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) at No Way Out. At WrestleMania XX in 2004, they unsuccessfully challenged for the WWE Tag Team Championship in a fatal four-way tag team match. The gimmick continued on-and-off until the March 18 episode of SmackDown! until losing a tag team [...] "You're Fired" [...] match to WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty for the tag team title. General Manager Paul Heyman, frustrated by an insult by the APA, told Faarooq that if he did not win the aforementioned match, then [...] "You're Fired". After the match, Bradshaw led Faarooq back to Heyman's office to state they had not been fired, but had resigned. Then Heyman cleared up the misunderstanding and pointed out that he said that if they did not win the titles, then he told Faarooq [...] "You're fired". His reason for saying this directly to Faarooq was because it applied only to Faarooq because [...] "WWE Management" [...] still saw a lot of potential in Bradshaw. He left them after telling Bradshaw to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> own future. Faarooq shouted after Heyman that he was not fired because they (Faarooq and Bradshaw) had quit. Bradshaw, however, hesitated. Faarooq took Bradshaw's hesitation to mean that he would not resign, and so Faarooq promptly disbanded the APA and left. In reality, the WWE had decided to stop using Ron Simmons as an on-air performer. He was initially released, but he was later re-hired to work behind the scenes in the WWE under various roles.|$|E
