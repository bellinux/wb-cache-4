5|$|Although {{some parts}} of Waterfall Gully were {{transferred}} from the District Council of East Torrens (now the Adelaide Hills Council) to the City of Burnside in 1856 when the suburb's current boundaries were established, {{the government of the}} day chose to retain control of a significant portion of Waterfall Gully. <b>Thus</b> <b>it</b> was not until 1884 that the remaining land was transferred to the control of the Burnside Council, eventuating largely through the efforts of Samuel Davenport and G. F. Cleland.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the release of Mughal-e-Azam, a typical Bollywood film would garner a {{distribution}} fee of 300,000–400,000 (about US$63,000–84,000 in 1960) per territory. Asif insisted that he would sell his film to the distributors at no less than 700,000 per territory. Subsequently, the film was actually sold at a price of 1.7million (US$356,000) per territory, surprising Asif and the producers. <b>Thus,</b> <b>it</b> set the record for the highest distribution fee received by any Bollywood film at that time.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat. <b>Thus,</b> <b>it</b> was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt {{made it impossible for}} him to do so in all cases, {{and most of the time}} these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.|$|E

5|$|Development of MediEvil: Resurrection {{began in}} 2003 at SCE Cambridge Studio. The senior {{management}} team of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe wanted a launch game for the PlayStation Portable console and ordered the studio to develop the game {{in time for the}} console's release. Due to the short notice, the studio was given only a year to develop a game, <b>thus</b> <b>it</b> was decided that a remake of the original MediEvil would be suitable as developing an original title would take more time to develop.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{diminutive}} size, the Church of St Nicholas {{was probably}} not constructed as an independent church. A legend links the church to {{the name of an}} unidentified local feudal lord named Nikola (Nicholas) as his final resting place, though archaeologist Nikola Mavrodinov considers it more likely that it was possibly a chapel or a cemetery church attached to a larger place of worship. The larger church was perhaps pulled down during the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria (post-14th century). While the Church of St Nicholas was not destroyed, its renovation was prohibited by the Ottomans, <b>thus</b> <b>it</b> gradually fell into ruin.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} nonspecific character, these {{symptoms}} are not often recognized {{as signs of}} HIV infection.

5|$|During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, {{the delegates}} {{allegedly}} received reports from a fur trapper that Lake Michigan extended significantly farther south than {{had previously been}} believed (or mapped). <b>Thus,</b> <b>it</b> was possible that an east–west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of Maumee Bay, or worse, might not intersect the lake at all; the farther south that Lake Michigan actually extended, the more land Ohio would lose, perhaps even the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|During the {{occupation}} of Norway, {{three members of the}} Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property. <b>Thus</b> <b>it</b> was a safe haven from the German military, which was not at war with Sweden. These members kept the work of the Committee going, but did not award any prizes. In 1944, the Nobel Foundation, together with the three members in exile, made sure that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again.|$|E
5|$|Eowa {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on which side he fought is unknown. It {{may well be}} that he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa was in fact dominant among the Mercians during the period leading up to the battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. <b>Thus</b> <b>it</b> may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.|$|E
5|$|Feeding almost {{exclusively}} on octopuses and other cephalopods, the Australian weasel shark mostly hunts near the sea floor. It is viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished through a placental connection and born after a six-month gestation period. This species is productive for a shark, with females bearing litters of 1–19 pups usually twice per year. The Australian weasel shark is caught by trawl {{and to a lesser}} extent gillnet and longline fisheries, though not in such numbers that its population is threatened. <b>Thus,</b> <b>it</b> has been listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

5|$|Forgeries {{in which}} modern lead or white lead pigment {{has been used}} can be {{recognized}} by using a technique called Pb(Lead)-210-Dating. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of lead {{that is part of}} the uranium-238 Radioactive decay series, and has a half-life of 22.3 years. To determine the amount of Pb-210, the alpha radiation emitted by another element, polonium-210 (Po-210), is measured. <b>Thus</b> <b>it</b> is possible to estimate the age of a painting, within a few years' span, by extrapolating the Pb-210 content present in the paint used to create the painting.|$|E
5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and <b>thus</b> <b>it</b> was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.|$|E
