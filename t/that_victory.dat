5|$|Faced with dwindling attendances, the Kilcoynes {{decided to}} starve {{the club and}} sold off senior players who were {{replaced}} by junior footballers. On a tour of Japan in 1975, Mick Meagan and Theo Dunne’s young side defeated the Japanese national team 3–2 in front of 60,000 spectators at the Olympic Stadium, but <b>that</b> <b>victory</b> was the highlight of a season that saw the team finish bottom {{of the table and}} re-apply for admission into the League of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, ranked No. 197, he lost to No. 238 Fernon Wibierin {{the first}} round of {{qualifying}} at Wimbledon. Three weeks later he beat No. 25 Arnaud Boetsch on clay in straight sets in the Davis Cup. He also defeated Henri Leconte in the same week and even though Ramesh Krishnan closed the tie out by beating Rodolphe Gilbert in a five-setter, the architect of <b>that</b> <b>victory</b> was Paes.|$|E

5|$|In the 2009 Wimbledon final, Roddick lost to Federer in five sets. The match {{included}} a 30-game fifth set (a Grand Slam final record) and lasted over four hours. In {{the final game}} of the deciding set, Roddick's serve was broken {{for the first time in}} the match. With <b>that</b> <b>victory,</b> Federer broke Pete Sampras' record of 14 Grand Slam singles titles, and Roddick apologised to Sampras (who was there) for not being able to stop Federer.|$|E
5|$|<b>That</b> <b>victory</b> was {{followed}} by consecutive losses, however, against UCLA and No. 1-ranked Florida. Tennessee ended its losing streak with a win against Ohio, then began alternating wins and losses. The victory against Ohio {{was followed}} by a loss to Auburn. A win against Georgia preceded a loss to No. 2 Alabama on a last-second blocked field goal and a win against No. 22 South Carolina. After South Carolina, Tennessee beat Memphis to create its first winning streak of the season. That streak abruptly ended the following week, when Tennessee lost to Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|The Allies had {{confidently}} expected <b>that</b> <b>victory</b> {{in a major}} set-piece battle would compel LouisXIV {{to accept}} peace on Allied terms, but after Malplaquet (the bloodiest battle of the war), that strategy had lost its validity: Villars had only to avoid defeat for a compromise peace settlement to become inevitable. In March 1710, fresh peace talks re-opened at Geertruidenberg, but again LouisXIV would not concede Whig demands to force his grandson, PhilipV, from Spain. Publicly Marlborough toed the government line, but privately he had real doubts about pressing the French into accepting such a dishonourable course.|$|E

5|$|The Tigers {{opened their}} season against Division I-AA {{opponent}} The Citadel, whom they beat handily, 380. <b>That</b> <b>victory</b> {{was followed by}} two blowout wins: 629 against Missouri and 557 against ACC opponent Wake Forest. Those three games were typical of Clemson's first eight, which the Tigers won in succession. After the win against Wake Forest, Clemson beat Virginia, Duke, North Carolina State, Maryland, and North Carolina. In the final win of that streak, starting quarterback Woodrow Dantzler was replaced by backup Willie Simmons {{in the second quarter}} due to an injury to Dantzler.|$|E
5|$|As a {{qualifier}} at the clay-court Nordea Nordic Light Open in Helsinki, Finland in August, Kuznetsova won {{her first}} WTA singles title, defeating world No. 24 Patty Schnyder in the quarterfinals {{for her first}} win over a top 40 player, before defeating Denisa Chládková in the final. Kuznetsova entered the top 100 {{for the first time}} as a result of <b>that</b> <b>victory.</b> Kuznetsova qualified for the US Open, defeating 19th seed Anne Kremer in the first round for her first win over a top 20 player, before losing in the third round to 13th seed Silvia Farina Elia. In September, Kuznetsova won her second title at the hard court Commonwealth Bank Tennis Classic in Bali, Indonesia, defeating former Grand Slam champions Arantxa Sánchez Vicario and Conchita Martínez. Also during 2002, she teamed up with Sánchez Vicario to win the first WTA doubles titles of her career, in Sopot, Poland, Helsinki and Kōtō, Japan. Kuznetsova finished the 2002 season as world No. 43 in singles.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the battle}} was {{received}} in England shortly after news {{of the fall of}} Louisbourg, putting a damper on the celebrations marking <b>that</b> <b>victory.</b> The full scope of British victories in 1758 did not reach English shores until later in the year, when Pitt learned of the successes at Forts Duquesne and Frontenac, key steps in completing the conquest of New France. Had Carillon also fallen in 1758, the conquest might have been completed in 1758 or 1759; as it happened, Montreal (the last point of resistance) did not surrender until 1760, with campaigns launched from Fort Oswego, Quebec, and Carillon, which was captured and renamed Ticonderoga in 1759 by forces under the command of Jeffrey Amherst, the victor at Louisbourg.|$|E

She held aloof from me, and when Snider took his turn at the wheel, sat beside him, upon the pretext that she wished {{to learn how to}} steer the launch. I wondered if she had guessed the man's antipathy for me, and was seeking his company solely for the purpose of piquing me.|$|R

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 14 September, Hitler and his command held a conference at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin to discuss the future direction of the war. Göring was not present; he was inspecting Luftwaffe units in Belgium. Erhard Milch replaced him. Hitler praised the attacks which had caused heavy damage to the RAF and London. He blamed the failure to achieve more decisive results on the weather. Nevertheless, {{it was clear to}} Hitler <b>that</b> <b>victory</b> had still not been attained by the Luftwaffe. Under those circumstances, Operation Sea Lion could not take place. Großadmiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine, agreed. He argued that Sea Lion should only be carried out as a last resort regardless of gaining air superiority.|$|E
5|$|On the {{subsequent}} {{advance of the}} Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5,000 men and {{took part in the}} battle of the Hydaspes River. After <b>that</b> <b>victory</b> he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in {{the subsequent}} partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC.|$|E
5|$|Reagan's {{campaign}} {{relied on}} a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois. The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much {{of the credit for}} <b>that</b> <b>victory</b> came from the work of three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart of Houston, whom Reagan as President would appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E

40|$|As half of {{the country}} ponders how they underestimated Trump’s advantage, it is {{important}} to remember the state level propositions that passed across the United States last night. Sierra Smucker writes <b>that</b> <b>victories</b> of state ballot initiatives highlight the fact <b>that</b> a Trump <b>victory</b> is not necessarily a sign that American citizens are moving toward a conservative platform. Victories for gun violence prevention policies and minimum wage increases even in states that voted for Trump suggest that Americans are looking for ways to change their immediate circumstance and increase public safety. Shaking up Washington is part of that but that does not mean citizens have rejected the policies that Clinton ran on...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} week, {{the team}} played the Bengals in the playoffs, {{this time at}} Paul Brown Stadium, and secured a 24–14 victory over Cincinnati. <b>That</b> <b>victory</b> meant that the Jets would travel to San Diego to play the Chargers, who had won eleven straight games, in the divisional round. Strong performances by Sanchez, running back Shonn Greene, and the Jets defense helped the Jets to a 17–14 win over the Chargers. New York played the top-seeded Colts in the AFC Championship Game and secured an early 17–6 lead. They had little luck {{in the second half}} as the Colts went to the Super Bowl with a 30–17 victory.|$|E
5|$|After wasting their {{ammunition}} in {{this preliminary}} action, the Mahdist force began a flanking maneuver against the Belgians. The Mahdists' right flank, situated {{along the river}} parallel to the Nile, advanced rapidly trying to pin Chaltin {{with his back to}} the river. Chaltin, who by this time had advanced within two hundred meters of the Mahdists and begun a more effective barrage of his own, replied to the threat by ordering the sudden advance of his reserve companies. The move checked the advancing Mahdists, avoiding the unfavorable position and causing the rebels to falter. Sensing <b>that</b> <b>victory</b> was near, Chaltin ordered the Azande to charge the Mahdists to separate the advanced right wing from the rest of the line. The charge was successful, and the now considerably damaged Mahdist flanking force was completely cut off and surrounded by Free State soldiers. Chaltin's main companies then attacked, pressing the Mahdist defenses as they forced their way into the hills. Three of the companies attacked the well-defended path through the hills, while two others charged the hilltops. After a fierce contest for the heights, the demoralized and weakened Mahdist line broke and its remaining defenders fled to the north towards Rejaf, leaving ammunition and weapons. The action was finished by eight-thirty that morning.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Murray {{suffered}} a first round loss at the Australian Open to eventual runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, {{and a third}} round loss at the French Open to Nicolás Almagro. Murray then made his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at Wimbledon before making his first final at the US Open. During the tournament in New York, Murray claimed his first win over Nadal. <b>That</b> <b>victory</b> meant that he'd become the first player from Britain since Greg Rusedski in 1997 to reach a major final. In his first Grand Slam final Murray {{suffered a}} straight sets loss to Federer. At the Beijing Olympics, Murray suffered {{one of the worst}} defeats of his career, losing his first round singles match to world No. 77 Yen-hsun Lu of Taiwan in straight sets. That abject defeat was still on his mind in a BBC interview five years later – despite an intervening Olympic gold medal and a head-to-head win – when he met the same player (now ranked 75 in the world) in the 2nd round of Wimbledon 2013.|$|E

5|$|Russian armies entered Poland and Lithuania, {{starting}} the Polish–Russian War of 1792. The Sejm voted {{to increase the}} army of the Commonwealth to 100,000men, but owing to insufficient time and funds this number was never achieved and soon abandoned even as a goal. The Polish King and the reformers could field only a 37,000-man army, many of them untested recruits. This army, under the command of Józef Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kościuszko, defeated or fought to a draw the Russians on several occasions, but in the end, a defeat loomed inevitable. Despite Polish requests, Prussia refused to honor its alliance obligations. Stanisław August's attempts at negotiations with Russia proved futile. As the front lines kept shifting to the west and in July 1792 Warsaw was threatened with siege by the Russians, the King came to believe <b>that</b> <b>victory</b> was impossible against the numerically superior enemy, and that surrender was the only alternative to total defeat. Having received assurances from the Russian ambassador Yakov Bulgakov that no territorial changes will occur, the Guardians of the Laws cabinet voted 8:4 to surrender. On July 24, 1792, King Stanisław August Poniatowski joined the Targowica Confederation, as the Empress had demanded. The Polish Army disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|The {{last round}} of matches, {{featuring}} {{all three of}} the teams that had qualified for finals day, determined who went directly to the final, and who would face off first in the semi-final. The Southern Vipers faced the Loughborough Lightning, and batting first a team effort saw them reach 156 for 4; Bates scored 38, Sara McGlashan got 34* and Lydia Greenway 29. Despite scores in the thirties from Perry and Evelyn Jones, a strong bowling performance from the Vipers, in which Linsey Smith and Brindle each took three wickets, saw them to victory by 59 runs. <b>That</b> <b>victory</b> guaranteed the Vipers a place in the final, while the Loughborough Lightning had to face Western Storm in a semi-final. The result of the other match that day was of no consequence to the tournament; Beth Mooney scored 56 runs for the Yorkshire Diamonds, who scored 118 runs. Anya Shrubsole finished the match with five wickets for the Western Storm, taking a four–wicket maiden in the final over of the match. Storm opening batsmen Taylor and Priest shared a 101-run partnership to take their side to the brink of victory before being dismissed from subsequent deliveries, but despite two further wickets, the Storm won by six wickets with 21 balls remaining.|$|E
5|$|Vytautas, {{supported}} by a few Polish banners, started {{an assault on the}} left flank of the Teutonic forces. After more than an hour of heavy fighting the Lithuanian light cavalry began a full retreat. Jan Długosz described this development as a complete annihilation of the entire Lithuanian army. According to Długosz, the Knights assumed <b>that</b> <b>victory</b> was theirs, broke their formation for a disorganized pursuit of the retreating Lithuanians and gathered much loot before returning to the battlefield to face the Polish troops. He made no mention of the Lithuanians, who later returned to the battlefield. Thus Długosz portrayed the battle as a single-handed Polish victory. This view contradicted Cronica conflictus and has been challenged by modern historians. Starting with an article by Vaclaw Lastowski in 1909, they proposed that the retreat was a planned, strategic maneuver borrowed from the Golden Horde. A false retreat was used in the Battle of the Vorskla River of 1399, where the Lithuanian army was dealt a crushing defeat and Vytautas himself barely escaped alive. This theory gained wider acceptance after the discovery and publication of a German letter by Swedish historian Sven Ekdahl in 1963. The letter, written a few years after the battle, cautions the new Grand Master to look out for false retreats of the kind that were used in the Great Battle. Stephen Turnbull asserted that the Lithuanian retreat did not quite fit the tried formula of a false retreat. Such a retreat was usually staged by one or two units (as opposed to almost an entire army) and was swiftly followed by a counterattack (whereas the Lithuanians returned late in the battle).|$|E
