25|$|After {{the climbers}} had {{recovered}} {{and made their}} way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> at Camp VII, Gilkey was lost. He had been anchored to the ice slope as the exhausted climbers prepared the tent, and his muffled shouts were heard. When Bates and Streather returned to bring him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> they found no sign of him. A faint groove in the snow suggested that an avalanche had taken place.|$|E
25|$|The Crown {{alleged that}} Lindy Chamberlain had cut Azaria's throat {{in the front}} seat of the family car, hiding the baby's body in a large camera case. She then, {{according}} to the proposed reconstruction of the crime, rejoined the group of campers around a campfire and fed one of her sons a can of baked beans, before going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> and raising the cry that a dingo had taken the baby. It was alleged that at a later time, while other people from the campsite were searching, she disposed of the body.|$|E
25|$|He was {{concerned}} because Mallory and Irvine {{seemed to be}} five hours behind their schedule. After this sighting, Odell continued on to Camp VI where he found the tent in chaotic disorder. At 2p.m. an intense snow squall began. Odell {{went out in the}} squall hoping to signal the two climbers who he believed would by now be descending. He whistled and shouted, hoping to lead them back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> but gave up because of the intense cold. Odell holed up in C-VI until the squall ended at 4pm. He then scanned the mountain for Mallory and Irvine but saw no one.|$|E

For three more days they remained in their tent, unable even to light the stove. When the weather cleared on 16 November, Madigan and Stillwell's parties joined them. The three parties travelled together for much of {{the following}} day, before Mawson's party separated and pushed on ahead in the late afternoon.|$|E
500|$|Later in 1778 at Short Hills, New Jersey, White {{suffered}} a fractured femur {{caused by a}} musket ball and received a wound to the head from the stock of a British Army grenadier's musket. Following the engagement at Short Hills, White was taken as {{a prisoner of war}} by the British forces. White had fallen unconscious and was taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> of [...] "an amiable and accomplished" [...] British officer who had rescued him from death. He was later exchanged, and in the autumn of 1778 White returned to Winchester [...] "by slow and painful efforts, exceedingly lame, weak and emaciated by acute and protracted suffering". His wounds had not yet healed by the time of his return to Winchester, but following the removal of bone fragments, the wound began to close. White remained permanently physically disabled {{as a result of his}} injuries.|$|E

500|$|Patton {{arrived at}} the {{hospital}} the same day, accompanied {{by a number of}} medical officers, as part of his tour of the U.S. II Corps troops. He spoke to some patients in the hospital, commending the physically wounded. He then approached Kuhl, who {{did not appear to be}} physically injured. Kuhl was sitting slouched on a stool midway through a tent ward filled with injured soldiers. When Patton asked Kuhl where he was hurt, Kuhl reportedly shrugged and replied that he was [...] "nervous" [...] rather than wounded, adding, [...] "I guess I can't take it." [...] Patton [...] "immediately flared up," [...] slapped Kuhl across the chin with his gloves, then grabbed him by the collar and dragged him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> entrance. He shoved him out of the tent with a kick to his backside. Yelling [...] "Don't admit this son of a bitch", Patton demanded that Kuhl be sent back to the front, adding, [...] "You hear me, you gutless bastard? You're going back to the front." ...|$|E
2500|$|The last {{survivor}} of the Ludlow Massacre, Mary Benich-McCleary, died of a stroke {{at the age of}} 94 on June 28, 2007. She was 18 months old when the massacre occurred. [...] McCleary's parents and her two brothers narrowly escaped death when the conductor of the train that brought the militia <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> colony stopped the train to shield the family and others trying to flee, but Mary had been left behind. A 16-year-old boy heard her screams, gathered her up into his coat and then ran into the woods. Mary and the boy were found several days later, still hiding. McCleary's daughter said family members didn't speak of the massacre.|$|E
2500|$|In the morning, Moses {{relates to}} Aaron that God {{has a message}} for him, while deferring its revelation to a later time. [...] However, this {{particular}} day, Moses changes {{the order in which}} the priests and dignitaries walk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tent</b> of Meeting, placing Aaron in the center position of honor, much to the delight of the people. [...] Still, he does not explain to Aaron the reason for the change, nor can he later explain the matter to Aaron when they and Eleazar walk together to the mountain. [...] Moses tries in a gently elliptical manner to explain to Aaron that the latter's death is at hand, asking hypothetically whether [...] Aaron was loaned something from God which God might now want returned; however, Aaron does not perceive Moses's meaning.|$|E
50|$|On {{arrival at}} the army camp, Aleksandra is taken to her grandson's platoon area and told to wait.

Many are standoffish at first but soon, after she shares some pies, some begin to talk to her. She returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> <b>to</b> find Denis had returned. They hug and exchange pleasantries. Later Aleksandra meets her grandson's commanding officer who shows her around the base; he also questions her as to her reasons for visiting. He explains that Denis is a good officer but the request asking for permission for his grandmother to visit was bemusing.|$|R

50|$|The Menik Farm site is very {{prone to}} {{flooding}} because it lies on low ground near a number of rivers and streams including the Aruvi Aru (Malvathu Oya). In August heavy rains flooded the site, causing heavy damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> housing <b>the</b> IDPs and sending raw sewage into the camps and the rivers providing drinking water. There is widespread concern that the north east monsoon season (October to March) will flood the site.|$|R
2500|$|Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, saying: [...] "He {{married a}} Cushite woman!" [...] and [...] "Has the Lord spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us as well?" [...] God heard and called Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tent</b> of Meeting. God {{came down in}} cloud and called out to Aaron and Miriam: [...] "When a prophet of the Lord arises among you, I make Myself known {{to him in a}} vision, I speak with him in a dream. Not so with My servant Moses; he is trusted {{throughout}} My household. With him I speak mouth to mouth, plainly and not in riddles, and he beholds the likeness of the Lord. How then did you not shrink from speaking against My servant Moses!" [...] As the cloud withdrew, Miriam was stricken with snow-white scales. Moses cried out to God, [...] "O God, pray heal her!" [...] But God said to Moses, [...] "If her father spat in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be shut out of camp for seven days." [...] And the people waited until she rejoined the camp.|$|E
2500|$|... "that {{the group}} {{woke up in}} a panic (...) and cut their way out the tent either because an {{avalanche}} had covered the entrance to their tent or because they were scared that an avalanche was imminent (...) (better to have a potentially repairable slit in a tent than risk being buried alive in it under tons of snow). They were poorly clothed {{because they had been}} sleeping, and ran to the safety of the nearby woods where trees would help slow oncoming snow. In the darkness of night they got separated into two or three groups; one group made a fire (hence the burned hands) while the others tried to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> to recover their clothing, since the danger had apparently passed. But it was too cold, and they all froze to death before they could locate their tent in the darkness. At some point some of the clothes may have been recovered or swapped from the dead, but at any rate the group of four whose bodies were most severely damaged were caught in an avalanche and buried under 4 metres (13 ft) of snow (more than enough to account for the 'compelling natural force' the medical examiner described). Dubinina's tongue was likely removed by scavengers and ordinary predation." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 26, the searchers {{found the}} group's {{abandoned}} and badly damaged tent on Kholat Syakhl. The campsite baffled the search party. Mikhail Sharavin, {{the student who}} found the tent, said [...] "the tent was half torn down and covered with snow. It was empty, and all the group's belongings and shoes had been left behind." [...] Investigators said the tent had been cut open from inside. Eight or nine sets of footprints, left by people who were wearing only socks, a single shoe or were even barefoot, could be followed, leading down {{toward the edge of}} a nearby woods, {{on the opposite side of}} the pass, [...] to the north-east. [...] However, after [...] these tracks were covered with snow. At the forest's edge, under a large cedar, the searchers found the visible remains of a small fire, along with the first two bodies, those of Krivonischenko and Doroshenko, shoeless and dressed only in their underwear. The branches on the tree were broken up to five metres high, suggesting that one of the skiers had climbed up to look for something, perhaps the camp. Between the cedar and the camp the searchers found three more corpses: Dyatlov, Kolmogorova and Slobodin, who seemed to have died in poses suggesting that they were attempting to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b> They were found separately at distances of 300, 480 and 630 metres from the tree.|$|E

2500|$|The Crown Collection {{works on}} display are also usually {{augmented}} with approximately 100 art pieces and antiques {{on loan from}} various museums, galleries, and private collections; this continues a tradition started in the 1930s, when the National Gallery lent pieces to the viceroy at the time, the Earl of Bessborough. Additionally, {{since the time of}} Clarkson's appointment, themed artistic exhibitions have been mounted at Rideau Hall, such as that during the tenure of Michaëlle Jean wherein the show [...] "Body and Land" [...] featured select silkscreen prints from the artist's book The Journals of Susanna Moodie by author Margaret Atwood and artist Charles Pachter. What had been praised during Clarkson's tenure, however, was soon critiqued when it was revealed that into Jean's appointment, Rideau Hall's interpretation and exhibition planner, Fabienne Fusade, was removing from sight the portraits of Canada's past and present sovereigns {{and other members of the}} Royal Family, in order to fulfill Jean's wish to make the royal residence a showcase for Canadian art and give [...] "a strong image of Canada"; the portrait by Jean Paul Lemieux of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh that had for decades dominated the focal wall of the ballroom was shifted to the rear wall, thereby bumping the copy of George Hayter's [...] that had hung there <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tent</b> Room, where the portraits of Canada's British governors general had been collected together. These moves and removals were criticised by the editorial board of the National Post, as well as other journalists, as having [...] "demoted and ghettoized" [...] history in order to [...] "siphon off the great symbolic power of the monarchy, to further [...] particular tastes and agendas," [...] noting that Rideau Hall should not be used [...] "primarily [...] an art gallery." ...|$|E
