5|$|Initially making only {{tentative}} forays onto land, tetrapods {{adapted to}} terrestrial environments {{over time and}} spent longer periods away from the water. It {{is also possible that}} the adults started to spend some time on land (as the skeletal modifications in early tetrapods such as Ichthyostega suggests) <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> the sun close to the water's edge, while otherwise being mostly aquatic.|$|E
5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They {{spend much of}} the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel them through the water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|The young may all hatch in {{a single}} night. Crocodilians are unusual among {{reptiles}} {{in the amount of}} parental care provided after the young hatch. The mother helps excavate hatchlings from the nest and carries them to water in her mouth. Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother. For spectacled caimans in the Venezuelan llanos, individual mothers are known to leave their young in the same nurseries, or cr√®ches, and one of the mothers guards them. Hatchlings of many species tend <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> a group during the day and disperse at nightfall to feed. The time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate with adults for one to two years, while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.|$|E

5|$|Dry land is also {{important}} as it provides opportunities for basking, nesting, and escaping from temperature extremes. Gaping allows evaporation of moisture from the mouth lining and has a cooling effect, and several species make use of shallow burrows on land to keep cool. Wallowing in mud can also help prevent them from overheating. Four species of crocodilians climb trees <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> areas lacking a shoreline. The type of vegetation bordering the rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians is mostly humid tropical forest, with mangrove swamps in estuarine areas. These forests are of great importance to the crocodilians, creating suitable microhabitats where they can flourish. The roots of the trees absorb water when it rains, releasing it back slowly into the environment. When the forests are cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, rivers tend to silt up, the water runs off rapidly, the water courses can dry up in the dry season and flooding can occur in the wet season. Destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than is hunting.|$|E

25|$|The school's origins are {{detailed}} in the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002-2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. Jool Noret of the ocean-covered planet Ginaz uses personal tragedy {{to make himself}} a fierce and innovative warrior, distinguishing himself in the ongoing war against the machine forces of Omnius in the Butlerian Jihad. Despite his reluctance <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> fame or accept students, young warriors flock to Ginaz for training; he concedes, and eventually his unique fighting style becomes an art in its own right. Ultimately, the mercenaries of Ginaz are considered the most elite warriors available outside the Imperial Sardaukar.|$|E
50|$|A {{feeling of}} {{involvement}} {{is also necessary}} for BIRGing to occur. It is frequently seen as a cognitive process that affects behavior. In Bernhardt's et al. (1998) study, researchers examined physiological processes related <b>to</b> <b>Basking</b> <b>in</b> Reflected Glory, specifically, changes {{in the production of}} endocrine hormones. Endocrine system Fans watched their favorite sports teams (basketball and soccer) win or lose. The men's testosterone levels increased while watching their team win, but decreased while watching their team lose. Thus, this study shows that physiological processes may be involved with BIRGing, in addition to the known changes in self-esteem and cognition.|$|R
25|$|Aside {{from direct}} catches, {{by-catches}} in trawl nets {{have been one}} of several threats <b>to</b> <b>basking</b> sharks. <b>In</b> New Zealand, <b>basking</b> sharks had been abundant historically, however, after the mass by-catches recorded in 1990s and 2000s, confirmations of the species became very scarce.

25|$|This {{butterfly}} frequents forest {{paths and}} streams. The male {{is fond of}} sun and avoids the shade. It frequents flowers especially of Mussaenda frondosa, Ixora coccinea, Jasminum species and Asystasia gangetica. Periodically raids thicker forest patches, especially where Atalantia species {{are to be found}} in search of females to mate with. Has a rapid unidirectional flight and frequently changes course, hopping up and down in its flight path. Difficult to catch. Known <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> the sun. Attracted to damp patch and has greater tolerance to other butterflies and humans while lapping up the mineral rich moisture. Known to visit animal droppings.|$|E
25|$|It is a diurnal species, {{but it can}} {{be found}} moving about and hunting at night as well. They are often found by turning over rocks within or near the brooks and streams they inhabit. They will also come out of the water <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> the sun, often {{perching}} on branches or roots above or near the waters edge. Queen snakes are very alert to any potential danger and will drop into the water when disturbed. They are rather docile snakes, not too likely to bite and can be easily handled. However, in doing so, one risks being polluted by malodorous feces and anal musk, similar to the behaviour of the garter snake in this defense.|$|E
25|$|Forest tent {{caterpillars}} are ectotherms so {{they rely}} on sources of heat from the environment to raise their body temperatures. In order to do this, they bask together and benefit from group thermoregulation. Elevating body temperature is essential in increasing metabolic rates for movement and food processing, so proper thermoregulation leads to an increased rate of development. This {{is very important for}} M. distria caterpillars, which rely on fast growth in spite of low environmental temperatures to benefit from the high food quality and the smaller predation risk in the spring. Thus, it is an adaptive advantage <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> groups. However, as caterpillars grow, thermoregulatory needs decrease and the benefit of group living is gradually overridden by other factors such as food competition.|$|E
50|$|The Southern California legless lizard {{is known}} <b>to</b> not <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> direct sunlight, {{and has a}} {{tolerance}} of low temperatures, allowing most of its activity to occur in cool conditions. It is also mostly active during {{the morning and the}} evening, their diet mainly subsisting on larval insects, beetles, termites, and spiders.|$|R
50|$|The seas by Peel {{are home}} <b>to</b> <b>basking</b> sharks <b>in</b> early summer (these are mostly {{harmless}} to humans - they don't bite). These sharks are seen occasionally {{from the land}} and more often from boats. Seals are often to be found around the breakwater by the castle. A variety of seabirds live and feed around the harbour, castle and headland.|$|R

25|$|Crocodilians {{are more}} closely related to birds and dinosaurs than to most animals {{classified}} as reptiles, the three families being included in the group Archosauria ('ruling reptiles'). Despite their prehistoric look, crocodiles are among the more biologically complex reptiles. Unlike other reptiles, a crocodile has a cerebral cortex and a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians also have the functional equivalent of a diaphragm by incorporating muscles used for aquatic locomotion into respiration. Salt glands are present in the tongues of crocodiles and they have a pore opening {{on the surface of the}} tongue, a trait that separates them from alligators. Salt glands are dysfunctional in Alligatoridae. Their function appears to be similar to that of salt glands in marine turtles. Crocodiles do not have sweat glands and release heat through their mouths. They often sleep with their mouths open and may pant like a dog. Four species of freshwater crocodile climb trees <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> areas lacking a shoreline.|$|E
25|$|One may {{reasonably}} {{maintain an}} average and acceptable temperature for the snake {{by the use}} of a heating element or infrared light bulbs. A gradient must be offered within the enclosure to allow the snake <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> the heat or go to cooler areas in the tank. Optimum humidity can be difficult to maintain and research must be done on the snake to determine the correct level. More than 80% humidity must be maintained for caging an anaconda species from the tropical region, while a slightly less than 30% humidity must be maintained for a species of a desert region. Photoperiods are often used with most species of snake; natural light is best for this, but low UV percentage bulbs can also be used. Captive anacondas have a reputation for unpredictability and aggression due to the temperaments of wild-caught specimens first collected for captive breeding, but with proper care, green anacondas can and do make for calm, relatively sedate pets. Due to their immense size and power however, proper respect and caution should always be maintained, and they are best left to experienced adult owners who can provide them with the proper requirements.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{species of}} snakes lay eggs which they abandon shortly after laying. However, a few species (such as the king cobra) {{actually}} construct nests {{and stay in}} the vicinity of the hatchlings after incubation.

500|$|During the spring, {{the wood}} turtle is active during the daytime (usually from about 7:00a.m. and 7:00p.m.) and will almost always be found within several hundred metres of a stream. The early morning and late {{afternoon}} are preferred foraging periods. Throughout this season, the wood turtle uses logs, sandy shores, or banks <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> sunlight. In {{order to maintain}} its body temperatures through thermoregulation, it spends {{a considerable amount of}} time basking, most of which takes place in the late morning and late afternoon. The wood turtle reaches a peak body temperature of [...] after basking. During times of extreme heat, it has been known to estivate. Several reports mention individuals resting under vegetation, fallen debris and in shallow puddles. During the summer, the wood turtle is considered a largely terrestrial animal. At night, its average body temperature drops to between [...] and it will rest in small creeks or nearby land (usually in areas containing some sort of underbrush or grass).|$|E

500|$|His task finished, Cutter {{leaves the}} theater and passes a {{stranger}} on the street. The stranger shoots Angier and reveals himself as Borden. Angier realizes that [...] "Alfred Borden" [...] is actually an identity assumed by twin brothers who took turns being Borden and Fallon; the twin who loved his hanged wife Sarah, {{and the one who}} loved the assistant Olivia. Fallon loved Olivia and is the more hot headed of the two brothers; he is the twin who, despite promising not to return to Angier's show, does so and is caught. Fallon, having exacerbated Sarah's depression which leads to her suicide, is the twin who is hanged. The surviving twin is Sarah's husband. Borden berates Angier for going too far in his quest for dominance. Angier explains that giving his audience a moment of wonder, and <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> their applause, was his great ambition. Angier dies as his fallen lantern sets the theater on fire. Borden picks up his daughter, Jess, at Cutter's workshop. A final glimpse of the burning theater shows what looks like the body of Angier in a water tank near the dead body.|$|E

500|$|American {{alligators}} play {{an important}} role in the restoration of the Everglades as biological indicators of restoration success. American alligators are highly sensitive to changes in the hydrology, salinity, and productivity of their ecosystems; all are factors that are expected to change with Everglades restoration. American alligators also may control the long-term vegetation dynamics in wetlands by reducing the population of small mammals, particularly coypu, which may otherwise overgraze marsh vegetation. [...] In this way, the vital ecological service they provide may be important in reducing rates of coastal wetland losses in Louisiana. They may provide a protection service for water birds nesting on islands in freshwater wetlands. American alligators prevent predatory mammals from reaching island-based rookeries and in return eat spilled food and birds that fall from their nests. Wading birds appear to be attracted to areas with alligators and have been known to nest at heavily trafficked tourist attractions with large numbers of American alligators, such as the St. Augustine Alligator Farm in St. Augustine, Florida. In addition to basking on shore, American alligators can and will climb trees <b>to</b> <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> if no shoreline is available. However, this is not often seen as the American alligators will retreat back into the water by jumping from their perch.|$|E
