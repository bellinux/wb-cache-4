5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> sent into exile. He helped <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn's {{internal}} records {{date from}} 1569, {{at which point}} there were four types of member; {{those who had not}} yet been called to the Bar, Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> called to the Bar but were still studying, Ancients were those who were called to the Bar and were allowed to practise and Readers were <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> called to the Bar, were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the Inns of Chancery and at Gray's Inn itself. At the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).|$|E

5|$|The Uprising and its {{repression}} caused {{trauma that}} continues to manifest in the Malagasy population. Many Malagasy nationals fought each other and struggle to reconcile themselves to the remorse and guilt. Healing {{at the national level}} is further {{complicated by the fact that}} the same leaders who proclaimed Madagascar's independence in 1960 were <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> major players in the PADESM political party, which had been favored by the colonial administration after the crushing of the revolt.|$|E
5|$|The {{change of}} {{government}} was welcome {{particularly to the}} senators, who had been harshly persecuted during Domitian's reign. As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters, Nerva publicly swore that no senators would {{be put to death}} as long as he remained in office. He called an end to trials based on treason, released <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> imprisoned under these charges, and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled.|$|E

5|$|Benedict Arnold {{continued}} on to Philadelphia, {{where he met}} with members of Congress about his rank. His action at Ridgefield, coupled {{with the death of}} Wooster due to wounds sustained in the action, resulted in Arnold's promotion to major general, although his seniority was not restored over <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> promoted before him. Amid negotiations over that issue, Arnold wrote out a letter of resignation on July 11, the same day that word arrived in Philadelphia, that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British. Washington refused his resignation and ordered him north to assist with the defense there.|$|E
5|$|For the {{commanding}} officers stationed on the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands campaign, attacking the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians was a logical continuation to recapturing Attu and Kiska. However, these officers faced resistance from their superiors in Washington and their {{troops on the}} ground. Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result of}} the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> on the island for more than six months. An American assault of the Kuriles never materialised.|$|E
5|$|In 1447 {{the local}} painter's guild elected Lochner as their {{representative}} municipal councilor, or Ratsherr. The appointment implies {{that he had}} lived in Cologne since at least 1437, as only <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> living in the city for ten years could take up the position. He had not taken up citizenship immediately, possibly to avoid paying the 12 guilder fee. He was obliged to act as Ratsherr, and on 24 June 1447 he became a burgher of Cologne. The role of municipal councilor could only be held for a one-year term, with two years vacated before reoccupation. Lochner was re-elected for a second term in the winter of 1450–51, but died in office.|$|E

5|$|In 1529 {{the king}} summoned Parliament {{to deal with}} annulment, thus {{bringing}} together those who wanted reform but who disagreed what form it should take; it {{became known as the}} Reformation Parliament. There were Common lawyers who resented the privileges of the clergy to summon laity to their courts; there were <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> influenced by Lutheran evangelicalism and were hostile to the theology of Rome; Thomas Cromwell was both. Henry's Chancellor, Thomas More, successor to Wolsey, also wanted reform: he wanted new laws against heresy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, gay bathhousesnow {{primarily}} gay-owned and operatedbecame fully licensed gay establishments which soon became major gay institutions. These bathhouses served as informal gay meeting places, places where friends could meet and relax. Gay bathhouses frequently threw parties for Pride Day and were usually open, and busy, on public holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, when some gay men, particularly <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> rejected {{by their families}} due to their sexual orientation, had nowhere else to go. The American writer Truman Capote was a regular at New York City baths in the 1970s, in particular the sauna at West 58th Street.|$|E

Leeds United {{installed}} a brass plaque in Elland Road to remember <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed in the violence.

5|$|As {{the ship}} was sinking, British destroyers steamed towards her {{in an attempt to}} rescue {{survivors}} from the water. However, the German zeppelin L5 mistook the sinking Blücher for a British battlecruiser, and tried to bomb the destroyers, which withdrew. Figures vary on the number of casualties; Paul Schmalenbach reported 6 officers of a total of 29 and 275 enlisted men of a complement of 999 were pulled from the water, for a total of 747 men killed. The official German sources examined by Erich Gröner stated that 792 men died when Blücher sank, while James Goldrick referred to British documents, which reported only 234 men survived from a crew of at least 1,200. Among <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> rescued was Kapitan zur See (captain at sea) Erdmann, the commanding officer of Blücher. He later died of pneumonia while in British captivity. A further twenty men would also die as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong's {{population}} recovered {{quickly after}} the war, as {{a wave of}} skilled migrants from the Republic of China moved in to seek refuge from the Chinese Civil War. When the Communist Party eventually took full control of mainland China in 1949, even more skilled migrants fled across the open border for fear of persecution. Many newcomers, especially <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> based in the major port cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou, established corporations and small- to medium-sized businesses and shifted their base operations to British Hong Kong. The establishment of a socialist state in China (People's Republic of China) on 1 October 1949 caused the British colonial government to reconsider Hong Kong's open border to mainland China. In 1951, a boundary zone was demarked as a buffer zone against potential military attacks from communist China. Border posts along the north of Hong Kong began operation in 1953 to regulate the movement of people and goods {{into and out of}} the territory.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Wałęsa quit Solidarity {{in protest}} of the union's support of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński—twin {{brothers}} who had been prominent in Solidarity and were now serving as the country’s president and prime minister, respectively. The main point of disagreement was the Kaczyńskis’ focus on rooting out <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> involved in communist rule and their party's attempt to make public all the files of the former communist secret police. Until then only members {{of the government and}} parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services. Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so-called transparency legislation advocated by the government might turn into a witch hunt and the more than 500,000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the communist secret police could face exposure.|$|E

5|$|Most of the Germans {{who were}} {{responsible}} for the operation of the camp were captured and brought to trial. Many of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> prominent German officials during the occupation of Serbia, including Turner, Fuchs and Meyszner, were extradited to Yugoslavia by the Allies after the war, where they were executed. Camp commander Andorfer managed to escape {{with the assistance of the}} Roman Catholic Church, which helped him flee to South America. He returned to Austria from Venezuela in the 1960s, and was subsequently apprehended and tried on the minor charge of being an accessory to murder—for which he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years imprisonment. Andorfer's deputy, Enge, was apprehended in the 1960s, and sentenced to one-and-a-half years imprisonment. His sentence was never carried out due to his old age and poor health. German guards suspected of executing Serbian prisoners were never tried, although they served as witnesses in several trials in West Germany.|$|E
5|$|Robert Ferrers, Earl of Derby, was {{singled out}} in {{particular}} for his central {{involvement in the}} rebellion, and for him the multiple was seven rather than five. The same {{was the case for}} Henry de Hastings, who was the commander of Kenilworth Castle. Those who had not taken part in the fighting themselves, but had incited others to rise up against the king, were fined at two years' value, while <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> compelled to fight, or played only a minor part, had to pay one year's value of their land.

5|$|Throughout July 1944, Goebbels and Speer {{continued}} to press Hitler {{to bring the}} economy to a total war footing. The 20 July plot, where Hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in East Prussia, played {{into the hands of}} <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> pushing for change: Bormann, Goebbels, Himmler, and Speer. Over the objections of Göring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort. Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service. However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer. Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.|$|E
