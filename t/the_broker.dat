The war provided the mafiosi with new opportunities for self-enrichment when the Italian Army requisitioned horses and mules in Sicily for the cavalry and artillery. Vizzini came to {{an agreement with the}} Army Commission to delegate the responsibilities to him. He collected a poll tax on the animals whose owners wanted to avoid requisition. He was also <b>the</b> <b>broker</b> for animals that were rustled for the occasion, buying at a low price from the hustlers and selling at market prices to the Army.|$|E

40|$|The article {{seeks to}} analyze the {{transaction}} of vegetables through wakâlah method in Krisik Village Ponorogo from Islamic legal perspective. Wakâlah requires four important elements: the person who gives a trust (muwakkil), the trustee (muwakkal or wakîl), the deed (muwakkal fîh), and the transaction statements (ijâb-qabûl). The transaction of vegetables in Krisik Village is done in an unusual way. In many areas, <b>the</b> <b>brokers</b> usually buy all farmers’ crops at once and pay for the farmers in-cash. In Krisik Village, <b>the</b> <b>brokers,</b> however, first of all, sell farmers’ vegetables into markets. <b>The</b> <b>brokers</b> will pay <b>the</b> farmers for their vegetables afterward. It means that <b>the</b> <b>brokers</b> do not pay for the farmers in-cash. It is also found that <b>the</b> farmers and <b>brokers</b> in Krisik Village make an uncommon agreement (‘aqd), in which they agree to reduce the scale. The practice seems to violate a number of Quranic verses, which ask people to enhance the scales. Such a practice of reducing scale has been a “common agreement” among the Krisik people for decades. On the one hand, the practice aims at preventing <b>the</b> <b>brokers</b> from loss, while on the other the farmers do not feel aggrieved from {{the reduction of the}} scale...|$|R
