5|$|In a 1993 paper, David Wonnacott, Barry J. Kellett and David J. Stickland {{identified}} {{this system}} as a candidate to evolve into a Type Ia supernova or a cataclysmic variable. At a distance of 150light years, this makes it the nearest known candidate supernova progenitor to the Earth. However, {{in the time it}} will <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> system to evolve to a state where a supernova could occur, it will have moved a considerable distance from Earth but may yet pose a threat.|$|E

Travelling {{a total of}} , the train uses the China Railways and the Trans-Mongolian line to travel from Xiangtan (in Hunan Province) to Ulaanbaatar, where it then {{continues}} north to the Trans-Siberian. After reaching {{the end of the}} Trans-Siberian at Moscow the train continues to Germany via rail links in Belarus and Poland. Total transit time is 15 days, as compared with the 30 days average it would <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> freight to make the same journey by ship. The first train of 50 containers, carrying a mixed load of clothes, ceramics and electronics (for the Fujitsu company), travelled on tracks operated by six different railways.|$|E
5|$|In September 2000, Warner Bros. and {{producer}} Lauren Shuler Donner hired writer-director Hype Williams {{to take the}} helm of the project. In October 2001, the studio hired screenwriters Christian Gudegast and Paul Scheuring for $1.2 million split between them to write a script for the film. Eventually, without production getting under way, the director and the writers left the project. In June 2004, Vince Vaughn spearheaded a revival of the project by presenting a <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film that would develop the characters more strongly. Vaughn was cast as Racer X and was also attached to the project as an executive producer. With production never becoming active, Vaughn was eventually detached from the project.|$|E

25|$|Andrade {{goes on to}} {{question}} whether or not Europeans would have developed large artillery pieces {{in the first place}} had they faced Chinese style walls so resistant to projectiles, coming to the conclusion that such exorbitant investments in weapons unable to serve their primary purpose would not have been ideal. Yet Chinese walls do not fully explain the divergence in gun development as European guns grew not only bigger, but more effective as well. By 1490 the European gun had achieved the basic form it would <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next three centuries, during which it would dominate the fields of warfare. The Classic Gun had arrived, and in the 1510s and 1520s when the Chinese encountered European firearms, they fully recognized they were superior to their own.|$|E
25|$|In Norden's {{version of}} the system, the bombardier first looked up the {{expected}} time it would <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bombs to fall from the current altitude. This time was set into a countdown stopwatch, and the bombardier waited for the target to line up {{with a set of}} iron sights {{at the front of the}} bombsight. When the target passed through the sights, the timer was started, and the bombardier then rotated the telescope around its vertical axis to track the target as they approached it. This movement was linked to a second sight through a gearing system that caused the second to move twice as fast as the first. The bombardier continued moving the telescope until the timer ran out. The second sight was now at the correct aiming angle, or range angle; the bombardier moved his eyes to look through this second set of sights to time the drop.|$|E

25|$|The 1979 {{season was}} Cheatle's last with Sussex. He made eight {{first-class}} appearances in that season, with six appearances {{coming in the}} County Championship. He took 21 wickets {{at an average of}} 22.23, with best figures of 6/32. One of two five wicket hauls he took in that season, these figures came against Yorkshire. He also made sixteen List A appearances in his final season, again spread over appearances in the Benson & Hedges Cup and John Player League, though he did not feature in the Gillette Cup. He took 17 wickets in these sixteen matches, which came at an average of 26.82, with best figures of 3/28. In total Cheatle made forty first-class appearances for Sussex, scoring 276 runs at a batting average of 12.54. With the ball, he took 77 wickets at an average of 31.28, with best figures of 6/32, one of four five wickets hauls he would <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> county. In List A cricket, he 183 runs at an average of 20.33, with a high score of 18 not out. With the ball, he took 44 wickets at an average of 24.70, with best figures of 4/33.|$|E
25|$|In May 2006, Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima {{announced}} that a film adaptation of Metal Gear Solid was in development. The film was purported to be in English, said to be released some time in 2011. Kojima also announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo later that month that he had negotiated a contract with a party in Hollywood to adapt the video game into a film. Kojima once {{said that he would}} like to see Hugh Jackman as Snake but he is also open to other up-and-coming actors to the role. Kojima also considered Alaska as the site of the film production, due to the game's setting in the state. David Hayter, the English voice actor for Solid Snake, had submitted his <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> movie but executives have passed on his script. Kojima also denied claims that German director Uwe Boll was a possible contender to direct a Metal Gear film. Producer Quentin Tarantino expressed interest in having Equilibrium director Kurt Wimmer write the script for the movie. Wimmer was also considered as potential director for the film. Konami's Aki Saito had commented that There Will Be Blood director Paul Thomas Anderson was interested, but producer Mike De Luca dismissed the claim.|$|E

It had to include the time required to assemble the fleet, prepare and provision its ships, and then [...] sally to Singapore. Initially, the estimate was 42 days, assuming reasonable advance warning. In 1938, it was increased to 70 days, with 14 more for reprovisioning. It was further increased in June 1939 to 90 days plus 15 for reprovisioning, and finally, in September 1939, to 180 days.|$|E

500|$|In {{an effort}} to keep the band focused, Godrich had them record A Moon Shaped Pool to tape with analog {{multitrack}} recorders. This added creative limits to the process, as rerecording a take meant first erasing the previous <b>take.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> introduction to [...] "Daydreaming", the band slowed the tape, creating a pitch-warping effect. Radiohead still used digital manipulation on many tracks; for example, Greenwood used the music programming language Max to manipulate the piano on [...] "Glass Eyes". Drummer Clive Deamer, who had performed with Radiohead on the King of Limbs tour and appeared on their 2011 double single [...] "The Daily Mail" [...] and [...] "Staircase", played additional drums on [...] "Ful Stop". Greenwood estimated that 80% of the album was recorded in two weeks.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack for Sonic R was {{composed}} by British composer Richard Jacques of Sega Europe, {{who had also}} previously worked on the soundtrack of the Sega Saturn and PC versions of Sonic 3D Blast. Work on the soundtrack began in March 1997 when Jacques travelled to Japan to meet with Sonic creator Yuji Naka to discuss the musical approach to <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game. The first song written was [...] "Super Sonic Racing," [...] which {{would be used for}} the game's reveal in June at E3. British singer TJ Davis provided the vocals for the song, which Naka liked so much that he requested that she be featured in all the game's songs. Jacques wrote all the lyrics for the songs with the intention that they would complement the on-screen action but still be appealing to someone who had never played the game. Tracks were recorded and programmed at Sega Digital Studios, and then worked on for two weeks at Metropolis Studios in London, where a week was spent on vocals, and a week was spent on producing, mixing, and finalising the tracks. Sonic R features two separate mixes of each song in its in-game soundtrack; ones with vocals and instrumental versions, giving the player the option to disable vocals. An official soundtrack CD was released on 21 January 1998.|$|E
500|$|The {{writers and}} {{producers}} got together {{to discuss what}} direction they would <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> seventh series. They wanted to repeat the same style for series six, which was to add a serial element to be carried throughout {{the duration of the}} series. They got together to think about what they would believe to be a big political story that would affect politics in the United Kingdom in within twelve to eighteen months after their initial meetings early in 2008. They settled on using Russia, which was facing a resurgence in power after the Cold War, which the producers felt, in subtle ways, would threaten the security of the west. Sometime through the writing process, the producers set up a story-arc, Sugarhorse, to be a threat throughout the series and have it resolved by the finale. The writers enjoyed making the Sugarhorse storyline because {{it was one of the}} instances that [...] "really brings Harry to the edge" [...] and causing him to doubt everything he has done or achieved. The writing team took several meetings together to discuss what it is and how it should work into the storyline. Christian Spurrier noted it was [...] "kind of a headache" [...] to figure out how to [...] "weave it in" [...] to the series and work out what parts would be used in which episodes. The producers wanted to use a scene relating to Sugarhorse as the finale scene of every episode it was featured in, as the producers believed it would provide a [...] "right hook" [...] to the audience. Adding the new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the characters should trust.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to several}} {{standard}} interpretations of quantum mechanics, microscopic phenomena are objectively random.

For example, if a single unstable atom is placed in a controlled environment, it cannot be predicted how long it will <b>take</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> atom to decay—only the probability of decay in a given time. Thus, quantum mechanics does not specify the outcome of individual experiments but only the probabilities. [...] Hidden variable theories reject the view that nature contains irreducible randomness: such theories posit that in the processes that appear random, properties with a certain statistical distribution are at work behind the scenes, determining the outcome in each case.|$|E
