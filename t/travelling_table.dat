He also introduced a scoring system within the game, and added ten more treasures to collect in addition to the five in Crowther's original version. His work expanded Crowther's game to approximately 3000 lines of code and 1800 lines of data. The data consisted of 140 map locations, 293 vocabulary words, 53 objects (15 treasure objects), <b>travel</b> <b>tables,</b> and miscellaneous messages. Like Crowther's original game, Woods' game also executed with all its data in memory, but required somewhat less core memory (42k words) than Crowther's game. Don Woods continued releasing updated editions through to at least the mid-1990s.|$|R
40|$|Travel {{time is a}} {{fundamental}} measure in transportation. Accurate travel-time prediction also {{is crucial to the}} development of intelligent transportation systems and advanced traveller information systems such as traffic monitoring, finding driving directions, ride sharing and taxi dispatching. The travel time of a vehicle is influenced by several factors that can bring to large difference between the standard travel time and the travel time in particular situations. These factors can depend from the vehicle itself, for example driver behaviour, and from external factors, such as traffic jams and weather. In this thesis, we realized a model that is able to generate accurate <b>travel</b> time <b>tables</b> for road segments depending {{on the day of the}} week and the time of the day. Initially GPS data from a car fleet is processed through a map matching algorithm in order to obtain the travel time records done by drivers on road segments of the city. Subsequently, a street categorization algorithm is realized to determine the average time required on each road segment of the city. In order to cope with the different amount of data depending on the road segment, a machine learning model and interpolation techniques are applied. The <b>travel</b> time <b>tables</b> generated are processed by two machine learning models in order to consider different weather conditions and driver’s behaviors that can influence the predicted travel time. Compared to other <b>travel</b> time <b>tables</b> provided by commercial competitors, our results show that the model created, with the inclusion of factors that can influence the predicted time, can significantly reduce both relative mean errors and root-mean-squared errors of predicted travel times. We demonstrate the feasibility of applying our model in travel-time prediction of fleet management system and prove that it performs well for traffic data analysis...|$|R

The objective of this work is to locate and characterize natural and induced fractures from the analysis of scattered waves recorded on 4 -D (time lapse) VSP data in order to optimize well placement and well spacing in these gas reservoirs. Using synthetic seismic data, we have previously shown {{that it is possible to}} characterize the quality of fracturing based upon the amount of scattering of seismic energy from hydraulic fractures. We show this concept applied to a field dataset from the Jonah Field in Wyoming. The time lapse (4 D) VSP data from this field are imaged with a migration algorithm using shot <b>travel</b> time <b>tables</b> derived from the first breaks of the 3 D VSPs and receiver <b>travel</b> time <b>tables</b> based on the microseismic and perf shot arrival times. We create images of the fracture planes through two of the hydraulically fractured wells in the field. The scattered energy shows correlation with the locations of the microseismic events and azimuthal scattering which is different from the azimuthal reflectivity of the reservoir. This gives us more confidence that we have separated the scattered signal from simple formation reflectivity.

40|$|Among the {{problems}} related to CTBT {{a very important role}} belongs to the calibration of the regional travel times (regional kinematic calibration). The success in solving this task would significantly improve the accuracy of the weak seismic event location by the system. The methods that are applied to perform this kind of calibration are assumed in the present paper. All these methods can be broken into two principal groups: methods for direct calibration and those utilizing the velocity model of the media that is to be developed in an intermediate stage. Direct methods are used to construct the time correction surfaces making use of previously learned seismological experience (regional <b>travel</b> time <b>tables)</b> or directly employing the experimental data. The first approach represents the try to perform the task through the linear combination of regional <b>travel</b> time <b>tables</b> (godographs) and their errors. Another technique is a kind of spatial interpolation of the regional observations for given station. Indirect methods solve the calibration problem in two steps. Initially the 3 -D velocity model of the media is being produced by the inversion of the observations. Afterwards the field of travel times is generated on the base of the velocity model. Methods inside the group differ depending upon what way is chosen for the reverse kinematic problem solution. Currently the velocity models are being built by “try-and-drop ” technique or by tomographic inversion. The tomographic P-models developed till now do not possess the horizontal resolution enough to b...|$|R

We also checked {{the difference between}} the theoretical phase readings from <b>travel</b> time <b>tables</b> for ISS Bulletin and also especially the original records which are not in the list of available readings. It has been possible to see the reliability of a station time by comparing the phases with the theoretical arrival times to see whether there are large clock bias, misidentification of the seismic phases, or typing mistakes and so on. We also compared the available seismic stations’ bulletins with the ISS Bulletin data.|$|R
40|$|Computing {{distance}} tables {{is important}} for many logistics problems like the vehicle routing problem (VRP). While shortest distances from all source nodes in S to all target nodes in T are time-independent, travel times are not. We present the first efficient algorithms to compute time-dependent <b>travel</b> time <b>tables</b> in large time-dependent road networks. Our algorithms are based on time-dependent contraction hierarchies (TCH), currently the fastest time-dependent speed-up technique. The computation of a table is inherently in Theta(|S|*|T|), and therefore inefficient for large tables. We provide one particular algorithm using only Theta(|S|+|T|) time and space, being able to answer queries two orders of magnitude faster than the basic TCH implementation. If small errors are acceptable, approximate versions of our algorithms are further orders of magnitude faster...|$|R
30|$|First of all, households’ {{socio-economic}} characteristics influence daily travel times and {{can thus be}} considered to be a determinant of intensive <b>travel</b> (<b>Table</b> 4). Our estimation results show that on average men’s hazard rate is 8.6  % lower than women’s (Cox model: β[*]=[*]− 0.089, hazard ratio[*]=[*] 0.914, p-value[*]<[*] 0.001) and that they also have a higher probability of intensive travel (logit model: β[*]=[*] 0.3212, odds ratio[*]=[*] 1.379, p-value[*]<[*] 0.001). Individuals of working age (over 15  years) have longer travel times than older people (aged 65  years and over) and a higher probability of being intensive travellers, whereas younger people (aged between 5 and 14  years) have lower daily travel times. The dummy variables for the cities impact daily travel times and the probability of intensive travel in the same direction. All else being equal, the daily travel time and the probability of intensive travel are the lowest in Rennes, which is the city in our sample that most favours car travel, buses providing the only public transport. In increasing order of daily travel times, there follows: Strasbourg, Grenoble, Brussels, Lyon, Bern, Geneva and Zurich. Individuals’ occupations also affect their daily travel time and their probability of intensive travel. Nonetheless, there are disparities between the countries (captured by the dummy variables that combine country and occupation 2). Workers in Belgium have longer daily travel times than French workers, while Swiss workers have shorter daily travel times than French workers. Conversely, the presence of {{children under the age of}} 12 in a household tends to reduce the daily travel time and the probability of intensive travel. Similarly, car-owning households tend to have shorter daily travel times and a lower probability of intensive travel.|$|R
40|$|Tight gas sand {{reservoirs}} generally contain thick gas-charged intervals {{that often}} have low porosity and very low permeability. Natural and induced fractures provide {{the only means}} of production. The objective of this work is to locate and characterize natural and induced fractures from analysis of scattered waves recorded on 4 -D (time lapse) VSP data in order to optimize well placement and well spacing in these gas reservoirs. Using model data simulating the scattering of seismic energy from hydraulic fractures, we first show {{that it is possible to}} characterize the quality of fracturing based upon the amount of scattering. In addition, the picked arrival times of recorded microseismic events provide the velocity moveout for isolating the scattered energy on the 4 -D VSP data. This concept is applied to a field dataset from the Jonah Field in Wyoming to characterize the quality of the induced hydraulic fractures. The time lapse (4 D) VSP data from this field are imaged using a migration algorithm that utilizes shot <b>travel</b> time <b>tables</b> derived from the first breaks of the 3 D VSPs and receiver <b>travel</b> time <b>tables</b> based on the microseismic arrival times and a regional velocity model.

30|$|To {{constrain}} aftershock locations using {{a single}} station, we estimate the backazimuth from the P-wave particle motion and the epicentral {{distance from the}} differential travel time of S- and P-wave, assuming a modified CRUST 2.0 layered velocity structure (Bassin 2000). The backazimuth of the event is determined by rotating the N-S and E-W component records to the radial and transverse components under the guiding principle that the best angle will minimize the P-wave energy on the transverse component (Jurkevics 1988; Niu and Li 2011). The epicentral distance {{is determined by the}} differential travel time of S- and P-wave with manually picked direct P- and S-wave arrival time (Additional file 1 : Figure S 5).

5000|$|Will Crowther was a {{programmer}} at Bolt, Beranek & Newman (BBN), {{and helped to}} develop the ARPANET (a forerunner of the Internet). Crowther and his wife Pat were experienced cavers, having previously helped to create vector map surveys of the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky in the early 1970s for the Cave Research Foundation. In addition, Crowther enjoyed playing the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons with a regular group which included Eric S. Roberts and Dave Lebling, one of the future founders of Infocom. Following his divorce from Pat in 1975, Crowther wanted to connect better with his daughters, and decided a computerized simulation of his cave explorations with elements of his role-playing games would help. He created {{a means by which}} the game could be controlled through natural language input so that it would be [...] "a thing that gave you the illusion anyway that you'd typed in English commands and it did what you said". Crowther later commented that this approach allowed the game to appeal to both non-programmers and programmers alike, as in the latter case, it gave programmers a challenge of how to make [...] "an obstinate system" [...] perform in a manner they wanted it to.Developed over 1975 and 1976, Crowther's original game consisted of about 700 lines of FORTRAN code, with about another 700 lines of data, written for BBN's PDP-10 timesharing computer. The data included text for 78 map locations (66 actual rooms and 12 navigation messages), 193 vocabulary words, <b>travel</b> <b>tables,</b> and miscellaneous messages. On the PDP-10, the program loads and executes with all its game data in memory. It required about 60k words (nearly 300kB) of core memory, which was a significant amount for PDP-10/KA systems running with only 128k words. Crowther's original version did not include any scorekeeping. Once the game was complete, Crowther showed it off to his co-workers at BBN for feedback, and then considered his work on the game complete, leaving the compiled game in a directory before taking a month off for vacation. During that time, others had found the game and it was distributed widely across the network, which had surprised Crowther on his return. Though titled in-game as Colossal Cave Adventure, its executable file was simply named ADVENT, which led to this becoming an alternate name for the game.|$|R

30|$|We {{investigate}} lateral {{variation of}} the upper mantle P-wave velocity structure in the western Pacific rim using travel times of P phases from regional shallow events. Onsets of direct and later arrivals are manually picked up from short-period waveforms at Matsushiro Seismic Array System in central Japan by consulting the correlation among the waveforms at seven array stations. For the path along Kurile and Alaska seismic zones, observed first arrivals of shallow events (d = 5 – 50 km) are well explained by a standard <b>travel</b> time <b>table</b> for Japan. Observations provide no strong evidence of a distinct low-velocity zone in the uppermost mantle, and triplicated branches are adequately explained by a slight modification of model 12 by Sugiyama and Nakanishi (1989, 1999). Observed travel times of direct P phases from events along the eastern and western Philippine Sea are slightly larger at around 15 ° and slightly smaller at around 25 °, and the upper mantle is slower and the transition zone and uppermost lower mantle faster in the eastern and western Philippine Sea than in the northwestern Pacific.

The complexity of Lg waveforms makes it difficult to consistently determine a unique Lg arrival time, thus affecting source location with a single station or array.

The duration of the section is fixed to be 40.96  s. We also cut out another successive 40.96  s record section as a coda part to compare its spectral characteristics to the S-wave part. After the extraction of these two record sections, we calculate their Fourier spectra and then take a spectral ratio of root-mean-square (RMS) values of two horizontal components {{with respect to the}} vertical component to obtain the earthquake horizontal-to-vertical ratio (EHVR hereafter). Once all the records are analyzed, then we calculate the average of all the EHVRs to obtain the average and the average ± one standard deviations. The average operation here is not the one that the theory of the diffuse field suggests (Sánchez-Sesma et al. 2011; Kawase et al. 2011), in which the average of the normalized spectra for each component should be calculated first and then a ratio between horizontal and vertical components are taken. The reason why we calculate the ratio first is because we would like to check the range of variation of EHVRs for different earthquakes. We confirmed that the averaged EHVRs for these two different ways of calculation are almost the same to each other.|$|R
