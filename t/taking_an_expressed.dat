Photographs made by film exposure usually contain much information which may be crucial long after the photograph was taken. They can readily be digitised by scanning, and then enlarged to show the detail needed for new analysis. For example, controversy has raged {{for a number of}} years over the cause of the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879 when a half-mile section of the new bridge collapsed in <b>a</b> storm, <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> <b>express</b> train down into the estuary of the river Tay. At least 75 passengers and crew were killed in the disaster.|$|R

At her father's prompting, she later obtained a second degree in Law at Harvard University. She returned to Hong Kong and began practising law in the 1960s and was senior partner of the Liu, Chan & Lam law firm. Liu declared her pro-Beijing convictions during the 1967 Leftist riots, although she disagreed with the terrorist tactics of the Leftists. Liu was <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> risk by <b>expressing</b> her pro-Beijing sympathies as the colonial government and most of the public were anti-Communists.|$|R

40|$|Automobile use {{leads to}} {{external}} {{costs associated with}} emissions, congestion, noise and other impacts. One option for minimizing these costs is to introduce road pricing and parking charges to reduce demand for single occupant vehicle (SOV) use, while providing improvements to alternatives to encourage mode switching. However, {{the impact of these}} policies on urban mode choice is uncertain, and results reported from regions where charging has been introduced may not be transferable. In particular, revealed preference data associated with cost recovery tolls on single facilities may not provide a clear picture of driver response to tolls for demand management. To estimate commuter mode choice behaviour in response to such policies, 548 commuters from a Greater Vancouver suburb who presently drive alone to work completed an individually customized discrete choice experiment (DCE) in which they chose between driving alone, carpooling or <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> hypothetical <b>express</b> bus service when choices varied in terms of time and cost attributes. Attribute coefficients identified with the DCE were used in a predictive model to estimate commuter response to various policy oriented combinations of charges and incentives. Model results suggest that increases in drive alone costs will bring about greater reductions in SOV demand than increases in SOV travel time or improvements in the times and costs of alternatives beyond a base level of service. The methods described here provide an effective and efficient way for policy makers to develop an initial assessment of driver reactions to the introduction of pricing policies in their particular regions.

The key reasons espoused by students include <b>an</b> <b>expressed</b> dissatisfaction with mathematics, the opinion that there are other more viable courses of study to pursue, and that the Australian Tertiary Admissions Ranking (ATAR) can be maximised by <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> lower mathematics course.

In <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> union with a left-wing leadership and a section with 80 per cent membership with <b>an</b> <b>expressed</b> willingness to escalate industrial action, the article tests Hyman's 1979 contention that, rather than a concentration on a bureaucratic caste, a much better explanation for conservatism centres on the nature of social relations within the union that encompass a wider layer of representatives...|$|R

The song is a vast departure {{from the rest of the}} album, featuring Ocean gently singing in the style of Stevie Wonder. Ocean speaks a contemplative poem about the transitory mystery of love, with the song serving as an intermission from the more aggressive style of the album. The song is followed by [...] "Hcapd", with heavy synths played over Left Brain's verses about horror-related topics. Taco and Jasper Dolphin appear on the comical track [...] "We Got Bitches", another absurdist parody composition. The song has <b>a</b> chaotic beat, <b>taking</b> influence from punk rock and rave music. Braggadocio rapping is prominent on the track, with the crew screaming the chorus [...] "We got bitches, we got diamonds, we got cars, we got jacuzzis," [...] adding [...] "and yo’ bitch be on my dick!" [...] The album closer is [...] "Oldie", where Earl Sweatshirt makes his first rapping appearance in over a year. The song is a 10-minute track featuring, in order of appearance on the song, Taco, Tyler, Hodgy Beats, Left Brain, Mike G, Domo Genesis, Frank Ocean, Jasper Dolphin and Earl Sweatshirt, with Tyler closing the song with another verse. The song features the collective's blending of eccentricity and rebellion, and each rapper <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> verse to <b>express</b> their own topics of interest lyrically.|$|R
