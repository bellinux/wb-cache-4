He gained his A-licence, which allowed him to coach in the professional game, and he took up coaching at Ossett Town. He and John Beresford then set up an unsuccessful wooden flooring company called 'Major Oaks'. The pair then developed a football training product called 'BallMax', Alex Ferguson used it in the Manchester United Academy, but <b>this</b> <b>business</b> also went nowhere. Billy Jennings then took the pair on as football agents at Premier Management International for a twelve-month period. Northampton Town manager Martin Wilkinson then took Swan on as a coach, but soon after Colin Calderwood took over as manager in 2003 Swan found himself again out of work. Swan instead found success in the building trade, constructing a house in his expansive back garden. He also found work as an 'expert witness' for Hull City's games at BBC Radio Humberside in 2003.

5|$|In late 1940, a southerly bypass of {{downtown}} Battle Creek opened. U.S. Highway12 (US12) was rerouted out {{of downtown}} to follow Columbia Avenue. The former route was redesignated Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12). In 1958 or 1959, {{a section of}} the route of Bus. US12 was split onto a one-way pairing of streets through downtown Battle Creek. On December 7, 1959, the southern I-94/US12 bypass of Battle Creek was dedicated and opened to traffic. The former routing of US12 along Columbia Avenue was turned over to local control and the route of Bus. US12 was extended via Michigan Avenue easterly and M-78 (Capitol Avenue) southerly to connect to the new freeway. Later the next year, <b>this</b> <b>business</b> loop was redesignated BL I-94. When the first segment of I-194 opened in 1961, BL I-94/M-78 was rerouted to follow the freeway. In 1964, the western end of the business loop was realigned to follow Dickman Road west to Fort Custer and south along Skyline Drive to I-94. The next year, as I-194 was completed and M-78 was replaced by an extended M-66, BL I-94 was rerouted through the downtown area. From Dickman Road, BL I-94 followed I-194/M-66 north {{to the end of the}} freeway at Hamblin Avenue and turned along Hamblin to Michigan Avenue via Jay Street. A minor realignment in 1970 shifted the connection between Hamblin and Michigan avenues. The one-way setup through downtown was removed in 1984. M-96 and M-37 were extended in 2000, running concurrently between Skyline Drive and the Helmer Road intersections. M-89 replaced part of M-37 but did not follow the latter's routing to I-994/M-66 near downtown. Then in 2008, BL I-94 was removed from the northern segment of I-194/M-66 freeway and rerouted to follow Dickman Road to Main Street back to Hamblin Avenue.|$|E
