2500|$|A large {{contribution}} to <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>is</b> {{due to the}} closure and suspension of thousands of banks across the country. The causation of these failing financial institutions come from several reasons including unregulated lending procedures, confidence in the Gold standard, consumer confidence in future economics, and agricultural defaults on outstanding loans. With these compacting issues the banking system struggled {{to keep up with}} the high demand of cash withdraws from the public. This impact overall decreased the money supply and forced the banks to result to short sale (real estate) and liquidation of existing loans. In the race to liquidate assets the banking system began to fail on a wide scale. In November 1930 the first major banking crisis begun with over 800 banks closing their doors by January 1931; over 2100 banks will be suspended by October 1931, with the highest suspension rate recorded in the St. Louis Federal Reserve District with 2 out of every 5 banks suspended. The economy in whole experienced a massive reduction in banking footholds across the country amounting to more than nine thousand closed banks by 1933.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} a study of a {{business}} <b>recessions.</b> On <b>the</b> ground of the actual financial crisis, which has broad international influence, many questions about possibilities of efficient solutions of <b>the</b> economic <b>recessions</b> have <b>been</b> opened. In the economics history is possible to find many examples of business recessions and more or less successful solution methods.

50|$|Endaka was {{tipped off}} again in 2008. The yen {{moved from the}} {{floating}} near 120 to floating near 90. This {{is thought to be}} the first time endaka contributed to a worldwide recession, instead of just a Japanese recession. While the proximate cause of <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>is</b> widely thought to be an increase in credit defaults (largely outside Japan) causing a loss in confidence in the credit markets (a credit crisis), the yen was funding these investments through the carry trade, where loans were made at near zero interest rates in yen to finance the purchase of non-yen debts which had higher interest rates. As the value of the yen increased, the trillions of dollars' worth of carry trade buildup over years swiftly reversed in a matter of days, and there was pressure to sell these assets to cover the more expensive yen loans, thus decreasing the available credit and accelerating the crisis. By 2011, the yen had touched 81.1129 per USD.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{values the}} option of a firm to {{downscale}} production in recessionary times. The regulator allows downscaling {{as long as the}} recession lasts. The end of <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>is</b> modelled via a Poisson process. We show that the disinvestment timing is affected by two contrary effects. First, when the probability increases that the recession will be over soon, the firm will disinvest sooner, because after <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>is</b> over the downscale option no longer exists. Second, the firm will downscale later because the expected future revenue stream increases when the recession will be over sooner. As a result the disinvestment trigger is non-monotonic in the intensity of the Poisson process. The second effect dominates when <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> <b>is</b> expected to last long. We also study the disinvestment problem in case there is a risk of bankruptcy due to lack of available funds in the credit market. It is shown that the optimal disinvestment threshold is the same as when there is no bankruptcy risk. This threshold, however, may not be appropriate due to the bankruptcy threshold. 1...|$|E
