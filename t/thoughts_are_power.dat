We carry out detailed stellar evolution calculations for the first generation stars including annihilation energy of dark matter (DM) particles. We show that very massive stars, as massive as 104 M⊙, can be formed in an early DM halo. Such stars are extremely bright with Log L/L ⊙> ∼ 8. 2. They will gravitationally collapse to form IMBHs.

Finally, we discuss a possible scenario of the accretion process in more realistic situations, which cannot be simulated by our code.

Even if these sources are misidentified distant clusters, they would lie above the apparent rich cluster radio/X-ray luminosity relation in the literature, suggesting that detections of radio halos and relics thus far may be more biased than previously thought.

Here we report on X-ray timing observations of the magnetar 1 E 2259 + 586 which we show exhibited a clear "anti-glitch" [...] a sudden spin down. We show that this event, like some previous magnetar spin-up glitches, was accompanied by multiple X-ray radiative changes and a significant spin-down rate change.

The amount of Faraday rotation (rotation measure) is proportional to the integral of the magnetic field strength along the line of sight times the density of electrons.

This is the tightest upper limit for the magnetic field around a black hole to date. We use the magnetic field limit to derive {{an estimate of the}} mass accretion onto the central black hole.
