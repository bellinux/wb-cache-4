5|$|Some of {{the main}} puppet cast to feature in the film, such as Scott Tracy, were re-made from the {{original}} marionettes, while previously unseen characters such as the Zero-X astronauts, Cliff Richard and the bandmembers of The Shadows were sculpted especially. Whereas guest star puppets for Series One had been recycled for each appearance and moulded in Plasticine, since {{this was the first}} occasion when puppets in an AP Films production were intended to represent real-life celebrities, most of the supporting puppets were made from fibreglass to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>standards</b> of workmanship as the main puppets.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{was split}} into two types - a class for heavier {{agriculture}} and driving horses and a class for lighter racing and riding horses. In 1875, the Norwegian Trotting Association was formed by enthusiasts of the second type. In 1902, the first Dole Gudbrandsdal stud book was published, containing stallions from both types born between 1846 and 1892. In 1903, the Norwegian Trotting Association split their registration between purebred Norwegian trotters and trotting crosses. At the same time, standards for entry were tightened and the first inspection committee was created. In 1965, the Norwegian or Dole Trotter studbook {{was taken over by}} the Norwegian Trotting Association, as part of the new Coldblood trotter program approved by the Norwegian Ministry for Agriculture. The Dole Trotter studbook is still coordinated with the original Dole Gudbrandsdal registry, and horses have to meet many of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>standards.</b> The Dole Trotter is alternately considered a subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed.|$|E

5|$|In October 2007, Time Magazine ran {{an article}} condemning the V-22 as unsafe, overpriced, and {{completely}} inadequate; the Marine Corps responded {{by arguing that}} parts of the article's data were dated, obsolete, inaccurate, and reflected expectations too high for any new field of aircraft. In 2011, it was reported by the controversial defense industry supported Lexington Institute that the average V-22 mishap rate per flight hour over the past 10 years was {{approximately half of the}} average accident rate for the USMC fleet; the V-22's accident rate was the lowest of any Marine rotorcraft. In 2011 Wired Magazine reported that the safety record was achieved by excluding ground incidents; the USMC responded that MV-22 reporting was to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>standards</b> as other aircraft in the Department of the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} or seizures {{are typically}} denied a pilot license. In Canada {{if an individual}} has had {{no more than one}} seizure, they may be considered after five years for a limited license if all other testing is normal. Those with febrile seizures and drug related seizures may also be considered. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration does not allow those with epilepsy to get a commercial pilot license. Rarely, exceptions can be made for persons who have had an isolated seizure or febrile seizures and have remained free of seizures into adulthood without medication. In the United Kingdom, a full national private pilot license requires <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>standards</b> as a professional driver's license. This requires a period of ten years without seizures while off medications. Those who do not meet this requirement may acquire a restricted license if free from seizures for five years.|$|E

25|$|Anti-nuclear {{activists are}} accused of {{encouraging}} radiophobic emotions among the public. The War Against the Atom (Basic Books, 1982) Samuel MacCracken of Boston University argued that in 1982, 50,000 deaths per year could be attributed directly to non-nuclear power plants, if fuel production and transportation, as well as pollution, were taken into account. He argued that if non-nuclear plants were judged by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>standards</b> as nuclear ones, each US non-nuclear power plant could {{be held responsible for}} about 100 deaths per year.|$|E
40|$|In G. A.

Since different qualities sell under <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>standard,</b> <b>the</b> potential for lemons exists if buyers cannot identify different qualities. The authors' theoretical and empirical models suggest seller characteristics signal quality to buyers, and buyers pay premiums to firms with these characteristics. Thus, cherries are not lemons.
