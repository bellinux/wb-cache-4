25|$|Gashing is a {{machining}} process used <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> coarse pitched gears and sprockets. It {{is commonly used}} on worm wheels before hobbing, but also used on internal and external spur gears, bevel gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of worm wheels. After gashing the gear or sprocket is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|E
25|$|A hard hammerstone {{would first}} be used <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> {{the shape of}} the tool from the stone by {{removing}} large flakes. These large flakes might be re-used to create tools. The tool maker would work around the circumference of the remaining stone core, removing smaller flakes alternately from each face. The scar created by the removal of the preceding flake would provide a striking platform for the removal of the next. Misjudged blows or flaws in the material used could cause problems, but a skilled toolmaker could overcome them.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at furthering our {{knowledge}} about the historical and economic dynamics of quarrying, production, transport and trade of the Berici Hills soft stone in ancient times. To do this, we have examined the published data relating <b>to</b> <b>roughed</b> <b>out</b> stone artefacts found in 1982 in the Bacchiglione River (Cervarese Santa Croce, Padua, Italy). Thanks to petrographical analysis on thin sections of stone samples recently taken from them it has been possible {{to find out that}} the architectural elements (blocks, columns and capitals) are made of pietra di Costozza and that the finds belonged to a ship sailed from the quarries of the Berici district and wrecked during its way to a unknown city of Northern Italy...|$|R

2500|$|Carson {{described}} the Nexus energy ribbon {{as the true}} villain of the film; ILM was responsible for conceiving what the ribbon would look like with no natural analog. [...] "When creating something from scratch, it's always important <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> the whole thing [...] {{because there are so}} many paths you can explore, it's easy to get bogged down," [...] recalled effects co-superviosr Alex Seiden, who had worked as a technical director on the [...] from The Undiscovered Country. Knoll decided the ribbon was a rip through universes, filled with chaotic energy, taking inspiration from images he had seen of magnetic fields around Uranus from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory simulation. The airfoil-shaped core of the undulating ribbon was enhanced with electrical tendrils. To sell the ribbon's vastness in space shots where no sense of scale would be available, Seiden and George created a debris field of embers that trailed the ribbon.|$|E
60|$|The {{sounds of}} keen {{activity}} stirred Festing's blood. He had {{a touch of}} constructive genius, but lack of specialized training had forced him {{into the ranks of}} the pioneers. Others must add the artistic finish and divide the prizes of ultimate victory; his part was <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> the work and clear the way. But he was satisfied with this, and something in him thrilled as he heard in the crash of a blasting charge man's bold challenge to the wilderness. Kerr waited with a twinkle of understanding amusement while Festing looked about, and then took him up the hill.|$|E
5000|$|Another key moment {{occurred}} in 1988, when, having long {{been working on}} Strat and Chatto by Jan Mark he found that after his [...] "early drawings in pencil/charcoal were rejected as too sophisticated," [...] and he felt that pencil-work often suffered from printing techniques he experimented in improving his pen and ink style. [...] "Submitting a rough pen and ink drawing to Pentagram", he found that they [...] "chose {{to use it as}} a finished piece" [...] as the cover to a book by Don Marquis entitled [...] "Archy and Mehitabel". In late 1989, [...] "he was invited by The Observer magazine to produce drawings for a topical weekly medical column, [...] "A Doctor Writes" [...] by Dr. John Collee," [...] first as one of a number of rotating artists, but soon as the solo, regular weekly artist.

60|$|When {{they reached}} the lake he found {{there would be some}} delay. They had covered the canoes with branches, but the pine-needles had {{withered}} off and the hot sun had opened the seams. Some of the thin planks were badly split, one had sprung away from its fastenings, and it would take a few days to repair the damage without proper tools. The caulking composition he had brought would not go round, and he had to send the Metis into the bush to look for gum to make the Indian pitch. Then it cost him a day's hard labor <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> new plans with an ax and saw, and he afterwards found he must make a steaming-box to soften the wood so that it would bend into place.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{location of}} the La Cobata head was not a major archaeological site {{and it is likely}} that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination. Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished, such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base. Rock was not removed from around the earspools as on other heads, and does not narrow towards the base. Large parts of the monument seem <b>to</b> be <b>roughed</b> <b>out</b> without finished detail. The right hand earspool also appears incomplete; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief, probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished. The La Cobata head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne.|$|R

50|$|After {{one year}} of {{surveying}} possible routes in the Upper Skagit River region, the State Road Commission concluded in 1896 that the Skagit gorge was not a practical route. Instead, the commission settled upon the Cascade Pass route, several {{miles south of the}} Skagit gorge. The Cascade Pass route began <b>to</b> be <b>roughed</b> <b>out</b> in 1897 and shortly afterward, state highway maps showed the road as either State Highway 1 or the Cascade Wagon Road. In the following years, floods on the Cascade River took out most of the work completed on the road and led Washington's first State Highway Commissioner to report in 1905 that almost all the money appropriated for the road had been wasted. After these unsuccessful attempts to build a northern cross-mountain highway, the state designated that a highway be built along the Methow River from Pateros to Hart's Pass, high above Eastern Washington's Methow Valley. This road was completed in 1909.|$|R

50|$|Sarcophagi {{production}} of the Ancient Roman Empire involved three main parties: the customer, the sculpting workshop that carved the monument, and the quarry-based workshop that supplied the materials. The distance between these parties was highly variable due to the extensive size of the Empire. Metropolitan Roman, Attic, and Asiatic were the three major regional types of sarcophagi that dominated trade throughout the Roman Empire. Although they were divided into regions, the {{production of}} sarcophagi was {{not as simple as}} it might appear. For example, Attic workshops were close to Mount Pentelikon, the source of their materials, but were usually very far from their client. The opposite was true for the workshops of Metropolitan Rome, who tended <b>to</b> import large, <b>roughed</b> <b>out</b> sarcophagi from distant quarries in order to complete their commissions. Depending on distance and customer request (some customers might choose to have elements of their sarcophagi left unfinished until a future date, introducing the possibility of further work after the main commission), sarcophagi were in many different stages of production during transport. As a result, it is difficult to develop a standardized model of production.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis letter {{considers}} {{the problem of}} detecting and characterizing a target buried beneath a rough surface separating two homogeneous half spaces. The problem of detecting the target is tackled by analyzing the frequency-averaged Wigner-Ville function, the purpose of which is <b>to</b> filter <b>out</b> <b>rough</b> surface scattering. Characterization of the target is performed using the iterative solution derived from the Newton-Kantorovitch algorithm as applied to the Wigner-Ville function instead of the scattered field as is usually done. In addition, the scattering model involved in the inversion scheme assumes a flat interface, and surface roughness is handled as clutter. The efficiency of the approach is illustrated through numerical experiments, and the comparison between inversions from the scattered field and the Wigner-Ville function is reported...|$|R

5000|$|Lithic {{reduction}} {{involves the}} use of a hard hammer percussor, such as a hammerstone, a soft hammer fabricator (made of wood, bone or antler), or a wood or antler punch to detach lithic flakes from a lump of tool stone called a lithic core (also known as the [...] "objective piece"). As flakes are detached in sequence, the original mass of stone is reduced; hence the term for this process. Lithic reduction may be performed in order to obtain sharp flakes, of which a variety of tools can be made, or <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> a blank for later refinement into a projectile point, knife, or other object. Flakes of regular size that are at least twice {{as long as they are}} broad are called blades.

50|$|Most {{traditional}} carpets {{begin with}} a layer of undyed sawdust spread in a wood frame <b>to</b> smooth <b>out</b> <b>rough</b> surfaces such as stone paved streets and then sprayed with a light coating of water. Sometimes other materials such as sand are used for the base. Then the designs are laid over top. On smooth streets and other surfaces, the design can be drawn in chalk and filled in with the coloring materials. There are two ways to create the design, with the use of molds or stencils and freehand, sprinkling and placing the colored material. Freehand takes longer and requires more skill with the use of molds allowing for very defined and complicated designs. After the carpet is finished, it received a very light spray of water to affix the sawdust in place and keep the colors from fading.|$|R
