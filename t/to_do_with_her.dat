While still a student, Wong came down with an illness identified as St. Vitus's Dance which caused her to miss months of school. She was on the verge of emotional collapse when her father took her to a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. The treatments proved successful, though Wong later claimed this had more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> dislike of the methods. Other Chinese thought such as Confucianism and particularly Taoism and the teachings of Laozi had a strong influence on Wong's personal philosophy throughout her life. The family's religious life also included Christian thought, in the form of Presbyterianism and as an adult she was a Christian Scientist for some time.|$|E

Although nothing came of these plans, and Blount had little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> son's upbringing, the fact that she was the mother of such an important child made her an object of interest to many of her contemporaries.|$|E
