40|$|During an Extravehicular Activity (EVA), the {{astronaut}} s metabolic {{heat and the}} heat produced by the Portable Life Support Unit (PLSS) must be rejected. This heat load is currently rejected by a sublimator, which vents up to eight pounds of water each EVA. However, for advanced space missions of the future, water venting to space needs to be minimized because resupply impacts from earth will be prohibitive. If this heat load could be radiated to space from the PLSS, which has enough surface area to radiate most of the heat, {{the amount of water}} now vented could be greatly reduced. Unfortunately, a radiator rejects heat at a relatively constant rate, but {{the astronaut}}s generate a variable heat load depending on how hard they are working. Without a way to vary the heat removal rate, the astronaut would experience cold discomfort or even frostbite. A proven method allowing a radiator to be turned-down is to sequentially allow tubes that carry the heat transfer fluid to the radiator to freeze. A drawback of current freezable radiators using this method is that they are far to heavy for use on a PLSS, because they use heavy construction to prevent the tubes from bursting as they freeze and thaw. This creates the need for a large radiator to reject most of the heat but with a lightweight tube <b>that</b> <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> burst as it freezes and thaws. The new freezable radiator for the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) has features to accommodate the expansion of the radiator fluid when it freezes, and still have the high tube to fin conductance needed to minimize the number and weight of the tubes. Radiator fluid candidates are water and a propylene glycol-water mixture. This design maintains all materials within their elastic limits so that large volume changes can be achieved without breaking the tube. This concept couples this elastic expansion with an extremely lightweight, extremely high conductivity carbon fiber fin that can carry the heat needed to thaw a frozen tube. By using most of the exposed surface area of the PLSS as a radiator, the system can reject about 75 % of the highest heat load, and reduce the loss of water through sublimation by a factor of four. The proposed radiator and a small water tank can be no heavier than the current system...|$|R

Para tanto, debruçamo-nos sobre o programa televisivo norte-americano South Park, uma animação que se dedica a caricaturálas. Trabalhamos com a hipótese de que o ídolo é um simulacro que não resiste à profanação do humor. Nesse sentido, tomamos como {{principal}} referencial teórico-investigativo os conceitos de dispositivo e profanação de Giorgio Agamben, para quem a caricatura presente nos cartoons desvela o caráter humano e ordinário do ídolo, removendo o véu da fantasia que o sacraliza. Mas mobilizamos também, como outros operadores conceituais, o real lacaniano, uma vez que, por definição, ele não se deixa desprender nem do imaginário nem do simbólico e também a noção de sujeito cínico, conforme desenvolvido por Slavoj i ek, o que nos leva a elaborar uma outra hipótese, a de que o engajamento na modalização profanatória do programa pode não ocorrer em razão justamente dessa recepção cínica por parte de sua audiência. O corpus selecionado para análise constitui-se de 71 episódios de 22 minutos de duração, selecionados dentre mais de 200 do referido programa, exibidos entre 1997 e 2011 e também o longa-metragem, South Park: maior, melhor e sem cortes (1999). A seleção recorta principalmente os episódios que se prestam particularmente ao que se pretende demonstrarThe {{reason of}} this research is studying the contemporary and social construction of the celebrities as well as the role that it exerts at the mediatic civilization. Therefore we focused on the American TV show South Park, an animation that is dedicated at caricature them. We worked with the hypothesis that the idol is a simulacrum <b>that</b> <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> resist to humor desecrate. In order to do that we adopted as the main investigative theorist reference the concepts of dispositive and profanation from Giorgio Agamben s philosophy, to whom the caricature present on the cartoons reveals the human and ordinary character of the idols, taking off the phantasy veil which sacralizes it. But we also mobilize as other conceptual operators the lacanian real, once that by definition he doesn´t let himself lose from the imaginary as well as the symbolic and cynical subject notion, as developed by Slavoj i ek, which takes us to elaborate another hypothesis, the one that the engaging at the modalization defiler of the show might not occur because of the cynical reception of its audience. The corpus selected to analysis constitutes of 71 episodes of 22 minutes duration selected among more than 200 of the previously mentioned TV show, aired between 1997 and 2011, as well as the feature film South Park: bigger, better and uncut (1999).

The exploding number of Internet users, andmassive increase in Internet content consumption forces carriers to constantlyupgrade and transform their core networks {{in order to}} cope with the trafficgrowth. The choice of both physical components and transport protocols inthe core network is crucial in order to provide satisfactorily performance. Data traffic in the core network consists {{of a wide variety of}} protocols. OTN is a digital wrapper technology, responsible for encapsulating existingframes of data, regardless of native protocol, and adding additional overheadfor addressing, OAM and error control. The wrapped signal is thentransported directly over wavelengths in the optical transport network. Thecommon OTN wrapper overhead makes it possible to monitor and controlthe signals, regardless of the protocol type being transported. OTN is standardized by the ITU through a series of recommendations,the two most important being ITU-T G. 709 - "Interfaces for the OpticalTransport Network", and ITU-T G. 872 - "Architecture of the Optical TransportNetwork". OTN uses a flexible TDM hierarchy in order to provide highwavelength utilization. The TDM hierarchy makes it possible to performswitching at various sub-wavelength bit rates in network nodes. An introduction to OTN and an overview of recent progress in OTNstandardization is given in the thesis. An OTN switch which utilizes theflexible multiplexing hierarchy of OTN is proposed, and its characteristics istested in a network scenario, comparing it to the packet switched alternative.

40|$|Being offsite {{is based}} on a {{fieldwork}} in India over six months among IT professionals in the offshore outsourcing industry in Mumbai. In this industry a distinction between onsite and offsite is created, where onsite refers to the American or European offices on the one side and offsite refers to the Indian offices on the other side as well as these offices respective employees. The aim of the thesis is to explore what these distinctions mean to the IT professionals in their daily lives working with onsite colleagues and clients. The aim of the project is also to challenge the idea <b>that</b> place <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> matter anymore with our time s borderless technology that enables communication and co-operation among IT professionals over long distances. In the offshore outsourcing industry distance does matter, however it is the cultural distance between the onsite and offsite that is given the accountability of the challenges that may be faced when outsourcing to India. Efforts of assisting a more efficient co-operation between Western IT professionals and Indian IT professionals by building bridges between the two groups are thus made to develop a cross-cultural understanding at the office. However, many of these cross-cultural trainings - as well as the discourses about outsourcing to India - focuses mainly on the problem of Indian culture in the IT industry. Indian culture thus becomes something that the Indian professionals must unlearn in order to become successful IT professionals, as the Indian culture {{is considered to be a}} potential obstacle to an efficient and successful co-operation between onsite and offsite. As being offsite becomes a distance to the West in the offshore outsourcing industry measured by on, near and off in a geographical sense, I argue that offsiteness also may be measured as a distance to the West in a social, economical and cultural sense. This distinction between onsite and offsite further contributes to create a perception of India as an offsite place, not just considering the country s geographical distance to the West, but also it s place in the world as a periphery to the centralized West. I further argue that the distinction between onsite and offsite as a relative distance to the West transcends into the daily lives of the IT professionals as associations with offsiteness and onsiteness are made in their spatial movements through varying degrees of on and off in their working environment, as well as in their daily lives. In comparison to the community outside these onsite zones the Indian IT professionals are more onsite, as they are closer to the West. In comparison to their onsite colleagues visiting the offsite offices however, the IT professionals are always offsite...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis investigates {{different}} stochastic {{methods for}} estimating the extreme response on a jack-up platform in the North Sea. The extreme response of jack-ups is often heavily affected by dynamics and thus dynamic effects must be accounted for. In this thesis the Equivalent Dynamic Amplification Factor (EDAF) has been calculated based on time domain simulations of sea states {{decided by the}} Environmental Contour Method. A metocean report was created based on 57 years of hindcast data of the Ekofisk-field, {{with a focus on}} finding the extreme sea states and waves. The long-term variation of the environment is described by the joint probability distribution of significant wave height (Hs) and spectral peak period (Tp). The environmental contour lines in the Tp-Hs plane have been constructed based on their annual probability of exceedance. Estimates for the 100 and 10 000 year largest crests and wave heights were found using their respective Forristall distributions. These results are used as input for the extreme response analyses. For structures acting quasi-statically it is common practice to estimate the extreme response by using the Design Wave Method. Previously the Stoke 5 th wave was designed based on the extreme wave height, but using the extreme crest with the same return period gives larger responses. The crest height should therefore be the deciding parameter of the Design Wave Method. Long-term analysis of the dynamic response based on an all sea states approach has been illustrated and conducted using time domain simulations in the nonlinear finite element program USFOS. The extreme response for deck displacement, base shear and overturning moment was calculated based on annual probabilities of exceedance of 10 - 2 and 10 - 4. The focus of the thesis has been on using the Environmental Contour Method to calculate the extreme (Gumbel) distribution for both static and dynamic response. The EDAFs and the α-percentiles were found by comparing the Gumbel distribution with the responses of the Design Wave Method and the Long-Term Analysis. The time domain simulations in USFOS are based on linear (Airy) wave theory and Wheeler stretching is used to account for wave kinematics up to the free surface. By comparing the static time domain simulations with Stokes 5 th regular waves in USFOS, the results show <b>that</b> Wheeler stretching <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> adequately account for higher order wave kinematics and hence cannot correctly predict the extreme response. This means that second order wave theory should be used for drag-dominated structures such as jack-ups in regard to extreme response estimation...|$|R

O referencial teórico utilizado foi o da psicanálise freudiana e lacaniana e de outros autores contemporâneos que estabelecem o diálogo entre a Psicanálise e o Direito. Trata-se de um trabalho exploratório, no qual foram realizadas entrevistas semi-estruturadas com juristas, psicólogos e assistentes sociais que atuam em casos da disputa da guarda de crianças, no Fórum da cidade de Fortaleza. Foram entrevistados 09 profissionais, sendo 03 juristas, 03 psicólogas e 03 assistentes sociais. A análise e discussão dos resultados foi realizada a partir do diálogo entre as falas trazidas pelos participantes da pesquisa e os teóricos pesquisados. Foi possível verificar que não há garantias de que o princípio do melhor interesse da criança será cumprido ao término dos processos judiciais. Ainda, foi observado que os profissionais têm diferentes entendimentos a respeito do que seria o melhor interesse da criança em casos da disputa de sua guarda. Estes enfatizaram a importância da atuação interprofissional, para subsidiar o juiz a tomar a decisão que atenda o melhor interesse da criança em questão. Porém, por vezes, o melhor interesse da criança não é cumprido, pois os pais, por estarem interessados em ganhar, podem esquecer que quando um deles ganha quem pode vir a perder é a criança, que pode responder sintomaticamente a angústia causada pelo litígio, podendo gerar um conflito de grandes proporções.

The analysis and quarrel of the results were the dialogue between the participants of the dissertation and the searched theoreticians. It was possible to verify <b>that</b> it <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> have guarantees of that the interest of the child will be guaranteed to the ending of the actions at law. Still, it was observed that the professionals have different agreements regarding what would be the interest of the child in cases of the dispute of its guard. These had emphasized the importance of the interprofissional performance, to subsidize the judge to make the decision that takes care of best interest of the child in question. However, by times, best interest of the child is not preserved, by the parents because their interest is earning, and they can forget that when one of them wins the child loses, also the child can symptomatically answer the anguish caused for the litigation, generating a conflict of big ratios.

Objectives: The {{aim of this}} thesis is to analyze a didactic interaction between a teacher and a student, group of students or the whole class, during school skiing lessons in lower secondary education. We distinguish lower secondary education at grammar school and at basic school and we compare those two groups. Methods: In this thesis a method of modified analysis of didactic interaction was used, which was applied while analysing skiing courses. The results were {{used to compare the}} didactic interaction between teacher and student, teacher and group and teacher and class. Results: We found out that the development of didactic interaction <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> depend on the age of students. Then we found out that the proportion of practical training is higher among older pupils and we discovered descending level of thematic content and teaching activity during the lessons in both groups.

Two theoretical roads are traveled {{for the construction of}} that purpose. The first is based on the reference to the Theory of the Social Representations and the second to the Theory of the Action. The argument that sustains the purpose is that both theories base the content analysis as method of analysis for the social actors declared speech. Initially it is accomplished a theoretical rising of authors who described the content analysis and theories and later is developed an analysis of some dissertations that made of the method in the research process in Post Graduation s Program in Administration of the Federal University of Lavras. It is important to understand that, the non-discussion on the other theories that embrace the theme <b>doesn</b> <b>t</b> reduce your importance. social representations, theory of the action, content analysis, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods,...|$|R

This paper reports the evaluation outcomes from thirteen classes taught by volunteer parent educators using the Discipline <b>That</b> <b>Doesn</b> 2 ̆ 7 t Hurt! parenting series (Ladd, 1995). Data were gathered on 117 parents of whom 41 did not complete the classes. A final sample of 26 males and 46 females did complete the six week brief intervention parenting series aimed at building parent decision-making skills in addressing problem behaviors in their family system. This evaluation analyzed the scores of participants across three levels of problem- solving strategies: linear (one-dimensional), relationship (two-dimensional), and systems (three-dimensional). Parents who typically named one factor or person as the way to resolve the problem behavior were identified as using a linear approach to problem solving. Parents who were identified as using a relationship approach to problem solving typically applied information that involved a relationship between two people or environmental factors. Systems answers included information across three dimensions of the family system such as time of day, noncustodial parent, school experiences, and the child being hungry. Thisevaluation found that parents used significantly more complex decision-making strategies {{at the end of}} the six week Discipline <b>That</b> <b>Doesn</b> 2 ̆ 7 t Hurt! series when pre and post test evaluation scores were compared. These results indicate clearly that parents who completed the six classes did learn to apply more complex decision-making strategies that are based on child development information, parental values, and systems information through a short intervention training course. A second comparison analyzed gender differences on pre and post test scores for the three individual items. Significant differences for gender were found on two of the three evaluation items. No further conclusions could be made in this study, but gender differences will be a focus of future research. This evaluation study supports the use of the Discipline <b>That</b> <b>Doesn</b> 2 ̆ 7 t Hurt! parenting series as a brief intervention curriculum to teach more complex problem-solving strategies to parents of children ages one through 14 years old...|$|R

Product layout is extracted from an input image {{by means of}} unsupervised recurring pattern detection and matched via graph matching, with the expected product layout specified by a planogram to measure the level of compliance.

Recurring patterns are detected in each region, respectively, and then merged together to estimate the product layout...|$|R
