40|$|Amodiaquine (AQ) and <b>tebuquine</b> are 4 -aminoquinoline antimalarials with Mannich base {{side chain}} and are highly {{effective}} against chloroquine (CQ) -resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Clinical use of AQ has been severely restricted due to hepatoxicity and agranulocytosis side effects associated with its long term use. Lysosomal accumulation and bioactivation to generate reactive quinoneimine metabolite are implicated {{to be the}} cause of the observed AQ toxicities. To avoid the quinoneimine formation and thus the toxicity, a series of isotebuquine analogues and their Nω-oxides with hydroxy group meta to the amino rather than in para position of the aniline moiety were prepared. The new Mannich bases are highly active against both CQ-sensitive (D 6) and -resistant (W 2 and TM 91 C 235) clones of P. falciparum with IC 50 in the range of 0. 3 - 120 ng/mL. New compounds are 1000 -fold less toxic (IC 50 = 0. 7 - 6 μg/mL) to mouse macrophage cell line than to parasite cell lines. Mono-Mannich bases are more active than bis-Mannich bases. Mono-Mannich base 1 a (IC 50 = 0. 3 ng/mL) is 20 -fold more active than the corresponding trifluoromethyl analogue 1 b. No appreciable difference in either toxicity or efficacy were observed between the new Mannich bases (m-hydroxyaniline derivatives) 1 a or 2 a and the corresponding p-hydroxyaniline derivatives...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{antimalarial}} agent amodiaquine {{has been}} curtailed due to drug-induced idiosyncratic reactions. These {{have been attributed to}} the formation of a protein-reactive quinoneimine species via oxidation of the 4 -aminophenol group. Therefore, the effects of chemical modifications on the disposition of amodiaquine in relation to its metabolism, distribution, and pharmacological activity have been investigated. The inclusion of a group at the C- 5 ′ position of amodiaquine reduced or eliminated bioactivation, as determined by glutathione conjugate formation in vivo. This can be seen in two series of C- 5 ′-substituted compounds: the bis-Mannich antimalarial agents, including cycloquine and pyronaridine, and mono-Mannich antimalarial agents containing a 5 ′-chlorophenyl group (<b>tebuquine</b> and 5 ′-ClPAQ). Chemical substitution at the C- 5 ′ position also resulted in compounds which underwent slower elimination (< 5 % of the dose excreted into bile and urine, compared with 50 % for amodiaquine) and increased levels of accumulation in tissue (10 % of the dose in the liver at 48 h compared with 1 % with amodiaquine). This may be due to an increase in either the lipophilicity or the basicity of the analogs and may reflect the lack of metabolic clearance for these compounds. The alteration in the disposition following the introduction of the C- 5 ′ substituent resulted in an increased duration of antimalarial activity in the mouse compared with that for amodiaquine. While this is desirable in the treatment of malaria, repeated administration for prophylaxis may induce toxicity through accumulation. Therefore, by simple chemical modification it is possible to block the bioactivation of amodiaquine while maintaining and in some cases extending the duration of antimalarial activity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tebuquine</b> is a 4 -aminoquinoline {{that shows}} {{significantly}} more potency as an antimalarial than amodiaquine and chloroquine both in vitro and in vivo. To explore the conformation in the rate-limiting step and to elucidate pharmacophoric properties of tebuquine-related analogues, molecular shape analysis (MSA) along with molecular field analysis (MFA) methods were applied {{on a series}} of 5 -[(7 -chloro- 4 -quinolinyl) amino]- 3 -[(alkylamino) methyl][1, 1 ¢-biphenyl]- 2 -ol analogues and their Nö-oxides possessing antimalarial activity. The study was performed using 45 compounds in which 37 molecules were taken as a training set for the derivation of the 3 D quantitative structure-activity relationship models and eight molecules were kept as a test set to evaluate the predictive ability of the derived models. Both methods were analyzed in terms of their predictive abilities and produced comparable results with good conventional and cross-validated r 2 values (0. 908 and 0. 886, respectively, for the MFA model and 0. 846 and 0. 812, respectively, for the MSA model). In external data set prediction, the MSA model scored much better than MFA. Steric, electrostatic, and hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor fields of molecules were found to be relevant descriptors for structureactivity relationships. The inclusion of polar solvent-accessible charged surface area and spatial descriptors in the MSA model generation resulted in a model with significant predictive ability for the test set molecules. This indicates the importance of the orientation of conformationally favored molecules inside the receptor site and solvation of the charged surfaces of the molecule by a polar solvent for the activity of the molecule. The results provided the appropriate tools for predicting the affinity of related compounds using a ligandbased approach, and for guiding the design and synthesis of novel and more potent antimalarial agents...|$|E
