5|$|Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U.S. 373 (1976), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> did {{not have the right to}} assess a tax on the {{property}} of a Native American (Indian) living on tribal land absent a specific Congressional grant of authority to do so.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{scholars}} divided inference {{into three}} types. The {{first is the}} expression of the connection existing between one proposition and another without any specific effective cause. Next, inference could mean presumption <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of things, which is not proved to have ceased, still continues. The final type of inference is the authority as to the revealed laws previous to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Sac & Fox Nation, 508 U.S. 114 (1993), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that absent {{explicit}} congressional direction to the contrary, it must be presumed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>State</b> does not have jurisdiction to tax tribal members who live and work in Indian country, whether the particular territory consists of a formal or informal reservation, allotted lands, or dependent Indian communities.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>State</b> is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E
5|$|Madison argued <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>state,</b> after declaring {{a federal}} law unconstitutional, could take action by {{communicating}} with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention. Madison did not assert that the states could legally nullify an objectionable federal law or that they could declare it void and unenforceable. By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison tried {{to make clear that}} the Democratic-Republicans were not moving toward disunion.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} day, Medvedev ordered Russia's government agency devoted to consumer protection, Rospotrebnadzor, to ban all sales of non-food items {{with more than}} 25 percent alcohol. Their order came into effect on 26 December and was scheduled to run for one month before being extended for a further 60 days in January; the restrictions did not cover perfumes and glass-cleaning products. Further restrictions were possibly considered, with one top health official announcing <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> monopoly may be imposed on Russia's perfume and pharmaceutical industries.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} effect of state personal and corporate tax rates on firm location at the 2 -digit SIC level. Using a random effects model on a data set of 14000 observations, the present study finds <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>state's</b> personal tax rate has a negative effect on firm location but <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>state's</b> corporate tax rate has no statistically-significant effect on firm location. These results suggest that the locational decision of a firm is affected more by the impact that high personal taxes will have on the manager's and/or owner's income than by the negative impact of high corporate tax rates on firm profits. ...|$|R

5|$|Von Neumann was {{the first}} to {{establish}} a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, known as the Dirac–von Neumann axioms, with his 1932 work Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics. After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics. He realized, in 1926, <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of quantum mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as linear operators acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.|$|E
5|$|For {{his victory}} over L'Insurgente, Truxtun {{received}} honors {{both at home}} and abroad. When accounts of the action reached London, Truxtun was fêted by the merchants there who sent him a piece of silver plate to commemorate his victory. In the United States, morale soared upon hearing of the first American victory over the French. Truxtun was cited by Stoddert for his excellent conduct during the action, and songs and poems such as Brave Yankee Boys were later written about the event. In contrast, when Barreaut returned to France he was accused of failing to put up sufficient resistance in the engagement and was given a court-martial. Despite the accusations, he had been praised by Truxtun after the action for his bravery and was acquitted during the court-martial. The French were infuriated upon hearing the results of the action because the two countries were not officially at war; Governor Edme Étienne Borne Desfourneaux of Guadeloupe demanded that Insurgent be returned to French control. Upon learning of the American refusal to repatriate Insurgent, Desfourneaux was outraged and ordered all American vessels and property to be seized, while also declaring <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of war existed between the United States and Guadeloupe. After continuing their cruise for a few weeks, both Insurgent and Constellation were forced to return to Norfolk by the end of March due to the expiration of the terms of enlistment of their crews. On her next cruise Constellation prevailed in another action against La Vengeance, although her own casualties were heavy this time, and that French frigate escaped L'Insurgentes fate.|$|E

40|$|A crucial {{issue in}} the debate on state support for higher {{education}} is the extent <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>state?s</b> production of college graduates affects the state?s education attainment. The view that many new graduates take their state-supported degrees to labor markets in other states undermines states? incentives to promote wider access to college. This study offers reasons to be skeptical of this view, and develops a simple framework to quantify the intrastate labor-market effects from the production of new college graduates. Data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System and the Current Population Survey are used to quantify the effects of new graduates on states? net migration, employment, unemployment, labor force non-participation, and wages of college graduates. The results indicate <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>state?s</b> production of college graduates has a nearly proportionate impact on the state?s college attainment...|$|R
