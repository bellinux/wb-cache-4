5000|$|Based on size, {{morphology}} and plumage, {{this species}} {{is believed to}} be a close living relative of <b>the</b> extinct <b>Carolina</b> parakeet, possibly <b>the</b> closest, though that has not been confirmed by molecular phylogenetics [...] which found the nanday parakeet to be <b>the</b> <b>Carolina</b> parakeet's closest living relative among the species tested. The plumage of this bird, is very close to that of <b>the</b> <b>Carolina's</b> and can be distinguished from <b>the</b> <b>Carolina</b> parakeet by having a yellow neck and shoulders, and a black beak instead of a buff-colored beak as <b>the</b> <b>Carolina</b> parakeet has.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of Helene recurving away from the United States East Coast, damage in the United States outside of <b>the</b> <b>Carolinas</b> was less severe. In Virginia, damage was {{relatively}} minor. A peak gust of 56mph (90km/h) was reported in Norfolk. In Hampton Roads, damage was minor, and was confined to downed utility wires and marginal infrastructural damage. Although rainfall was primarily concentrated in <b>the</b> <b>Carolinas,</b> 1,434official rain gauges measured precipitation in coastal areas from South Carolina to Maine. Precipitation was further increased by a frontal zone to the hurricane's north. In the Mid-Atlantic States, rainfall peaked at 5.29in (134.4mm) in Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Outside of Pennsylvania or <b>the</b> <b>Carolinas,</b> no weather station reported rainfall exceeding 5in (125mm). In the New England region, rainfall peaked at 4.11in (104.4mm) in Hyannis, Massachusetts. Elsewhere in Massachusetts, rainfall totals ranging from 1–4in (25–100mm) caused minor flooding and road washouts. The minor floods led to several automotive accidents. Other states in New England reported rainfall peaks of at least 1in (25mm), with the lowest peak occurring at a weather station in Machias, Maine, which reported 1.16in (29.5mm) of rainfall.|$|E

5|$|Shrimpers in <b>the</b> <b>Carolinas</b> blamed high {{fuel prices}} and the {{disruption}} of Tropical Storm Tammy {{for some of the}} troubles facing the shrimping industry in 2005.

5|$|As {{it moved}} northward, Jeanne {{continued}} to drop moderate to heavy rainfall, including over 7inches (175mm) in southern Georgia. A cold front {{across the region}} caused the depression to accelerate northeastward, combining moisture from the Gulf of Mexico with cool and stable air over <b>the</b> <b>Carolinas.</b> This combination produced severe thunderstorms across the region, spawning six tornadoes in Georgia, eight in South Carolina, and eight in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Fearing a major {{hurricane}} strike, coastal locations from Florida to Virginia performed extensive preparations {{in advance}} of the storm. In addition to tropical cyclone watches and warnings, about 950,000people were evacuated from <b>the</b> <b>Carolinas,</b> and the military evacuated and relocated hundreds of aircraft and vessels from the storm's projected path.

5|$|Hurricane Cindy {{impacted}} <b>the</b> <b>Carolinas,</b> the Mid-Atlantic states, New England, and the Canadian Maritime Provinces {{during the}} 1959 Atlantic hurricane season. The third storm of the season, Cindy originated from a low-pressure area {{associated with a}} cold front located east of northern Florida. The low developed into a tropical depression on July 5 while tracking north-northeastward, and became Tropical Storm Cindy by the next day. Cindy turned westward because of a high-pressure area positioned to its north, and further intensified into a weak hurricane {{off the coast of}} <b>the</b> <b>Carolinas</b> on July 8. Early on July 9, Cindy made landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina, and re-curved to the northeast along the fall line as a tropical depression. It re-entered the Atlantic on July 10, quickly restrengthening into a tropical storm while it began to move faster. On July 11, Cindy passed over Cape Cod, while several other weather systems helped the storm maintain its intensity. Cindy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on July 12 as it neared the Canadian Maritime Provinces.|$|E

5|$|On May 20, Charles Cornwallis {{arrived at}} Petersburg with 1,500 men after {{suffering}} heavy casualties at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse.

5|$|Sherman {{began his}} Civil War career {{serving in the}} First Battle of Bull Run and Kentucky in 1861. He served under General Ulysses S.

In 1864, Sherman succeeded Grant as the Union {{commander}} in the western theater of the war. He proceeded to lead his troops to the capture of the city of Atlanta, a military success that contributed to the re-election of Abraham Lincoln. Sherman's subsequent march through Georgia and <b>the</b> <b>Carolinas</b> further undermined the Confederacy's ability to continue fighting.
