Research in the geosciences is also based on university partnerships/companies notably with the Federation of research applied to petroleum engineering (IPRA), consisting of teams of research CNRS/University of Pau and the Pays de l'Adour (UPPA) and Total (the IPRA represents 130 teachers, researchers and beneficiaries, {{an annual budget of}} 1.5million euros and six scientific Masters). Research and engineering in the geosciences are also present through specialised companies (CGG, Paradigm Geophysical, TTI, VERITAS, etc.) implanted, for the most part, {{on the site of the}} Hélioparc <b>technopole</b> and specialised training centres (IFP Training, NExT-Schlumberger, Wellstaff, Baker Hughes, etc.).|$|E
25|$|In 2014, 74.6 {{percent of}} the city's {{businesses}} were involved in trade, transport and services; 16.2 percent in administration, education and health; 5.4 percent in construction, and 3.7percent in industry. Although industry is less significant {{than it was before}} the 1970s, Nantes is France's second-largest centre for aeronautics. The European company Airbus produces its fleet's wingboxes and radomes in Nantes, employing about 2,000 people. The city's remaining port terminal still handles wood, sugar, fertilizer, metals, sand and cereals, ten {{percent of the}} total Nantes–Saint-Nazaire harbour traffic (along the Loire estuary). The Atlanpole <b>technopole,</b> in northern Nantes on its border with Carquefou, intends to develop technological and science sectors throughout the Pays de la Loire. With a business incubator, it has 422 companies and 71 research and higher-education facilities and specialises in biopharmaceuticals, information technology, renewable energy, mechanics, food production and naval engineering. Creative industries in Nantes had over 9,000 architectural, design, fashion, media, visual-arts and digital-technology companies in 2016, a 15-percent job-creation rate between 2007 and 2012 and have a hub under construction on the Isle of Nantes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{critically}} analyses {{the recent}} fad for using <b>technopoles</b> and as key economic growth drivers stimulating innovation dynamics in particular territories. Conceptualising <b>technopoles</b> as “knowledge community precincts” creating science-park style benefits, we characterise these benefits as creating proximity between participants. Studying a typical science city, Kennispark in Eastern Netherlands, we discover that geographical proximity {{is much less}} important than social, cognitive or institutional proximity to Kennispark academics. The paper argues that local dimension to <b>technopoles</b> requires further analysis, and policy should focus on embedding local firms more actively in technopoles’ knowledge communities...|$|R

The authors of that book stressed the importance of careful planning and staying power when creating <b>technopoles,</b> pointing to the waste that can result when their creators can be too gung-ho. Hence, any analysis of the intervening two decades must present a balanced view. In this new book, an international team of contributors look at the continuing development of <b>technopoles,</b> both from the theoeretical and policy perspective, with a strong body of evidence from Asia – China and Taiwan in particular have been quick to mimic the model. The result points the way forward for these parks, with recommendations as to their appropriate formation and governance...|$|R

The paper is a companion piece {{to a recent study}} of the aircraft and parts industry in the same region (Scott and Mattingly, 1989). Together, these two papers provide an empirical foundation for further investigations of the growth of high technology industry in Southern California. This growth has been especially stimulated by federal spending for defense purposes. The defense-oriented manufacturing complex that has evolved in the region in the post-War decades is locationally organized within a series of specialized industrial districts (or <b>technopoles)</b> scattered across the entire landscape. Within these <b>technopoles</b> we typically find bifurcated local labor markets and intense local interlinkage of individual manufacturing establishments forming a transactions-intensive system of production...|$|R
