5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E

Through him, <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the office was renewed and its political position made secure. His tomb in Pumbedita was a place of worship as late as the 12th century, according to Benjamin of Tudela.|$|E

(ll.174–176). The Old Man warns that although Aleko loves the Gypsy life, this feeling may not last forever, and tells {{a story of a}} man that he knew who spent his entire life with the Gypsies but who eventually pined for his homeland and asked to be buried there. (ll.181–216). This is thought to be a reference to the Roman poet Ovid, who was banished to Tomis in 8AD.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere {{within the}} Vatican, Bernini created {{systematic}} rearrangements and majestic embellishment of either empty or aesthetically undistinguished space that exist as he designed {{them to the}} present day and have become indelible icons of <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the papal precincts. Within the hitherto unadorned apse of the basilica, the Cathedra Petri, the symbolic throne of St Peter, was rearranged as a monumental gilded bronze extravagance that matched the Baldacchino created earlier in the century. Bernini's complete reconstruction of the Scala Regia, the stately papal stairway between St. Peters's and the Vatican Palace, was slightly less ostentatious in appearance but still taxed Bernini's creative powers (employing, for example, clever tricks of optical illusion) to create a seemingly uniform, totally functional, but nonetheless regally impressive stairway to connect two irregular buildings within an even more irregular space.|$|E

When the most formidable Kipchak chief, Bachman, fled to {{an island in the}} Volga delta. Möngke crossed the river and captured him. When he ordered Bachman to bend down on his knees, Bachman refused and was executed by Möngke's brother Bujek. Möngke also engaged in hand-to-hand combat during the Mongol invasion of Rus'. While his cousins, Shiban and Büri, went to Crimea, Möngke and Kadan, a son of Ögedei, were ordered to reduce the tribes in the Caucasus. The Mongols captured the Alan capital Maghas and massacred its inhabitants. Many chiefs of the Alans and Circassians surrendered to Möngke. After the conquest of Europe, Möngke would bring them back to Mongolia. He also participated in the Siege of Kiev (1240). Möngke was apparently taken by <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> Kiev and offered the city surrender, but his envoys were killed. After Batu's army joined Möngke's soldiers, they sacked the city. He also fought alongside Batu at the Battle of Mohi. In the summer of 1241, before the premature end of the campaign, Möngke returned home after his uncle Ögedei recalled him in the winter of 1240–41. However, Ögedei died.|$|E

500|$|Light {{became a}} popular means for 15th-century Northern {{painters}} {{to represent the}} mystery of the Incarnation, utilising the idea of light passing through glass without shattering it to convey the paradox of conception and [...] "virgo intacta". This is reflected in a passage attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux from his [...] "Sermones de Diversis"; [...] "Just as the brilliance of the sun fills and penetrates a glass window without damaging it, and pierces its solid form with imperceptible subtlety, neither hurting it when entering nor destroying it when emerging: thus the word of God, <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the Father, entered the virgin chamber and then came forth from the closed womb." ...|$|E

500|$|Light was {{associated}} with Mary and the Incarnation from the 9th century. Millard Meiss notes that, from the 12th century a common way to convey the conception was to compare light passing through glass {{to the passage of}} the Holy Spirit through the body of the Virgin. St. Bernard likened it to sunshine explaining in this passage: [...] "Just as the brilliance of the sun fills and penetrates a glass window without damaging it, and pierces its solid form with imperceptible subtlety, neither hurting when entering nor destroying when emerging; thus the word of God, <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> the Father, entered the virgin chamber and then came forth from the closed womb." ...|$|E

The Campbell's Soup Can series, along with his other series, provided him {{with a chance to}} express his positive view of modern culture. However, his deadpan manner endeavored to be devoid of emotional and social commentary. The work was intended to be without personality or individual expression. Warhol's view is encapsulated in the Time magazine description of the 'Slice of Cake School,' that [...] "... a group of painters have come to the common conclusion that the most banal and even vulgar trappings of modern civilization can, when transposed to canvas, become Art." ...|$|E

On his visit to Portugal, he negotiated a treaty of friendship and commerce with Hawaii that would provide a legal framework for the emigration of Portuguese [...] laborers to Hawaii. The King had an audience in Rome with Pope Leo XIII and met with many of the crowned heads of Europe.

Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com disagreed, however, saying that the art [...] "represents a step back from <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> Final Fantasy XIII". The music received mixed reviews; Parish said that the music was great, applauding the unique styles, but Simon Parkin of Eurogamer felt that the music [...] "suffers from a lack of coherent direction", and tracks often failed to match their scenes.

500|$|... 16th-century Poland {{was officially}} a [...] "republic of nobles", and the [...] "middle class" [...] of the nobility (individuals {{at a lower}} social level than [...] "magnates") formed the leading {{component}} during the later Jagiellonian period and afterwards. Nonetheless, members of the magnate families held the highest state and church offices. At that time, the szlachta in Poland and Lithuania was ethnically diversified and represented several religious denominations. During this period of tolerance, such factors had little bearing on one's economic status or career potential. Jealous of their class privilege ("freedoms"), the Renaissance szlachta developed a sense of public service duties, educated their youth, took keen interest in current trends and affairs and traveled widely. While the Golden Age of Polish Culture adopted western humanism and Renaissance patterns, the lifestyles of Polish nobles acquired a distinctly eastern flavor beginning {{in the second half}} of the 16th century. Visiting foreigners often remarked on <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> their residencies and the conspicuous consumption of wealthy Polish nobles.|$|E

500|$|Filmed in Los Angeles, {{the music}} video reunited Carey with Paul Hunter, {{director}} of the video for her 1997 single, [...] "Honey". Since its release, Carey claimed it {{to be one of}} her favorite videos, due to its complex scenery and fun nature. She explained that she had wanted to work with Hunter again for some time, and was happy to be able to film another music video alongside him. In an interview with MTV News, Carey described her feelings regarding the video, as well as sentiments towards the video's director, Hunter: [...] "But I was so happy to work with him again 'cause ever since 'Honey' I've been trying to relive <b>the</b> <b>splendor</b> <b>of</b> that moment. It's more of just a plain beauty piece with sentimental overtones, but it was great to work with Paul again." [...] Following a tale of love and separation, the video alternates between two different time frames. The first of these involves a tearful Carey in the present, while the second invokes memories of a relationship with a former lover (played by Dolce & Gabbana model Christian Monzon). When questioned regarding a possible relationship with Monzon, Carey said [...] "Erm, how do we play this? OK, he’s a very nice guy, he's been in a fabulous Dolce & Gabbana advert - did you see it? And we’ve had some nice conversations and, um, a nice time. OK, I'll say he definitely {{did a very good job}} in the video." [...] Additionally, Carey and Hunter placed several secrets within the video's scenery, that would be intended for the [...] "die-hard fans". Following the video's completion, it premiered on MTV and several other music video channels on November 1, 2005.
