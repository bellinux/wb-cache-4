500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Black's near-psychic visions; a phenomenon which had been used with much less frequency in the second season. Executive producer Glen Morgan begrudgingly allowed Maher and Reindl to show the ability in this episode, saying [...] "I felt last year those visions were a cheat. The camera {{would go to a}} coffee cup and Frank would say, 'The murderer used a coffee cup.' It drove me nuts. What we were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> year was elevate Frank's visions to a dream-like state, so he would have to interpret what he's seeing. There would be more mystical, symbolic imagery that might give him more of a sense of what's going on. I had wanted to strip away the gift {{for a long time and}} see if the show really played without it. But we got back into that".|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} stated {{to have a}} running theme {{throughout}} the performances of being [...] "on the run" [...] by the Miami New Times, whether it is from [...] "the media, their place in pop music, the haters, the bullshit and sometimes even each other". When explaining {{the concept of the}} tour and its accompanying videos in a telephone conversation to New York-based director Dikayal Rimmasch, Jay-Z stated [...] "We're not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> literally, it's not that we're Bonnie and Clyde. We're on the run from everything. On the run from becoming a cliché. On the run from doing the same thing again." [...] During their individual performances, Beyoncé was often backed by both male and female dancers and Jay-Z was noted to hold the stage for multiple songs without assistance. Beyoncé was backed by an all female band during her solo songs, whilst Jay-Z was accompanied by other male instrumentalists; however both artist's musicians collaborated {{for the majority of the}} performance. Video interludes filled with [...] "cop chases and other violent outbursts" [...] carried the storytelling between songs. The performances of the joint tour was said to be split up similarly to Jay-Z's previous joint venture with Kanye West, the Watch the Throne Tour. Beyoncé and Jay-Z would take turn holding down the stage, beginning with several songs by Beyoncé first, followed by duets and afterwards Jay-Z rapping his songs. Both artists sported multiple outfits from a variety of fashion designers throughout the performances of the tour. In Beyoncé's case, makeup artist Sir John Barnette commented on her quick changes backstage between performances, comparing them to [...] "Daytona 500" [...] with every member of her team working on a separate part of her look.|$|E

On the run from doing the same thing again.' Everything he mentioned was a level of consciousness he has for staying alive as an entertainer and as a human being. He wanted to keep it more abstract because for him it was very abstract. How do you stay new, not just to your audience but also yourself? ...|$|E

[...] As a teenager, he was highly influenced by fellow Latino rapper Big Pun.

2500|$|Collider.com's Kayti Burt {{felt the}} episode of Arrow [...] "gets enough nostalgic hits {{in to make}} it work, while also giving us an {{exciting}} (batshit crazy) final act to launch us into the final part of the superhero crossover... Though the shared hallucination gimmick might lack long-term narrative consequence and feel like {{a bit of a}} 'Look, It's The 100th Episode!' plot device, it works because of the performance of all of the actors (including many returning ones) and the sentiment that this show has genuinely inspired in people." [...] Conversely, Burt [...] "was a bit sad that Arrow was robbed the opportunity of having a 100th episode outside of the already considerable demands of the crossover event, which were sometimes at odds with what this episode was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do...</b> <b>This</b> episode was trying to do far too much and was therefore a bit of a mess, but it's hard to dislike an hour of TV that is earnestly trying to please its fans in so many different ways." [...] She gave the episode 3 stars out of 5. Sara Netzley, for Entertainment Weekly praised the episode, awarding it an [...] "A", saying [...] "Lots of Arrow action here, and not as much for The Flash/Supergirl folks to do. Still, it all worked beautifully. We get enough cross-team action to make it a treat for viewers of the Berlanti-verse while still forwarding the invasion story line – and honoring the characters, plots, and themes that have made Arrow such a satisfying show over the last four and a half seasons.

And they don't understand luncheon, you know--they can't make out our eating at this sort of hour. You know they always dine so beastly early.

You know the Americans are so deucedly thin-skinned--they always bristle up if you say anything against their institutions. The English don't care a rap what you say--they 've got a different sort of temper, you know. With the Americans I 'm deuced careful--I never breathe a word about anything. While I was over there I went in for being complimentary. I laid it on thick, and I found they would take all I could give them. I did n't see much of their institutions, after all; I went in for seeing the people. Some of the people were charming--upon my soul, I was surprised at some of the people. I dare say you know some of the people I saw; they were as nice people as you would see anywhere. There were always a lot of people about Mrs. Wright, you know; they told me they were all the best people. You know she is always late for everything. She always comes in after every one is there--looking so devilish pretty, pulling on her gloves. She wears the longest gloves I ever saw in my life. Upon my word, if they don't come, I think I will ring the bell and ask the waiter what 's the matter. Would n't you ring the bell? It 's a great mistake, their trying to carry out their ideas of lunching. That 's Wright's character, you know; he 's always trying to carry out some idea.
