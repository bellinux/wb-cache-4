5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. <b>The</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> not told Ruth {{that he had}} cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E
5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, the World Jewish Congress {{condemned}} the indictment in Moscow of Jewish doctors as alleged conspirators against the Soviet Union leadership, the so-called Doctors' plot, and called a leadership meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, which was canceled {{at the last}} minute due to the death of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. The new Soviet leadership declared that the case against <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> been fabricated.|$|E

60|$|Could she {{possibly}} {{come out}} by the next train? Bailey was very ill. Bailey was dying. Bailey had come home last night looking ghastly. He had not slept. In the early morning {{he had begun to}} babble--Mrs. Bailey's voice had risen and broken on the word, and Ruth {{at the other end of}} the wire had heard her frightened sobs. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> come. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> looked awfully grave. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> telephoned to New York for another doctor. They were both upstairs now. It was awful, and Ruth must come at once.|$|R
25|$|That Dragon, Cancer {{bore out}} from {{experiences}} that Ryan and Amy Green had after their third child Joel {{was diagnosed with}} an atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor at twelve months of age, around November 2010. <b>The</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> only given the child about four months to live, but despite developing seven additional tumors, Joel continued to live for four more years. Joel's condition left him mentally underdeveloped, being unable to speak even by age 2, and he required additional parental care and supervision, alongside numerous visits to doctors and hospitals for palliative care and chemotherapy treatment. In early 2014, Joel's condition worsened, and the Greens temporarily moved from Colorado to San Francisco {{to take part in}} an experimental drug trial. The new drug failed to relieve any of the new symptoms. Ryan and Amy, following the advice of the hospice, decided to take him off his feeding tube, and he died on March 13, 2014 at the age of five.|$|E
25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off and <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never see again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of what he would do next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E
25|$|Some {{money went}} to Vysotsky, {{the rest was}} {{distributed}} amongst this circle. At first this was a reasonable return on their efforts; however, as his addiction progressed and his body developed resistance, the frequency and amount of drugs needed to keep Vysotsky going became unmanageable. This culminated {{at the time of}} the Moscow Olympics which coincided with the last days of his life, when supplies of drugs were monitored more strictly than usual, and some of the doctors involved in supplying Vysotsky were already behind bars (normally <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> to account for every ampule, thus drugs were transferred to an empty container, while the patients received a substitute or placebo instead). In the last few days Vysotsky became uncontrollable, his shouting could be heard all over the apartment building on Malaya Gruzinskaya St. where he lived amongst VIP's. Several days before his death, in a state of stupor he went on a high speed drive around Moscow in an attempt to obtain drugs and alcohol – when many high-ranking people saw him. This increased the likelihood of him being forcibly admitted to hospital, and the consequent danger to the circle supplying his habit. As his state of health declined, and it became obvious that he may die, his associates gathered to decide what to do with him. They came up with no firm decision. They did not want him admitted officially, as his drug addiction would become public and they would fall under suspicion, although some of them admitted that any ordinary person in his condition would have been admitted immediately.|$|E

He insisted on seeing his wife before being executed, but doctors told him she was not {{severely}} injured and would recover. Beauchamp protested that not being allowed to see his wife was cruel, and the guards consented to take him to her. Upon arriving, he was angered to see that <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> lied to him; Anna was too weak even to speak to him. He remained with her until he could no longer feel her pulse.

William Huskisson already believed that he was dying and had resigned himself to his fate; Emily Huskisson at first caused [...] "a dreadful scene... but at last she calmed herself and {{during the rest of the}} time sat weeping by the couch". Huskisson told Brandreth [...] "You see I shall never live to make any return for your kindness. You have done all that is possible, but it is all in vain."

2500|$|Victim's {{conscious}} actions R v. Blaue is {{a criminal}} law application of the [...] "thin skull rule" [...] in criminal law. The defendant visited {{the home of a}} Jehovah's Witness and demanded sex. When she refused, he stabbed her four times. At hospital, she refused a blood transfusion which would have saved her life. There was no suggestion that <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> acted improperly. Blaue was convicted of manslaughter by an unlawful act, namely wounding with intent. [...] "But for" [...] his actions, she would not have been faced with the choice about treatment and those who use violence on others must take their victims as they find them (albeit that he had known her religion and so her refusal was foreseeable).|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the {{thinking}} behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to UK R writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul – in May 2010: [...] "It comes from when I got ill. I went into cardic rehab, {{and there was}} this older lady there. She was like 'What are you doing here so young? It must have been your heart. You know what? This is my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then she told me how she'd just got back from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope – <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> told me I'd never be able to record again – her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} empire one finds milites medici who were immunes ("exempt") from other duties. Some were {{staff of the}} hospital, which Pseudo-Hyginus {{mentions}} in De Munitionibus Castrorum [...] as being set apart from other buildings so that the patients can rest. The hospital administrator was an optio valetudinarii. The orderlies aren't generally mentioned, but they must have existed, as the patients needed care and <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> more important duties. Perhaps they were servile or civilians, not worth mentioning. There were some noscomi, male nurses not in the army. Or, {{they could have been}} the milites medici. The latter term might be any military medic or it might be orderlies detailed from the legion. There were also medici castrorum. Not enough information survives in the sources to say for certain what distinctions existed, if any.|$|E

2500|$|Third party's {{deliberate}} intervention R v Malcherek (1981) 73 Cr. App. R. 173. The {{victim was}} placed on a life support machine and, after determining that she was brain dead, the doctors turned off the machine. The defendant appealed the conviction of murder arguing that <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> broken the chain of causation [...] by deliberately switching off the life support machine. It was held that the original wounds were the operating and substantial cause of death, and that a life support machine does no more than hold {{the effect of the}} injuries in suspension and when the machine is switched off, the original wounds continue to cause the death no matter how long the victim survives after the machine's disconnection. In R v Pagett (1983) 76 Cr. App. R. 279, to resist lawful arrest, the defendant held a girl in front of him as a shield and shot at armed policemen. The police instinctively fired back and killed the girl. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant's act caused the death and that the reasonable actions of a third party acting in self-defence could not be regarded as a novus actus interveniens because self-defence is a foreseeable consequence of his action and had not broken the chain of causation.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1894, Alexander III {{died and}} Nicholas mounted the throne as Emperor. At the time, Nicholas had no children, thus {{according}} {{to the laws of}} succession of the Russian Empire, the Grand Duke George became Tsarevich (formally Tsesarevich, denoting the heir presumptive or heir apparent to the throne as opposed to any son of the Tsar, although the latter title fell into disuse in 1721 and was gradually supplanted by the more specific use of Tsarevich). George's ill-health had forced him to relocate to Likani. It was impossible for him to return to St. Petersburg for the funeral of his father, Alexander III. <b>The</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> forbidden it. Nicholas wrote to his brother, [...] "... constantly pray to God to send you a full and speedy recovery, and to comfort you, because it is so much more difficult to be alone after such great sorrow than it is for us who are at least together!" [...] George also missed the christenings of Nicholas' elder daughters, Olga and Tatiana. Shortly after the birth of Nicholas' third daughter, Maria, in June 1899, George wrote to his brother, [...] "I am terribly sad that I have not yet been able to see your daughters and get to know them; but what can I do! It means it's not my fate, and everything is the will of God." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the Peripatetic philosopher Eudemus {{became ill}} with quartan fever, Galen {{felt obliged to}} treat him [...] "since he was my teacher and I {{happened}} to live nearby." [...] Galen wrote: [...] "I return {{to the case of}} Eudemus. He was thoroughly attacked by the three attacks of quartan ague, and <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>had</b> given him up, as it was now mid-winter." [...] Some Roman physicians criticized Galen for his use of the prognosis in his treatment of Eudemus. This practice conflicted with the then-current standard of care, which relied upon divination and mysticism. Galen retaliated against his detractors by defending his own methods. Garcia-Ballester quotes Galen as saying: [...] "In order to diagnose, one must observe and reason. This was the basis of his criticism of the doctors who proceeded alogos and askeptos." [...] However, Eudemus warned Galen that engaging in conflict with these physicians could lead to his assassination. [...] "Eudemus said this, and more to the same effect; he added that if they were not able to harm me by unscrupulous conduct they would proceed to attempts at poisoning. Among other things he told me that, some ten years before, a young man had come to the city and had given, like me practical demonstrations of the resources of our art; this young man was put to death by poison, together with two servants who accompanied him." ...|$|E
