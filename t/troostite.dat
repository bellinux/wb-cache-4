50|$|A good {{polishing}} reveals what {{speed the}} edge was cooled at, from what temperature, {{and what the}} carbon content of the steel is. It does this by displaying either predominantly nioi (匂), which {{is a mix of}} extremely fine martensite with <b>troostite</b> (another type of tempered steel), or the larger martensite crystals called nie (錵), which look like individual dot-like mirrors.|$|E

He is honored by having a subspecies of turtle named after him, the Cumberland turtle (Trachemys scripta troostii [...] ).

50|$|Benedicks was a {{professor}} at Stockholm's technical university, Director of the Institute of Metallography, {{and was the first}} to study the yttrium silicate thalenite. In 1926 Benedicks argued to the Nobel Physics Committee that Jean Baptiste Perrin should receive the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work, over 15 years prior, on Brownian motion, a debate which led to Perrin's eventual nomination and award. Benedicks was awarded the Carnegie Gold medal for his work on the cooling power of liquids, quenching velocities, and the constituents of <b>troostite</b> and austenite.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1920s Davenport and Bain {{discovered}} a new steel microstructure which they provisionally called martensite-troostite, due to it being intermediate between the already known low-temperature martensite phase and what was then known as <b>troostite</b> (now fine-pearlite). This microstructure was subsequently named bainite by Bain's colleagues at the United States Steel Corporation [...] although {{it took some time}} for the name to be taken up by the scientific community with books as late as 1947 failing to mention bainite by name. Bain and Davenport also noted the existence of two distinct forms: 'upper-range' bainite which formed at higher temperatures and 'lower-range' bainite which formed near the martensite start temperature (these forms are now known as upper- and lower-bainite respectively). The early terminology was further confused by the overlap, in some alloys, of the lower-range of the pearlite reaction and the upper-range of the bainite with the additional possibility of proeutectoid ferrite.|$|E
40|$|AbstractReplaced of the nitrate as the {{traditional}} quenching medium by hot water, the grey iron gear was processed by <b>troostite</b> heat treatment, its microstructures after heat treatment were investigated. The metallographic microstructures of the gear cross section were observed by scanning electronic microscope. Experimental results show that, the microstructures of the gear work piece are different with the observing position changing accordingly, which are extremely thin <b>troostite</b> and the structures with larger interlamellar spacing {{such as the}} sorbite and pearlite from outer to the core. Its hardness decreases gradually from the gear point to gear center. It indicates that if treated by the appropriate water temperature and proper cooling time, the <b>troostite</b> structures can be obtained in work pieces with complex shapes such as the grey iron gears, which comprehensive mechanical properties can be improved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cold steel {{rolls and}} too many other cold work dies are chosen of low alloy steel heat treated to about 60 RC in 50 {{millimeter}} depth on surface. <b>Troostite</b> phase which happens in some cases in tempered martensite has lower fracture toughness, although its ductility is a little more. In Industrial practical process condition, some technological problems seldom take place, and the part might be locally heated because of the accident. This effect may cause a phase change in metallurgical structure {{on the surface of}} the cold steel rolls or dies, named <b>Troostite.</b> However, the parts which subjected to this problem have no mechanical defect to be detected by NDT, but these kinds of affected part may be failed in working (rolling) by fracture, spalling or cracks. So <b>Troostite</b> is a harmful phase for rolls and other cold work tools which cause lots of losses to the companies. The following paper is a practical industrial approach to show and follow thermal instability of roll surface and metallurgical change of the surface from sorbite to <b>troostite</b> and its failure or fracture due to any improper usage...|$|E
40|$|In this investigation, {{the effect}} of heat {{treatment}} on the rate of corrosion of steel was studied. The following results were summarized. (1) The corrosion rate of steel increases with increasing carbon content of annealed and quenched steel. (2) Corrosion potential of steel shifts to noble potential as corrosion rate increases then corrosion reaction of steel is cathodic control type. (3) Between 300 ℃ and 400 ℃ of tempering temperature, corrosion rate of steel increases considerably because tempering <b>troostite</b> appears in the structure (S 55 C). (4) At 600 ℃ of tempering temperature, the structure of steel becomes tempering sorbite phase and corrosion rate decreases...|$|E
40|$|Microstructure and {{properties}} of structural steel subjected to overlay welding with secondary materials powder is in-vestigated. Crushed glass, grinding wheels (SiC), hard metals plates, {{high speed steel}} and cast iron chips as well as marble powders were used in automatic overlay welding of steel by low carbon wire. Powder spread over the steel surface and melted by continuously supplied wire arc enabled to obtain layers with graphite and carbides inclusions in the matrix; hardness of the matrix depends on the phases contained in it: martensite, <b>troostite</b> and residual austenite as well as secondary carbides. Depending on materials used for overlay welding the layers were obtained which abrasive wear resistance became {{equal to that of}} high alloyed hardened tool steel. Wear of these layers is much more less in comparison with low alloyed hardened tool steel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the surface wear-resistance and overall shock-resistance of 65 Mn steel, effects of rare earth (RE) {{particle}} size, adding amount and boronizing time subjected to quenching and medium-temperature tempering treatment were studied systematically. Optimizing basic component of low-temperature boronizing reagent and RE types, the depth of boronizing layer was selected as main evaluation parameter through the orthogonal test of RE-boronizing. Experimental results show that, cerium oxide with particle size of 20 nm and content of 4 % has the best effect of accelerating boronizing process on 65 Mn steel at 700 ℃ for 9 h, {{and the depth of}} boronizing layer with RE-boronizing is about 3. 3 times than without adding RE; meanwhile, the heart of 65 Mn steel still keeps good strength and toughness due to temper <b>troostite</b> microstructure. It can be concluded that the strengthening and toughening treatment of low-temperature RE-boronizing can obtain hard-surface and tough-core properties on 65 Mn steel...|$|E

This paper {{presents}} {{the research on}} the influence of carburizing and heat treatment on the properties and microstructure of a new medium carbon alloy steel Fe- 0. 39 C- 0. 99 Si- 0. 37 Mn- 5. 06 Cr- 1. 21 Mo- 0. 75 V (wt. %) used for disk cutter ring. The carburized case has secondary cementite besides those appeared in core such as pearlite and some carbides of Cr, Mo and V. Microstructure of the case is coarse and there are more and larger carbide particles than in core. After quenching and tempering, the carburized case and the core transformed into the microstructure comprised mostly of <b>troostite</b> and fully precipitated tiny carbide particles of Cr, Mo and V. The grains in the carburized case are still larger and the quantity of carbide precipitations including cementite is larger compared with that in the core. Finally, the case depth of about 1 mm can be obtained; the surface hardness is above 60 HRC; the core hardness is above 55 HRC; and the impact toughness reaches 16. 9 kJ/cm...|$|E
