5|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of her early novels such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair (1937) and The Enchanted Wood (1939), Blyton {{went on to}} build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year {{in addition to her}} prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her. <b>The</b> <b>sheer</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> her work and the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers, a charge she vigorously denied.|$|E
5|$|Resources {{and funds}} {{were needed to}} {{construct}} most memorials, particular larger monuments or building projects; sometimes professional services could be acquired for nothing, but normally designers, workmen and suppliers had to be paid. Different countries approached this problem in various ways, depending on local culture {{and the role of}} the state. Despite the special nature of the memorials, contractual arguments and issues over costs, timings and specifications were common, from smaller works in villages through to major works, such as the Vimy Memorial. <b>The</b> <b>sheer</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> work encouraged industrial innovation: carving the inscriptions into the many thousands of British memorial stones had to originally be undertaken by hand, for example, until a Lancashire company invented an automated engraving process.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>sheer</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> data {{handled by}} today's Internet {{services}} demand uncompromising scalability from the persistence substrates. Such demands {{have been successfully}} addressed by highly decentralized key-value stores invariably governed by a distributed hash table. The availability of these structured overlays rests on the assumption of a moderately stable environment. However, as scale grows with unprecedented numbers of nodes the occurrence of faults and churn becomes the norm rather than the exception, precluding the adoption of rigid control over the network's organization. In this position paper we outline the major ideas of a novel architecture designed to handle today's very large scale demand and its inherent dynamism. The approach rests on the well-known reliability and scalability properties of epidemic protocols to minimize the impact of churn. We identify several challenges that such an approach implies and speculate on possible solutions to ensure data availability and adequate access performance...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{importance}} of Big Data and What You Can Accomplish with the data that counts. Until recently, organizations have been limited to using subsets of their data, or they were constrained to simplistic analyses because <b>the</b> <b>sheer</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> data overwhelmed their processing platforms. But, {{what is the point of}} collecting and storing terabytes of data if you can't analyze it in full context, or if you have to wait hours or days to get results? On the other hand, not all business questions are better answered by bigger data. How can you make the most of all that data, now and in the future? It is a twofold proposition. You can only optimize your success if you weave analytics into your solution. But you also need analytics to help you manage the data itself. There are several key technologies that can help you get a handle on your big data, and more importantly, extract meaningful value from it. ...|$|R
5|$|The Great Raid of 1840 was {{the largest}} Indian raid on white cities {{in the history of}} what is now the United States—though {{technically}} when it occurred it was in the Republic of Texas and not in the United States. The war party literally burned one city to the ground. They took over 3,000 horses and mules, {{and hundreds of thousands of}} dollars of other plunder, ranging from silver to cloth and mirrors. Unfortunately for the war party, <b>the</b> <b>sheer</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> loot slowed them down, and made them vulnerable to attack from a militia that otherwise would never have caught them.

5|$|The Hale Commission was {{established}} by the Commonwealth of England on 30 January 1652 and led by Sir Matthew Hale to investigate law reform. Consisting of eight lawyers and thirteen laymen, the Commission met approximately {{three times a week}} and proposed changes as radical (at the time) as reducing the use of the death penalty, allowing witnesses, legal aid and lawyers for defendants in criminal cases and creating County Courts and a Court of Appeal for criminal cases. Though the Commission was unsuccessful at passing any of its measures under the Rump Parliament, two of its measures were put into law by the subsequent Barebone's Parliament, and, {{by the middle of the}} 20th century, most of the others were as well. Debate has occurred over the effectiveness and strife within the Commission between its more moderate and radical members; the general conclusion is that with <b>the</b> <b>sheer</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> work produced and the vast proportion of moderate to radical members, it is unlikely such strife existed.|$|E
40|$|Peak-season {{visitors}} to Yosemite Valley know first-hand that use levels {{can affect the}} quality of their experiences in <b>the</b> park. <b>The</b> <b>sheer</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> vehicles and people sometimes produce long lines at entrance gates, traffic jams at intersections, full parking lots, and congested trails or viewpoints. These problems have been challenging the park’s infrastructure and operational staff for decades, but more frequently in recent years (White et al. 2012). A 2011 study of mid-summer river users in Yosemite Valley also helps quantify the general problem: 82 % report feeling some degree of crowding during their visits (Whittaker and Shelby 2012). Meta-analyses of the hundreds of studies using this same measure suggest that recreation settings with crowding levels above 65 % are probably “over capacity, ” and those above 80 % may be “greatly over capacity ” (Shelby et al. 1989; Vaske and Shelby 2008). More detailed information shows that Yosemite visitors feel more crowded while using the park’s transportation system than when participating in other activities. The percentage of those feeling crowded was highest while engaged in driving roads (90 %), finding parking (88 %), or riding free shuttles (83 %), followed by hiking or biking on trails (68 %). In contrast, crowding ratings were considerably lower for river-based activities, such as boating (60 %) ...|$|R

5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is <b>the</b> <b>sheer</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.|$|E
