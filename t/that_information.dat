40|$|We {{examine how}} health {{information}} affects individuals' subjective well-being using a regression discontinuity design {{on data from}} a screening program for an asymptomatic disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The information provided to the individuals is guided by the measured aorta size {{and its relation to}} pre-determined levels. When comparing individuals <b>that</b> receive <b>information</b> <b>that</b> they are healthy with those <b>that</b> receive <b>information</b> <b>that</b> they are in the risk zone for AAA, we find no effects. However, when comparing those <b>that</b> receive <b>information</b> <b>that</b> they have a small AAA, and will be under increased surveillance, with those who receive <b>information</b> <b>that</b> they are in the risk zone, we find a weak positive effect on wellbeing. This indicates <b>that</b> the <b>information</b> about increased surveillance (positive) may outweigh the information about worse health (negative) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: I {{examine the}} role of {{information}} processing costs on post earnings announcement drift. I distinguish between hard <b>information</b> —quantitative <b>information</b> <b>that</b> is more easily processed — and soft information which has higher processing costs. I find <b>that</b> qualitative earnings <b>information</b> has additional predictability for asset prices beyond the predictability in quantitative information. I also find <b>that</b> qualitative <b>information</b> has greater predictability for returns at longer horizons, suggesting <b>that</b> frictions in <b>information</b> processing generate price drift. Using a tool from natural language processing called typed dependency parsing, I demonstrate <b>that</b> qualitative <b>information</b> relating to positive fundamentals and future performance {{is the most difficult}} information to process...|$|R

5|$|According to John Carmack, {{the lead}} {{graphics}} engine developer at id Software, {{the technology of}} Doom 3 was supported by three primary features: unified lighting and shadowing, complex animations and scripting that showed real-time with fully dynamic per-pixel lighting and stencil shadowing, and GUI surfaces that add extra interactivity to the game. The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified lighting and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving <b>that</b> <b>information</b> in the map data, most light sources are computed in real-time. This allows lights to cast shadows even on non-static objects such as monsters and machinery, which was impossible with static non-directional lightmaps. A shortcoming {{of this approach is}} the engine's inability to render soft shadows and global illumination.|$|E

5|$|Diamond {{writes that}} jury {{consultants}} then compare the three data sets {{to determine which}} background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use <b>that</b> <b>information</b> to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with inexorably biased or dumb jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.|$|E

On day four Air India's flight safety officer informed the inquiry that the aircraft's thrust lever and thrust reverse levers were both in the forward position, possibly indicating that the pilot intended to go around. The inquiry panel stated <b>that</b> <b>information</b> from the FDR would be released at the next hearing of the Court of Inquiry in New Delhi on 3 September 2010, {{and that of the}} CVR soon after.

5|$|During {{the first}} three months of 1944, Cicero {{supplied}} the Germans with copies of documents taken from his employer's dispatch box or his safe. Photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion, this led to a high-speed chase around Ankara as someone had taken an interest in the hand-over. Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped. Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From <b>that</b> <b>information,</b> the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did not know that the source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian field commanders {{complained of}} a total lack of {{topographical}} maps causing a real problem in {{the first months of}} the war. Commanders had difficulty planning military operations effectively or sending back routine and casualty reports without accurate coordinates. Field units were given maps that were only of use for aerial navigation. Chief of Egyptian Intelligence, Salah Nasr, admitted <b>that</b> <b>information</b> on Yemen was nonexistent. Egypt had not had an embassy in Yemen since 1961; therefore when Cairo requested information from the US ambassador to Yemen, all he provided was an economic report on the country.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{defeat at}} the hands of the North Vietnamese Air Force, Colonel Robin Olds learned that Seventh Air Force {{intelligence}} had watched North Vietnamese MiG fighters practicing their new tactics for ten days prior to the battle of 23 August, but had not passed <b>that</b> <b>information</b> on to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing and other units. Thus, it soon became clear to U.S commanders that the reason the North Vietnamese repeatedly stood down their fighter force was because they were working on their new tactic. In the first half of 1967, the North Vietnamese had realized they could not directly confront U.S. fighters in air-to-air combat, so they changed their procedures for the deployment of their numerically inferior MiG units. To take advantage of the MiG-21’s speed and small size, pilots flying the type were instructed to intercept targets only at high speed behind or above U.S. strike formations.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold <b>that</b> <b>information</b> from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E
