Of those 707households, 104 were pensioners living alone, 176 were couples without children, 27 were lone parents and 153couples with dependent children. 343 of <b>the</b> <b>households</b> {{had at least}} one vehicle.

5|$|Records {{suggest that}} 28.6% of <b>the</b> <b>households</b> have {{children}} under the age of 18. Of these, 25.6% are married couples living together, 24.8% have a female householder with no husband present, and 43.6% are non-families. Meanwhile, 37.8% of all households comprise a single person, and 14.5% of households comprise a person over 65 years of age living alone. The average household size is 2.28 and the average family size is 3.02.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{driver of}} this {{difference}} is due to cultural standards that give women little leverage {{in the selection of}} their partner. Elder family members must find suitable husbands for young females in <b>the</b> <b>households.</b> If women are known to have adverse previous medical histories, their ability to find a partner is significantly reduced. This difference leads to diverging health outcomes for men and women.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the reign}} of Richard II, the Chamber had re-established its {{seniority}} within <b>the</b> <b>Household,</b> and <b>the</b> Wardrobe then 'ceased to be the directive force of <b>the</b> <b>household,</b> remaining simply as <b>the</b> office of <b>household</b> accounts'. Rather than being a separate department, the Wardrobe and its officers now came {{under the authority of}} the Steward, and before long, even within <b>the</b> <b>Household,</b> <b>the</b> Wardrobe began to lose its separate identity: by the late 14th century, its senior officers were more often than not referred to as the Treasurer of <b>the</b> <b>Household,</b> Controller of <b>the</b> <b>Household</b> and Cofferer of <b>the</b> <b>Household</b> (rather than as [...] "Treasurer/Controller/Cofferer of <b>the</b> <b>Household</b> Wardrobe").

It made its network television debut in November later that year: NBC paid $5 million for a one-off airing, and it was broadcast in two parts on successive evenings.

In 1978, CBS signed a deal worth $35 million to broadcast the film twenty times over as many years. Turner Entertainment acquired the MGM film library in 1986, but the deal did not include the television rights to Gone with the Wind, which were still held by CBS. A deal was struck in which the rights were returned to Turner Entertainment and CBS's broadcast rights to The Wizard of Oz were extended. It was used to launch two cable channels owned by Turner Broadcasting System: Turner Network Television (1988) and Turner Classic Movies (1994). It debuted on videocassette in March 1985, where it placed second in the sales charts, and has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats.|$|E
5|$|The parishes {{were grouped}} into deaneries called Varados. Every parish {{was divided into}} wards, while Parish Councils were present in most parishes. About 15 percent of <b>the</b> <b>households</b> in the parishes were literate. A widow had to remain indoors, {{practically}} {{for the rest of}} her life. Since high-caste Hindu widows cannot remarry after the death of their husbands, the high-caste Christians too considered the remarriage of a widow as something unnatural. Canon law did allow remarriage for widows and therefore there was no direct prohibition for widows to remarry in the society of the Christians of South Canara. Few women had the courage to go against the strict conventions of their community. A widow who remarried was looked down upon, pitied, and shunned as unlucky. But she was not ill-treated or made an outcast, and no stigma was attached to her husband. Succession to property was practised as per the Hindu laws.|$|E
