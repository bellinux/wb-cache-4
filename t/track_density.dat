2500|$|Through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, various {{methods to}} improve the dynamic range of mass-produced records {{involved}} highly advanced disc cutting equipment. These techniques, marketed, to name two, as the CBS DisComputer and Teldec Direct Metal Mastering, were used to reduce inner-groove distortion. RCA Victor introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the commercial name of Dynagroove. Two main elements were combined: another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and dynamic compression for masking background noise. Sometimes this was called [...] "diaphragming" [...] the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects. Both elements were reflected in the brandname of Dynagroove, described elsewhere in more detail. It also used the earlier advanced method of forward-looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk.

Also, the higher <b>track</b> <b>density</b> at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end {{farther away from the}} disk center than usual, helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Beijing's {{worsening}} {{traffic congestion}} prompted city planners {{to move the}} construction of several lines from the 13th Five Year Plan to the 12th Five Year Plan. This meant Lines 8 (PhaseIII), 3, 12, 16, the Yanfang Line, as well as additional lines to suburban districts of Changping, Tiantongyuan, and Haidian were to begin construction before 2015. Previously, Lines 3, 11, 12 and 16 were being planned for the more distant future. On December 30, 2010, five suburban lines: Lines 15 (Phase I from Wangjing West to Houshayu except Wangjing East Station), Changping, Fangshan (except Guogongzhuang Station), Yizhuang (except Yizhuang Railway Station), and Daxing, commenced operation. [...] The addition of [...] of track, a nearly 50% increase, made the subway the fourth longest metro in the world. [...] One year later, on December 31, 2011, the subway surpassed the New York City Subway to become the third longest metro in revenue track length with the extension of Line 8 north from the Olympic Green to Huilongguan, the opening of Line 9 in southwest Beijing from Beijing West Railway Station to Guogongzhuang (except Fengtai Dongdajie Station, which opened on October 12, 2012), {{the extension of the}} Fangshan Line to Guogongzhuang, and the extension of Line 15 from Houshayu to Fengbo in central Shunyi.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{digitized}} scanning electron micrographs and computer image analysis programs to measure <b>track</b> <b>densities</b> in lunar soil grains. Tracks were formed by highly ionizing solar energetic particles and cosmic rays. Back-scattered electron images produced suitable high contrast images for analysis. We used computer counting and measurement of area to obtain <b>track</b> <b>densities.</b> We found an excellent correlation with manual measurements for <b>track</b> <b>densities</b> below 1 x 10 (exp 8) cm(exp - 2).

50|$|Technically, {{reformatting}} a cartridge means {{increasing its}} <b>track</b> <b>density</b> (only), as the {{linear bit density}} {{is limited by the}} tape coating. In the table below, a 'JA' type cartridge can be reformatted from 300 GB initially to 640 GB in the TS1130 drive. A later 'JB' type cartridge will carry 1 TB since its better coating also permits a higher linear bit density. Generally speaking, linear density is limited by material, semiconductor and signal processing technologies, whereas <b>track</b> <b>density</b> is limited by the servo technology that prevents track runout.|$|E

50|$|Quad density (QD or 4D) doubles {{capacity}} over DD by {{narrowing the}} width of tracks to 0.160 mm for a density of 96 tpi.

40|$|Measurements {{of cosmic}} ray <b>track</b> <b>densities</b> are {{presented}} for soil samples from Apollo 15, 16, and 17.

50|$|Shingled {{magnetic}} recording (SMR) is a magnetic storage data recording technology used in hard disk drives (HDDs) to increase storage density and overall per-drive storage capacity. Conventional hard disk drives record data by writing non-overlapping magnetic tracks parallel {{to each other}} (perpendicular recording), while shingled recording writes new tracks that overlap part of the previously written magnetic track, leaving the previous track narrower and allowing for higher <b>track</b> <b>density.</b> Thus, the tracks partially overlap similar to roof shingles. This approach was selected because physical limitations prevent recording magnetic heads from having the same width as reading heads, leaving recording heads wider.|$|E
50|$|Metal {{particles}} (MP) {{have been}} used to store data on tapes and magnetic strips but they have reached their limit for high capacity data storage. In order to increase their capacity by (25x) on data tape the MP had to increase the tape length by (45%) and <b>track</b> <b>density</b> by over (500%) which made it necessary {{to reduce the size of}} the individual particles. As the particles where reduced in size the passivizing coating needed to prevent the oxidation and deterioration of the MP had to become thicker. This presented a problem for as the passivation coating got thicker it became harder to achieve an acceptable signal to noise ratio.|$|E
5000|$|Micropolis's first advance was to {{take the}} {{existing}} 48 tpi (tracks per inch) standard created by Shugart Associates, and double both the <b>track</b> <b>density</b> and track recording density to get four times the total storage on a 5.25-inch floppy in the [...] "MetaFloppy" [...] series with quad density (Drives :1054, :1053, and :1043) around 1980. Micropolis pioneered 100 tpi density because of the attraction of an exact 100 tracks to the inch. [...] "Micropolis-compatible" [...] 5.25-inch 77-track diskette drives were also manufactured by Tandon (TM100-3M and TM100-4M). Such drives were used in a number of computers like in a Vector Graphic S-100 bus computer, the Durango F-85 and in a few Commodore disk drives (8050, 8250, 8250LP and SFD-1001).|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} the particle <b>track</b> <b>densities</b> in 36 grains taken from {{two levels of}} the soil column returned from the Sea of Plenty by Luna 16.

All {{but one of the}} grains contained very high <b>track</b> <b>densities.</b> We conclude that all of the Luna 16 soil has been irradiated very close to the surface, that there has been little or no 'recent' admixture of previously shielded material from below 30 cm, and that the regolith is both unusually thin at the Luna 16 site and extremely old (about 3 b. y. and more) ...|$|R
40|$|Sandford {{theoretically}} {{explored the}} use of solar flare <b>track</b> <b>densities</b> in interplanetary dust particles (IDP's) to distinguish whether they were of cometary or asteroidal origin.

Flynn examined the heating of IDP's on atmospheric entry and concluded that IDP's must be predominantly from asteroidal sources because these asteroidal particles would have sufficiently low velocities to survive atmospheric heating {{with little or no}} modification whereas cometary particles would ordinarily have velocities that are much higher.

5000|$|Occupying 10.5 inches (6U) {{of space}} in a {{standard}} 19-inch rack, the drive was competitive at the time.

They were positioned by a voice coil actuator using a linear optical encoder for feedback. The <b>track</b> <b>density</b> was 100 tracks-per-inch. The bit density along the track was about 2200 bits-per-inch. Discrete electronics computed the velocity profile for seeks commanded by the controller.

The six new SmartTrack stations would be St. Clair West, Liberty Village, East Don Lands (Unilever site), Gerrard and Pape, Lawrence East, and Finch East. A proposed SmartTrack station near Ellesmere SRT station was cancelled. Another proposed station between Liberty Village and Union Station was considered but was rejected as it would not fit with the <b>track</b> <b>density</b> at that location. Staff had estimated that SmartTrack would put 24,100 residents and 19,000 jobs within 500 metres of a station, and would carry 27,600 riders daily in additional to GO Regional Express Rail, and would divert 3,900 riders from the Yonge subway south of Bloor Street during the morning rush hours.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other isotopic dating methods, the [...] "{{daughter}}" [...] in fission track dating is {{an effect}} in the crystal rather than a daughter isotope. Uranium-238 undergoes spontaneous fission decay at a known rate, {{and it is the}} only isotope with a decay rate that is relevant to the significant production of natural fission tracks; other isotopes have fission decay rates too slow to be of consequence. The fragments emitted by this fission process leave trails of damage (fossil tracks or ion tracks) in the crystal structure of the mineral that contains the uranium. The process of track production is essentially the same by which swift heavy ions produce ion tracks.Chemical etching of polished internal surfaces of these minerals reveals spontaneous fission tracks, and the <b>track</b> <b>density</b> can be determined. Because etched tracks are relatively large (in the range 1 to 15 micrometres), counting can be done by optical microscopy, although other imaging techniques are used.

The primary contributors to the issues related to these high capacities are the physical and magnetic properties of the tape media itself.

40|$|STAR [1] is {{an active}} {{collider}} heavy-ion experiment at RHIC/BNL (Upton, USA). The main tracking detector of the experiment is the Time Projection Chamber (TPC).
