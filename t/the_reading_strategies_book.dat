The frequency analysis revealed a fairly regular use of <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> by Vietnamese ESL learners. Of the three types of strategies, support strategies were the most frequently employed, followed by global and problem solving strategies. Regarding strategies used by the higher and lower performing readers, the results revealed significant differences in the use of 5 global and 1 problem solving strategies. In addition, the study found that participants 2 ̆ 7 performance on higher order and lower order reading questions was significantly associated with a set of <b>reading</b> <b>strategies.</b> Specifically, 14 <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> were significantly correlated with performance on lower order reading questions and 22 <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> with performance on higher order reading questions.

Based on the above findings several suggestions were made to help teachers improve their teaching and help learners improve their reading comprehension and also about possible areas for future research. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Reading is an {{individual}} activity to understand and get the meanings from the printed text. Reading activity needs schema to organize knowledge in memory and metacognitive to raise the awareness. To activate the schema and raise metacognition, <b>reading</b> <b>strategy</b> is needed to help them to construct the meanings and solve difficulties encountered in <b>reading.</b> From <b>the</b> last-three-year document of national exam of English which emphasized more reading comprehension, it can be known that some students scored high, some others scored low. The difference in achieving such a score {{may be influenced by}} <b>the</b> <b>strategy</b> use in <b>reading.</b> To know comprehensively <b>reading</b> <b>strategy</b> used and <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension achievement, <b>the</b> researcher is interested to find out <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> used by <b>the</b> high achieving students and low achieving students of SMA Muhammadiyah 1 Babat when reading academic texts and doing reading tasks. Thus, this study focused on describing <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> used by <b>the</b> high achieving students and the low achieving students, the most frequently used strategy by the students, and finding out whether there is any significant correlation between <b>reading</b> <b>strategy</b> and <b>reading</b> achievement. This non experimental study involves 56 second graders of the exact sciences program of SMA Muhammadiyah 1 Babat. Reading comprehension test was administered to measure <b>the</b> students’ <b>reading</b> comprehension of <b>the</b> high achieving students and the low achieving students. Survey of Reading Strategy (SORS) was used to measure <b>the</b> students’ <b>reading</b> <b>strategy.</b> <b>The</b> validity and the reliability of these two instruments were measured after they were applied to the pilot group.

The first results found that high achieving students of the second grade of the exact sciences program of SMA Muhammadiyah 1 Babat tended to use <b>the</b> three <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> (global strategy, problem solving strategy and support strategy). They indicated high level. The four activities of the global strategy are: having a purpose when reading, using context clues to help better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>reading,</b> thinking about what they know to help them understand what they read, and checking what to see if guesses about the text are correct. Besides, four activities of problem solving are: re-reading to increase understanding when the text becames difficult, reading slowly and carefully {{to make sure that the}} reader understands what to read, paying a closer attention to the material when the tex...|$|R
40|$|Reading is an {{area that}} has {{concerned}} educators who work with students who are deaf or hard of hearing for many years. Studies from the 1960 s to the present have concluded that students who are deaf read at lower levels than their hearing counterparts. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> used by students who are deaf, as they comprehend the written text. This study focuses on the strengths of individual students who are deaf, as they realize their potential as efficient readers and writers of a language they cannot hear. Qualitative case study research design initiated and guided this investigation. Through observations, interviews, and miscue analysis, I investigated two students' <b>reading</b> <b>strategies.</b> I was interested in the students' perspectives of their <b>reading</b> <b>strategies,</b> <b>reading</b> strengths, and thoughts about <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> process. Using constant comparative method of reading, organizing, and coding the data, an understanding of <b>the</b> students' <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> developed. A significant implication from this study is that students who are deaf use similar <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> as students with normal hearing in each of <b>the</b> three <b>reading</b> comprehension categories, predicting, sampling, and confirming.

40|$|This study investigates <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> {{selected}} {{junior high}} school students employ when reading social studies, science, and literature materials in school and a self-selected passage in a non-school setting. In addition interrelationships among their <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> and <b>the</b> subjects' purposes for <b>reading,</b> <b>the</b> students' personal models of <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> process, and <b>the</b> readers' attitudes toward reading, {{as well as the}} subject areas of social studies, science, and English are also examined. Six subjects from a seventh grade class are administered the Estes Attitude Scales, the Burke Reading Interview, and are questioned concerning their purposes for <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> selected passages. Miscue analysis identifies <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> these subjects employ in their natural environments. Retrospective responses are examined to investigate the subjects' awareness of their <b>reading</b> <b>strategies.</b> <b>The</b> major findings indicate that each of these subjects sample syntactic, semantic, and graphophonic cues when <b>reading.</b> <b>The</b> more efficient readers produce more sentences which are syntactically and semantically acceptable, and result in no change to the intended meaning. The subjects' patterns of self-correction vary depending on the different materials. The students' sampling of graphophonic cues appears not to reflect reader proficiency but varies with different curricular materials. The retelling scores are not always predictable based on the readability formula ratings for the same passage. Other measures do not relate simply to proficiency of reading. These findings indicate a complex interaction between <b>the</b> subjects' <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> and their attitudes toward reading or a specific discipline, reading in different settings, <b>the</b> selection of <b>reading</b> materials, and reading for different purposes. The findings support a conclusion that these {{junior high school}} students employ recognition, prediction, confirmation, correction, and termination <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> when <b>reading</b> for diverse purposes teacher assigned, and self-selected materials in different settings. The subjects vary in their ability to adjust their <b>reading</b> <b>strategies</b> to meet <b>the</b> specific demands of different curricular materials.
