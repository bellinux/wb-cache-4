5|$|In 1913, another Hull House ghost story began circulating. According to this legend, after a man {{claimed that}} he would rather have the Devil in his house than a picture of The Virgin Mary, his child was born with pointed ears, horns, scale-covered skin, and a tail. The mother {{was said to have}} taken the baby to Hull House, where Addams was said to have {{attempted}} to have it baptized and wound up locking it in the attic. While initially annoyed about the story, which had no basis in fact, Addams became fascinated by the effect the episode had on old women in <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> <b>and</b> used the episode as a basis for her book, The Long Road of Woman's Memory.|$|E
