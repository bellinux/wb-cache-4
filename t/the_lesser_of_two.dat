25|$|For a long time, the U.S. and the Dominican elite {{supported}} the Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition, {{the massacre of}} Haitians, and Trujillo's plots against other countries. The U.S. believed Trujillo was <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> or more evils. The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo's agents attempted to assassinate the Venezuelan president, Rómulo Betancourt, a fierce critic of Trujillo.|$|E

50|$|Kaplan {{initially}} operationalized ambivalence as <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> reactions (i.e., {{positive or}} negative evaluations), also called conflicting reactions (and contrasted with dominant reactions). For example, if objective ambivalence towards exercising was assessed using two separate 6-point scales, and a person indicated {{that his or her}} evaluation was slightly negative (e.g., 2 on a 6-point scale) and extremely positive (e.g., 6 on a 6-point scale), this person's ambivalence would be quantified by <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> these <b>two</b> evaluations (i.e., 2 in this example).|$|R
25|$|During World War II, Pramoedya (like many Indonesian Nationalists, Sukarno and Suharto among them) {{at first}} {{supported}} the occupying forces of Imperial Japan. He believed the Japanese to be <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> evils, {{compared to the}} Dutch. He worked as a typist for a Japanese newspaper in Jakarta. As the war went on, however, Indonesians were dismayed by the austerity of wartime rationing and by increasingly harsh measures taken by the Japanese military. The Nationalist forces loyal to Sukarno switched their support to the incoming Allies against Japan; all indications are that Pramoedya did as well.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{understood}} that the region would not be re-attached. Therefore, they favored <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> evils and tacitly supported the interests of Lithuania. The Weimar Republic saw both Poland and France as its major enemies while Lithuania was more neutral. Also, once Germany restored its might, {{it would be much}} easier to recapture the region from weaker Lithuania than from larger Poland. Already on February 22, 1922, the Germans unofficially informed the Lithuanians that they were not opposed to Lithuanian action in Klaipėda and that, understandably, such a stance would never be officially declared. Such attitudes were later confirmed in other unofficial German–Lithuanian communications and even during the revolt, when Berlin urged local Germans not to hinder the Lithuanian plans.|$|E
25|$|After the {{oil shock}} the NUM renewed its claim for a {{substantial}} wage increase, a claim which broke government pay guidelines, and then began industrial action {{in the form of}} an overtime ban in support of the claim. The sudden shortage of coal in the middle of the winter forced the Government to announce a 'three-day week' of restrictions of electricity by industry. Adamson deplored the move but regarded it as <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> evils because industry might not be able to operate at all. Adamson supported the Government's refusal to concede the miners' pay claim because of concerns that other wage claims would follow, although he conceded that it could be supported if there was a watertight guarantee that other unions would settle within the limits.|$|E

25|$|This {{version of}} Light is {{different}} to his manga counterpart {{in the fact}} that he never loses sight of his goal to make the world better for the innocent. Unlike Light Yagami, Light Turner never kills any police officers and never truly lets the power of the Death Note overtake him. Instead, his ruthless qualities are transferred to Mia, who uses the notebook in secret to kill police and innocents that are trying to find Light and, by association, herself. In the end, she writes Light's name in the notebook to make him transfer ownership of the notebook to her, showing her true nature and calling the death note her notebook. However, Light creates a plan that will result in his survival and her death if she attempts to take the notebook, which she does despite how much he tries to convince her to let it go and be with him instead, having truly fallen in love with Mia by writing her name in it as well. In the end, through using two criminals that he controlled using the Death Note, Light manages to trick the police into believing that he wasn't Kira with the exception of his father, who worked out the truth after finding newspaper articles about his mother's murder. The film ends with his father asking Light, in response to what he said, if he was truly <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> evils when compared to Mia while L finds a page of the death note, and wonders whether to write Light's name.|$|E

500|$|From 1988, environmentalists started {{actively}} {{opposing the}} Triangle Link. The most active was the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, which stated that the road would have serious consequences for the local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. Instead, they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge. An action group was established. Hallgeir Matre stated that Stord had a lack of beaches and that the two islands [...] "were the last low, forested islands in the area after the paradise Eldøyane had been converted to an industrial area for Aker Stord during the 1970s". He further stated that environmentalists were skeptical to floating bridges, but that in this case it would be <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> evils. The Stord Society for the Conservation of Nature applied for municipal grants to make a critical report, but this was rejected by the majority of the municipal council. By June, a new chapter had been established on Bømlo, and the group stated that it was irresponsible to build a link which would result in a massive increase in car use. Future In Our Hands started a petition which collected 1,600 signatures. A poll from 1990 showed that in Stord, 35 percent were in favor of the project, while 36.7 percent were opposed, given that the ferry service was improved, among other things with night ferries and increased comfort.|$|E
500|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, Champollion {{was a young}} {{bachelor}} {{and thus}} liable to compulsory military service, which would have put him in great danger due to the extremely high mortality of soldiers in Napoleon's armies. Through the assistance of his brother and the prefect of Grenoble Joseph Fourier, who was also an egyptologist, he successfully avoided the draft by arguing that his work on deciphering the Egyptian script was too important to interrupt. First skeptical of the Napoleonic regime, {{after the fall of}} Napoleon in 1813 and the institution of the royalist regime under Louis XVIII, Champollion came to consider the Napoleonic state <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> evils. Anonymously he composed and circulated songs ridiculing and criticizing the royal regime [...] songs that became highly popular among the people of Grenoble. In 1815 Napoleon Bonaparte escaped from his exile on Elba and landed with an army at the Côte d'Azur and marched directly on Grenoble where he was received as a liberator. Here he met with Champollion, whose many requests for exemption from the draft he remembered, and he asked him how his important work was progressing. Champollion replied, that he had just finished his Coptic grammar and dictionary. Napoleon requested that he send the manuscripts to Paris for publication. His brother Jacques joined the Napoleonic cause, putting both of the brothers in danger {{at the end of the}} Hundred Days when Napoleon was finally defeated, Grenoble being the last city to resist the royalist advances. In spite of the risk to themselves, having been put under Royalist surveillance, the Champollion brothers nonetheless aided the Napoleonic general Drouet d'Erlon who had been sentenced to death for his participation in the Battle of Waterloo, giving him shelter and helping him escape to Munich. The brothers were condemned to internal exile in Figeac, and Champollion was removed from his university post in Grenoble and the faculty closed.|$|E
500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E

50|$|In self-defense cases, {{the amount}} of force {{employed}} by the defender must be proportionate to the threatened aggressive force.

Otherwise, unlawful conduct will only be justified when it involves <b>the</b> <b>lesser</b> harm <b>of</b> <b>two</b> harmful choices.
