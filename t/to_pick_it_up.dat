5|$|A Ganapatya legend {{recalls how}} the creator-god Brahma, the preserver-god Vishnu and the dissolver-god Shiva, the Divine Mother Devi and the Sun-god Surya {{mediated}} at Morgaon {{to learn about}} their creator and their purpose of existence. Ganesha emerged before them in form of an Omkara flame and blessed them. Another legend records that when Brahma created his son Kama (desire), he became a victim of desire and lusted for his own daughter Sarasvati (Goddess of learning). Upon invocation {{by all of the}} deities, the sacred Turiya Tirtha river appeared and Brahma bathed in her waters to cleanse his sin of incest. Brahma then came to Morgaon to worship Ganesha, carrying water from the river in his water pot. Entering the Ganesha shrine, Brahma stumbled and water fell from the pot. When Brahma tried <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> it was turned into the sacred Karha river, that still flows at Morgaon.|$|E
5|$|While {{the weather}} was fine, the wind whipped up {{to such an extent}} at pitch level that the ball was taken out of its proper flight on occasion. In the third minute Sheffield United were nearly a goal up after Arsenal goalkeeper Wilson dropped the ball to the ground and fumbled at it trying <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> United players Barclay and Dodds both charged in to take advantage, but an Arsenal defender cleared the ball away before they could turn the {{opportunity}} into a goal. During the first fifteen minutes, United were the superior team with the work of their forwards only failing against the work of Arsenal's full backs and goalkeeper with Wilson continuing to looking not entirely safe. Arsenal's defenders eventually settled with Crayston and Copping stepping up for their team.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behaviour. It {{is believed to have}} been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing hunters <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> off its roost. The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. It was only recorded by Albert Stewart Meek, who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It {{is believed to have been}} rare when Meek collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of cats, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon was in the early 1940s, and the species is considered extinct.|$|E

5|$|After {{the guests}} take their seats, Scott starts {{to worry that}} Charlene will not show up, but Paul and Mike assure him {{that she will be}} there. Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites {{everyone}} to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their walk up the aisle. Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them man and wife. At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams from Max and Maria, Clive and Rosemary, who all are unable to attend, are being read out. Dan Ramsay (Syd Conabere) spots a mouse and tries <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> but hits Mrs. Mangel's foot. She accuses Dan of groping her and as he protests his innocence, an argument breaks out among the guests. Scott and Charlene go to his bedroom and Gail brings them a gift from her father. Jane comes to tell Charlene {{that it is time to}} get changed for the honeymoon, while Paul takes their bags out to the car. Lucy tells Scott that she will miss him and he gives her his skateboard. Everyone gathers in the street to wave the couple off. Mrs. Mangel catches Charlene's bouquet, as the couple drive out of Ramsay Street.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighth}} season, it is {{revealed}} that the positive pregnancy test found at Monica's wedding belongs to Rachel. Phoebe at first tricks Rachel and tells her that the pregnancy test is negative, {{in order to achieve}} Rachel's real emotions on the realization of being pregnant. Rachel projects feelings of sadness when she thinks she's not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. The three of them rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy; Ross is revealed to be the father after an investigation involving a red sweater. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship. Joey develops romantic feelings for Rachel, but she does not reciprocate them. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale. At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey looks for some tissue for an upset Rachel, picks up Ross's jacket, and the ring falls to the floor. He kneels <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and turns to Rachel, still on his knees and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage.|$|E

5000|$|The person {{walks with}} the frame {{surrounding}} their front and sides and their hands provide additional support by {{holding on to}} the top of the sides of the frame. Traditionally, a walker is picked up and placed a short distance ahead of the user. The user then walks to it and repeats the process. With the use of wheels and glides, the user may push the walker ahead as opposed <b>to</b> <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> This makes for easier use of the walker, as it does not require the user to use their arms to lift the walker. This is beneficial for those with little arm strength.|$|R

Beginning the next day, a rerun package premiered in papers that had elected <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> (see below). Although Schulz did not draw any daily strips that were to run past January 3, he had drawn five extra Sunday strips and these had yet to run. The first of these strips appeared six days after the last daily on January 9.|$|E

25|$|With the {{addition}} of the server browser and custom server options in the February 2017, many of the Control maps can also be set to be played in casual game modes as Capture the Flag. Both teams have a flag they must defend from the opposing team. To pick up the opponent's flag, the player must keep their character close to the flag and not take damage for a few moments. Once they have the flag, they must race back to their home base to earn the capture point. If the character is killed, the flag is dropped and either the capturing team must follow similar rules <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> or if the owning team stays near the flag, it is automatically returned. A team can capture the opposing flag even if their flag has been taken. The match is over after one team obtains 3 captures or 5 minutes has expired, whichever comes first.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the International Football Association Board made {{changes in}} {{the laws of the}} game that {{affected}} goalkeepers – notably the back-pass rule, which prohibits goalkeepers from handling the ball when receiving a deliberate pass from a teammate that is made with their feet. This rule change was made to discourage time-wasting and overly defensive play after the 1990 FIFA World Cup which was described as exceedingly dull, rife with back-passing and goalkeepers holding the ball. Also, goalkeepers would frequently drop the ball and dribble it around, only <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> again once opponents came closer to put them under pressure, a typical time-wasting technique. Therefore, another rule was introduced {{at the same time as}} the back-pass rule. This rule prohibits the goalkeeper from handling the ball again once he or she has released it for play; an offence results in an indirect free kick to the opposition. Furthermore any player negating the spirit of the new rule would be likely to be cautioned for unsporting behaviour and punished by an indirect free-kick.|$|E
25|$|In {{some places}} in India, the corpse may {{be carried out}} of the house from the side door, rather than the front door so that the {{deceased}} does not find her way back in the house. If a woman dies during childbirth or during her menstrual cycle, her “corpse is anointed with five different products of the cow and special texts are recited.” In the Hilly regions, the place where a pregnant woman died is carefully scraped and the earth removed. The spot is then sown with mustard (sarson), which is also sprinkled along the road traversed by the corpse {{on its way to the}} burial ground. The reason behind this is that the mustard blossoms in the world of the dead, and the sweet smell pleases the spirit and keeps her content, so that she does not long to revisit her earthly home; secondly, the Churel rises from her grave at nightfall and seeks to return to her friends but when she sees the minute grains of the mustard scattered abroad and stoops <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> and while she is engaged, the sun rises and she is unable to visit her home. This story also tells us that the Churel usually only comes out during the night.|$|E
5000|$|The Nebraska Cornhuskers {{scored a}} famous {{touchdown}} in the 1984 Orange Bowl against the Miami Hurricanes on a fumblerooski play. The ball was deliberately left sitting on the field during a fake sweep, allowing Nebraska lineman Dean Steinkuhler <b>to</b> surreptitiously <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and run unchallenged towards the endzone. The play has subsequently been banned at most levels of competitive football.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next day}} (August 24) Donaldson {{held a press}} conference, {{becoming}} the first male prison-rape survivor to publicly recount his experiences; this resulted in [...] "massive and prolonged" [...] publicity (under his legal name, Robert Martin).

5000|$|... bump or hip and {{shoulder}} tackle {{is a legal}} Aussie rules tactic for both dispossession of the player with the ball and also impeding players involved in a contest but not in possession of the ball. The difference between a bump and a tackle is that arms are not used in a bump, which must be made side-on using the hip and or shoulder. Not all bumping is legal, however. Aggressive head on bumping or [...] "charging" [...] of a player with the ball {{is often described as}} [...] "rough play" [...] and is a reportable offence, this is particularly so if a player is deemed to have their head down over the ball in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> off the ground when the bump is applied or contact is made above the shoulders. Standing ground against an oncoming player, however, is legal.|$|R
25|$|The show premiered as The Seinfeld Chronicles on July 5, 1989. After it aired, {{a pickup}} by NBC seemed {{unlikely}} {{and the show}} was offered to Fox, which declined <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Rick Ludwin, head of late night and special events for NBC, however, diverted money from his budget by canceling a Bob Hope television special, and the next 4 episodes were filmed. These episodes were highly rated as they followed summer re-runs of Cheers on Thursdays at 9:30p.m., and the series was finally picked up. At one point NBC considered airing these episodes on Saturdays at 10:30p.m., but gave that slot to a short-lived sitcom called FM. The series was renamed Seinfeld after the failure of short-lived 1990 ABC series The Marshall Chronicles. After airing {{in the summer of}} 1990, NBC ordered thirteen more episodes. Larry David believed that he and Jerry Seinfeld had no more stories to tell, and advised Seinfeld to turn down the order, but Seinfeld agreed to the additional episodes. Season two was bumped off its scheduled premiere of January 16, 1991, due to the outbreak of the (Persian) Gulf War. It settled into a regular time slot on Wednesdays at 9:30p.m. and eventually flipped with veteran series Night Court to 9:00.|$|E
25|$|Bucs quarterback Trent Dilfer's 23-yard {{completion}} to Karl Williams {{on third}} down and 1 {{set up the}} first score of the game, Michael Husted's 22-yard field goal with 5:25 {{left in the first}} quarter. The Lions received a huge scoring opportunity when Williams fumbled a punt {{at the end of the}} next drive. Lions linebacker Matt Russell got to the ball first, but instead of falling on the ball, he tried <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and run with it. Instead of grabbing the ball, he accidentally batted it out of bounds, allowing the Bucs to keep possession on the Lions 11-yard line. Taking full advantage of their second chance, Tampa Bay subsequently drove 89 yards in 17 plays, taking 8:50 off the clock and converting three third downs, one from a 12-men on the field penalty against Detroit. Dilfer finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Horace Copeland that put the team up 10-0. Later on, Buccaneers cornerback Anthony Parker intercepted a pass from Mitchell and returned it 19 yards to the Lions 20-yard line, setting up Husted's 43-yard field goal that gave the team a 13-0 lead at the end of the half. Tampa Bay had a chance to increase their lead even more before halftime with a drive to the Lions 43, but Ron Rice intercepted a pass from Dilfer on the last play of the second quarter.|$|E

500|$|The wolf, {{after some}} complaint, agrees {{to this and}} the two proceed through the woods after the prize—all the while the fox {{considers}} how to trick the wolf.

However, this pulls up the other bucket, into which the fox has jumped, and so the two swap places; the wolf at the bottom of the well and the fox safely escaped. The narrator professes that he does not know who helped the wolf out of the well, but that the tale is at an end.|$|E
500|$|The Red Wings again won the Stanley Cup in 1951–52, {{defeating}} the Montreal Canadiens in the final. It was Pronovost's first full {{season in the}} NHL; he appeared in 69 regular season games and eight more in the playoffs. The Red Wings set a record that post-season by winning all eight games played – four by shutout – and the series spawned the Legend of the Octopus. When an octopus was thrown onto the ice {{near the end of}} the clinching game (the eight tentacles meant to represent the eight wins required to win the Stanley Cup at that time), Pronovost was the only player willing <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and remove it.

He also played in an ill-fated game in Montreal on March 17, 1955, in which fan anger over the NHL's suspension of Maurice Richard precipitated the Richard Riot.
