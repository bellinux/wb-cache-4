5|$|Some modern genealogical {{researchers}} consider John {{a possible}} father to Theodora Axouchina, wife of Emperor Alexios I Megas Komnenos of Trebizond (r. 1204–1222), {{but that is}} conjectural: <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> Axouchina is ascribed to her because her eldest son, the Trebizondian emperor John I Megas Komnenos Axouchos (r. 1235–1238), bore it as well.|$|E

50|$|In Indonesia, {{there are}} a number of ethnic groups with {{different}} naming systems. The Batak of North Sumatra (Sumatra Utara) give every child <b>the</b> <b>family's</b> <b>name.</b> Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>family's</b> <b>name</b> is prefixed by Huta-, Batu-, etc., but most use Si-, such as Sitanggang, Sihombing, Sibutar-butar, Sinaga, or Sitohang. <b>The</b> <b>family's</b> <b>name</b> is given from <b>the</b> father's <b>family.</b> For example, if the father's name is Boggi Sinaga who married to Moetia Siregar then all children will be given <b>family's</b> <b>name</b> of Sinaga.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>family</b> Münch von Münchenstein {{originated}} {{from the first}} son of Hugo I, Hugo II. Soon after, <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>names</b> Münch von Münchsberg and Münch von Büren/Sterenfels derived from this branch of <b>the</b> lineage. <b>The</b> <b>family</b> <b>names</b> Münchs von Landskron and Münch von Stettenberg/Alsace derived from the second son of Hugo I, Konrad II.|$|R
5|$|Culture: Although {{there are}} many {{differences}} between Eastern and Western cultures, including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures. In their study with subjects from Thailand, where <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name. Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for initials in Japan, where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> Fregatidae, {{cited as}} {{described}} in 1867 by French naturalists Côme-Damien Degland and Zéphirin Gerbe, was conserved under Article 40(b) of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature in preference to the 1840 description Tachypetidae by Johann Friedrich von Brandt. This was because the genus names Atagen and Tachypetes had been synonymised with Fregata before 1961, resulting in the aligning of family and genus names.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} part of the 12th century, the manor passed from the second Baron of Dunham Massey to Matthew de Bromale. According to Dean, Matthew's father is said to have founded the de Bromale family, naming himself after the manor, and he may have been related to or a {{follower}} of the de Masseys. He may have also held the manor at some point. The de Bromales held the manor until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married John de Davenport, and <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> was changed.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> English <b>family</b> <b>name</b> Dallinger {{has been}} theorized as {{deriving}} from Dellingr.

5|$|Linnæus {{was born}} in the village of Råshult in Småland, Sweden, on 23 May 1707. He was the first child of Nicolaus (Nils) Ingemarsson (who later adopted <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> Linnæus) and Christina Brodersonia. His {{siblings}} were Anna Maria Linnæa, Sofia Juliana Linnæa, Samuel Linnæus (who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on beekeeping), and Emerentia Linnæa.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists Jose Bonaparte and Fernando Novas {{coined the}} name Abelisauridae in 1985 when they {{described}} the eponymous Abelisaurus. The name is formed from <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> of Roberto Abel, who discovered Abelisaurus, {{as well as}} from the Greek word σαυρος/sauros meaning 'lizard'. The very common suffix -idae is usually applied to zoological family names and is derived from the Greek suffix -ιδαι/-idai, which indicates a plural noun.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> {{most likely}} {{derives from the}} Slavic kača (snake), the closest word to the name Kačić. Based on etymology, {{it is likely that}} the Hungarian Kačićs (Kacsics) are {{originally}} of Slavic rather than Hungarian origin. Latin sources also refer to the name as de genere Chacittorum, generatione Cacich, genus Chacittorum, nobiles de Cacich, Caçici, Cacicii, Cacicli, Caciki, Cazethi, Cazichi, Cazziki, Chacichi and Kazzeti. The Kačić name is distinct from the similar-sounding name of another noble family, Kašić (Chasich), and its derivations (Kasig, Kasige).|$|E

5|$|The genus name Knoetschkesuchus {{combines}} <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> of Nils Knötschke, {{a researcher}} at the DFMMh who was responsible for the collection, curation, and preparation of Langenberg Quarry specimens, with the common crocodilian suffix suchus, from the Greek souchos ("crocodile"). Meanwhile, the species name langenbergensis is in reference to the provenance of this species from the Langenberg Quarry.|$|E
5|$|The type {{species is}} M. carinatus; seven other {{species have been}} named during the past 150years, but only M. kaalae among these is still {{considered}} valid. Early sauropodomorphs systematics have undergone numerous revisions during the last several years, and many scientists disagree where exactly Massospondylus lies on the dinosaur evolutionary tree. <b>The</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> Massospondylidae was once coined for the genus, but because knowledge of early sauropodomorph relationships {{is in a state}} of flux, it is unclear which other dinosaurs—if any—belong in a natural grouping of massospondylids; several 2007 papers support the family's validity.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Hamilton's early life. He was the third son of Alexander (died 1768) and Margaret Hamilton (died 1742). His two older {{brothers}} were Alexander (died 1783) and Gavin Hamilton (1723–1798), the latter a painter and archeologist in Rome. Inglis was added to <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> in 1719 {{as a condition of}} the will by which Alexander Inglis bequeathed Murdostoun to his nephew Alexander Hamilton, James's father.|$|E

5|$|Claiborne {{was born}} the county of Kent in England in 1600 to Thomas Clayborn, an {{alderman}} and lord mayor from King's Lynn, Norfolk, who made his living as a small-scale businessman involved {{in a variety of}} industries, including the salt and fish trades, and Sarah Smith, the daughter of a London brewer. <b>The</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> was spelled alternately as Cleburn, Cleyborne, or Claiborne. William Claiborne, who was baptized in 1600, was the younger of two sons. The family's business was not profitable enough to make it rich, and so Claiborne's older brother was apprenticed in London, becoming a merchant involved in hosiery and, eventually, the tobacco trade.|$|E
5|$|Greene's wife Martha died in 1883 {{at an age}} of 74. Their oldest son, Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene, was the {{executive}} officer on the ironclad ship USS Monitor during the Battle of Hampton Roads. Another of their sons, Francis V. Greene, commanded a brigade at the Battle of Manila during the Spanish–American War. A third, Charles Thurston Greene, was a lieutenant on his father's staff at Culp's Hill. Later in 1863, Charles was wounded by an artillery shell and his leg was amputated, but he remained on active service until 1870. George Sears Greene, Jr., volunteered to serve but {{was not allowed to}} do so by his father so he could survive and carry on <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
5|$|Helene Bertha Amalie Riefenstahl {{was born}} in Germany on 22 August 1902. Her father, Alfred Theodor Paul Riefenstahl, owned a {{successful}} heating and ventilation company and wanted his daughter to follow him into the business world. Since Riefenstahl was the only child for several years, Alfred wanted her to carry on <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> and secure the family fortune. However, her mother, Bertha Ida (Scherlach), {{who had been a}} part-time seamstress before her marriage, had faith in Riefenstahl and believed that her daughter's future was in show business. Riefenstahl had a younger brother, Heinz, who was killed at the age of 39 on the Eastern Front in Nazi Germany's war against the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, in {{response}} to the wave of anti-German feeling that surrounded the war, George V changed <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also disposed of his family's German titles and styles, so Christian, Helena and their daughters simply became Prince and Princess Christian; Princess Helena Victoria and Marie Louise with no territorial designation. Helena's surviving son, Albert, fought {{on the side of the}} Prussians, though he made it clear that he would not fight against his mother's country. In the same year, on 8 October, Prince Christian died at Schomberg House. Her last years were spent arguing with Commissioners, who tried to turn her out of Schomberg and Cumberland Lodge because of the expense of running her households. They failed, as clear evidence of her right to live in those residences for life was shown.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Youngblood was a Second-team All-pro {{selection}} {{and went to}} the first of his seven Pro Bowls and led the Rams with 16½ sacks. The Ram defense led the NFL in fewest yards allowed and fewest rushing yards. He was voted the Rams defensive lineman {{of the year by the}} Rams Alumni Association. Beginning in the 1973 season, the Rams added the unrelated Jim Youngblood to its roster, so from that time on, both Youngbloods had the unique distinction of having their entire name on the back of their jerseys, the given name appearing above <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name.</b> The following year, 1974, the Rams again led the NFL in rushing defense and Youngblood led the Rams with 15 sacks while being voted a consensus First-team All-Pro. The Rams advanced to the NFC Championship game, losing 14-10 to the Minnesota Vikings.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{was born}} under <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>name</b> of Pătraşcu. In 1601, during {{a stay in}} Prague, he was portrayed by the painter Aegidius Sadeler, who {{mentioned}} on the portrait the words aetatis XLIII ("in the 43rd year of life"), which indicates 1558 as the year of Michael's birth. Very {{little is known about}} his childhood and early years as an adult. He is argued by most historians to have been the illegitimate son of Wallachian Prince Pătraşcu cel Bun, (Pătrașcu the Good) of the Drăculeşti branch of the House of Basarab, while others believe he merely invented his descent in order to justify his rule. His mother was Theodora Kantakouzene, a member of the Kantakouzenoi, a noble family present in Wallachia and Moldavia, and allegedly descended from the Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos.|$|E
