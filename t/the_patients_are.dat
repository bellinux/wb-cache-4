Meanwhile, Two-Face's mental condition has deteriorated as a result of Adams' therapy; she replaced Two-Face's trademark coin with a six-sided die then a tarot deck, in each instance increasing the number of choices he has (as opposed to two choices from his original coin) in the hope that he will eventually not leave any of his choices up to chance. Instead, the treatment renders him incapable of even making simple decisions, such as going to the bathroom.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to present our {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic experience with antiphospholipide syndrome (APS) and vascular thrombosis.

25|$|A silent stroke is {{a stroke}} {{that does not}} have any outward symptoms, and <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} unaware they have had a stroke. Despite not causing identifiable symptoms, a silent stroke still damages the brain, and places the patient at increased risk for both transient ischemic attack and major stroke in the future. Conversely, those who have had a major stroke are also at risk of having silent strokes. In a broad study in 1998, more than 11 million people were estimated to have experienced a stroke in the United States. Approximately 770,000 of these strokes were symptomatic and 11 million were first-ever silent MRI infarcts or hemorrhages. Silent strokes typically cause lesions which are detected via the use of neuroimaging such as MRI. Silent strokes are estimated to occur at five times the rate of symptomatic strokes. The risk of silent stroke increases with age, but may also affect younger adults and children, especially those with acute anemia.|$|E
25|$|The {{pre-operative}} {{assessment of}} patients has turned more patient-goal oriented. This means that <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>are</b> asked {{to define their}} goals before surgery. In order to evaluate this the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was developed. This test {{is based on the}} World Health Organisation's framework of measuring health and disability: The International Classification of Function(ICF): This framework measures health and disability by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. Functional deﬁcits can be measured according to the level of loss of structure and function, the level of activity limitations, and the level of restriction in social participation. Reaching or gripping represents the integration of strength, sensation and range of motion, and therefore occur at the individual level rather than at the organ system level. For this reason, reaching and gripping are on the ICF level of activities. However, this level includes a broad range of activities, from basic activities (for example grasping and moving objects) to complex activities (such as dressing, grooming). It is useful to make a distinction between basic activities and complex activities.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1918, Dr. Cadbury treated lepers, {{who were}} outpatients in the Canton Hospital leprosy clinic, for one year. The Canton Hospital {{was the first}} to have an {{organized}} leprosy clinic in China. He injected these patients with a mixture of chaulmoogra oil, resorcin, and camphorated oil. Then, he reported the results in The China Medical Journal in 1920. He wrote:"We must state that the various remedies, as outlined above, while in most cases of leprosy they have definite therapeutic value, yet unless <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>are</b> cared for in a sanatorium, given proper food, together with baths and attention to personal hygiene, a complete cure can hardly be looked for."In 1926, Dr. Cadbury tackled widespread issue of Chinese children not knowing their birth dates. He collected information from 1013 Cantonese children. His calculations to estimate the ages of these children revealed an understanding of the customs of the Canton people. For example, he learned that most of the children claimed they were born in August, September, and October most likely due to the tradition that Canton merchants were gone for most of the year except around Chinese New Year.|$|E

500|$|The Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps (TVAC) {{was created}} in 1939 to serve the {{residents}} of Teaneck. TVAC has always been Teaneck's only emergency ambulance service and includes over 100 volunteers and four ambulances, serving Teaneck and its residents around the clock, without pay. In 2011, TVAC responded to over 4,300 emergency calls, routinely saving lives and reducing suffering with their rapid response and application of Basic Life Support skills. [...] Throughout the last 70 years, TVAC has never charged a patient nor the patient's family for service. The services of the Corps are entirely free of charge, whether <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>are</b> residents of Teaneck, visitors, or individuals who need medical service while passing through the town. The Corps also renders service in nearby towns {{as part of a}} mutual aid system, again without charge.|$|E
500|$|Medications are {{modestly}} {{effective at}} decreasing {{the number of}} attacks in RRMS and in reducing the accumulation of brain lesions, which is measured using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Interferons and glatiramer acetate are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% and their safe profile make them the first-line treatments. Nevertheless, not all <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>are</b> responsive to these therapies. It is known that 30% of MS patients are non-responsive to Beta interferon. [...] One of the factors related to non-respondance {{is the presence of}} high levels of interferon beta neutralizing [...] antibodies. Interferon therapy, and specially interferon beta-1b, induces the production of [...] neutralizing [...] antibodies, usually in the second 6 months of treatment, in 5 to 30% of treated patients. Moreover, a subset of RRMS patients with specially active MS, sometimes called [...] "rapidly worsening MS" [...] are normally non-responders to immunomodulators and are treated with either mitoxantrone or natalizumab.|$|E

2500|$|In 1972, Romalis {{started the}} {{practise}} {{of obstetrics and}} gynecology. Abortion law in Canada had been liberalized in 1969. In his practice, Romalis and his partners saw many women who wanted to terminate a pregnancy. He therefore learned how to perform abortions. Romalis finds providing abortion services often stressful because <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>are</b> very stressed. He states, [...] "Usually, an unplanned, unwanted pregnancy is the worst trouble the patient has ever been in in her entire life." [...] He added, [...] "by performing a five-minute operation, in comfort and dignity, I can give her back her life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{dismantling}} of the false self [...] "leaves the impaired real self {{with the opportunity to}} convert its potential and its possibilities into actualities." [...] Working through brings unique rewards, of which the most important element is the growing realization that the individual has a fundamental, internal need for relatedness that may be expressed in a variety of ways. [...] "Only schizoid patients", suggests Klein, [...] "who have worked through the abandonment depression... ultimately will believe that the capacity for relatedness and the wish for relatedness are woven into the structure of their beings, that they are truly part of who <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>are</b> and what they contain as human beings. It is this sense that finally allows the schizoid patient to feel the most intimate sense of being connected with humanity more generally, and with another person more personally. For the schizoid patient, this degree of certainty is the most gratifying revelation, and a profound new organizer of the self experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Patients in coma, vegetative, or {{minimally}} conscious state pose ethical challenges. <b>The</b> <b>patients</b> <b>are</b> {{unable to}} respond, therefore {{the assessment of}} their needs can only be approached by adopting a third person perspective. They are unable to communicate their pain levels, quality of life, or end of life preferences. Neuroscience and brain imaging have allowed us to explore the brain activity of these patients more thoroughly. Recent findings from studies using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} have changed the way we view vegetative patients. The images have shown that aspects emotional processing, language comprehension and even conscious awareness might be retained in patients whose behavior suggests a vegetative state. If this is the case, it is unethical to allow a third party to dictate the life and future of the patient. [...] For example, defining death is an issue that comes with patients with severe traumatic brain injuries. The decision to withdraw life-sustaining care from these patients can be based on uncertain assessments about the individual's conscious awareness. Case reports have shown that these patients in a persistent vegetative state can recover unexpectedly. This raises the ethical question about the premature termination of care by physicians. The hope is that one day, neuroimaging technologies can help us to define these different states of consciousness and enable us to communicate with patients in vegetative states {{in a way that was}} never before possible. The clinical translation of these advanced technologies is of vital importance for the medical management of these challenging patients. In this situation, neuroscience has both revealed ethical issues and possible solutions.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though their}} group was {{traditionally}} {{viewed as a}} monolith, the members of Cioculescu's generation often aimed their critical remarks at each other. The debate between Călinescu and Cioculescu was therefore echoed in the former's History of Romanian Literature (first edition 1941), which spoke of Cioculescu as [...] "a major personality" [...] with [...] "an enormous capacity for literary pleasure", but reproached his [...] "fear of commitment" [...] and his [...] "slowness" [...] in entering cultural debates, {{as well as his}} interest in details. Ştefănescu writes that Cioculescu made a point of downplaying Călinescu's synthesis, [...] "with the manifest intent of finding cracks in the marble monument". Călinescu also viewed his colleague's tastes as problematic, particularly in matters of poetry assessment, and claimed that such pronouncements tended to fluctuate between [...] "the minimum and the maximum." [...] In his view, Cioculescu had failed to adequately understand the narrative power of works by Liviu Rebreanu (Răscoala) and Mihail Sadoveanu, and had preferred to state objections to minor aspects of their work—all while maintaining an exterior politeness which [...] "promises nothing good to the victim." [...] The book also featured references to clashes between Cioculescu and various other critics of the day, noting that the former's tone [...] "is very cold, but <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>are</b> being led to the door with ceremony". Commenting with irony on his entry in the same volume, Cioculescu himself stated, years after his rival's death: [...] "I would be an ingrate not to thank the shadow of G. Călinescu for having publicly spared me, it being more suited to him to have me destroyed 'in confidence'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Researchers {{believe that}} [...] "failure of inhibition" [...] {{has no effect}} on {{implicit}} processing, but instead is the cause of impairments in the explicit task of speech production. They believe that explicit characteristics of reading involve only the conscious production of speech (reading). Information about written words is internalized without awareness (implicitly); the ability to access this information and process it into words that can be read or spoken is an explicit process. [...] Implicit knowledge involves phonological awareness, understanding of the morphology, and a semantic understanding of written words. This implicit aspect of reading may be completely intact, and yet reading errors can still occur through defects in explicit output, or production. Researchers have studied the dissociation of implicit and explicit processes to thus unravel the underlying deficiencies in deep dyslexia. Studies in support of [...] "failure of inhibition" [...] show intact implicit processing of deep dyslexics. For instance, studies have shown deep dyslexics that are equally fast in a lexical decision task with a rhyming pair of words (book-took) in comparison to a non-rhyming pair of words (bough-tough), indicating that <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>are</b> able to use implicit phonological knowledge and phonics to process the words. Additionally, they are faster in a lexical decision task with words that sound like they are spelled (couch, pouch) than they are with words that do not sound like they are spelled (touch), again showing that patients are using phonology. These data show that implicit processing is in fact occurring in deep dyslexic patients. Thus, some researchers believe that the impairments present in deep dyslexics are only in explicit phonological output (i.e., reading aloud). They believe that the problems of deep dyslexics are due to production errors, and that deep dyslexics have normal phonological processing at the implicit level. This is supported by the fact that deep dyslexia is often present in patients suffering from production errors resulting from Expressive aphasia.|$|E
