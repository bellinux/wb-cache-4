5|$|There is {{debate about}} {{the exact nature of}} phreatomagmatic eruptions, and some {{scientists}} believe that fuel-coolant reactions may be more critical to the explosive nature than <b>thermal</b> <b>contraction.</b> Fuel coolant reactions may fragment the volcanic material by propagating stress waves, widening cracks and increasing surface area that ultimately leads to rapid cooling and explosive contraction-driven eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions {{that arise}} from {{interactions}} between water and magma. They are driven from <b>thermal</b> <b>contraction</b> (as opposed to magmatic eruptions, which are driven by thermal expansion) of magma when it comes in contact with water. This temperature {{difference between the two}} causes violent water-lava interactions that make up the eruption. The products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and finer grained than the products of magmatic eruptions because of the differences in eruptive mechanisms.|$|E

The installation is based on the use of geometric information derived from mechanical measurements performed in warm conditions, assuming that geometric and magnetic axes coincide, and that <b>thermal</b> <b>contractions</b> of the assembly are homothetic.

In this paper, a statistical analysis of the correlations obtained is presented for both corrector alignment and main field direction, and the results are compared with beam optics-based specifications...|$|R

25|$|The use of lead glaze {{has several}} {{advantages}} over alkali glazes {{in addition to}} their greater optical refractivity. Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the ceramic body. Alkali glazes must first be mixed with silica and fritted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful glaze must not crawl, or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the surface tension of the glaze. It must not craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the <b>thermal</b> <b>contraction</b> of the glaze and the ceramic body do not match properly. Ideally, the glaze contraction should be 5–15% less than the body contraction, as glazes are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead glaze has a linear expansion coefficient of between 5 and 7×10−6/°C, compared to 9 to 10×10−6/°C for alkali glazes. Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5×10−6/°C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7×10−6/°C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15–25% CaO. Therefore, the <b>thermal</b> <b>contraction</b> of lead glaze matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali glaze, rendering it less prone to crazing. A glaze should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of pinholes as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900–1100°C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead glaze mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali glazes.|$|E
25|$|Planimetrically arcuate escarpments in the Discovery {{quadrangle}} cut intercrater {{plains and}} crater materials {{as young as}} c4. These scarps are typically 100 to 400km long and 0.5 to 1.0km high, and they have convex-upward slopes in cross section that steepen from brink to base. More trend closer to north-south than to east-west. Discovery (lat 55° S., long 38° W.), Vostok (lat 38° S., long 20° W.), Adventure (lat 64° S., long 63° W.), and Resolution (lat 63° S., long 52° W.) Rupes are the most prominent examples in the quadrangle. Vostok transects and foreshortens the crater Guido d'Arezzo, which suggests that arcuate scarps are compressional tectonic features (thrust or high-angle reverse faults). Melosh and Dzurisin have speculated that both arcuate scarps and the global mercurian lineament pattern may have formed {{as a result of}} simultaneous despinning and <b>thermal</b> <b>contraction</b> of Mercury.|$|E

These four transfer lines will be installed between a refrigerator {{on the surface and}} an interconnection box located 80 m to 145 m underground. They consist of a vacuum jacket, a thermal screen and four internal helium pipes. Due to space and accessibility limitations, the lines have been specified without bellows or bends of any kind in the long vertical part; the <b>thermal</b> <b>contractions</b> must be compensated at the surface only. The displacement due to these contractions amounts to more than 35 cm in one case, and all four internal pipes, as well as the thermal screen, must be able to contract and expand independently. The lines will be built and installed by a consortium of Linde AG and Babcock Noell Nuclear GmbH. Their technical design choices are presented together with expected performance...|$|R
2500|$|The {{properties}} of silicon {{can be used}} to modify alloys with metals other than iron. [...] "Metallurgical grade" [...] silicon is silicon of 95–99% purity. About 55% of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium-silicon alloys (silumin alloys) for aluminium part casts, mainly for use in the automotive industry. Silicon's importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount (12%) of silicon in aluminium forms a eutectic mixture which solidifies with very little <b>thermal</b> <b>contraction.</b> This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity. Silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminium.|$|E
2500|$|Increases in bore {{and stroke}} gave the D.4 {{more than twice the}} swept volume of the C.4 and roughly doubled its power. The cast-steel cylinders, {{individually}} machined inside and out, were mounted separately onto a flat-sided aluminium crankcase. They were fastened down by long bolts between them, which reached into the crankcase to support the four inner crankshaft bearings. The main bearings were in the crankcase ends, and the ball race was designed to allow either pusher or tractor operation. A flywheel was fitted to the output shaft. Thin cylindrical copper water jackets surrounded the cylinders almost to their base, where a rubber ring, located by a circumferential groove in the cylinder, provided a sliding water seal that allowed for the differential <b>thermal</b> <b>contraction</b> of copper and steel. [...] Cooling water was fed to these jackets by an engine-driven pump via a horizontal tube on the low right side of the engine, assuming a tractor orientation, and fed to the radiator by another tube on the top left.|$|E

50|$|Another example {{where they}} aid locking {{is a joint}} that {{experiences}} {{a large amount of}} <b>thermal</b> expansion and <b>contraction.</b> They will supply the required pre-load, but the bolt may have an additional locking mechanism (like Thread-locking fluid) that would fail without the Belleville. Belleville washers should never overhang the joint they are trying to secure, as all of their clamping force is on the outside perimeter edge of the washer. If a belleville washer overhangs a joint, its clamping effectiveness is exponentially reduced, and it is a poor application that will eventually fail under <b>thermal</b> expansion and <b>contraction.</b>|$|R
40|$|Integral {{abutment}} {{construction has}} become a popular alternative to conventional bridge construction for short and intermediate length bridges. Integral abutment construction eliminates joints and bearings which reduce long-term maintenance costs. However, {{in the absence of}} joints and bearings, the bridge abutments and foundations must be able to accommodate lateral movements from <b>thermal</b> expansion and <b>contraction</b> of the superstructure and from seismic events. Previous research has focused on the response to <b>thermal</b> expansion and <b>contraction.</b> The current research examines the response of integral abutment bridges to seismic loading. A field investigation was conducted to examine the response of an integral abutment to lateral loading from <b>thermal</b> expansion and <b>contraction.</b> The results were used to calibrate analytical bridge models used to estimate displacements of the abutment during design seismic events. A laboratory investigation was conducted to estimate the lateral displacement capacity of the abutment based on the performance of the abutment-pile connection. Results of the field, analytical, and laboratory investigations were used to evaluate allowable bridge lengths based on seismic performance. Alternate abutment-pile connection details are proposed which will increase seismic performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Modelling and {{targeted}} experimentation {{are used to}} quantify the processing conditions which cause recrystallization in a single-crystal superalloy. The plasticity needed is traced to the differential <b>thermal</b> <b>contractions</b> of the metal and its ceramic mould during processing. For typical cooling rates, the plasticity causing recrystallization is induced above 1000 °C, thus over a temperature interval of approximately 300 °C after solidification is complete. The total accumulated plastic strain needed for recrystallization {{is estimated to be}} in the range of 2 - 3 %. Modelling is used to rationalize the influence of mould thickness, stress concentration factor and geometry on the induced plasticity. Negligible plastic strains were predicted in a solid casting with no stress concentration features, as found experimentally. However, recrystallization occurred in thin-walled sections, particularly beneath shroud-like features due to the plasticity induced there. The model provides the foundation for a systems-based approach which enables recrystallization to be predicted and thus avoided in new designs of turbine blade aerofoil. © 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|An advanced, modular bottom-supported cryomodule {{design is}} {{described}} which is highly optimized for mass-production and efficient precision-assembly. The FRIB driver linac uses 4 types of superconducting resonators and 2 solenoid lengths {{which in turn}} require 7 individual cryomodule configurations. To meet alignment tolerances a precision-machined bolted cryomodule rail system is described.

40|$|This work {{establishes}} {{a method of}} controlling the c-axis-oriented structure of α-Fe (soft magnetic) /L 1 _ 0 -FePd (hard magnetic) thin films in the dual-phase compositional region in thermal equilibrium. Two types of thin films were prepared; one is a single-layered thin film, {{and the other is}} a multilayered film, [FePd(x nm) /Fe(5  nm) ]_n (x: thickness, n: the number of multilayers), both of which are deposited on silica glass substrates. For single-layered films, the ordering process is retarded by phase separation that requires long-range diffusion. In this case, the 〈 111 〉 oriented domains preferentially grow from the film surface, and the c-axis-oriented structure is not obtained. On the contrary, for multilayered films, each FePd layer can undergo ordering without phase separation subject to the constraint of strong biaxial tensile stress resulting from the difference in the <b>thermal</b> <b>contractions</b> between Fe/FePd film and the silica glass substrate. Consequently, the L 1 _ 0 domains with c-axis orientation in the normal direction of the film surface are preferentially formed in the initial amorphouslike structure, eventually leading to the desired c-axis-oriented structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} third-generation gravitational-wave {{detectors}} requires dedicated sensors to perform very accurate {{measurements of the}} residual motion of mechanical components cooled down at cryogenic temperatures and accommodated close to the test masses. For this reason, we developed a vertical accelerometer prototype derived by the classical scheme widely used in Virgo seismic suspension control. <b>Thermal</b> <b>contractions</b> are the main concern when cooling down such a device and the calibration check at low temperature, {{in the absence of}} commercial sensors working in parallel, plays a crucial role. The accelerometer was conceived to be used at low frequencies (0. 3 – 3 [*]Hz) in a quite specific environment, where the noise produced by cryocoolers has to be suppressed. However, it can be easily operated over a wider frequency band, up to ~ 100 [*]Hz. The achieved sensitivity is ~ 10 − 8 [*]m[*]s− 2 below 3 [*]Hz. During 2013, the device was successfully installed in the KAGRA cryostat, where it was tested at low temperatures down to 8 [*]K and provided the measurement of vertical vibrational modes of the inner thermal shield...|$|R

50|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>contraction</b> theory {{states that}} during the winter months, <b>thermal</b> <b>contraction</b> cracks form only a few cm wide {{and a couple of}} metres deep because of the extreme cold weather. Over the next few months, the snow melts and the {{remaining}} water fills the cracks and the permafrost below the surface freezes it. These tiny cracks turn into permafrost.

For both materials, we measured the difference in their heat capacities from 60 to 325 K, inelastic neutron-scattering spectra at four values of Q at 11 and at 300 K, and Young's moduli and coefficients of thermal expansion. The difference in heat capacity at low temperatures was consistent with a harmonic model using the phonon density of states (DOS) curves determined from the inelastic neutron-scattering spectra. In contrast, at temperatures greater than 160 K the difference in heat capacity did not approach zero, as expected of harmonic behavior. The temperature dependence of the phonon DOS {{can be used to}} approximately account for the anharmonic contributions to the differential heat capacity. We also argue that some of the anharmonic behavior should originate with a microstructural contribution to the heat capacity involving anisotropic <b>thermal</b> <b>contractions</b> of the D 022 structure.
