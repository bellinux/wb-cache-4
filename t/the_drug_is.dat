5|$|Adalimumab {{is a drug}} {{targeting}} TNF alpha. Its name {{can be broken down}} into ada-lim-u-mab. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> a human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune system. If adalimumab had been named after 2009, it would have been adalumab.|$|E
5|$|Olaratumab is an antineoplastic. Its name is {{composed}} of the components olara-t-u-mab. This shows that <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> a human monoclonal antibody acting against tumors.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the breast}} cancer {{medication}} trastuzumab can be analyzed as tras-tu-zu-mab. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> a humanized monoclonal antibody used against a tumor.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} by Amgen and is marketed under the trade name Nplate through a restricted usage program called NEXUS. [...] During development and clinical trials <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> called AMG531.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> {{approved}} {{for use in}} the European Union by the European Commission on December 3, 2010. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> approved by <b>the</b> US Food and Drug Administration on July 20, 2011.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} in <b>the</b> 1960s by Hoechst AG (now Sanofi-Aventis), who then test marketed {{it in the}} United States. It was an effective antidepressant, without sedative effects. Nomifensine did not interact significantly with alcohol and lacked anticholinergic effects. No withdrawal symptoms were seen after 6 months treatment. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> however considered not suitable for agitated patients as it presumably made agitation worse. In January 1986 <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn by its manufacturers for safety reasons.|$|R
5|$|Alprazolam {{and other}} benzodiazepines may also cause the {{development}} of physical dependence, tolerance, and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment. There is a higher chance of withdrawal reactions if <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> administered in a higher dosage than recommended, or if a person stops taking the medication altogether without slowly allowing the body to adjust to a lower-dosage regimen.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> marketed under many {{brand and}} generic names {{including}} Aldocumar, Anasmol, Anticoag, Befarin, Cavamed, Cicoxil, Circuvit, Cofarin, Coumadin, Coumadine, Cumar, Farin, Foley, Haemofarin, Jantoven, Kovar, Lawarin, Maforan, Marevan, Marfarin, Marivanil, Martefarin, Morfarin, Orfarin, Panwarfin, Scheme, Simarc, Varfarin, Varfarins, Varfine, Waran, Warcok, Warf, Warfareks, Warfarin, Warfarina, Warfarine, Warfarinum, Warfen, Warfin, Warik, Warin, Warlin, and Zyfarin.|$|E
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When {{administered}} to rats, echitamine was absorbed rapidly from the tissues and was detected in circulation within 30 min. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> level reached a maximum value by 2 h and then decreased steadily. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> had completely {{disappeared from the}} blood in 6 h. The presence of echitamine was observed within 2 h in urine and {{the maximum amount of}} <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> excreted between 2 and 4 h. About 90 % of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> excreted in urine in 24 h and <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> could not <b>be</b> detected in urine after 48 h. Along with echitamine, its metabolites were also detected in the urine. Plumbagin was not detected in blood upto 24 h when administered into rats. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> detected in urine within 4 h after administration; a major portion of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> excreted in urine by 24 h and traces of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>were</b> observed in <b>the</b> urine even after 48 h...|$|R
30|$|The TGA {{thermograms}} of PG and CQ {{suggested that}} <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> not thermally stable. PG exhibited a curve, indicating a rapid {{rate of degradation}} (Fig.  6 b). CQ exhibited two steps of weight loss. The weight loss of <b>the</b> free <b>drugs</b> <b>was</b> rapid, while <b>the</b> weight loss of the hydrogel loaded with <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> steady. This observation suggested that the hydrogels enhanced the thermal stability of <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> which <b>is</b> attributed to {{the high degree of}} crosslinking of the hydrogel and interaction between rGO and the polymeric network (Fig.  6 b) [17].|$|R

5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 meter and 200 meter sprints. Williams, who would later compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics, was disqualified because she admitted that she used a banned substance. She voluntarily told her Olympic committee about using a banned substance, and it was announced on July 29 that she would not compete. Williams admitted to using a drug named Blast Off Red, which is typically used to enhance the performance of racehorses and greyhounds. Williams had posted on Facebook that she was innocent and had passed drug tests prior to the Olympics. While <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> not listed as prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, it falls into the category of veterinary medicine and therefore its use is not permitted.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{the most}} {{successful}} commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E
50|$|Depo-Provera was {{clinically}} {{tested on}} black Rhodesian (now Zimbabwean) {{women in the}} 1970s. Once approved, <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> used as a population control measure.

5|$|Fairley's {{proposed}} use of atebrin as a prophylactic {{agent was}} accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute problem {{at this time}} was a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} much safer than quinine. Blackwater fever—which had a mortality rate of 25%—disappeared entirely.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Dallas {{electrician}} and rodeo cowboy Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) {{is diagnosed}} with AIDS and given 30 days to live. He initially refuses {{to accept the}} diagnosis, but remembers having unprotected sex {{with a woman who}} was an intravenous drug user. He is soon ostracized by family and friends and gets fired from his job, believed by family, friends and coworkers to have had homosexual relations, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Dr. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as {{this is the only way}} they can determine if <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> working.|$|E
5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. <b>The</b> <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E
