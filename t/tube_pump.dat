The intensely heated gas produced {{in such a}} tube {{can be used to}} drive light gas guns and shock tubes.

The first concept involves the use of one or more diaphragms in the <b>pump</b> <b>tube,</b> thus replacing a single compression process by multiple, successive compressions. The second concept involves a radical reduction in the length-to-diameter ratio of the <b>pump</b> <b>tube</b> and the <b>pump</b> <b>tube</b> piston.

40|$|Abstract—Recent medical {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the importance of enteral feeding {{and the use of}} feeding pumps for recovering patients unable to feed themselves or gain nourishment and nutrients by natural means. The most of enteral feeding system uses a peristaltic <b>tube</b> <b>pump.</b> A peristaltic pump is a form of positive displacement pump in which a flexible tube is progressively squeezed externally to allow the resulting enclosed pillow of fluid to progress along it. The squeezing of the tube requires a precise and robust controller of the geared motor to overcome parametric uncertainty of the pumping system which generates due to a wide variation of friction and slip between tube and roller. So, this paper proposes fuzzy adaptive controller for the robust control of the peristaltic <b>tube</b> <b>pump.</b> This new adaptive controller uses a fuzzy multi-layered architecture which has several independent fuzzy controllers in parallel, each with different robust stability area. Out of several independent fuzzy controllers, the most suited one is selected by a system identifier which observes variations in the controlled system parameter. This paper proposes a design procedure which can be carried out mathematically and systematically from the model of a controlled system. Finally, the good control performance, accurate dose rate and robust system stability, of the developed feeding pump is confirmed through experimental and clinic testing...|$|E

40|$|Herein, {{we study}} the {{technique}} of improving the gun performance by installing a diaphragm in the <b>pump</b> <b>tube</b> of the gun. A CFD study is carried out for the 0. 28 in. gun in the Hypervelocity Free Flight Radiation (HFF RAD) range at the NASA Ames Research Center. The normal, full-length <b>pump</b> <b>tube</b> is studied {{as well as two}} <b>pump</b> <b>tubes</b> of reduced length (approximately 75 % and approximately 33 % of the normal length). Significant improvements in performance are calculated to be gained for the reduced length <b>pump</b> <b>tubes</b> upon the addition of the diaphragm. These improvements are identified as reductions in maximum pressures in the <b>pump</b> <b>tube</b> and at the projectile base of approximately 20 %, while maintaining the projectile muzzle velocity or as increases in muzzle velocity of approximately 0. 5 km/sec while not increasing the maximum pressures in the gun. Also, it is found that both guns with reduced <b>pump</b> <b>tube</b> length (with diaphragms) could maintain the performance of gun with the full length <b>pump</b> <b>tube</b> without diaphragms, whereas the guns with reduced <b>pump</b> <b>tube</b> lengths without diaphragms could not.

40|$|Abstract. Current space launch is {{expensive}} and low-efficient because the invalid load [...] rocket and fuel in it occupies over 80 % {{of the total}} launch weight. A solution to reduce the space launch cost and increase the launch efficiency is to construct the evacuated <b>tube,</b> <b>pump</b> air out from the tube and have the maglev vehicle loaded with the spacecraft run in it; the spacecraft fly out the tube when the maglev is accelerated to ultra-speed, e. g. 5 km/s even 8 km/s in the tube. By this way, the first class of the rocket could be saved, so that the launch cost would be low and lead the large scale space exploitation to become reality in the soon future. As for the tube construction, the route layout should be concerned on at first. Because of the engineering restriction, the height at the tube end wouldn’t be very high, and the embedding depth wouldn’t be very deep, practically about 8 km. However, the tube length will be 700 km at least, a completely straight tube or a completely curve tube (on a single circle) would lead a too small launch angle. Thus {{both of them are}} not feasible. Reasonable tube routes in vertical section will include two or more than two segments, for example, a straight tube segment and a curve tube segment, or two or more than two curve segments in different radius or different curve direction. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{appearance}} of the valveless piezoelectric pump with cone-shaped tubes influences directly the classification of pumps. The conventional volume-type reciprocating pump is divided into the pumps using valve, but the cone-shaped <b>tube</b> <b>pump</b> {{does not have any}} valve from a common sense perspective. And in the definition of non-rotary pump, the valveless concept was thus generated. The emergence of the valveless piezoelectric pump with cone-shaped tubes also manifests the discovery of a novel driving source, piezoelectric vibrator, which can convert electric energy into mechanical strain energy of piezoelectric ceramic, and then transfer the mechanical strain into kinetic or potential energy of fluid through pump chamber and cone-shaped tube. This pump breaks through the banal definition of conventional pump and driving source, and eliminates the maladjustment between conventional pump and new driving source, as well as between new function and old principle [3]. It is like a spring breeze blowing into the traditional industry of pump. Unlike the situation in a conventional pump with valve(s) and vibrator(s), no compromise should be made in the valveless piezoelectric pump with cone-shaped tubes because the cone-shaped tube with dynamic unidirectional character matches the driving source, piezoelectric vibrator, surprisingly well. Thanks to the facts that the driving source matches channel and the pump structure adapts its function, the valveless piezoelectric pump with cone-shaped tubes becomes competitive in the fields of bio-engineering, micro/nano manufacturing and micro/nano driving [4 – 9], thus attracting much attention of researchers. According to our retrieve data using “piezoelectric pump” as a key word, there are nearly 1400 papers available, of which the papers about the valveless pump with cone-shaped tubes accounts for nearly one-third of the total.|$|E

40|$|The {{major cause}} of {{hemodialysis}} vascular access dysfunction (HVAD) is the occurrence of stenosis followed by thrombosis at venous anastomosis sites due to the aggressive development of venous neointimal hyperplasia. Local delivery of antiproliferative drugs may be effective in inhibiting hyperplasia without causing systemic side effects. We have previously demonstrated that paclitaxel-coated expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE) grafts, by a dipping method, could prevent neointimal hyperplasia and stenosis of arteriovenous (AV) hemodialysis grafts, especially at the graft-venous anastomoses; however, large quntities of initial burst release have remained a problem. To achieve controlled drug release, paclitaxel (Ptx) -loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (Ptx-PLGA-NPs) were prepared by the emulsion-solvent evaporation method and then transferred to the luminal surface and inner part of ePTFE vascular grafts through our micro <b>tube</b> <b>pumping</b> and spin penetration techniques. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of various stages of Ptx-PLGA-NPs unequivocally showed that micro <b>tube</b> <b>pumping</b> followed by spin penetration effectively transferred Ptx-PLGA-NPs to the inner part, {{as well as the}} luminal surface, of an ePTFE graft. In addition, the in vitro release profiles of paclitaxel demonstrated that this new system achieved controlled drug delivery with a reduced initial burst release. These results suggest that loading of Ptx-PLGA-NPs to the luminal surface and the inner part of an ePTFE graft is a promising strategy to ultimately inhibit the development of venous neointimal hyperplasia...|$|R

The purpose of this experiment (designated as Gas Test Loop- 1 [GTL- 1]) is two-fold: (1) to assess {{the adequacy of the}} U 3 Si 2 /Al dispersion fuel and the aluminum alloy 6061 cladding, and (2) to verify stability of the fuel cladding boehmite pre-treatment at nominal power levels in the 430 to 615 W/cm 2 (2. 63 to 3. 76 Btu/s•in 2) range. The GTL- 1 experiment relies on a difficult balance between achieving a high heat flux, yet keeping fuel centerline temperature below a specified maximum value throughout an entire operating cycle of the reactor. A detailed finite element model was constructed to calculate temperatures and heat flux levels and to reveal which experiment parameters place constraints on reactor operations. Analyses were performed to determine the bounding lobe power level at which the experiment could be safely irradiated, yet still provide meaningful data under nominal operating conditions. Then, simulations were conducted for nominal and bounding lobe power levels under steady-state and transient conditions with the experiment in the reactor. Reactivity changes due to a loss of commercial power with pump coast-down to emergency flow or a standard in-pile <b>tube</b> <b>pump</b> discharge break were evaluated. The time after shutdown for which the experiment can be adequately cooled by natural convection cooling was determined using a system thermal hydraulic model.
