40|$|Lymphocytes {{activated}} by antigens or mitogens acquire {{the capacity to}} replicate viruses, {{and the number of}} activated lymphocytes can be estimated by the virus plaque assay. Concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen produced 33 -fold and 17 -fold increases in virus plaqueforming cells (V-PFC), respectively, above background, while lipopolysaccharide produced only a 2 - to 3 -fold increase. T (<b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte)</b> -depleted lymphocyte populations, derived from anti-θ-treated or nude (arthymic) mouse spleens, failed to produce V-PFC after culture with concanavalin A or pokeweed mitogen.

40|$|The {{administration}} of glucocorticosteroids {{results in a}} wide range of effects on inflammatory and immunologically mediated disease processes. Glucocorticosteroids cause neutrophilic leukocytosis together with eosinopenia, monocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia. A principal mechanism whereby corticosteroids suppress inflammation is their impeding the access of neutrophils and monocytes to an inflammatory site. Granulocyte function is relatively refractory, whereas monocyte-macrophage function seems to be particularly sensitive to corticosteroids. Corticosteroid administration causes a transient lymphocytopenia of all detectable lymphocyte subpopulations, particularly the recirculating <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte.</b> The mechanism of this lymphocytopenia is probably a redistribution of circulating cells to other body compartments.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the cell populations required for the in vivo and in vitro immune response of mouse spleen cells to rabbit Fab′ 2 and Fab′ and sheep red blood cells (SRBC). The production of IgM antibodies to SRBC both in vivo and in vitro is dependent upon the presence of <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> although some response does occur in their absence. The IgG response can only be obtained in vivo, and is also dependent upon the presence of <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> By contrast, the in vivo and in vitro IgM response of mice to rabbit Fab′ 2 and Fab′ is independent {{of the presence of}} <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> but the in vivo IgG response is thymus dependent.

These alloantigens are associated with the X-linked immune response genes controlling the immune response to the so-called "thymus independent antigens" such as type III pneumococcal polysaccharide, poly(I) -poly(C), and denatured DNA. They also show association with the histocompatibility locus present on the X-chromosome. They were mainly detected on a not yet characterized <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> subpopulation.

40|$|Human <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>{{lymphocytes}}</b> proliferate when cultured with lymphocytes or epidermal {{cells from}} unrelated individuals because such cells express HLA-D antigens, which {{are recognized as}} foreign by <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> The current study demonstrates that these responses are inhibited if either the stimulator cells or responder cells are pretreated with the combination of 8 -methoxypsoralen and long-wave ultraviolet light. Additional studies revealed that photoactivated 8 -methoxypsoralen has a lethal effect on lymphocytes and monocytes {{but not on the}} majority of epidermal cells. These observations suggest that the dramatic beneficial effect of PUVA on patients with psoriasis and other skin disorders may be due to a toxic effect on immunocompetent cells in the epidermis, which results in inhibition of cell mediated immune responses...|$|R
40|$|Young adult rat thymus and {{lymph node}} cell subpopulations were {{obtained}} by differential flotation on discontinuous BSA density gradients and assayed for properties characteristic of mature <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> One such subpopulation (C) of thymocytes was enriched {{in its ability to}} respond mitotically to a hemiallogeneic MLR stimulus, to localize in the parenchyma of lymph nodes and spleen, and to initiate a GVH reaction in a suitable host. These cells did not respond well to mitotic stimulation by PHA, they were lighter in density than the majority of mature lymph node <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> and they possessed a thymus-specific antigen (RTA) not present on peripheral lymphoid cells.

The cytotoxic activity of spleen cells was inhibited by pretreatment with antithymocyte serum and complement, {{but not with}} complement alone or in combination with anti-bursa cell serum or normal preimmune serum. The conclusion was that the effector cell in the above cytotoxic assay was a <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte.</b> Also, pretreatment of target cells with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase enhanced in vitro cytotoxic activity of effector cells.

40|$|Recognition of cell surface antigens by nonsensitized thymus-derived rat {{lymphocytes}} is {{not affected}} by antisera against immunoglobulin, yet can be effectively blocked by treatment of the lymphocytes with alloantisera raised against lymphoid cells. However, allo antisera induced by nonlymphoid cells do not inhibit recognition. Adsorption of blocking antisera on immunoglobulin-Sepharose columns does not decrease their blocking activity. Absorption of blocking alloantisera with liver and kidney homogenates removes the cytotoxic alloantibodies, yet {{does not affect the}} capacity of the antisera to block recognition. Anti-H 1 - 1 alloantisera block antigen recognition only of lymphocytes of strains that share the H 1 - 1 locus.

Normal spleen and bone marrow cells were more susceptible to infection than were cells prepared from thymus and lymph node. Spleen cells from athymic nu/nu mice also could be readily infected with virus. Permissive cells did not ingest iron readily infected with virus. Permissive cells did not ingest iron filings and did not adhere to plastic. Exogenous replication of murine leukemia virus was enhanced in spleen and lymph node cells treated with lipopolysaccharide, a bone marrow-derived lymphocyte mitogen. Conversely, cells treated with the <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> cell mitogens, phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A, were less capable of supporting murine leukemia virus replication.

40|$|Cell-mediated {{immunity}} was {{induced by}} the injection of a low dose of sheep erythrocytes in Complete Freund's Adjuvant. This state of cell-mediated immunity was found to correlate with a reduce capacity of the spleen cells taken from such animals three days after priming to produce anti-sheep erythrocyte antibody in vitro. Evidence presented suggested that the depression {{is due to a}} competition between the cell mediated and humoral responses for the same <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte.</b> Thymus-derived lymphocytes perform a helper function in the synthesis of anti-sheep erythrocyte antibodies in mice. The helper cell could be replaced by a cell-free supernatant derived from short term culture of the thymus-derived cells with the antigen.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the therapeutic potential of killed Corynebacterium parvum, {{its effects on}} the course of Listeria monocytogenes infection in mice was studied. Mortality in mice given C. parvum after L. monocytogenes infection was greater than in mice given C. parvum before infection or infected with only L. monocytogenes. C. parvum alone resulted in no mortality. Spleens from infected mice given C. parvum had increased numbers of L. monocytogenes. Peritoneal macrophages from mice infected with only L. monocytogenes were activated by four days after infection, whereas those from mice given L. monocytogenes plus C. parvum were not. By seven days macro phages from both were activated. Delayed hypersensitivity and in vitro lymphocyte transformation in response to L. monocytogenes antigen were strikingly suppressed in infected mice given C. parvum. The increased susceptibility of L. monocytogenes-infected mice given C. parvum {{may have been due}} to delayed macrophage activation resulting from suppres-sion of <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> responses.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{immune response}} was assessed in 20 patients with chronic Chagas' disease (American trypanosomiasis). <b>Thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> function was determined in vivo by cutaneous reactivity to several antigens including a soluble preparation derived from Trypanosoma cruzi and sensitization to 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene. The in vitro T-cell reactivity was investigated by the proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin and to T. cruzi antigen and by inhibition of leukocyte migration with the specific antigen. In addition, the proportion and absolute numbers of peripheral blood T and B-lymphocytes were determined by rosette formation. This research indicates that the general and specific {{cellular immune response}}, evaluated by the tests herein mentioned, is well preserved in patients, with Chagas' disease. We conclude that chronic Chagas' disease is not associated with deficiency in cellular immunity, nor does it lead to it.

40|$|At {{least three}} {{different}} types of cells are needed for a humoral response to most antigens. The bone marrow-derived lymphocyte (B cell) produces the humoral antibody (1, 2) and is triggered by a cooperating <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (T cell) to do so (3). A phagocytic cell, the macrophage (M 4), is often needed to "process " or "handle " the antigen (4, 5) for this cooperation. The details of these cell interactions are not complete and several models have been proposed (6 - 9) for them. We have tried to interfere with some aspects of antigen processing by M~b to see whether such processed antigen is necessary for T cell priming, B cell priming, or for both and for the cooperating events between B and T cells. To do this, we treated erythrocytes with formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde and tested their immunogenicity in vivo and in vitro. Chicken erythrocytes (CRBC) so treated show no gross changes in antigenicity judged by their agglutination patterns with antibody prepared against native CRBC. Table I shows that CRBC fixed with formaldehyde (F-CRBC...|$|E
40|$|Immunological {{adjuvants}} {{are defined}} as agents which act nonspecifically to enhance immune responsiveness to a specific antigen. While many substances {{are known to have}} adjuvanticity, remarkably little is understood about the mechanism by which they enhance either the antibody response or cellular immunity. It is now clear, for at least some antigens, that interaction of three cell types is required for antibody formation: thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells), bone marrow-derived lymphocytes (B cells), and probably macrophages. In studies on the specificity of response to haptenprotein conjugates, it has emerged that the specificity of the antibody-producing cell (hapten specific) is generally not {{the same as that of}} the T cell which bears immunological memory (carrier specific) (1 - 3). In addition, the characteristics of the helper cell involved in antibody formation, i. e. thymus derived, nonantibody secreting, carrier specific, and nondividing, appear at present indistinguishable from those of the <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> responsible for cell-mediated immunity (4). We chose to pursue this analogy by exploring the effects of the two most effective immunological adjuvants in mice, pertussis vaccine and tubercl...|$|E

40|$|<b>Thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (T-cell) {{responses}} to alloantigens that {{are expressed in}} mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) I and in the generation of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CL) are complex and incompletely understood; one need only cite {{the fact that only}} metabolically active cells are capable of inducing these reactions (1). Neither fragments of membrane nor soluble membrane components are capable of evoking a reaction despite their retention of serologically detectable antigenic determinants (2). The picture is further complicated by the report that immunocompetent allogeneic thymocytes, although they carry antigens, are unable to stimulate T cells unless syngeneic spleen cells are present (3). Although recent genetic investigations have contributed further to the analysis of cellular antigens which could not be detected by conventional serological assays (4, 5), relatively {{little is known about the}} triggering of the MLR.

40|$|<b>Thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> {{precursors}} (pre-T cells) 1 {{are found}} in adult mammalian bone marrow. The precursor nature of the cells can be demonstrated by their ability to reconstitute the thymus of irradiated recipients (1). This procedure is tedious, not easily quantitated, and only rarely applicable to humans. Fortunately, another assay for pre-T cells has recently been described: {{in the presence of}} certain "inducers, " notably thymus humoral factors, pre-T cells rapidly express surface antigens characteristic of more mature, thymic cells (2). The number of such induced cells can be quantitated by a cytotoxic assay (2) or by immunofluorescence (3). Whether all pre-T cells are detected in this way is unknown. If pre-T-cell maturation is analogous to that of other hematopoietic precursor cells, there will be several maturation stages between the uncommitted hematopoietic stem cell and the final pre-T cell, that is, the cell that enters the thymus and begins the intrathymic differentiation process. The assay using induction of surface markers is of limited use in distinguishing different maturation stages...|$|E
40|$|The {{immunological}} synapse (IS) is {{a stable}} cell-cell junction between a <b>thymus-derived</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (T cell) and an antigen-presenting cell (APC). The IS concept provides {{a number of}} insights into the T cell activation process. Firstly, it provides a stop signal that coordinates antigen recognition and T cell migration. Secondly, the essential role of the actin cytoskeleton in T cell activation {{is related to the}} role of actin in IS formation. Third, the sensitivity of T cell to agonist MHCp is related to the role of weakly interacting, but probably more abundant self MHCp in promoting IS formation. The IS provides a framework for orderly integration of the TCR and innate immune signals like CD 28 -CD 80 interaction, and situations in which CD 28 contributes to MC formation may open a door to autoimmunity. Finally, the IS may organize asymmetric cell divisions that are critical for T cell memory. The exact manner in which asymmetry is established and maintained, and the relationship of this process to the IS, is an area of great current interest. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.
