40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid {{energy storage system}} based on Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), where the charging and discharging is done within maximum efficiency conditions. As the maximum efficiency conditions impose the level of converted power, an intermittent time-modulated operation mode {{is applied to the}} <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>converter</b> to obtain a variable converted power. A smoothly variable output power is achieved {{with the help of a}} supercapacitive auxiliary storage device used as a filter. The paper describes the concept of the system, the power-electronic interface circuits and especially the Maximum Efficiency Point Tracking (MEPT) algorithm and the strategy used to vary the output power. In addition, the paper will present the characteristics of a high efficiency storage device where the pure pneumatic machine is replaced by an oil-hydraulics and pneumatics converter, used under isothermal conditions. Practical results are also presented, recorded from a low-power pneumatic motor coupled to a small DC generator, as well as from a first prototype of the final hydraulic/pneumatic system...|$|E
5000|$|Energy {{conversion}} efficiency is not defined uniquely, but instead {{depends on the}} usefulness of the output. All or part of the heat produced from burning a fuel may become rejected waste heat if, for example, work is the desired output from a <b>thermodynamic</b> cycle. Energy <b>converter</b> is an example of an energy transformation. For example a light bulb falls into the categories energy converter.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit the {{thermocouple}} model, as a linear irreversible <b>thermodynamic</b> energy <b>converter.</b> As is well known, the linear {{model of the}} thermocuple {{is one of the}} classics in this branch. In this model we note two types of phenomenological coefficients: the first comes from some microscopic models, such as the coefficient associated with the electric conductivity, and the second comes from experimental facts such as the coefficient associated with the thermoelectric power. We show that in the last case, these coefficients can be related to the operation modes of the converter. These relationships allow us to propose a generalization of the first and second Thomson's relations. For this purpose we develop the ideas of non-isothermal linear converters, operated directly (heat engine) and indirect (refrigerator). In addition to this development we analyze the energy described by these converters. Comment: 17 pages and 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{situations}} of smelting SPHD were analyzed for 150 t converter in TangSteel. Based on {{the analysis of}} dephosphorization process and the <b>thermodynamic</b> conditions in <b>converter,</b> the operation of dephosphorization was optimized. The industrial tests for dephosphorization were carried out, {{and the results were}} analyzed. The results were shown that the distribution coefficient would be the highest value, when the alkalinity of slag was 3. 5 and the FeO content was 21 % in making SPHD steel. The distribution coefficient would reduce, when the temperature was increased, especially more than 1700 ℃, so end point temperature should be best less than 1700 ℃...|$|R
