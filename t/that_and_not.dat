As a child, {{she wanted to be}} a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain as to whether she could do <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> sure what to do in the future. At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that she give up if she was making no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university. She has kept the second half of the promise, graduating in commercial science from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.|$|E

[...] In another interview, she was asked whether the c-word was based on experience, to which she said, [...] "It {{was a little bit}}. It was a little bit based on the experience of having someone call you <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> knowing how to deal with it.". [...] In December 2015 Fey revealed that the writer who called her [...] "the c word" [...] was Colin Quinn.|$|E

500|$|On 8 February 2010 he {{announced}} his resignation from Fine Gael and from Dáil Éireann, due to having [...] "virtually no influence or input" [...] into shaping Fine Gael's economic policies {{at a time of}} economic upheaval. It emerged that on 2 February, Lee met with the Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny and told him of his intention to resign. Kenny then offered Lee the frontbench position as spokesman on economic planning. Speaking to reporters outside Leinster House soon after his announcement, Lee said it would have been dishonest of him to accept the position: [...] "I had absolutely no input for nine months. I think I had to be honest with myself and honest with the electorate about <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> pretend." [...] Asked if his resignation was a vote of no confidence in Kenny, Lee said there were [...] "certainly lots of large mutterings at the moment in relation to the leader's position". He said he had [...] "minimal involvement" [...] with Fine Gael finance spokesman Richard Bruton. [...] "I had a maximum of two or three conversations with Richard Bruton in a total nine months period. I don’t know how my relationship is with [...] " [...] Lee said.|$|E
500|$|Lautner {{has stated}} {{that he does not}} want to be just known for his looks, as some have {{attributed}} his popularity to <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> his actual acting skill. In an interview, the actor revealed that he was originally supposed to have a baring scene in the movie Valentine's Day. He stated, [...] "The script said we were walking into school and Willy takes off his shirt. I said, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. Time out. He's gonna take off his shirt in the middle of school? No, no, no. The reason I took off my shirt for New Moon is because it's written in the book that way. And there's reasons behind it." [...] Lautner later said he would not bare his chest for any role that did not call for it. In June 2010, Lautner covered GQ magazine. The actor was lampooned in conservative writer Laura Ingraham's satirical The Obama Diaries, commenting to have Lautner as a mascot for the White House Easter Egg Roll, to fit their health-conscious theme, and have Lautner don a furry bunny head and appear shirtless. In 2010, Lautner was ranked number two on Glamours [...] "50 Sexiest Men of 2010 [...] " [...] list. Men's Health ranked him at third on their list of [...] "Top 10 Summer Bodies." [...] Additionally in 2010, he was ranked fourth on Peoples [...] "Most Amazing Bodies" [...] list.|$|E

The chorus of the song says 'one of us must die, but the killer won’t survive.' In a relationship, you're both fifty percent at fault.

2500|$|Based on this fact, Virginia {{must have}} {{intended}} for the Ohio River itself to be the boundary between Indiana and Kentucky and not a strip of land which was subject to {{the rise and fall}} of the water levels. [...] The majority refused to consider Kentucky's request that the Court define what constitutes an island, for not only was that request asking the Court to rule on a hypothetical question but to ask the Court to rule on an issue not based on the facts before it. Marshall noted that Kentucky itself had made this question moot in its Act of January 27, 1810, by asserting that the state's border only extended to the low-water mark of the northwestern side of the Ohio River (clearly limiting its claim only to <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> to land the river might cut off from Indiana during high water). [...] This proved critical to the Court. [...] Marshall concluded: ...|$|E
2500|$|On 21 April 2001, a mugging {{and attack}} upon 76-year-old white World War II veteran Walter Chamberlain by three Asian youths was amongst {{the first major}} provocations {{which led to the}} riots. Mr. Chamberlain was {{approached}} as he walked to his home after watching a local amateur rugby league match. He was mugged and badly beaten, receiving fractured bones in the face amongst other injuries. His battered face appeared {{on the front of the}} Manchester Evening News, and the story spread to all the major national newspapers. In the Mail on Sunday, his story was told under the headline 'Whites beware'. In the Mirror, his face appeared under the headline [...] "Beaten for being white: OAP, 76, attacked in Asian no-go area". Media pundits began to speculate on the apparent transformation of young Asian males - from the stereotype of hard-working boys, who respected their parents, to the new stereotype of angry, violent thugs. An Asian male (a Mr. Fokrul Islam) was ultimately charged for the crime of racially aggravated grievous bodily harm on 1 October 2001, some time after the riots. Walter Chamberlain and his family in an attempt to try to calm tensions in the borough stated at the time that the mugging was just <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> at all racially motivated."It was a violent assault on an elderly man", said Mr. Chamberlain's son Steven. [...] "As a family we don't think it was a race issue at all." [...] Since this story was attributed to fuelling further hatred in the local communities race crimes against all sections of society are no longer reported as such for fear of further trouble.|$|E

[...] That report made no mention of novelist Clive Cussler, whose organization later (August 2008) dropped a lawsuit in federal district court against Spence in which it had claimed <b>that</b> they <b>and</b> <b>not</b> Spence had discovered the wreck in 1995.
