5|$|Finally, at the 30 Rock studios, after overhearing Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) impersonating Elmo from Sesame Street while Pete was {{encouraging}} {{his son to}} do better with his potty training, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) compares Pete's relationship with his wife to that of Samson and Delilah. While working late at night in his office, Tracy enters with Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) {{and a couple of}} other people, which turns into a party. Pete is still working, while Tracy's entourage enjoy themselves. Tracy encourages Pete <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>up,</b> and asks one of the women, Vicki (April Lee Hernández), to look after him. Pete finally loosens up and begins to give in to Vicki's temptations, but NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) sets him straight, telling him to recall the day that he got married.|$|E

50|$|In Central Java, {{especially}} in Wonogiri Regency, {{there is an}} almost identical rice cracker called intip, the hardened semi-burnt rice that sticks to the inner bottom of rice-cooking vessels. These cooking vessels are filled with water <b>to</b> <b>loosened</b> <b>up</b> the stuck rice. After it is separated from the cooking vessel, the stuck rice is sun-dried until it loses all of its liquid contents. The dried sticky rice is later deep fried {{in a lot of}} cooking oil to create a crispy rice cracker. There is no significant difference between rengginang and intip other than its size; because intip is created from the inner bottom of cooking vessel, its size is larger than rengginang.|$|R
25|$|Several {{mechanical}} techniques {{are used to}} dislodge sputum and encourage its expectoration. In the hospital setting, chest physiotherapy is used; a respiratory therapist percusses an individual's chest by hand several times a day, <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>up</b> secretions. Chest physiotherapy is beneficial for short-term airway clearance. Devices that recreate this percussive therapy include the ThAIRapy Vest and the intrapulmonary percussive ventilator. Other methods such as biphasic cuirass ventilation, and associated clearance mode available in such devices, integrate a cough assistance phase, {{as well as a}} vibration phase for dislodging secretions. These are portable and adapted for home use.|$|E
25|$|As captain against Frank Worrell's West Indian cricket team in England in 1963 Dexter {{was able}} <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>up</b> after the Ashes and they played an {{exciting}} Test series. After losing the First Test, in the Second Test at Lord's England's first innings rested heavily on Dexter's hard-hitting 70 off 75 balls {{when he took}} on the West Indian fast bowlers Charlie Griffith and Wes Hall in an innings that was remembered by all who saw it. In the second innings Colin Cowdrey came out to bat with a broken arm with victory, defeat or a tie still possible {{in the last two}} balls, but David Allen blocked them for a draw. England levelled the series in the Third Test thanks to Dexter (4/38 and 1/7) and Fred Trueman (5/75 and 7/44), but lost the last two Tests and the series. In 1964 Dexter was again in charge in the rain-soaked 1964 Ashes series. Famously in the decisive Third Test at Headingley he removed the off-spinner Fred Titmus after he had taken three wickets to reduce Australia to 187/7, still 81 runs behind England. Dexter took the new ball and gave it to Fred Trueman who bowled a series of bouncers which Peter Burge hooked and pulled to 160, hoisting Australia to 389 and a 7 wicket win. Although the change made sense as the new batsman Neil Hawke was fragile against fast bowling and Trueman, the greatest wicket-taker in the world at the time, was playing on his home ground Dexter was heavily criticised for a decision which obviously lost the series. In the Fourth Test Australia made 656/8, but thanks to a stand of 246 between Ken Barrington (256) and Dexter (174) England reached 611 and avoided defeat. It {{was the first time that}} two teams had made 600 runs in an innings in a Test, and their fortunes gripped the cricketing nation, but the inevitable draw meant that Australia retained the Ashes. As some consolation Dexter led Sussex to the finals of the Gillette Cup in 1963 and 1964, and won both, the first trophies in the county's history.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{molecular}} genetics {{has opened up}} an entirely new approach to human history. DNA evidence is now being used not only in studies of early human evolution (molecular anthropology), but is increasingly helping to solve the puzzles of history. This emergent research field {{has become known as}} »genetic history«. The paper gives an overview on this new field of research. The aim is both to discuss in what ways the ascendant discipline of genetic history is relevant, and to pinpoint both the potentials and the pitfalls of the field. At the same time, we would like to raise the profile of the field within the humanities and cultural studies. We hope that the opportunity for communication between representatives of different disciplines will contribute <b>to</b> <b>loosening</b> <b>up</b> the widespread monodisciplinary method of working and, in particular, bring together the relevant scientific and cultural streams of research...|$|R

One person at the studio refused to work on this episode because they did not agree with the portrayal of some of the religious content. Cohen also noted that the writing team had begun <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>up</b> during this episode, which gave it a feel similar to the series' later episodes.

2500|$|Sheldon has {{sometimes}} appeared to show empathy, including lending money to Penny without expecting it back quickly (although that may just {{have been his}} logical Spock-like response to a problem to be solved; it was, after all, money he was not using and would not miss) and driving her to a hospital when her shoulder was dislocated. Sheldon admits he is overly fond of koalas munching on eucalyptus {{so much that he}} has a facial expression that he refers to as his koala face. He dislikes gifts, because the [...] "social contract" [...] in his view creates either a debt or burden on the receiver of the gift which will not stop until one of the two involved in the [...] "gift-relationship" [...] dies leaving the other either in debt or with an undue surplus. Sheldon does not take drugs, not even legal ones such as caffeine, due to a promise to his mother, and is hypersensitive when he accidentally consumes them. It has been shown, however, that alcohol often causes Sheldon <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>up</b> significantly, although it will also cloud his judgment – on occasion, after drinking alcoholic drinks (both deliberately and accidentally), he has done things that he would never do while sober, such as singing out loud, mooning an audience full of people, confronting Wil Wheaton and affectionately slapping Amy's rear.|$|E

2500|$|<b>To</b> <b>loosen</b> <b>up</b> the {{mathematical}} strictness and to counteract distortions of human visual perception, a slight {{curvature of the}} whole building, hardly visible with the naked eye, was introduced. The ancient architects had realised that long horizontal lines tend to make the optical impression [...] of sagging towards their centre. To prevent this effect, the horizontal lines of stylobate and/or entablature were raised by a few centimetres towards {{the middle of a}} building. This avoidance of mathematically straight lines also included the columns, which did not taper in a linear fashion, but were refined by a pronounced [...] "swelling" [...] (entasis) of the shaft. Additionally, columns were placed with a slight inclination towards the centre of the building. Curvature and entasis occur from the mid 6th century BC onwards. The most consistent use of these principles is seen in the Classical Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis. Its curvature affects all horizontal elements up to the sima, even the cella walls reflect it throughout their height. The inclination of its columns (which also have a clear entasis), is continued by architrave and triglyph frieze, the external walls of the cella also reflect it. Not one block of the building, not a single architrave or frieze element could be hewn as a simple rectilinear block. All architectural elements display slight variations from the right angle, individually calculated for each block. As a side effect, each preserved building block from the Parthenon, its columns, cella walls or entablature, can be assigned its exact position today. In spite of the immense extra effort entailed in this perfection, the Parthenon, including its sculptural decoration, was completed in the record time of sixteen years (447 to 431 BC).|$|E
