5|$|In 1694, two Franciscan friars set {{out from}} Guatemala <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> succeed where the Dominicans had failed. Antonio Margil and Melchor López left Cobán in August 1693 {{to seek out the}} hostile Lakandon Ch'ols {{in the depths of the}} rainforest. Antionio Margil had already spent two years among the Manche Ch'ol. Although they found the Lakandon, the mission was a failure and the friars were forced to flee. Disappointed by their failure, in April 1694 the friars wrote a letter to the {{president}} of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, Jacinto de Barrios Leal, stating their belief that any further peaceful attempts at converting the Ch'ol peoples were pointless, and that the time had come for military action.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005 Barrales {{began looking}} for musicians for the band, asking friends of his <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{recommend}} anyone, which is how he heard of guitarist Alex Lee. When Barrales saw Lee play, he dropped the thought of trying to play rhythm guitar himself {{because he had a}} fear {{of not being able to}} keep up. There were a few years that Lee was playing guitar, but he was already playing along to music by Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Rusty Cooley, Paul Gilbert and Michael Angelo Batio. Lee decided to join Barrales, and together, they went on searching until they found themselves the drummer Carlos Regalado, who was known locally by playing covers of Megadeth and Metallica. With Regalado in the band, he helped to find bassist Ruben Dominguez. The band was impressed with the skills of Dominguez, who soon joined the band completing its line-up. The band then decided to name themselves after Exodus' Bonded by Blood, an album they had in common in their collection, even though their music tastes differed.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles. He {{was interviewed by}} Mexican authorities and stated {{that he was not}} guilty of Fischer's murder. He admitted to having stolen cars since he was young, and stated that Garza was trying to put the blame on him to protect himself from prosecution. Olivarez justified himself by saying that he had never been arrested with a gun. He admitted going to Dallas in 1992, but stated that he only knew Garza by name. He said he was a self-employed auto mechanic who supported his wife, mother, and uncle. Mexican officials said that Olivarez's auto theft ring extended all the way to Monterrey, as well as in Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. There was an arrest warrant for him issued by a state judge in Reynosa for being connected to about 50 car thefts. Brownsville investigators went to Mexico <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> talk to Olivarez, and began extradition procedings to bring him to a Texan court.|$|E

25|$|Slug {{has also}} {{released}} three albums with Murs from the West Coast hip hop group Living Legends. The idea for , their first album as a duo, came about while on tour. The two decided <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> garner some extra media attention for Ricci by dedicating their album to her, although according to Slug, Ricci has never {{responded to this}} or contacted the band.

25|$|With its eight daily round trips, Maersk Air only {{captured}} {{ten percent}} of the market on the Copenhagen–Stockholm route, losing money on it. Maersk therefore started negotiations with British Airways and KLM <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> become part of an airline alliance. They were in close negotiations with what would become Oneworld, but pulled out in the last minute. There were two main concerns: the first was that Maersk would have to become a franchise partner of British Airways, and that they had already started negotiating with SAS.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a problem}} facing the crew in the newsroom, however. There was no {{television}} camera in the studio {{at the time as}} the technical crew was working on it. Eventually the camera was retrieved and brought back to the newsroom. Because of the magnitude of the story and the continuous flow of information coming from various sources, time was of the essence and the camera would take at least twenty minutes to become operational under normal circumstances. The decision was made to dispatch Cronkite to the CBS Radio Network booth to report the events and play the audio over the television airwaves while the crew worked on the camera <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get it set up quicker.|$|E
25|$|Scotland then {{competed in}} the 2005 ICC Trophy in Ireland. The Trophy is a {{competition}} played by associate and affiliate members of the International Cricket Council. 12 teams, including Scotland, qualified for the finals. The top 5 teams win places in the 2007 cricket World Cup and official One Day International status from 1 January 2006 until the 2009 ICC Trophy. Scotland won their first five games, against Oman, Canada, Papua New Guinea, Namibia and the Netherlands saw them through to the semi-finals, the World Cup and ODI status. Immediately, Scotland contacted England <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> arrange an ODI with them. They also defeated Bermuda in the semi-finals and Ireland to lift the ICC Trophy {{for the first time}} in their history.|$|E

25|$|Danish {{authorities}} therefore {{asked the}} three scheduled carries, SAS, Maersk and Cimber, to negotiate <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> reach an agreement. Consensus was reached in November 1971, whereby the company Danair was established. SAS held a 51-percent {{share of the}} company, while Maersk received 34 percent and Cimber 15 percent. Initially it was to organize domestic flights {{and in the long}} run the owners intended it to develop into a separate operator, although the latter never took place. Danair bought services from the three airlines, who retained flights to their respective destinations. Then Danair would set prices and sell tickets on the flights and the profits were paid out in relation to the ownership shares. The airlines were paid a fixed price, irrespective of their actual operating costs. Maersk fared better than SAS, as their regional airliners were more economical than SAS' Douglas DC-9 jetliners.|$|E
25|$|In 1937 the Army, {{faced with}} the {{continuing}} supply problems with the Norden, once again turned to Sperry Gyroscope <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{come up with a}} solution. Their earlier models had all proved unreliable, but they had continued working with the designs throughout this period and had addressed many of the problems. By 1937, Orland Esval had introduced a new AC-powered electrical gyroscope that spun at 30,000 RPM, compared to the Norden's 7,200, which dramatically improved the performance of the inertial platform. The use of three-phase AC power and inductive pickup eliminated the carbon brushes, and further simplified the design. Carl Frische had developed a new system to automatically level the platform, eliminating the time-consuming process needed on the Norden. The two collaborated on a new design, adding a second gyro to handle heading changes, and named the result the Sperry S-1. Existing supplies of Nordens continued to be supplied to the USAAC's B-17s, while the S-1 equipped the B-24Es being sent to the 15th Air Force.|$|E
25|$|It {{was further}} stipulated that {{candidates}} should be between 25 and 40 years old, no taller than , {{and hold a}} college degree in a STEM subject. The college degree requirement excluded the USAF's X-1 pilot, then-Lt Col (later Brig Gen) Chuck Yeager, {{the first person to}} exceed the speed of sound. He later became a critic of the project, ridiculing especially the use of monkeys as test subjects. USAF Capt (later Col) Joseph Kittinger, a USAF fighter pilot and stratosphere balloonist, met all the requirements but preferred to stay in his contemporary project. Other potential candidates declined because they did not believe that manned spaceflight had a future beyond Project Mercury. From the original 508, 110 candidates were selected for an interview, and from the interviews, 32 were selected for further physical and mental testing. Their health, vision, and hearing were examined, together with their tolerance to noise, vibrations, g-forces, personal isolation, and heat. In a special chamber, they were tested <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> perform their tasks under confusing conditions. The candidates had to answer more than 500 questions about themselves and describe what they saw in different images. Navy Lt (later Capt) Jim Lovell, a NAP who was later an astronaut in the Gemini and Apollo programs, did not pass the physical tests. After these tests it was intended to narrow the group down to six astronauts, but {{in the end it was}} decided to keep seven.|$|E

25|$|It {{was known}} that ethnic Chinese people in Sarawak were pro-Allied, and so contact {{was made with}} the Ongs, the leading Chinese family in Kuching, who lived {{about a mile from}} the camp, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> assist in {{providing}} parts. The first night-time attempt, by G. W. Pringle, was a failure as he could not find his way through the dense jungle to the house. A reconnoitre mission was required. To achieve this, Russell suggested to Dr Yamamoto that as the area was a breeding ground for mosquitoes (with the resultant risk of malaria, which would affect Japanese and prisoner alike), the jungle should be cleared and sprayed. Pringle took part on this working party and was able to plot his route. He subsequently made contact and Ong Tiang Swee, Kapitan China of Sarawak and the patriarch of the Ong family, agreed to help. Ong instructed his grandson, Kee Hui to help Pringle obtain the needed parts. This was at massive risk to the family's own safety as they too would have been executed if discovered. Their only condition was that they should be provided with the news gathered from the radio, in order to boost the morale of the Chinese community under occupation in Kuching. They provided some radio parts, the acquisition of which must have been a considerable task as all radio equipment had been confiscated by the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his body}} being {{identified}} by police and a priest before being burnt, {{there have also}} been stories that both Dan and Steve survived the fire. There is little evidence to support these claims. One man, James Ryan, said he was Dan Kelly. In 1934 he went on stage at the Brisbane Exhibition and told stories about the Kelly Gang. He died on 29 July 1948, after being struck by a train. The Ipswich City Council have put a memorial on his grave. In 2001, scientists took a small piece of bone from the grave of Charles Devine Tindall at Toowoomba, Queensland, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> find DNA to prove he was Dan Kelly. Devine, who had burn scars on his body, told his family he was really Dan. He said he had hidden under the floor of the Glenrowan hotel and escaped after the fire. An archaeological dig {{at the site of the}} hotel by Adam Ford in 2008 found that there was no cellar or other hiding place under the floors. In October 1902, a Melbourne newspaper printed a story that Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were living in South Africa. The men had fought in the Boer War. Another man, Jim Davis from Darra (a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland), said in 1938 that he was Dan Kelly. He claimed that he, Steve Hart and Joe Byrne had escaped from the hotel. He also said he was born at the Eureka Stockade in 1854, which makes him too old to have really been Dan.|$|E

500|$|The {{neutrino}} {{accounted for}} the missing energy, but Fermi's theory described a particle with little mass and no electric charge that {{would be difficult to}} observe directly. In a 1934 paper, Rudolf Peierls and Hans Bethe calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the Earth, and concluded [...] "there is no practically possible way of observing the neutrino." [...] In 1951, {{at the conclusion of the}} Greenhouse test series, Reines received permission from the head of T Division, J. Carson Mark, for a leave in residence to study fundamental physics. Reines and his colleague Clyde Cowan decided <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> detect neutrinos. [...] "So why did we want to detect the free neutrino?"
