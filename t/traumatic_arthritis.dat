40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} trauma degree and bone {{metabolism}} after minimally invasive subtalar arthrodesis treatment of <b>traumatic</b> subtalar <b>arthritis</b> caused by calcaneal fracture. Methods: A total of 76 patients with <b>traumatic</b> subtalar <b>arthritis</b> caused by calcaneal fracture were randomly divided into observation group and control group (n= 38), control group received open talocalcaneal arthrodesis treatment, observation group received minimally invasive subtalar arthrodesis, {{and then the}} differences in postoperative trauma degree {{as well as the}} values of bone metabolism indexes and imaging parameter indexes was compared between two groups of patients. Results: 7 d after operation, serum SP, IL- 6, PGE 2, β-EP, MYO, IMA and MDA levels of observation group were significantly lower than those of control group while TAC level was significantly higher than that of control group; 1 month after operation, serum ALP, BGP and CT levels of observation group were significantly higher than those of control group while ACP and PTH levels were significantly lower than those of control group; 3 months after operation, talocalcaneal height under X-ray of observation group was higher than that of control group, and calcaneus-talus angle, talar tilt angle and calcaneal compensation angle were greater than those of control group.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Osteoarthritis of the {{talonavicular}} joint {{caused by}} inflammatory, degenerative, and post-traumatic arthritis has been commonly described, and isolated arthrodesis for talonavicular joint has usually been performed for such conditions. However, arthritis accompanied by pseudarthrosis of the navicular bone {{is an extremely}} rare case, and {{to the best of}} our knowledge, isolated arthrodesis for this situation has not been previously described in any published reports. Case presentation The patient was a 39 -year-old Japanese man. He had complained of pain in his left middle foot since a fall from his motorcycle six months previously. Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans revealed pseudarthrosis of the navicular bone. MRI indicated mild arthritic change in the talonavicular joint and avascular necrosis of the navicular bone. We performed an isolated arthrodesis of the talonavicular joint with two 6. 5 mm cancellous screws. One year after the operation, radiographical bone union had been obtained, and the patient reported no pain and complete satisfaction with the result. Conclusions Isolated talonavicular arthrodesis is one of the effective procedures for the treatment of <b>traumatic</b> talonavicular <b>arthritis</b> with pseudarthrosis of the navicular bone both in providing pain relief and functional improvement. </p...|$|R
50|$|Methylnaltrexone (MNTX, {{brand name}} Relistor), used {{in form of}} methylnaltrexone bromide (INN, USAN, BAN), {{is one of the}} newer agents of peripherally-acting μ-opioid antagonists that act to reverse some of the side effects of opioid drugs such as {{constipation}} without affecting analgesia or precipitating withdrawals. Because MNTX is a quaternary ammonium cation, it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, and so has antagonist effects throughout the body, counteracting effects such as itching and constipation, but without affecting opioid effects in the brain such as analgesia. However, since a significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as <b>arthritis,</b> <b>traumatic</b> or surgical pain, MNTX may increase pain under such circumstances.|$|R

40|$|Synovial sepsis is {{a common}} problem in horses and foals. Septic {{arthritis}} and septic tenosynovitis may result in decreased performance or, in severe cases, euthanasia of the animal. Early diagnosis and aggressive therapy can improve the prognosis for survival and athletic ability. With the advent of arthroscopic lavage and regional antimicrobial limb perfu-sion, {{a greater proportion of}} horses with septic arthritis are responding favourably to treat-ment. This issue of Large Animal Veterinary Rounds discusses the diagnosis and treatment of septic arthritis.

Synovial sepsis in the horse is a serious clinical problem that can result in permanent loss of athletic function and possibly euthanasia of the animal. Bacteria can enter synovial structures by hematogenous, iatrogenic, or traumatic routes. In Canada, <b>traumatic</b> septic <b>arthritis,</b> as a result of lacerations penetrating into the synovial structures of the lower limb, is most common in adult animals, whereas hematogenous sepsis is most common in neonates.

40|$|Background: Acetabular {{fracture}} involves whether superior articular weight {{bearing area}} {{and stability of}} the hip are assessed by acetabular roof arc angles comprising medial, anterior and posterior. Many previous studies, based on clinical, biomechanics and anatomic superior articular surface of acetabulum showed different degrees of the angles. Anatomic biomechanical superior acetabular weight bearing area (ABSAWBA) of the femoral head can be identified as radiographic subchondral bone density at superior acetabular dome. The fracture passes through ABSAWBA creating <b>traumatic</b> hip <b>arthritis.</b> Therefore, acetabular roof arc angles of ABSAWBA were studied {{in order to find}} out that the most appropriate degrees of recommended acetabular roof arc angles in the previous studies had no ABSAWBA involvement. Materials and Methods: ABSAWBA of femoral head was identified 68 acetabular fractures and 13 isolated pelvic fractures without unstable pelvic ring injury were enrolled. Acetabular roof arc angle was measured on anteroposterior, obturator and iliac oblique view radiographs of normal contralateral acetabulum using programmatic automation controller digital system and measurement tools. Results: Average medial, anterior and posterior acetabular roof arc angles of the ABSAWBA of 94 normal acetabulum were 39. 09 (7. 41), 42. 49 (8. 15) and 55. 26 (10. 08) degrees, respectively. Conclusions: Less than 39 °, 42 ° and 55 ° of medial, anterior and posterior acetabular roof arc angles involve ABSAWBA of the femoral head. Application of the study results showed that 45 °, 45 ° and 62 ° from the previous studies are the most appropriate medial, anterior and posterior acetabular roof arc angles without involvement of the ABSAWBA respectively...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{existence}} of skeletal materials and accompanying archaeological subsistence data recording {{the shift from}} nomadic animal husbandary to sedentary agriculture during the 10 th and 11 th centuries in the Carpathian Basin offers the opportunity to document shifts in the frequencies in various disease categories.

The frequency of lesions in the samples should not be extrapolated to the larger population, but may only be used as an indicator of a trend in the appearance of the diseases.

Current study aimed to investigate the effects of CW, including raw chuanwu (RCW) and processed chuanwu (PCW) alone, as well as CW coadministered with BX on CYP 3 A activity. Buspirone (BP) and testosterone (Tes) were used as specific probe substrates in vivo and ex vivo, respectively.

Compared with those in the control group, the metabolites formation ratios significantly decreased in the RCW and PCW alone groups, accompanied by a marked decrease in CYP 3 A protein and mRNA levels. However, there was a significant increase in those ratios in the RCW-BX and PCW-BX groups compared to the RCW and PCW alone groups. The results indicated that both RCW and PCW can inhibit CYP 3 A activity in rats because of downregulation of CYP 3 A protein and mRNA levels.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} physical medicine in rehabilitation of animals. The main goal in rehabilitation is to regain best possible physical function after illness or injury, by use of different physical modalities. The aim of the present investigation was to study the photothermal effects of defocused CO 2 laser irradiation on equine tissue, one modality used in the rehabilitation of horses. The thesis comprises studies on the effect of irradiation on temperature, blood flow, morphology, concentration of anti-inflammatory and pain modulating mediators, and finally, lameness due to <b>traumatic</b> <b>arthritis</b> of the fetlock joint. Three experimental studies revealed that defocused CO 2 irradiation (91 J/cm 2) causes a moderate to vigorous heating effect (3 - 6 ˚C) in superficial tissues, with a concomitant increase in blood flow, detected by Laser Doppler Flowmetry. Mild to severe dose-dependent morphological changes were detected in the skin after irradiation with doses ranging from therapeutic to near-surgical (91 - 450 J/cm 2). A clinical study demonstrated a decrease in the degree of lameness in both groups of lame horses after irradiation. No statistical difference was detected between lame horses treated with laser or placebo, evaluated by conventional lameness examination and accelerometer technique. Nor was there a difference in the concentration of inflammatory mediators such as substance P and PGE 2, or the endogeneous opioid Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe in synovia. A higher concentration of Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe was measured in sound horses compared to horses with <b>traumatic</b> <b>arthritis.</b> In conclusion, the present thesis reveals that irradiation with defocused CO 2 laser causes a moderate to vigorous heating effect in superficial tissue, and a marked increase in blood flow. The increase in temperature was of such intensity that there is a potential risk of thermal injuries to the skin. The results also suggest that treatment with defocused CO 2 laser is not statistically better than placebo at reducing the grade of lameness in horse with <b>traumatic</b> <b>arthritis</b> of the fetlock joint...|$|E

Each animal {{was subjected to}} thorough clinical and radiographic examination; the grade of lameness was recorded and the best radiographic views were taken.   Fifteen types of distal limb affections were evident. The most prevalent affections in donkeys were high and low ring bone (29. 35 %) and hoof abscess (9. 78 %) followed by <b>traumatic</b> <b>arthritis</b> of the fetlock (6. 52 %), suspensory ligament desmitis (5. 43 %), fracture of first phalanx (5. 43 %), fracture of PII (4. 35 %), side bone (3. 26 %)  whereas, fracture of metacarpal bone (1. 09 %), sesamoditis (1. 09 %) and flexural deformities (1. 09 %)  represented the lowest prevalent affections. On the other hand, side bone (4. 35 %), fracture of the metacarpal bone (4. 35 %) represented the most prevalent affections in horses followed by high and low ring bone (3. 26 %), fractures of PI (2. 17 %), PII (2. 17 %), subluxation of coronopedal joint (2. 17 %) and punctured wounds in of the hoof (2. 17 %), <b>traumatic</b> <b>arthritis</b> of the fetlock joint (2. 17 %). Whereas, navicular disease (1. 09 %), suspensory ligament desmitis (1. 09 %) and hoof abscess (1. 09 %) were the lowest prevalent affections in horses. Treatment was not recommended in certain cases.

40|$|Peiming Liu, Yong Guo, Ying Wen, Wei Wang The Eleventh Department of Orthopaedics, The Fifth Hospital of Harbin, Harbin, China Objective: Pilon {{fracture}} is {{so complex}} that its therapy poses {{a great challenge}} to surgeons. Few studies have compared arthroscopy-assisted minimally invasive therapy and external fixation combined with limited internal fixation (EFLIF), and an optimal choice of surgical therapy remains unclear in patients with type III Pilon fracture. Moreover, to our knowledge, very few studies have specifically evaluated arthroscopy-assisted minimally invasive therapy in Chinese elderly with type III Pilon fracture. The current study was performed to observe the clinical application of arthroscopy-assisted minimally invasive therapy, compared with EFLIF, in Chinese elderly with type III Pilon fracture. Methods: There were 230 Chinese elderly with type III Pilon fracture assigned to undergo EFLIF (group A, n= 115) or arthroscopy-assisted minimally invasive therapy (group B, n= 115), and followed up for 1 year after surgery. Results: Age, sex, causes, sides and types of Pilon fractures were not different {{between the two groups}} (P> 0. 05 for all). Compared with EFLIF, arthroscopy-assisted minimally invasive therapy achieved a better reduction result, bone union and Mazur system (P 0. 05 for all). There was no skin necrosis in the two groups. <b>Traumatic</b> <b>arthritis</b> had a significantly lower prevalence in participants with arthroscopy-assisted minimally invasive therapy than EFLIF (P< 0. 05 for all). Conclusion: Compared with EFLIF, arthroscopy-assisted minimally invasive therapy for type III Pilon fracture significantly improved reduction result, bone union and functional status, and decreased <b>traumatic</b> <b>arthritis,</b> demonstrating that arthroscopy-assisted minimally invasive therapy is an optimal choice for type III Pilon fracture in Chinese elderly.
