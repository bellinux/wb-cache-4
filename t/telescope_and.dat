50|$|Heinrich Erfle (April 1, 1884, Dürkheim - April 8, 1923, Jena) was a German {{optician}} {{who spent}} most of his career at Carl Zeiss. In 1917 he invented the first wide-field eyepieces for <b>telescopes</b> <b>and</b> binoculars. During his short life he developed a number of new designs for <b>telescopes</b> <b>and</b> eyepieces.|$|R
5|$|Analyzing deep-infrared images {{obtained}} by the Spitzer Space <b>Telescope</b> <b>and</b> Gemini North telescope, astronomers discovered {{that one of the}} cluster's stars – HD 23514, which has a mass and luminosity a bit greater than that of the Sun, is surrounded by an extraordinary number of hot dust particles. This could be evidence for planet formation around HD 23514.|$|E
5|$|As the {{atmosphere}} is transparent for radio waves, radio telescopes in space are of most use for Very Long Baseline Interferometry; doing simultaneous observations of a source with both a satellite and a ground-based <b>telescope</b> <b>and</b> by correlating their signals to simulate a radio telescope {{the size of the}} separation between the two telescopes. Observations can be of supernova remnants, masers, gravitational lenses, starburst galaxies, and many other things.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} an astronomer, Gascoigne was a scholar {{of the history of}} Australian astronomy. He wrote {{histories}} of major telescopes, such as the Melbourne <b>Telescope</b> <b>and</b> the AAT. He wrote biographies for the Australian Dictionary of Biography, including those of the first trained astronomer at Canberra's Mount Stromlo Observatory, William Bolton Rimmer, and pioneering Australian astronomer Robert Ellery.|$|E
50|$|Advances in <b>telescope</b> {{construction}} <b>and</b> instrumental resolution gradually allowed increased {{identification of}} the atmospheric and surface details of the planets. The Moon was initially the most heavily studied, as it always exhibited details on its surface, due to its proximity to the Earth, and the technological improvements gradually produced more detailed lunar geological knowledge. In this scientific process, the main instruments were astronomical optical <b>telescopes</b> (<b>and</b> later radio <b>telescopes)</b> <b>and</b> finally robotic exploratory spacecraft.|$|R
40|$|The {{microscope}} {{is undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest inventions that men have ever made. The use of lenses for spectacles (eyeglasses), distant vision (<b>telescopes),</b> <b>and</b> high magnification (microscopes) required early lens makers accurately to grind lenses with different focal lengths. During the 16 th and 17 th centuries, Holland and Italy were the principal countries for the construction <b>and</b> use of <b>telescopes</b> <b>and</b> microscopes. The compound microscope (with two convex lenses) was invented in Holland around 1590 by two spectacle makers, Hans Jannsen and his son, Zacharias. During the early 1600 ’s, Galileo (1564 - 1642) made several <b>telescopes</b> <b>and</b> microscopes tha...|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, {{the smallest of the}} Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the Hubble Space <b>Telescope</b> <b>and</b> large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).|$|E
5|$|By the 17th century, two {{developments}} {{allowed for}} the transits of planets {{across the face of}} the Sun to be predicted and observed: the <b>telescope</b> <b>and</b> the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, which assumed elliptical, rather than circular, planetary orbits.|$|E
5|$|Escher's {{interest}} in geometry is well known, {{but he was}} also an avid amateur astronomer, and in the early 1940s he {{became a member of the}} Dutch Association for Meteorology and Astronomy.

5|$|In {{response}} to this, a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers. Many astronomers met congressmen and senators in person, and large scale letter-writing campaigns were organized. The National Academy of Sciences published a report emphasizing {{the need for}} a space <b>telescope,</b> <b>and</b> eventually the Senate agreed to half of the budget that had originally been approved by Congress.|$|E
5|$|Jodrell Bank {{has been}} {{involved}} with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) since the late 1960s; the Lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968, with other telescopes being those at Algonquin and Penticton in Canada. The Lovell <b>Telescope</b> <b>and</b> the Mark II telescopes are regularly used for VLBI with telescopes across Europe (the European VLBI Network), giving a resolution of around 0.001 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|Since Voyager 2s fly-by, the {{brightest}} rings (Adams and Le Verrier) have been imaged with the Hubble Space <b>Telescope</b> <b>and</b> Earth-based telescopes, owing to advances in resolution and light-gathering power. They are visible, slightly above background noise levels, at methane-absorbed wavelengths {{in which the}} glare from Neptune is significantly reduced. The fainter rings are still far below the visibility threshold.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{instruments}} are also designed and built in-house and includes spectrographs for both the 1-meter <b>and</b> 2-meter <b>telescopes</b> <b>and</b> imagers such as camera system for the 1-meter <b>telescopes,</b> Sinistro, <b>and</b> high-speed photometry/Lucky imaging.|$|R

5|$|The high {{sensitivity}} of superconducting niobium nitride bolometers make them an ideal detector for electromagnetic radiation in the THz frequency band. These detectors were tested at the Submillimeter Telescope, the South Pole Telescope, the Receiver Lab <b>Telescope,</b> <b>and</b> at APEX, {{and are now}} used in the HIFI instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the <b>telescope</b> <b>and</b> instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} <b>telescope</b> <b>and</b> instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 18th century, Charles Messier {{compiled}} a catalog containing the 109 brightest celestial objects having nebulous appearance. Subsequently, William Herschel assembled a catalog of 5,000 nebulae. In 1845, Lord Rosse constructed a new <b>telescope</b> <b>and</b> was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.|$|E

5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to the Milky Way. In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic <b>telescope</b> <b>and</b> {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count the stars in the Milky Way and determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in <b>telescope</b> <b>and</b> targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E
