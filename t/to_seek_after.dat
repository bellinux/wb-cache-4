25|$|You speak truly, O Achilli, and {{we cannot}} answer you a word. You are a Priest; {{you have been}} a Friar; you are, it is undeniable, the scandal of Catholicism, and the palmary {{argument}} of Protestants, by your extraordinary depravity. You have been, it is true, a profligate, an unbeliever, and a hypocrite. Not many years passed of your conventional life, and you were never in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed you. You were deprived of your professorship, we own it; you were prohibited from preaching and hearing confessions; you were obliged to give hush-money to the father of one of your victims, as we learned from an official document of the Neapolitan Police to be 'known for habitual incontinency;' your name came before the civil tribunal at Corfu for your crime of adultery. You have put the crown on your offences, by as long as you could, denying them all; you have professed <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>after</b> truth, when you were ravening after sin.|$|E
500|$|The poem {{creates a}} series of oppositional themes with aspects of nature {{representing}} each: seduction and innocence, order and chaos. These oppositions establish tension before the poem asks {{as to how they}} can be reconciled. These images and their being reconciled are described as analogous to the effects of an Aeolian harp and Coleridge's pantheistic feelings towards nature. In terms of religion, The Eolian Harp describes the mind's desire <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>after</b> the divine. His approach is similar to Ralph Cudworth's in The True Intellectual System of the Universe. [...] However, Coleridge's pantheistic feelings on nature are said to receive reproof from Fricker, and Coleridge returns to a more traditional view of God that deals more with faith than finding the divine within nature.|$|E
500|$|On {{their way}} back to Salzburg Leopold and Wolfgang stayed for a while at Venice, pausing on their way at Brescia to see an opera buffa. While in Venice, Leopold used his letters of {{introduction}} to meet the nobility and to negotiate a contract for Wolfgang to write an opera for the San Benedetto theatre. Wolfgang gave several concerts and perhaps played at Venice's famed ospidali—former orphanages [...] which became respected music academies. The Mozarts were received generously, but Leopold appeared dissatisfied. [...] "The father seems a shade piqued", wrote a correspondent to the Viennese composer Johann Adolph Hasse, adding: [...] "...they probably expected others <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>after</b> them, rather than they after others". Hasse replied: [...] "The father, as I see the man, is equally discontent everywhere".|$|E

500|$|The poem {{portrays a}} series of oppositional ideas {{and how they can}} be {{reconciled}} with each other. The image of a beanfield is contrasted against the image of a lute while they are compared to the image of a coy woman being caressed and then resisting the caresses. This image is compounded with the coy woman being caressed compared to the innocence of Fricker. Nature is also seen in its oppositions, with a wildness within nature being contrasted with order within nature, especially in regards to the effects of an Aeolian harp and Coleridge's pantheistic feelings about nature. In terms of religion, The Eolian Harp describes the mind's desire <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>after</b> the divine. Coleridge's approach is similar to Ralph Cudworth's in The True Intellectual System of the Universe. In the same theme, he wrote to John Thelwall in a letter dated 14 October 1797, ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Eighty-six {{university}} {{students with learning}} disabil-ities (LDs) completed measures of self-esteem and of perceptions of their LDs. In addition, they rated their willingness <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> help from academic services in response to two experimental manipu-lations: (a) they read vignettes about a student requesting help from professors or peers and receiving positive or negative reac-tions; and (b) they listened to audiotaped radio advertisements for academic services on a college campus, emphasizing either learning or performance goals. Participants reported the most willingness <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> help <b>after</b> reading about a positive reaction from a professor and the least willingness <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> help <b>after</b> read-ing about a negative reaction from a professor. In a nonsignifi-cant trend, participants were more willing <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> help <b>after</b> hearing the ad emphasizing performance goals, such as improved grades.

They can assist those members in the search for truth, or comfort their over-worn and doubtful minds; they can even assure them that they are in the way of truth, or that pardon is within their reach: but they can neither manifest the truth, nor grant the pardon. Truth is to be discovered, and Pardon to be won, for every man by himself. This is evident from innumerable texts of Scripture, but chiefly from those which exhort every man <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>after</b> Truth, and which connect knowing with doing. We are <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>after</b> knowledge as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures; therefore, from every man she must be naturally hid, and the discovery of her is to be the reward only of personal search. The kingdom of God is as treasure hid in a field; and of those who profess to help us to seek for it, we are not to put confidence in those who say,--Here is the treasure, we have found it, and have it, and will give you some of it; but in those who say,--We think that {{is a good place to}} dig, and you will dig most easily in such and such a way.|$|E

60|$|And {{understanding}} of the willingness {{that is in the}} heart of God to save sinners, there is nothing will press the soul more <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>after</b> God, and to cry for pardon, than it.

So it is with souls concerning the things of God: if a man once get an {{understanding of}} the worth of them, then his heart, nay, the very strength of his soul, runs after them, and he will never leave crying till he have them. The two blind men in the gospel, because they did certainly know that Jesus, who was going by them, was both able and willing to heal such infirmities as they were afflicted with: therefore they cried, and the more they were rebuked, the more they cried (Matt 20:29-31).|$|E
