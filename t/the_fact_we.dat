5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

In an interview, Marc-Antoine Audette and Sébastien Trudel said that they found it [...] "pretty disturbing to see that idiots like us can go through to a vice-presidential candidate", and claimed {{that they were just}} [...] "two stupid comedians with a bad French accent." [...] The Masked Avengers also admitted that the call was [...] "probably the biggest [...] we've ever done." [...] When recalling the experience, Audette said that [...] "once we [...] started making jokes, she didn't seem to mind, and she didn't seem to be aware of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> were making jokes", which according to Audette was when [...] "we were like 'Oh my God this [...] is gonna be long'".

500|$|The {{team could}} only manage a draw against Chelsea on 8 September 2001, {{in a game}} {{described}} by The Guardian writer David Lacey as one where [...] "the teams simply battered away at each other until one cracked." [...] Henry scored the winning goal away to newly promoted outfit Fulham; the 3–1 victory moved Arsenal {{to the top of}} the league for the first time in the campaign. Against Bolton Wanderers, Arsenal was held to a 1–1 draw after Jeffers' goal was cancelled out by Michael Ricketts. A win at Derby County, where Henry scored two goals was followed by an identical scoreline against Southampton at the new St. Mary's Stadium. At home to Blackburn Rovers, midfielder Keith Gillespie gave the visitors the lead, before Pirès equalised and Bergkamp put Arsenal in front. A mistake by Lauren presented David Dunn the chance to shoot [...] "from 25 yards" [...] and score. Henry's controlled effort looked to have been the winner for Arsenal, until a pass by Tugay caused goalkeeper Wright to [...] "race out of his goal" [...] – the loose ball was collected by Dunn who shot into the empty net. Although Wenger was disappointed with the manner of the defeat, he saw some encouragement: [...] "What's positive for everyone is that Manchester United are dropping points as well. But we need to rectify <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> concede goals at home." [...] October ended with a draw against Sunderland, where notably former Arsenal player Stefan Schwarz equalised for the home side and Patrick Vieira missed a penalty.|$|E

The same year she received two Grammy Award nominations—Best R Vocal Performance, Female and Best R Song for [...] "That's The Way Love Goes"—winning Best R Song. Several critics asserted she was unjustly {{overlooked in the}} Grammy's three major categories: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Album of the Year. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune stated, [...] "Jackson again was denied a nomination for album of the year, even though 'janet' (Virgin) has remained in the Top 10 since its release last summer and has been critically acclaimed." [...] He adds that [...] "the oversight is doubly vexing, because —in a songwriting and production partnership with Jimmy Jam (aka James Harris III) and Terry Lewis—is not just a multiplatinum pop act but an artist who has reshaped the sound and image of rhythm and blues over the last decade." [...] Kot laid blame to the oversight {{on the fact that}} many believed her to be a producer-dependent artist—an opinion he found to be in error. Similarly, producer Jimmy Jam stated: [...] "It's easy to say that the two albums she did before she met us weren't successful and when she got with us she became successful... 'Control' was the first album she actually had input. I think that's just as significant as <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> (Jam and Lewis) did the record." ...|$|E

After seeing the music video for [...] "Express Yourself" [...] by Diplo which was directed by @lilinternet and featured various shots of New Orleans, Beyoncé expressed her wish to collaborate with him on the visual for [...] "No Angel". Diplo contacted the director, telling him that the singer is interested in a collaboration. Following discussions with Beyoncé's team, he went to Houston with Ben Solomon and visited her team from Parkwood Entertainment to discuss about his work. In an interview with Vice magazine, @lilinternet recalled that the whole project occurred [...] "very rapidly". Beyoncé told the director she wanted to create a tribute to Houston, as he specialized in working on filming various locations and [...] "environmental beauty". Initially, the video was planned to be shot in a span of eight days. Only little narratives were planned; however @lilinternet revealed that the team opted for driving around Houston and filming various locations and people. He stated, [...] "We had so many Houston legends all together in that video, and they all really worked hard to let us capture Houston properly. Beyonce's team hooked us up with the legends. It's her hometown and she wanted its heroes represented. And I think they really respected <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> weren't in and out." [...] He added that the video was completed without any [...] "exaggeration" [...] and felt that there was [...] "so much beauty that kind of just innately was in the people and in the city".

[...] Although this is not a valid procedure in all contexts (as noted in the accompanying caveat: [...] "based on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> have assumed the underlying model we used is correct"), the age given is thus accurate to the specified error (since this error represents the error in the instrument used to gather the raw data input into the model).|$|E

Wrexham MP Ian Lucas, who was also campaigning to have the Welsh Dragon included on the Union Flag, called the omission [...] "disappointing", and stated {{that he would be}} writing to the Queen to request that the Royal Standard be changed to include Wales. The Royal Mint stated that [...] "the Shield of the Royal Arms is symbolic of the whole of the United Kingdom and as such, represents Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland." [...] Designer Dent stated [...] "I am a Welshman and proud of it, but I never thought about <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> did not have a dragon or another representation of Wales on the design because as far as I am concerned Wales is represented on the Royal Arms.

2500|$|He {{continued}} {{being an}} outspoken observer of Serbian politics and Serb society in general. In a May 2008 interview, following the Serbian parliamentary election, {{he used the}} fact that the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Vojislav Šešelj, Tomislav Nikolić, and Aleksandar Vučić received 1.2 million votes {{as a starting point for}} a wider comment on Serbian society: [...] "Political parties aren't the problem in Serbia. The problem here is the society that votes for those parties. I can't even begin to image what those million people that voted for SRS are like. We need to face <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> live in a country where 50% of the population is semiliterate, uninformed, and poisoned by the media outlets with nontransparent ownership structure so that we don't know who's financing them. When a person like that gets out to vote, I'm convinced they don't have the slightest clue who it is they're really voting for. Democracy makes sense only when you've got an economically independent and well informed voter, someone who has the information and is capable of thinking. Simply counting up the votes without really knowing what's behind them is stupidity. I'm sorry, but in Serbs we have the same people that elected Slobodan Milošević on multiple occasions. Big electoral numbers do not impress me at all".|$|E
