40|$|The {{index method}} is {{significant}} among the individual methods of scientific research. This work intends to develop ways {{to analyze the}} usage of transport indices as indicators {{of the character of}} market activity in logistical infrastructure at different levels. Transport indices only developed in the past decade; nevertheless, they have already developed a large degree of diversity. This makes systematization, classification, and identification of their distinguishing features all necessary. By their nature, freight indices are largely similar to stock market indices, in that they both show the average changes in some observed phenomenon, and that they both aim to describe the general changes in a process involving many factors. The authors propose a <b>transport</b> <b>index</b> classification with freight indices set aside in a separate group, depending on their intended applications and possible uses. As a result, based on the empirical analysis of the <b>transport</b> <b>index</b> and the stock market index, the level of interconnection between logistical infrastructure and market activity in the Russian economy has been defined, by applying the GARCH model. On the other hand, applying this methodology to the USA’s statistical <b>transport</b> <b>index</b> and stock market index gave no results. This once again confirms the necessity of setting freight indices aside in a separate group, as well as the futility of performing analytical procedures with statistically heterogeneous indexes...|$|E

The two-decadelong record from satellite altimetry is an important source of information for evaluating the mechanisms governing these trends. While several recent studies have used sea surface height contours to index ACC frontal displacements, here altimeter data are instead used to track the latitude of mean ACC transport. Altimetric height contours indicate a poleward trend, regardless of whether they are associated with ACC fronts. The zonally averaged <b>transport</b> latitude <b>index</b> shows no long-term trend, implying that ACC meridional shifts determined from sea surface height might be associated with large-scale changes in sea surface height more than with localized shifts in frontal positions.

40|$|Creating {{walkable}} compact {{cities is}} a global priority, and also a priority in Melbourne. There is {{a growing body of}} evidence showing that city design has a profound impact on the willingness and ability of residents to walk for transport.

40|$|Background: Recent {{reports have}} shown that {{microvascular}} lymph node transfer may improve lymphatic drainage in lymphedema patients. Lymphatic anastomoses are expected to form spontaneously in response to lymphatic growth factor [vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) ] secreted by the transferred lymph nodes. Methods: We have analyzed the results of 19 lymph node transfer patients operated on 2007 – 2012. Postoperat ive lymphatic function of the affected arm was evaluated using semiquantitative lymphoscintigraphy (<b>transport</b> <b>index)</b> and limb circumference measurements. To investigate the postoperative VEGF-C secretion, we examined axillary seroma fluid samples after different surgical operations, including lymph node transfer. Results: The <b>transport</b> <b>index</b> was improved postoperatively in 7 of 19 patients. Ten of the 19 patients were able to reduce or even discontinue using compression garments. Arm circumferences were reduced in 12 of 19 patients. Six of the 7 patients with preoperative erysipelas infections have not had infectious episodes postoperatively during 15 – 67 months follow-up. Neuropathic pain was relieved in 5 of 5 patients. VEGF-C protein was detected in the axillary seroma fluid both after lymph node transfer and normal breast reconstruction. Conclusions: Reconstructing the lymphatic anatomy of the axilla with a lymph node flap may offer possibilities that other reconstructive options are lacking. However, we will need further reports and comparative studies about the clinical efficacy of this new promising technique. In addition to the transferred lymph nodes, lymphatic growth factor production may also be induced by other factors related to microvascular breast reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|Quantifying {{sustainability}} of urban transport is important {{as evidenced by}} {{a growing number of}} studies working on measuring sustainability in transportation. This thesis first reviewed major initiatives reported in the current literature, which dealt with the challenge of measuring transport sustainability using long lists of indicators. To overcome the issue of using large number of indicators for evaluation, this thesis developed a method for obtaining a composite <b>transport</b> sustainability <b>index</b> based on three aspects: environmental, social and economic, each one defined by a set of indicators. Ten sustainability indicators relevant to urban transport were selected by assessing and reviewing the past research and based on available data for Melbourne. These indicators, which can be categorised as environmental, social and economic indicators, are depletion of non-renewable resources, GHG emissions, other air pollutants related to transport, land consumption by transport, accessibility, fatalities and injuries related to traffic accidents, mortality effects of air pollutants, car ownership costs and operation costs of public transport, vehicle and general costs of accidents and benefits of walking and cycling. To quantify selected indicators, land use/transport interaction model was developed to estimate car ownership, vehicle kilometre travelled (VKT) and modal split, and consequently transport energy consumption, emissions and its related social and economic impacts. In the next step, the indicators were integrated into transportation environmental impact index (TEII), transportation social impact index (TSII), transportation economic impact index (TCII) and then into <b>transport</b> sustainability <b>index</b> (ICST) in a way that overcomes the limitations of normalisation, weighting and aggregation methods. In the final step, <b>transport</b> sustainability <b>indices</b> were developed for three different urban planning scenarios (base-case scenario, activity-centres scenario, fringe-focus scenario) for 2030, to find the most appropriate approach for urban development in the future.

40|$|Coastal {{upwelling}} is {{a phenomenon}} that occurs along coastlines throughout the world, and {{has been shown to}} be strongly correlated with large fish populations in these areas. Coastal upwelling occurs when strong coastal winds drive water transport away from the coast, causing colder, often nutrient-rich water to upwell in its place. While coastal upwellings can be detected with satellite imagery or in situ temperature measurements, these datasets are neither continuous nor long-term. A wind-derived upwelling index was created for Lake Michigan to continuously quantify upwellings over multiple decades, and to allow for further understanding of the impact of upwelling in the Great Lakes region. Following work on oceanic upwelling, directional upwelling indices were calculated by taking wind velocity data from both buoys and land stations in Lake Michigan and estimating the off-shore transport of water as predicted by standard dynamical arguments (Ekman <b>transport).</b> <b>Indices</b> were calculated on episodic, daily, monthly, and seasonal timescales. The calculated indices were then validated with direct metrics of upwellings, including in situ water temperature and velocity data and satellite-derived sea surface temperatures (SST).

In both groups the canals were previously catheterized with K 10, K 15 and K 20. The instrumentation was always followed by 2. 5 % NaOCl irrigation. After the instrumentation, the cubes were photographed again in the stereomicroscope and the resulting images were superimposed using Photoshop CS 5 (v 12. 1, Adobe®), evaluating the differences between the two preparations with ImageJ (v 1. 45, NIH®) by means of comparative measurements in the apex and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 mm. ResultsAll data was evaluated using ANOVA repeated-measurements test after verification with Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The degree of wear obtained by RECIPROC® (M= 201182) was superior and significantly different (p< 0. 001) than the preparation obtained by WaveOne® (M= 148506).

In particular, we examined the mechanism of Fe accumulation in the liver {{before the onset of}} hepatitis. Female LEC (n= 19) and Fischer rats (n= 16) 11 weeks of age, were fed a Cu-deficient or Cu-supplemented diet for 4 weeks, respectively. These rats were orally intubated with 59 Fe and then sacrificed 3 or 24 hr later so as to determine the ferrokinetics. Much more radioactivity of 59 Fe was detected in the livers of LEC rats than in those of Fischer rats at both 3 and 24 hr. Moreover, in LEC rats, the 59 Fe activity of groups fed the Cu-deficient diet was higher than that in groups fed the Cu-supplemented diet. These results could not be explained by factors such as intestinal Fe absorption, Fe <b>transport</b> <b>indexes</b> including serum transferrin-and non-transferrin-bound Fe, or the biliary Fe excretion. However, there was a significant negative correlation between the hepatic 59 Fe accumulation and serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) activity. Since the LEC rat suffers from hereditary hypoceruloplasminemia, and reduced Cp activity could not sufficiently mobilize Fe from the liver, Fe appears to accumulate in the liver.
