50|$|Africa {{is home to}} {{numerous}} songbirds (pipits, orioles, antpeckers, brubrus, cisticolas, negrofinches, olivebacks, pytilias, green-backed twinspot, crimson-wings, seedcrackers, bluebills, firefinches, waxbills, amandavas, quailfinches, munias, weavers, <b>tit-hylia,</b> Amadina, Anthoscopus, Mirafra, Hypargos, Eremomela, Euschistospiza, Erythrocercus, Malimbus, Pitta, Uraeginthus, pied crow, white-necked raven, thick-billed raven, Cape crow and others). The red-billed quelea is the most abundant bird species in the world.|$|E
50|$|African rainforests {{also hold}} mixed-species flocks, the core species {{including}} bulbuls and sunbirds, and attendants being {{as diverse as}} the red-billed dwarf hornbill and the <b>tit-hylia,</b> the smallest bird of Africa. Drongos and paradise-flycatchers are sometimes described as the sentinels of the flock, but they are also known to steal prey from other flock members. Acanthizidae are typical core members in New Guinea and Australia; in Australia, fairy-wrens are also significant. The core species are joined by birds of other families such as minivets.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes, {{these birds}} are {{included}} as subfamily Remizinae in the tit family Paridae. Which taxonomic lineup scientists prefers {{is primarily a}} matter of taste; that these families are close relatives is well established by now. If the penduline tits {{are included in the}} Paridae, the stenostirid [...] "warblers" [...] would have to be included as another subfamily, while if they are considered a separate family, the sultan tit and the yellow-browed tit would possibly need to be excluded from the Paridae (JÃ¸nsson & Fjeldsa 2006). The placement of the <b>tit-hylia</b> within this family is particularly controversial, it having variously been placed with the sunbirds, waxbills, honeyeaters and most recently close to the green hylia. [...] It is placed in the Cettiidae family.|$|E
