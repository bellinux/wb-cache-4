40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> instability hypothesis of Hyman P.

The second part of the bachelor thesis applies <b>the</b> hypothesis <b>to</b> <b>the</b> current <b>financial</b> crisis. <b>The</b> whole thesis refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general discussion about relations of <b>the</b> Minsky's hypothesis <b>to</b> <b>the</b> current <b>financial</b> crisis and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fall of the insurance company AIG Corporation. The second part concludes that many relevant parts of Minsky's hypothesis can be applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recent <b>financial</b> crisis but important differences of <b>the</b> current <b>financial</b> system <b>to</b> <b>the</b> system in Minsky's times should be awared of. There are two most important differences: changes in risk management and new <b>financial</b> instruments. At <b>the</b> end, the thesis discusses the implications of these differences for applicability of the hypothesis on <b>the</b> current <b>financial</b> crisis. <b>The</b> thesis regards the fact that <b>the</b> recent <b>financial</b> crisis is caused by rational behaviour of economic agents and not by exogenous forces as the most important lesson <b>to</b> learn from <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> instability hypothesis of Hyman P.

5|$|A {{month after}} the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted {{in the ranks of}} those who fought against the {{military}} uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao. On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party. He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity. In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.|$|E
5|$|A {{short run}} of Gran Trak systems was {{produced}} in March 1974 and revealed other design problems, such as the steering controls; in their prototype system, Eigen used real a real car steering wheel and pedals, but the production run used different parts. Alcorn returned to Cyan that month and redesigned the game to fix the flaws and use more standard parts; the copying protection scheme was changed to use a custom-designed integrated circuit that was named {{the same as a}} standard Texas Instruments integrated circuit. Alcorn later stated in an interview that neither Warman nor Emmons understood the challenges in converting a prototype design to a product that could be manufactured. The game entered production soon after, and Atari announced it was shipping a full production run in May 1974. Although the design flaws were fixed, the communication problems during development led to one final problem with the game: Atari was unclear on the actual cost of producing the game. As a result, a single Gran Trak game ended up costing US$1,095 to manufacture, while Atari was selling them to distributors for only $995, losing $100 per sale. Atari soon corrected the problem, but ended the fiscal year with a large loss due in part <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> failure of the game.|$|E
5|$|Boogeyman 2 {{was first}} {{announced}} in October 2006 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> success of its predecessor with Jeff Betancourt, film editor of The Exorcism of Emily Rose, When a Stranger Calls and The Grudge 2, making his directorial debut and Brian Sieve attached as writer. The film was slated to start development in January 2007 in Los Angeles, California. It {{was produced by}} Ghost House Pictures, a film production company created by Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert which specializes in creating horror films. Betancourt stated {{that he wanted to}} avoid usage of CGI as well as present a new take on the Boogeyman rather than rehashing the storyline of the first film; this led to a more grounded version of the creature in the film. As a result, and due to the film's low budget, he focused especially on the atmosphere and writing. Storyboards were used extensively to plan out the film and minimize wasted effort and resources by make-up artists on unused prosthetics; the limited budget meant that most effects could only be filmed once. The former hospital Linda Vista Community Hospital served as the primary filming location for the mental institution.|$|E
