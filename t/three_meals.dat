5|$|He {{opened his}} first Butlin's camp at Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on 11 April 1936 (Easter eve). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson, {{the first woman}} to fly solo from England to Australia. An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announced the opening of the camp, inviting the public to book for a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with <b>three</b> <b>meals</b> a day and free entertainment with a week's full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. When the camp opened, Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had planned; most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests, which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was the very heart of Butlins and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require many more people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was conceived.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAimsTo {{evaluate}} the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of basal insulin glargine with mealtime insulin glulisine or twice daily 75 / 25 premixed neutral protamine insulin lispro and insulin lispro in individuals with {{type 1 diabetes}} during <b>three</b> standardized <b>meals</b> over a 24 hour duration and compare to physiologic insulin and glucose responses in healthy non-diabetic individuals. MethodsTwelve healthy (4 male/ 8 female) and thirteen individuals with type 1 diabetes (8 male/ 5 female) were studied during <b>three</b> sequential standardized <b>meals.</b> Individuals with type 1 diabetes received either glargine and glulisine injected 5 minutes subcutaneously before each meal or premixed insulin lispro injected 5 minutes before breakfast and dinner in a randomized fashion separated by eight weeks. ResultsThe incremental systemic insulin AUC, maximal insulin concentration, and rate of rise of systemic insulin (0 – 30 minutes) during all <b>three</b> <b>meal</b> intervals were similar between glargine/glulisine and healthy controls. Incremental glucose AUC with glargine/glulisine was similar to controls at lunch and dinner. With premix 75 / 25 insulin, insulin AUC was lower and incremental glucose AUC was greater at lunch compared to the healthy and glargine/glulisine. Hypoglycemic events before lunch were greater with premix insulin group than with glargine/glulisine (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). ConclusionsGlargine/glulisine pharmacokinetics in type 1 diabetes can closely approximate physiologic insulin responses in healthy individuals during a day in which <b>three</b> standardized <b>meals</b> are consumed. Additionally, when glulisine is dosed only five minutes pre-meal, systemic insulin concentration rises as rapidly as prandial endogenous insulin levels. This present study compared glargine and glulisine administered in an approximate 50 / 50 proportion. Future studies of alternate meal times, meal content and differing premixed insulin preparations are indicated...|$|R
25|$|The {{educational}} structure at St. Peter's changed in 1889, and this proved controversial. Most Jesuit missions in Montana were on Indian land, {{and it was}} common for white settlers {{in the area to}} pay tuition and have their children educated alongside Native Americans at Jesuit schools. The Jesuits believed this integrated educational system also prepared Native Americans for participation in white society. But as the borders of the Piegan Blackfeet territory shrank over time, St. Peter's Mission found itself standing on non-Indian ground. At the request of Bishop Brondel, Father Damiani made the highly controversial decision in 1889 to segregate the Native American children. Nonetheless, both whites and Native Americans credited the school with providing a clean, safe, warm place to live; <b>three</b> <b>meals</b> a day; and an excellent education. Piegan Blackfeet leaders later credited the mission with giving their tribe well-educated leadership other tribes lacked.|$|E
25|$|Widespread child {{malnutrition}} in slums {{is closely related}} to family income, mothers' food practice, mothers' educational level, and maternal employment or housewifery. Poverty may result in inadequate food intake when people cannot afford to buy and store enough food, which leads to malnutrition. Another common cause is mothers' faulty feeding practices, including inadequate breastfeeding and wrongly preparation of food for children. Tada et al.'s study in Bangkok slums shows that around 64% of the mothers sometimes fed their children instant food instead of a normal meal. And about 70% of the mothers did not provide their children <b>three</b> <b>meals</b> everyday. Mothers' lack of education leads to their faulty feeding practices. Many mothers in slums don't have knowledge on food nutrition for children. Maternal employment also influences children's nutritional status. For the mothers who work outside, their children are prone to be malnourished. These children are likely to be neglected by their mothers or sometimes not carefully looked after by their female relatives. Recent study has shown improvements in health awareness in adolescent age group of a rural slum area.|$|E

Many Pakistani families, particularly when guests are too many to fit at a table, eat sitting at a cloth known as Dastarkhān, which is {{spread out on the}} floor. In Pakistan, many street eateries serve food on a takht, in a style similar to what is seen in Afghanistan. A takht is a raised platform, where people eat their food sitting cross-legged, after taking their shoes off. Most Pakistanis used to eat on a takht.
