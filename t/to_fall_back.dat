5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back.</b> Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men {{arrived on the scene}} to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force and all of his artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|By 21:00, {{heavy rain}} was falling which helped {{disguise}} the withdrawal. The heavy bombardment commenced and the units began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> to the river. Half of the engineers' boats were too far west {{to be used}} (43rd Division mistakenly believing the crossing points used by the Dorsets the previous night were in British hands), slowing the evacuation process. The Germans shelled the withdrawal, believing {{it to be a}} resupply attempt. At 05:00, the operation was ceased lest the coming light enable the Germans to fire onto the boats more accurately.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenants Nuge and Klaus, {{the other}} two Yellow Jacket {{commanding}} officers, were also soon shot and killed. The Yellow Jackets began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> from the main line, retreating with the sentinels. The warriors followed the retreating unit and entered the camp. Colonel Bartholomew requested a detachment of 25 regular troops and led a bayonet charge that repulsed the warriors. During the charge Bartholomew was shot through the lower arm, breaking both bones. He was still clutching his sword when he was treated hours later. For his leadership during the Battle of Tippecanoe, Bartholomew was promoted to brigadier general.|$|E

5|$|On 30 November Major J.G. Rees of the 25th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers {{had only}} 60 men to hold Beit Ur el Foqa when the post was almost surrounded. They managed {{to break out}} of the {{position}} and joined the support company of the 10th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry covering Et Tire and facing Signal Hill, which became the focus of the next Ottoman attack. This came at 14:30 when they attacked with 400 soldiers, driving the detachment from Signal Hill. This move made Et Tire untenable and forced the 10th King's Shropshire Light Infantry <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> to its original line.|$|E
5|$|On September 28, 1862, Gwyn sent {{a letter}} to Colonel Barnes stating that the 118th Regiment did not provide the Philadelphia Inquirer with {{information}} that the paper used to publish a map and a report of the incident. Two days later, Gwyn issued a report on the Battle of Shepherdstown, noting the efforts he made to rally troops to fight back against the Confederate troops, though his efforts were in vain, as Colonel Barnes ordered to regiment <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{concentrated}} their riposte {{against the}} central column. Herff—who {{had been prepared}} to fall back—instead launched a local counter-attack toward Fort Capuzzo during the afternoon of 15 May with the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment5. At around 13:30, DCompany 1DLI at the landing ground was overrun, and with no anti-tank support more capable than the Boys anti-tank rifle, the remaining troops of 1DLI were forced <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> toward Musaid. A fortuitous dust cloud aided their withdrawal, but by 14:45 Panzer Regiment5 was reporting that it had recaptured Capuzzo, inflicting heavy casualties on the British and taking 70 prisoners.|$|E

5|$|The retreat {{was made}} even more serious {{by the fact that}} the gendarmes, tasked with {{stabilising}} the front and catching deserters, also fled in panic. The town itself was badly damaged, and the commanding officer of the 46th Regiment, Colonel Bronisław Krzywobłocki, was forced to order the retreat of the remainder of his forces south-west from the town. The rest of the division had no option but <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> to the line of First World War trenches. During the chaotic withdrawal all the artillery sub-units got lost. By 19:00 hours the town was in Russian hands.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short period}} of {{training}} in Australia, the battalion was deployed to New Guinea in August 1942 as the Australians sent reinforcements to the Kokoda Track to fight against Japanese forces that had been advancing towards Port Moresby. After the Japanese exhausted their supplies and began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> towards their beachheads on the north coast, the 2/14th saw further action around Gona. In September 1943, after a period of re-organisation in Australia, the battalion took part in the advance on Lae as the Allies went on the offensive in New Guinea, before taking part in the fighting in the Markham and Ramu Valleys of the Finisterre Range campaign. The battalion's final involvement in the war came in the landing on Balikpapan in 1945. The 2/14th was disbanded after the war, in early 1946.|$|E
5|$|After half an {{hour the}} Russians finally stormed the ramparts of Fort 74 and {{defeated}} the Polish battalion defending it. This forced the Polish mobile artillery in Czyste, until then shelling the advancing Russian columns and their Grand Battery, <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back.</b> Meanwhile, the Russian right column was approaching Fort 72. Defended by only 200 men, the fort was approached by the Russian spearhead formed by the reinforced Nieśwież Regiment. Seeing this, the Polish commander ordered his cavalry reserve to charge the Russian infantry. Russian grenadiers stormed the ramparts of Fort 72, but were repelled and forced back behind the moat, where the Polish cavalry charged them. The Russians formed infantry squares, but were defeated and forced to retreat. To counter the threat to Russian infantry, General Nostitz charged his own cavalry reserve under General Georg von Sass, and a cavalry battle ensued.|$|E

5|$|At dawn on 24 February, {{near the}} Île de Ré, Amelia closed on Cybèle, forcing the other French frigates <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> in support and open fire, driving the pursuers back. As Irby dropped off, sails {{appeared}} to the south. This was a British squadron from the Rochefort blockade commanded by Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford with the ships {{of the line}} HMS Caesar, HMS Defiance and HMS Donegal. Stopford had been stationed off the Chassiron lighthouse when Willaumez had passed, and he had sent the frigate HMS Naiad under Captain Thomas Dundas north to notify {{the rest of the}} British Channel Fleet that was in pursuit. Naiad sighted Jurien's squadron and signaled Stopford, who set a course to cut Jurien off from Willaumez, leaving the frigates HMS Amethyst and HMS Emerald to watch the French fleet.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> and join the 40th Regiment in town. The 40th had taken up a position just outside town, {{on the north side}} of a ravine. The 55th formed up to the left of the 40th. The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked out of the building and laid down their arms.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{returned}} to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen {{to win a}} place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, {{but at the same time}} suggested that he had offers from other Lancashire League teams <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> on should he not be picked. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with Test cricketers. In fact, lack of form and opportunity were greater threats to Barnes's continued Test career. Arriving back with several state games having already been played, he failed to make runs for New South Wales and was not picked for the first two Tests against the Indian tourists, Bill Brown taking over as opener with Morris.|$|E
