50|$|When {{performing}} a fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>test,</b> {{the most common}} test specimen configurations are the single edge notch bend (SENB or three-point bend), and the compact tension (CT) specimens. From the above discussion, {{it is clear that}} an accurate determination of the plane-strain fracture toughness requires a specimen whose thickness exceeds some critical thickness (B). Testing has shown that plane-strain conditions generally prevail when:When a material of unknown fracture toughness is tested, a specimen of full material section thickness is tested or the specimen is sized based on a prediction of the fracture toughness. If the fracture toughness value resulting from the test does not satisfy the requirement of the above equation, the test must be repeated using a thicker specimen. In addition to this thickness calculation, test specifications have several other requirements that must be met (such as the size of the shear lips) before a test can be said to have resulted in a KIC value.|$|E

Two test methods were used to examine interfacial strength development in neat resin samples. These included an interfacial tension test and a compact tension (CT) fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>test.</b> The interfacial tensile test proved {{to be very difficult to}} perform with a considerable amount of data scatter. Thus, the interfacial test was discarded in favor of the fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>test.</b> Interfacial strength development was observed by measuring the refracture toughness of precracked compact tension specimens that were rehealed at a given temperature and contact time. The measured refracture toughness was correlated with temperature and contact time.

40|$|Within {{the working}} program of CEN TC 336 WG 1 (Bituminous Binders) a round robin test has been {{performed}} on the fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>test</b> for bituminous binders (CEN/TS 15963). The fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>test</b> is a three-point bend test on a pre-notched bituminous beam and aims to determine a temperature at which the binder becomes brittle. Such temperature relates to crack propagation (the formation of a fatal crack) and should demonstrate improved sensitivity at low temperatures for bituminous materials than the currently available tests. The fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>test</b> originates {{in the field of}} materials engineering where it is used for determining the toughness of plastic and metallic materials. Eight laboratories participated in the round robin test, in which four different binders have been evaluated: two paving grade binders and two polymer modified binders. The round robin test has shown that the fracture toughness can be a more discriminative test than Fraass breakpoint or the Bending Beam Rheometer to evaluate the low temperature performance of fundamentally different binders. Consistent sample preparation and treatment are key parameters in achieving repeatable and reproducible results. The results have shown that experience with the test and diligent specimen preparation make it a test that is worthwhile to consider for characterising the low temperature behaviour of binders...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology of assessing the bond strength of composite overlays to concrete utilizing a fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>test</b> [...] Specimen preparation, test schedules, modeling efforts, and proposed outcomes are discussed. Good quality composite-concrete bond {{is associated with}} high fracture toughness and prevention of crack propagation through the concrete substrate. Weak bond and poorly adhered areas due to handling and fabrication may cause low fracture toughness. Personnel training is essential to eliminate the presence of poorly adhered areas. The fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>test</b> {{can be used to}} compare different composite-repair systems, to assess the effect of different environmental attacks, and as a quality control tool. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND The durability of the adhesion between the composite overlay and the concrete substrate is related to the initiation and propagation of cracks in the composite– concrete interface. For good durability, the composite-concrete material system should have high resistance to crack propagation, i. e. high fracture toughness. Crack initiation and propagation in the composite–concrete interface can b...|$|E

40|$|The {{variation}} of yield strength and fracture toughness was investigated for four different heat treatments attempted on specimens of a near-eutectoid steel. The {{aim of this}} study was to optimize the microstructure for simultaneous improvements in strength and toughness. Further, the fracture toughness deduced through empirical relations from tensile and charpy impact tests was compared with those measured directly according to ASTM Designation: E 399. Among the four different heat treatments attempted in this study, the plane strain condition was valid in the fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>tests</b> for (i) normalized and (ii) hardened and tempered (500 degrees C for 1 h) treatments only. The latter of the two heat treatments resulted in simultaneous improvement of strength and plane strain fracture toughness. The finely-dispersed carbides seem to arrest the crack propagation and also increase the strength, The pearlitic microstructure of the former leads to easy crack propagation along cementite platelets and/or cementite/ferrite interfaces. The nature of {{variation of}} empirically determined toughness values from tensile tests for different heat treatments is similar to that measured directly through fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>tests,</b> although the two sets of values do not match quantitatively.
