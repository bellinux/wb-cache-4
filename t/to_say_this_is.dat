As the network dedicated to bringing viewers the best stories on television, we are so pleased {{to have the opportunity}} with The Walking Dead to raise the bar within this popular genre and continue our commitment to being the home of premium television on basic cable." [...] Senior Vice President Joel Stillerman ascribed that much of its success came from the storytelling presented in the episode; [...] "The Walking Dead is that rare piece of programming that works on so many levels. It is legitimately great storytelling that is not only highly entertaining, but incredibly thought provoking as well. People who are familiar with the comic books know what's coming, but suffice it <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> only the beginning of a long, intense, and powerful ride. Long live The Walking Dead." ...|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} March 2011, with Connie Britton {{first to be}} cast, portraying female lead Vivien Harmon. Britton stated that she took a risk in taking the role of Vivien. When Murphy presented the role to her, he said, [...] "This is something we've never seen you do before. It will be turning what you've just been doing on its ear." [...] She was intrigued by what he had presented her and ultimately {{decided to take the}} part. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, series co-creator Ryan Murphy stated that he had told Connie Britton, early on, that her character Vivien would die in the first season. [...] "We've really had the whole season mapped out from the beginning," [...] he said. [...] "In the meetings with the core actors, the three leads being Connie, Dylan [...] and Jessica , as we tried to snare them we were able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> where you start, this is the middle, and this is where you end up. So, yes, I was able to tell Connie really the whole run of the series." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{literary}} theorists have approached the Devotions as politically themed. Richard Strier, in particular, identifies the Devotions as an [...] "Arminian polemic", {{arguing that it}} was highly atypical of Donne to actually publish works, rather than merely let them circulate amongst friends. Both before and after ordination, Donne actively resisted publication, normally only publishing works {{that had been the}} result of a commission, such as The Anniversaries or Pseudo-Martyr. The Devotions, however, were [...] "literally rushed" [...] into print, with the volume being handed to the printers a month after he had recovered from his disease. Strier argues that Donne's rationale for publishing the Devotions matches his rationale for publishing a sermon, the Encaenia, the same year, to assert the importance of [...] "places, and of dayes, and of all outward meanes", because he felt some sense of urgency about what he had <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> coupled with Devotion XVI, in which Donne explicitly comes out against Puritanism and is simultaneously [...] "purposely militant", deliberately frustrating the other extreme from Puritanism, where [...] "the Arminianism and the polemical anti-puritanism of the volume becomes explicit".|$|E

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN Movies {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} five stars. He was unhappy with the little screen time Bell and Elwes had been given, saying that the time the film did spend with them didn't have much impact. He said the traps were a step down from Saw VI, but did point out his {{favorite}} and highlight of the film as the [...] "garage trap". About the film's 3D effects, Goldman said [...] "The 3D is used {{as you might expect}} it to be – which is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> no James Cameron immersive experience. Instead, blades jut out of the screen, and there is some fun had with blood and guts literally shooting forward at several points". [...] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review. He said Saw 3D is [...] "consistent both stylistically and thematically with previous editions", but said most of the film's traps lack the [...] "Rube Goldberg-style cleverness that marked the series". [...] Scheck {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "unfortunate" [...] the creators killed Bell's character so early in the series and called Mandylor's character (Hoffman) an [...] "exceedingly bland stand-in". He called the visual impact of the 3D [...] "negligible".|$|E
500|$|Released in {{the wake}} of his passing, the song became synonymous with the myth of Hank Williams as a haunted, lonely figure who {{expressed}} pain with an authenticity that became the standard for country music. [...] The name of the song was used as the title of Hank Williams' 1964 biopic. [...] "Your Cheatin' Heart", as well as other songs by Williams were performed on the movie, with George Hamilton dubbing the soundtrack album recorded by Williams' son, Hank Williams, Jr. [...] In the 2003 documentary series Lost Highway, country music historian Ronnie Pugh comments, [...] "It's Hank's anthem, it's his musical last will and testament. [...] It's searing, it's powerful, it's gripping. [...] If you want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> his last and best work, I wouldn't argue with that." [...] AllMusic described the track as the [...] "signature song" [...] of Hank Williams, and an [...] "unofficial anthem" [...] of country music. Rolling Stone called it [...] "one of the greatest country standards of all time", ranking it at number 217 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song ranked at number 5 in Country Music Television's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music in 2003, ...|$|E
500|$|Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode an [...] "A". Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a glowing review, stating that [...] "I have <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} most dense and {{interesting}} episodes of Veronica Mars yet, on a number of different levels." [...] He went on to praise the return of Troy, the various subplots, and the episode's ambiguous conclusion. The reviewer summed up by saying, [...] "With all that going on, it could have been easy for this episode to fall apart somewhere... "The Rapes of Graff" [...] really managed to do everything it was trying to do quite well. It may have been missing something special {{to put it in the}} absolute top tier of Veronica Mars episodes, but it's still a marvelous episode for pulling all those different strands together. Anais Bordages of BuzzFeed ranked the episode 27th of 64 episodes of Veronica Mars, but nevertheless gave a positive review, calling it [...] "awesome". She elaborated, [...] "The banter is excellent, our main character shoots down every sexist on campus, and Michael Cera has a cameo. Even better: The other part of the episode revolves around Cliff’s sexual misfortunes." [...] On a similar list, TV Line ranked the episode 16th.|$|E

500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K. Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, do what is right, based on the system, or do we worry [...] some people are going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to knock out people we don't like? You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we {{know who they are}} and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E
500|$|Other {{reviews from}} the North American {{leg of the}} tour {{included}} Melissa Ruggierie writing for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution online blog. Ruggierie praised Beyoncé's performance, particularly the strong vocals demonstrated in [...] "1+1" [...] and concluded [...] "watching her command a stadium stage for two hours was another reminder of her limitless ambition". However, {{it was noted that}} Beyoncé did not speak to the crowd very often. After Beyoncé's hometown performance in Houston, Brandon Caldwell of the Houston Press introduced his article stating [...] "Hours after the slaying, the wig snatching, the fitted snatching, the life getting, the boy byes and various curses of shock, amazement and confusion, I stood with a perplexed look on my face. How? How does Beyoncé do this? On this level? With this magnitude?". Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times concluded her positive review of the Pasadena stop of the tour with [...] "Soaking wet and sitting onstage alone, she left the audience with the closing number, [...] "Halo". She'd been baptized and reborn into a less-perfect version of Queen Bey, allowing a more powerful Beyoncé to arise from that imperfection". Jim Harrington of the San Jose Mercury News began his article stating [...] "there were so many moving parts – a tremendous swirl of sharply choreographed dance routines, cool special effects, brilliant fireworks and other tactics for delighting tens of thousands", Harrington noted however that too many snippets of songs rather than their full versions were performed, feeling quality over quantity was missed. The first Canadian show of the tour in Edmonton was performed in cold and rainy conditions, with Beyoncé stating [...] "Can you feel your fingers? I can't feel mine" [...] and [...] "I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the coldest show I've ever done". Despite this, Sandra Sperounes of the Edmonton Journal commented [...] "not even rain or bitter wind could stop our Ms. Flawless, our Survivor, our Queen Bey from dazzling an estimated 40,000 fans at Commonwealth Stadium on a stormy Friday night." [...] Sperounes concluded [...] "the sun was nowhere to be found, but thanks to Bey's brilliant set, the crowd left beaming with giddiness, girl power and generosity".|$|E

2500|$|Although Lichtenstein's comic-based work {{gained some}} acceptance, {{concerns}} are still expressed by {{critics who say}} Lichtenstein did not credit, pay any royalties to, or seek permission from the original artists or copyright holders. In an interview for a BBC Four documentary in 2013, Alastair Sooke asked the comic book artist Dave Gibbons if he considered Lichtenstein a plagiarist. Gibbons replied: [...] "I would say 'copycat'. In music for instance, you can't just whistle somebody else's tune or perform somebody else's tune, no matter how badly, without somehow crediting and giving payment to the original artist. That's <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> 'WHAAM! by Roy Lichtenstein, after Irv Novick'."

[...] David Mavorah is an expert of Israeli Antiquity, and (presumably) not an expert of statistics. However, Dr. Andrey Feuerverger, the statistician cited by the makers of the documentary, has said that determination of the identity of those in the tomb was the purview of biblical historians, and not statisticians.

2500|$|The sacres {{originated}} in the early 19th century when the social control exerted by the Catholic clergy was increasingly a source of frustration. One of the oldest sacres is sacrament, which {{can be thought of}} in Quebec French as equivalent to [...] "goddamn it" [...] in English. It is known to have been in use {{as far back as the}} 1830s. The word [...] "sacrer" [...] in its current meaning is believed to come from the expression Ne dites pas ça, c'est sacré ("Don't say that, it is sacred/holy"). Eventually, sacrer started to refer to the words francophone Québécois were not supposed <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> likely related to the commandment [...] "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain" [...] (Exodus 20:7).
