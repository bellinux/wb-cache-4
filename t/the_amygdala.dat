5|$|The {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) {{is another}} {{midbrain}} area. The most prominent group of VTA dopaminergic neurons projects to the prefrontal cortex via the mesocortical pathway and another smaller group projects to the nucleus accumbens via the mesolimbic pathway. Together, these two pathways are collectively termed the mesocorticolimbic projection.

5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. <b>The</b> <b>amygdala,</b> orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience.

While {{there are other}} documented cases of similar behaviour from this period none of the subjects other than Domery's contemporary Tarrare were autopsied, {{and there have been}} no modern documented cases of polyphagia (excessive appetite) as extreme as Domery. Hyperthyroidism can induce an extreme appetite and rapid weight loss, while Bondeson(2006) speculates that Domery possibly suffered from a damaged amygdala or ventromedial nucleus; it is known that injuries to <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> or ventromedial nucleus in animals can induce polyphagia.|$|E
5|$|The {{intermediate}} hippocampus has overlapping characteristics {{with both}} the ventral and dorsal hippocampus. Using anterograde tracing methods, Cenquizca and Swanson (2007) located the moderate projections to two primary olfactory cortical areas and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. This region has the smallest number of place cells. The ventral hippocampus functions in fear conditioning and affective processes. Anagnostaras et al. (2002) showed that alterations to the ventral hippocampus reduced {{the amount of information}} sent to <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> by the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, consequently altering fear conditioning in rats.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{is connected}} by the brainstem to the spinal cord. The brainstem {{consists of the}} midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum {{is connected to the}} brainstem by pairs of tracts. Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system, consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> and the hippocampus; the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia; the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells. There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and a more or less equal number of other cells. Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses. Neurons form elaborate neural networks of neural pathways and circuits. The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5000|$|Located {{above the}} {{hippocampus}} in the medial temporal lobes are two amygdalae (singular [...] "amygdala"). <b>The</b> <b>amygdalae</b> {{are associated with}} both emotional learning and memory, as it responds strongly to emotional stimuli, especially fear. These neurons assist in encoding emotional memories and enhancing them. This process results in emotional events being more deeply and accurately encoded into memory. Lesions to <b>the</b> <b>amygdalae</b> in monkeys {{have been shown to}} impair motivation, as well as the processing of emotions.|$|R
50|$|There are {{functional}} {{differences between}} {{the right and left}} amygdala. In one study, electrical stimulations of <b>the</b> right <b>amygdala</b> induced negative emotions, especially fear and sadness. In contrast, stimulation of <b>the</b> left <b>amygdala</b> was able to induce either pleasant (happiness) or unpleasant (fear, anxiety, sadness) emotions. Other evidence suggests that <b>the</b> left <b>amygdala</b> plays a role in the brain's reward system.|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> corticomedial <b>amygdala</b> {{is involved in}} agonistic behavior by affecting social learning processes. The present study shows that deficits in the avoidance of a dominant male rat conditioned by defeat were only observed after bilateral lesions restricted to <b>the</b> medial <b>amygdala</b> and not after destroying the cortical portion. These results {{are related to the}} specific afferent and efferent connections of <b>the</b> medial <b>amygdala</b> with other brain structures involved in the control of agonistic behavior. Within <b>the</b> corticomedial <b>amygdala</b> <b>the</b> medial amygdaloid nucleus was found to be a major recipient of afferents from the accessory olfactory bulb, but also a source of efferent projections to the ventrolateral aspects of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and the ventral premammillary nucleus. A strong reciprocity exists in the connections between ventromedial hypothalamus and premammillary nuclei with <b>the</b> medial <b>amygdala.</b> <b>The</b> connections between the ventromedial hypothalamic and dorsal premammillary nucleus with the midbrain periaqueductal grey suggest an important role for the periaqueductal gray in the descending output in the anatomical substrate for agonistic behavior. ...|$|R
5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to <b>the</b> <b>amygdala,</b> which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{circuitry}} involving <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> (which regulates emotions like {{anxiety and}} fear, stimulating the HPA Axis and sympathetic nervous system) and hippocampus (which is implicated in emotional memory along with <b>the</b> <b>amygdala)</b> {{is thought to}} underlie anxiety. People who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in <b>the</b> <b>amygdala.</b> Some writers believe that excessive anxiety can lead to an overpotentiation of the limbic system (which includes <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> and nucleus accumbens), giving increased future anxiety, {{but this does not}} appear to have been proven.|$|E
25|$|Using a PET scan, {{researchers}} found that activity in the left medial and lateral prefrontal cortex was reciprocally associated with decrease activity in <b>the</b> <b>amygdala.</b> These findings imply that the prefrontal cortex modulates <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> activity. The left prefronatal cortex {{plays a role in}} approach behaviors (positively valenced emotions), while <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> plays a role in withdrawal behaviors (negatively valenced emotions).|$|E
25|$|Underdeveloped Amygdalae. Two {{studies found}} that {{both the left and}} {{especially}} <b>the</b> right <b>amygdalae</b> are impaired in psychopaths. The psychopaths had on average 18 percent reduction in the volume of <b>the</b> right <b>amygdala.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuman amygdalae are {{involved}} in various behavioral functions such as affective and stress processing. For these behavioral functions, {{as well as for}} psychophysiological arousal including cortisol release, sex differences are reported. Here, we assessed cortisol levels and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of left and right amygdalae in 81 healthy participants (42 women) to investigate potential modulation of amygdala rsFC by sex and cortisol concentration. Our analyses revealed that rsFC of <b>the</b> left <b>amygdala</b> significantly differed between women and men: Women showed stronger rsFC than men between <b>the</b> left <b>amygdala</b> and left middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, postcentral gyrus and hippocampus, regions involved in face processing, inner-speech, fear and pain processing. No stronger connections were detected for men and no sex difference emerged for right amygdala rsFC. Also, an interaction of sex and cortisol appeared: In women, cortisol was negatively associated with rsFC of <b>the</b> <b>amygdalae</b> with striatal regions, mid-orbital frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, middle and superior frontal gyri, supplementary motor area and the parietal–occipital sulcus. Contrarily in men, positive associations of cortisol with rsFC of <b>the</b> left <b>amygdala</b> and these structures were observed. Functional decoding analyses revealed an association of <b>the</b> <b>amygdalae</b> and these regions with emotion, reward and memory processing, as well as action execution. Our results suggest that functional connectivity of <b>the</b> <b>amygdalae</b> as well as the regulatory effect of cortisol on brain networks differs between women and men. These sex-differences and the mediating and sex-dependent effect of cortisol on brain communication systems should be taken into account in affective and stress-related neuroimaging research. Thus, more studies including both sexes are required...|$|R
40|$|Experience-driven {{synaptic}} plasticity in <b>the</b> lateral <b>amygdala</b> {{is thought to}} underlie the formation of associations between sensory stimuli and an ensuing threat. However, how <b>the</b> central <b>amygdala</b> participates in such a learning process remains unclear. Here we show that PKC-delta-expressing central amygdala neurons are essential for the {{synaptic plasticity}} underlying learning in <b>the</b> lateral <b>amygdala,</b> as they convey information about the unconditioned stimulus to lateral amygdala neurons during fear conditioning...|$|R
25|$|The {{consolidation}} of memory requires the synthesis (creation) of certain proteins in <b>the</b> <b>amygdala.</b> Disruption of protein synthesis in <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> {{has been shown}} to prevent long-term memory for fear conditioning. Anisomycin inhibits the production of proteins. In tests where it is delivered to the lateral and basal nuclei in <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> of rats, the rats demonstrated that they had forgotten fear responses that they had been conditioned to display.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} frontal gyrus, medial frontal areas, intraparietal sulcus, {{and superior}} parietal cortex, areas involved in sophisticated mental activity, show equal activity in REM sleep as in wakefulness. <b>The</b> <b>amygdala</b> is also active during REM sleep and may participate in generating the PGO waves, and experimental suppression of <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> results in less REM sleep. <b>The</b> <b>amygdala</b> may also cardiac function {{in lieu of}} the less active insular cortex.|$|E
25|$|Stimulation of <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> {{results in}} {{augmented}} aggressive behavior in hamsters, while lesions of an evolutionarily homologous {{area in the}} lizard greatly reduce competitive drive and aggression (Bauman et al. 2006). In rhesus monkeys, neonatal lesions in <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> or hippocampus results in reduced expression of social dominance, related to the regulation of aggression and fear. Several experiments in attack-primed Syrian golden hamsters, for example, support the claim of circuity within <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> being involved in control of aggression. The role of <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> is less clear in primates and appears to depend more on situational context, with lesions leading to increases in either social affiliatory or aggressive responses.|$|E
50|$|They are {{connected}} {{to other parts of}} the brain (as shown in the schematic, below left), and act as a relay for impulses coming from <b>the</b> <b>amygdalae</b> and hippocampi, via the mamillo-thalamic tract to the thalamus.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{evidence}} from rat and human studies indicates that glucocorticoid hormones influence cognitive performance. Posttraining activation of glucocorticoid-sensitive pathways dose-dependently enhances {{the consolidation of}} long-term memory. Glucocorticoid effects on memory consolidation rely on noradrenergic activation of <b>the</b> basolateral <b>amygdala</b> and interactions of <b>the</b> basolateral <b>amygdala</b> with other brain regions. Glucocorticoids interact with the noradrenergic system both at a postsynaptic level, increasing {{the efficacy of the}} beta-adrenoceptor-cyclic AMP/protein kinase A system, as well as presynaptically in brainstem noradrenergic cell groups that project to <b>the</b> basolateral <b>amygdala.</b> In contrast, memory retrieval and working memory performance are impaired with high circulating levels of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoid-induced impairment of these two memory functions also requires the integrity of <b>the</b> basolateral <b>amygdala</b> and <b>the</b> noradrenergic system. Such critical interactions between glucocorticoids and noradrenergic activation of <b>the</b> basolateral <b>amygdala</b> have important consequences for the role of emotional arousal in enabling glucocorticoid effects on these different memory functions...|$|R

25|$|The {{anterior}} insula {{receives a}} direct projection from the basal {{part of the}} ventral medial nucleus of the thalamus and a particularly large input from the central nucleus of <b>the</b> <b>amygdala.</b> In addition, the anterior insula itself projects to <b>the</b> <b>amygdala.</b>|$|E
25|$|The brain {{structure}} {{that is the}} center of most neurobiological events associated with fear is <b>the</b> <b>amygdala,</b> located behind the pituitary gland. <b>The</b> <b>amygdala</b> is part of a circuitry of fear learning. It is essential for proper adaptation to stress and specific modulation of emotional learning memory. In the presence of a threatening stimulus, <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> generates the secretion of hormones that influence fear and aggression. Once response to the stimulus in the form of fear or aggression commences, <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> may elicit the release of hormones into the body to put the person into a state of alertness, in which they are ready to move, run, fight, etc. This defensive response is generally referred to in physiology as the fight-or-flight response regulated by the hypothalamus, part of the limbic system. Once the person is in safe mode, meaning that there are no longer any potential threats surrounding them, <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> will send this information to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) where it is stored for similar future situations, which is known as memory consolidation.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>amygdala's</b> role in {{processing}} facial expressions of fear {{has been well}} established, {{its role in the}} processing of other emotions is unclear. In particular, evidence for <b>the</b> <b>amygdala's</b> involvement {{in processing}} expressions of happiness and sadness remains controversial. To clarify this issue, we constructed a series of morphed stimuli whose emotional expression varied gradually from very faint to more pronounced. Five morphs each of sadness and happiness, as well as neutral faces, were shown to 27 subjects with unilateral amygdala damage and 5 with complete bilateral amygdala damage, whose data were compared to those from 12 brain-damaged and 26 normal controls. Subjects were asked to rate the intensity and to label the stimuli. Subjects with unilateral amygdala damage performed very comparably to controls. By contrast, subjects with bilateral amygdala damage showed a specific impairment in rating sad faces, but performed normally in rating happy faces. Furthermore, subjects with right unilateral amygdala damage performed somewhat worse than subjects with left unilateral <b>amygdala</b> damage. <b>The</b> findings suggest that <b>the</b> <b>amygdala's</b> role in processing of emotional facial expressions encompasses multiple negatively valenced emotions, including fear and sadness...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> basolateral <b>amygdala's</b> {{involvement}} in fear acquisition and expression to visual and auditory stimuli is well known. The {{involvement of the}} basolateral and other amygdala areas in fear acquisition and expression to stimuli of other modalities is less certain. We evaluated {{the contribution of the}} basolateral and medial amygdala to olfactory and to context fear and fear conditioning by infusing into these areas the NMDA receptor antagonist AP 5, the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist NBQX, or vehicle prior to either odor-shock pairings or fear-potentiated startle testing. Pre-training AP 5 infusions into <b>the</b> basolateral <b>amygdala</b> disrupted fear conditioning to the odor but not the context conditioned stimulus (CS). Pre-test NBQX infusions disrupted fear-potentiated startle to the odor but not context CS. Neither compound blocked fear conditioning when infused into <b>the</b> medial <b>amygdala</b> prior to training, but pre-test NBQX infusions did block fear-potentiated startle. The results confirm and extend recent findings suggesting a role for <b>the</b> basolateral <b>amygdala</b> in olfactory fear and fear conditioning, reveal an unexpected dissociation of <b>the</b> basolateral <b>amygdala's</b> {{involvement in}} discrete cue versus context fear and fear conditioning, and implicate for the first time <b>the</b> medial <b>amygdala</b> in fear-potentiated startle...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>amygdala</b> is an {{important}} brain structure {{when it comes to}} learning fearful responses, in other words, it influences how people remember traumatic things.

25|$|In {{support of}} Zajonc's claim that affect {{does not need}} {{cognition}} to occur, Zola–Morgan conducted experiments on monkeys with lesions to <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> (the brain structure that is responsive to affective stimuli). In his experiments, Zola–Morgan proved that lesions to <b>the</b> <b>amygdala</b> impair affective functioning, but not cognitive processes. However, lesions in the hippocampus (the brain structure responsible for memory) impair cognitive functions but leave emotional responses fully functional.|$|E

40|$|The ventrolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} (VLPFC) and {{amygdala}} have critical {{roles in the}} generation and regulation of unpleasant emotions, and in this study the dynamic neural basis of unpleasant emotion processing was elucidated by using paired-samples permutation t tests to identify the timing of emotional discrimination in various brain regions. We recorded the temporal dynamics of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals in those brain regions during the viewing of unpleasant pictures by using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} with high temporal resolution, and we compared the time course of the signal within the volume of interest across emotional conditions. Results show that emotional discrimination in <b>the</b> right <b>amygdala</b> precedes that in <b>the</b> left <b>amygdala</b> and that emotional discrimination in both those regions precedes that in the right anterior VLPFC. They support the hypotheses that <b>the</b> right <b>amygdala</b> is part of a rapid emotional stimulus detection system and <b>the</b> left <b>amygdala</b> is specialized for sustained stimulus evaluation and that the right anterior VLPFC is implicated in the integration of viscerosensory information with affective signals between the bilateral anterior VLPFCs and <b>the</b> bilateral <b>amygdalae...</b>|$|R

This study examines the effect of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and the classical antipsychotic haloperidol on Fos-like-immunoreactivity (FLI) induction in areas belonging to <b>the</b> extended <b>amygdala.</b> Acute administration of clozapine (10 - 20 mg/kg) induced FLI in the central amygdaloid nucleus, IPAC, SLEA, and BST lateral division and, as previously described, in areas connected to <b>the</b> extended <b>amygdala,</b> such as <b>the</b> prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens shell. In contrast, acute administration of haloperidol (0. 1 - 1 mg/kg) failed to induce FLI in the BST lateral division and SLEA but increased FLI in the IPAC.
