As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find no sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bent line of deck.

25|$|The {{original}} slipway {{was built}} by John Ward Girdlestone in 1890 which had replaced a predecessor built in the 1850s by boatbuilders Ross and Sage. It used {{a system in which}} the ship is floated onto the cradle and secured. The cradle is then drawn out of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> steam-driven winch. The device was a low-cost alternative to dry docks for maintenance and repair work. This became known as the Patent slipway or 'Heave-up Slip' and was patented in 1819 by shipbuilder Thomas Morton of Leith in Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 9 A.M., {{with the}} {{submersible}} {{about to be}} lifted out of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> towline back onto the ship, a water alarm sounded in the aft sphere, a self-contained part of the submersible containing machinery and oil storage. The towline had apparently fouled on the aft sphere hatch and wrenched it open. With {{the sound of water}} entering the aft compartment, Pisces III became inverted and began to sink back to the seabed. The aft sphere was now fully flooded. The additional weight of water now added over a tonne of extra weight to the submersible.|$|E
25|$|This {{new concept}} in lock design {{has yet to}} be {{installed}} on any waterway. It is basically a shaft lock with a diagonal shaft. The proposal is for a long tube of reinforced concrete, of a size to accommodate the boats being lifted, to be built on the slope between the upper and lower levels. The bottom of the tube is sealed with a strong watertight door, but there is a single pair of conventional lock gates at the top, installed a boat's length from the far wall of the tube. The change in level is achieved by filling the tube with water from the top pound, or by draining. The vessel floats on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> guide float or pontoon, shaped to fit the tube, floating alongside to keep it clear of the walls. Side ponds, piped from the main tube, are incorporated to save water. In replacing a traditional flight or staircase of locks, a considerable time saving is anticipated. It differs from the similar caisson lock design in that the boat {{does not have to be}} carried in a submerged chamber.|$|E

25|$|Straight away Munroe {{obtained}} a few lumps of black graphite which he beat to a pulp with a hammer. He separated the fine particles that floated {{to the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spoon and mixed them with a clay solution. His first experiments with this lead solution was not very successful. He continued making cabinet maker’s squares and sold the few of these which he could. In this time he continued experimenting with graphite lead for pencils with little accomplishment. He had no knowledge of the subject and feared consulting others as they might take the idea and produce pencils themselves. Munroe continued experimenting in secret with graphite powder formulas on his own. Eventually he figured a way {{to come up with a}} suitable graphite paste formula of various ingredients that could be poured into a slotted line made in some cedar wood blanks. The pencil centers would be his secret formula of a mixture of dried graphite paste of clay and other unknown ingredients. They were air dried and not hardened by firing in a furnace as Europeans did, so the quality was not as good as theirs—but it was fine enough to write with.|$|E

500|$|At the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the Lone Wanderer is {{freed from}} their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who {{requests}} a private audience with them, but Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders, takes {{command of the}} Enclave's military, and orders the Lone Wanderer to be shot on sight. Despite the setback, the Wanderer meets with Eden who is revealed to be a sentient ZAX series supercomputer that {{took control of the}} Enclave after President Dick Richardson was killed off the West Coast. Seeking to repeat Richardson's plans, Eden reveals his intentions of using Project Purity to infect <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life, thus killing off most life in the wasteland including humans. The Enclave, who would be immune to the effects because of their genetic [...] "purity" [...] {{as a result of their}} isolation, would be free to take control of the area. Forced to take a sample of the new FEV, the Wanderer leaves the base, regardless of doing so peacefully or convincing Eden to self-destruct. Returning to the Citadel, where news of the Enclave's possession of the G.E.C.K. is known to the Brotherhood, the Lone Wanderer joins them in an assault on the Jefferson Memorial, which is spearheaded through the use of a giant, military robot named Liberty Prime. Reaching the control room and dealing with Colonel Autumn, where the player has the choice to either convince Autumn to leave or they can kill him, Li informs the Wanderer that the purifier is now ready for activation, but that the code must be inputted manually within the control room, meaning whoever goes in would be subjected to lethal amounts of radiation. To make matters worse, the purifier has been damaged and will self-destruct if not activated.|$|E
2500|$|The gut of E. superba {{can often}} be seen shining green through the animal's {{transparent}} skin, an indication that this species feeds predominantly on phytoplankton – especially very small diatoms (20μm), which it filters from <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> feeding basket.

2500|$|During the Battle of Midway, Shirakumo {{was part}} of [...] "Operation AL" [...] - the diversionary {{invasion}} of the Aleutian islands. In July 1942, Shirakumo sailed from Amami-Ōshima to Mako Guard District, Singapore, Sabang and Mergui for a projected second Indian Ocean raid. The operation was cancelled due to the Guadalcanal campaign, and Shirakumo was ordered to Truk instead. In August, Shirakumo was used for “Tokyo Express” high speed transport missions in the Solomon Islands. On 28 August, after having aborted a troop transport mission to Guadalcanal, Shirakumo suffered heavy damage in an attack by American dive bombers, and was left dead in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> direct hit to her engine room, although only two crewmen were wounded.
