40|$|Abstract. We propose TBSP, a TDMA {{protocol}} for gathering information periodically from multiple data sources {{to a central}} location across multiple hops. TBSP incurs a lower overhead than the existing protocols because it only requires the sensor nodes {{to keep track of}} their own schedule, whereas in the existing protocols each node needs to know the schedule of its neighbors. In order to gain a transmission slot, the sensor nodes transmit in different slots until they find one with sufficiently low interference. TBSP provides mechanisms to reduce the probability that the sensor nodes steal each other’s slots or thwart each other’s efforts.

Fiber optics technology has the capability to meet the requirements of these applications. Thus far, the vast majority of research on fiber-optic analog communications has concentrated on the modulation of continuous wave (CW) lasers for encoding data, such as sub-carrier multiplexing (SCM). However, since the signals are multiplexed and demultiplexed in the electrical domain, the maximum number of channels is limited in such a system due to intermodulation distortion caused by nonlinearities in the electrical-optical-electrical conversion process. In contrast, the techniques presented in the work are based on the multiplexing and demultiplexing of signals in the optical domain, thereby reducing nonlinear interactions between channels. In our approach, each analog signal is encoded as an envelope onto an optical pulse train.

While wake-up radio is employed for emergency and on-demand traffic. In an emergency situation, the sensor transmits an alert signal to the body coordinator and the body coordinator replies with allocation of a channel. The energy consumption is low but sensors wait to transmit data in their predefined time slot which is the drawback of this protocol [28] due to outnumber of states in the state-transaction diagram.
