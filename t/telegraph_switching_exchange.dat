40|$|<b>Exchanges</b> of <b>switches</b> {{is a time}} {{consuming}} and costly procedure that entails high risks for the contractor while the profit margin is low. The high cost is partly linked to the machine costs, where especially the cranes that lifts switchparts represent a major cost item. The cranes major drawback lies beyond the cost of these, in essence, the cranes can not perform any other activity than lifting, {{making it more difficult}} to reduce setup times. To reduce the cost of <b>switch</b> <b>exchanges,</b> this study intended to investigate the possibilities of using large construction machinery and, for the task specially adapted, a load distributing beam to lift the precast switch components. Construction machinery has historically been used to lift switches often without load distributing measures which can directly be contrary to the quality of deflection of the switch components, which the swedish transport administration regulations specify. Construction machinery can, unlike cranes, carry out other activities than just lifting where setup times are reduced and overall machine cost of the <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> should reduce. The study is thus designed to examine and clarify the conditions required for an alternative <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> method to be used. The conditions are based on the requirements that arise related to production, quality and contract aspects where the study also have included three traditionally utilized methods, gantry crane, rail-mounted crane and mobile crane. This is to enable to compare {{the pros and cons of}} the alternative method in comparison to the established <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> methods. The alternative method is also, along with the other <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> methods, tested against two real projects, the rebuilding of the meeting railyards Kaisepakte and Rensjön, with the intention to verify the study’s theoretically generated demand profiles. The study shows that the overall premise of using an alternative transmission shift method is based on the ability of the contractor to plan and prepare for using the method. Projects based on the swedish transport administration regulations and standards must create a good enough opportunity for the contractor to plan and prepare for the method. Which can be created by:• Continuity and sustainability of the client• Clearer quality requirements• Increased cooperation between client, contractor and construction planner• Focus on planningThe study of comparative analyzes also show that the <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> project have a tendency to change and comes with a high level of complexity, which makes it very difficult to argue that a single <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> method is fitted to meet the demands of all types of projects. Clear however is that the methods complement each other in regards to being able to master each other's weaknesses. The exception is the alternate <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> method and mobile cranes which impose similar requirements on the projects. Which could lead to the alternative method could be able to acquire the mobile cranes place as <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> method. The alternate <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> method's most obvious drawbacks are associated with:• Changes in the length of the switch parts• The presence of contact wire• The presence of slopes and ditches• Transport limitations to/from the siteValiderat; 20140924 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2015. Major: Physics. Advisor: Earl Dahlberg. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 98 pages. We {{present the results}} of a study on stochastic resonance in individual magnetic random telegraph oscillators. We have fabricated sub-micron magnetic samples, which have multiple stable magnetic states. We are able to observe random <b>telegraph</b> <b>switching</b> between magnetic states and tune the energetics by varying the temperature and applied external field. If a small AC field is applied to the system, it will modulate the energy well depth for the two states and the system shows stochastic resonance near the matching condition 2 f[A] = ?[D], where ?[D] is the drive frequency and f is the characteristic frequency of magnetic transitions. We fit our measured data for the resonance amplitude and phase of the particle as a function of temperature to a linear-response model and obtain good agreement. At low temperatures we observe a peak in the phase lag of the returned signal, which is consistent with linear-response theories. At higher temperatures, our fitted model parameters suggest that the particle has an energy surface that is not sinusoidal. This contradicts our initial approximation for the energy surface, but it is consistent with a model for magnetic energy that takes into account the magnetization dynamics near the conditions for random <b>telegraph</b> <b>switching.</b> Our work is the first clear observation of stochastic resonance in a single superparamagnetic particle where the energetics are modulated by an applied field. In addition, our work is the first physical system where stochastic resonance has been characterized with sufficient detail to allow for comparison to linear-response models...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{types and}} parameters of memories used in communication engineering. The memory is a device which {{is able to}} record and to save information for the certain period of time. The memory is used in computers, measuring devices, consumer electronics etc. Main parameters of the memory are capacity, data stream speed, price of bit and time of memory cycle. The {{first part of this}} thesis deals with two types of memory – external and internal. External memories are removable media such as discs and magnetic tapes used for information saving and data backup for longtime period. Inner memories – in the form of semiconductive components – are mostly attached to the main panel. There are two types of inner memories – RAM (random access memory) and ROM (read only memory). The memories could be further divided according to their dependence on feeding used for memory saving. Types of memories used in <b>switching</b> <b>exchanges</b> are also mentioned in this part. The next part discusses the scheme of T switch for the first level of European PDH E 1. The space switch and the time switch T belongs to switches used in digital <b>switching</b> <b>exchange.</b> In this part, the T switch, in particular the switch TR with controlled reading and the switch TW with controlled writing are described into details such as its parameters and methods of control.
