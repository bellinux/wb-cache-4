5|$|While {{waiting at}} the {{hospital}} as Marcus is being treated, Grace breaks down and Mason becomes upset with her for refusing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> how she feels; instead, she tells him that she no longer wants to marry him and that she plans to have an abortion. Upset, she returns to Jayden's father's house and breaks in, intending to injure him while he sleeps, but she is interrupted by Jayden, who suggests that they smash his car instead. Grace opens up to Jayden about being sexually abused by her own father, and after Jayden shows Grace bruises from where her father hit her they return together to Short Term 12, where Jayden reports her father for physical abuse. Grace goes home to apologize to Mason, who tells her that Marcus will recover.|$|E
5|$|Liz Sanbourne is the adopted {{daughter}} of Mr. Sanbourne and Ruby Lincoln and the adoptive sister of Eve Russell, who is Ruby's daughter {{from a previous}} marriage. Eve and Liz are both unaware of the adoption, believing that they were half-sisters. Mr. Sanbourne repeatedly molested Liz after Eve left home to be a nightclub singer, and a prostitute, and start a relationship with businessman Julian Crane. Liz blamed Eve for abandoning her to her father's sexual abuse. When she was fourteen, Liz went to Boston in search of Eve. She tracked down Julian at a jazz club <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> her sister and their relationship. Later that night, Alistair Crane, Julian's father, raped Liz in his son's apartment; Julian was passed out in a drunken stupor {{in the same room}} and was unaware of what happened. The rape resulted in Liz's pregnancy with Chad Harris-Crane, who was later believed to be Eve and Julian's son; Liz gave up her baby for adoption at birth, and was forced to undergo surgery that left her barren.|$|E

25|$|Harold Bishop {{visits and}} admits to having {{reservations}} about Amber and the wedding, causing Daniel to rescind his invitation. Paul also tries to stop Daniel from getting married by inviting Des Clarke (Paul Keane) <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> his failed first wedding. On {{the day of}} the wedding, Daniel tries to persuade Imogen to attend, but she admits that she is in love with him. Daniel learns the whereabouts of Agnes Robinson's ring and Imogen goes with him to retrieve it from an old well.

500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. I would walk up <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the scene and I could see that he was already there.|$|E

500|$|Several {{people were}} interviewed for the part, {{including}} Tom Jones, Robert Goulet, and Jerry Vale. Meanwhile, Behr {{and a friend}} attended a memorabilia show at the Beverly Garland Hotel in North Hollywood, where James Darren was signing autographs. Darren had not wanted to attend the event, but had been convinced otherwise. Behr thought he was so charming that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the role on the spot, but his friend talked {{him out of it}} as he felt that Darren would think he was insane. Surma got in touch with Darren at Behr's prompting. Darren initially rejected the role, having heard that the part was a singer. Darren's agent went back to him three times and eventually convinced him to read the script, which is when {{he fell in love with}} the character. He later called it a [...] "dream come true".|$|E
500|$|Karofsky is {{featured}} in the first eleven episodes of the second season continuing his bullying ways; in the sixth, [...] "Never Been Kissed", he especially targets Kurt, who is gay. After he slams Kurt into a locker, Kurt chases after and confronts him, and an increasingly agitated Karofsky abruptly grabs Kurt and kisses him. Before Karofsky can initiate a second kiss, a stunned Kurt shoves him away, and Karofsky leaves. Kurt and his new gay friend Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) later try <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> being gay and closeted, but he denies that the kiss happened and soon resumes his bullying. He even threatens to kill Kurt if he tells anyone else about the kiss. Kurt's father Burt (Mike O'Malley) finds out about the threat, but not the kiss, and Karofsky is soon expelled, but is allowed to return by the school board because no physical violence to Kurt had been witnessed; Kurt transfers to Dalton Academy {{to get away from}} him.|$|E
500|$|After Hershiser reached 49 {{consecutive}} innings {{because of}} what some sources describe as an umpire's favorable interference ruling on a double play, the sports media compared him to Drysdale, who had a similar incident occur during his streak. The Houston Chronicle noted that both beneficial calls were in Dodgers–Giants games. However, the press also noted that Hershiser needed another complete game shutout to tie Drysdale and pass Johnson on the all-time consecutive scoreless innings list. In addition to covering the record pursuit, some sportswriters perceived that Hershiser had taken a commanding lead in the Cy Young Award race. Despite the official ruling by MLB statistician Seymour Siwoff that only full innings of starting pitchers count toward the record, some of the press continued {{to refer to the}} record as [...] innings. The pennant race also continued to draw attention as the Dodgers closed in on the NL West division title. An Associated Press article noted that it was Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout. As Hershiser's last remaining start approached, the media mentioned that he needed one more complete game shutout to tie the all-time record. When the total reached 49, Hershiser first began to feel that the record was within reach. Not only were his teammates too superstitious <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the streak, Dodgers announcer Drysdale also avoided the subject when talking to Hershiser for fear of jinxing him. Hershiser was not superstitious about the record, saying, [...] "I'm pretty loosey-goosey about it... I talk about it all the time. I'm not superstitious." ...|$|E

By the time of her last message, which she sent in March 2013, she said she had visited the university's Office of Gender-Based Misconduct and that they had asked whether she had tried talking to the accused. A university spokesperson said in February 2015 that its gender-based misconduct policy does not recommend informal resolution or mediation for such complaints.|$|E

2500|$|Until the 1980s, Dalits {{had little}} {{involvement}} in Bollywood or other film industries of India {{and the community}} were rarely depicted {{at the heart of}} storylines. Chirag Paswan (son of Dalit leader Ram Vilas Paswan) launched his career in Bollywood with his debut film Miley Naa Miley Hum in 2011. Despite political connections and the financial ability to struggle against ingrained prejudices, Chirag was not able to [...] "bag" [...] any other movie project in the following years. Chirag, in his early days, described Bollywood as his [...] "childhood dream", but eventually entered politics instead. When the media tried <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> [...] "Caste in Bollywood", he refused to talk about the matter, and his silence speaks for itself.

The continued use of caste based references to Dalit sub-castes in South Indian films (typecast and pigeonholed in their main socio-economic sub-group) angers many Dalit fans.|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday, April 27, a man {{was arrested}} in Corpus Christi, Texas for trying to sell a {{saxophone}} to a music store. On Thursday, April 25, the thirty-year-old man walked into a music store without an instrument and asked the sales person {{if they wanted to}} buy an alto Bundy saxophone. The girl told him that she would need to speak to her manager. The man replied, [...] "What do you have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it for? You work here, don't you?" [...] The girl claimed that the man seemed nervous. Once the manager was summoned, the man fled. The store contacted the police. The man was arrested two days later at a waterfront hotel after purchasing a [...]45 revolver from a pawn shop. On Tuesday, April 30, the sales girl identified him as the same man who tried selling the saxophone. Although no saxophone was found in his possession, the police found a bag of bloody clothing in his hotel room. The man claimed that the blood was from a cut he had received on his forehead in a bar fight.|$|E
