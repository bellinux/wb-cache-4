It marked Cone's first return to Yankee Stadium since leaving the team. Cone would later take part in another notable game later that year when he went up against newly acquired Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina. Mussina had come within one strike of pitching a perfect game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th-inning two-out, two-strike single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 1–0 Yankee win. Coincidentally, David Cone was the last Yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game, in 1999.|$|E

Eight perpetrators received sentences ranging from five years probation to five years in federal prison and an additional member of the Rajneesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy.

5|$|Underbelly, {{the first}} series of Australian crime {{television}} drama series Underbelly. The thirteen-part series originally aired from 13 February 2008 to 7 May 2008 on the Nine Network and is {{loosely based on}} the real events of the 1995–2004 gangland war in Melbourne. It depicts <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>players</b> in Melbourne's criminal underworld, including the Carlton Crew and their rival, Carl Williams. The series {{is based on the}} book Leadbelly: Inside Australia's Underworld, by journalists John Silvester and Andrew Rule, and borrows its name from the successful Underbelly true crime anthology book series also authored by Silvester and Rule. An alternative and significantly updated tie-in novel, Underbelly: The Gangland War, was released as their 13th book in the series. The series is produced by the Australian Film Finance Corporation, in association with Film Victoria. The executive producers are Des Monaghan and Jo Horsburgh.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the entry}} of the United States into World War I, in April 1917, Middleton was {{assigned}} to the 4th Infantry Division, and soon saw action as a battalion commander during the Second Battle of the Marne. Three months later, following some minor support roles, his unit led the attack during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, and Middleton became a regimental commander. Because of his exceptional battlefield performance, on 14 October 1918 he was promoted to the rank of colonel, becoming, at the age of 29, the youngest officer of that rank in the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). He also received the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his exemplary service. Following World War I, Middleton served at the U.S. Army School of Infantry, the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, the U.S. Army War College, and as commandant of cadets at LSU. He retired from the army in 1937 to become dean of administration and later comptroller and acting vice president at LSU. His tenure at LSU was fraught with difficulty, as Middleton became one of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>players</b> in helping the university recover from a major scandal where nearly a million dollars had been embezzled.|$|E

40|$|We study {{peer effects}} in crime by {{analyzing}} co-offending networks. We first provide a credible estimate of peer effects in these networks equal to 0. 17. This estimate implies a social multiplier of 1. 2 for those individuals linked {{to only one}} co-offender and a social multiplier of 2 for those linked to three co-offenders. We then provide {{one of the first}} empirical tests of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>player</b> policy in a real world setting. This policy defines a micro-founded strategy for removing the criminal from each network that reduces total crime by the largest amount. Using longitudinal data, we are able to compare the theoretical predictions of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>player</b> policy with real world outcomes. By focusing on networks for which <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>player</b> has disappeared over time, we show that the theoretical predicted crime reduction is close to what is observed in the real world. We also show that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>player</b> policy outperforms other reasonable police policies such as targeting the most active criminals or targeting criminals who have the highest betweenness or eigenvector centrality in the network. This indicates that behavioral-based policies can be more efficient in reducing crime than those based on algorithms that have no micro-foundation...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a model where the criminal decision {{of each individual}} is affected by not only her own characteristics, {{but also by the}} characteristics of her friends (contextual effects). We determine who <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>player</b> is, i. e., the criminal who once removed generates the highest reduction in total crime in the network. We propose a new measure, the contextual intercentrality measure, that generalizes the one proposed by Ballester, Calvó-Armengol, and Zenou (2006) by taking into account the change in contextual effects following the removal of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>player.</b> We also provide an example showing that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>player</b> can be different whether contextual effects are taken into account or not. This means that the planner may target the wrong person if it ignores the effect of the “context” when removing a criminal from a network.

40|$|Criminals are {{embedded}} in a network of relationships. Social ties among criminals are modeled {{by means of a}} graph where criminals compete for a booty and benefit from local interactions with their neighbours. Each criminal decides in a non-cooperative way how much crime effort he will exert. We show that the Nash equilibrium crime effort of each individual is proportional to his equilibrium Bonacich-centrality in the network, thus establishing a bridge to the sociology literature on social networks. We then analyze a policy that consists of finding and getting rid of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>player,</b> that is, <b>the</b> criminal who, once removed, leads to the maximum reduction in aggregate crime. We provide a geometric characterization of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>player</b> identified with an optimal inter-centrality measure, which takes into account both a player's centrality and his contribution to the centrality of the others. We also provide a geometric characterization of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> group, which generalizes <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>player</b> for a group of criminals of a given size. We finally endogeneize the crime participation decision, resulting in a <b>key</b> <b>player</b> policy, which effectiveness depends on the outside opportunities available to criminals.
