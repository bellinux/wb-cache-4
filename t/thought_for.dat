5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and 1940s, economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani, and Paul Samuelson) {{attempted}} to interpret and formalise Keynes's writings {{in terms of}} formal mathematical models. In what had {{become known as the}} neoclassical synthesis, they combined Keynesian analysis with neoclassical economics to produce neo-Keynesian economics, which came to dominate mainstream macroeconomic <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> the next 40 years.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} {{secondary}} school, Presley <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> {{a short time}} about joining a gospel group. He attempted to join a group called Songfellows who sang at the local church, but he was unsuccessful. He worked on an assembly line in his first job, which he quit {{after a few weeks}} because he disliked the work. He then decided to become an apprentice electrician at Crown Electric.|$|E
5|$|Astana was {{at first}} not invited to the Giro. Six days before the race began, RCS Sport (the {{organizers}} of the Giro) went back on the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation. This change of heart was at least partly contingent on Contador, Leipheimer, and Klöden participating in the race. Having <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> two months prior {{that they would not}} compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had planned to take a break during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was headed to the Giro.|$|E

5|$|McKenna {{grew up in}} Hackensack, New Jersey {{and upon}} {{graduating from high school}} entered the Medical Mission Sisters, a Roman Catholic {{organization}} of women dedicated to improving world access to health care. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from Chestnut Hill College, then a small Catholic women's college, and a master's degree in liturgy from Notre Dame University before moving on to the University of Pennsylvania and earning a doctorate in Christian origins and religious <b>thought.</b> <b>For</b> her doctorate thesis, she traveled to Israel for the clarity and solitude.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{reinforcing}} Luso-Rhodesian relations, the Lisbon {{appointment was}} designed to secure the African nation a diplomatic foothold in Europe outside of Britain's reach and to help Salisbury find new trading partners and diplomatic allies on the continent. Among other things, the Rhodesians intended {{to make up the}} shortfalls in military equipment caused by the undeclared Anglo-American arms embargo. Reedman, the former minister for immigration and tourism, was also a retired officer of the British Royal Air Force (where he had been involved in bomber research), and an experienced engineer and businessman: all the right ingredients, the government <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> someone in the position to source European aircraft, weapons and other equipment, while also representing Rhodesian interests in mainland Europe.|$|E
5|$|Welcome to Alflolol (Bienvenue sur Alflolol) brings Laureline's rebellious {{nature to}} the fore; unlike Valérian, {{she has not}} been born and raised by Galaxity and is {{prepared}} not only to question Galaxity's authorities but to rebel openly against them when their orders run contrary to her sense of morality. It also demonstrates her impulsive streak; she sides with the native Alflololians against Galaxity and Valérian with no <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> the personal consequences she may have to face herself. Her position as the true star of the series is cemented in Ambassador of the Shadows (L'Ambassadeur des Ombres), which is virtually a solo adventure for her as she searches the vast space station Point Central for the kidnapped Valérian and the Earth Ambassador. Later, when acting as independent agents, it is Laureline who questions the ethics of some of the jobs they are forced to take to make ends meet, notably in The Living Weapons (Les Armes Vivantes).|$|E

25|$|In <b>Thought</b> <b>for</b> the Day, {{featured}} since 1970, {{a speaker}} reflects on topical issues from a theological viewpoint, the editorial responsibility lying with BBC's Religion and Ethics Department (a point often {{made on the}} Today programme). Notable contributors to the slot have included Rabbi Lionel Blue, the academic Elaine Storkey, the Sikh Indarjit Singh and Richard Harries, the former Bishop of Oxford. Over the years the slot has featured {{an increasing number of}} speakers from religions other than Christianity, though Christian speakers remain in a substantial majority. In August 2002 University of Oxford professor Richard Dawkins gave a non-religious humanist <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> the day; however, this did not replace the regular thought and was broadcast an hour later as an alternative thought.|$|E

25|$|The Aristotelian {{syllogism}} dominated Western philosophical <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> many centuries. In the 17th century, Sir Francis Bacon {{rejected the}} idea of syllogism as being {{the best way to}} draw conclusions in nature. Instead, Bacon proposed a more inductive approach to the observation of nature, which involves experimentation and leads to discovering and building on axioms to create a more general conclusion.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the communists}} {{came to power}} in China in 1949, villagers {{followed}} these traditional principles and tried to use the natural resources conservatively, with <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> the preservation of the natural resources for future generations. However, after 1949 serious cultural and social change came to the Nashi, and the government encouraged logging by the Han army in Nashi areas, which in turn led to a loss of influence of the traditional customs.|$|E
25|$|Language-related {{areas are}} {{dedicated}} to certain components of language processing (e.g. lexical semantics). These areas are functionally characterized by linguistically pertinent systems, such as phonology, syntax, and lexical semantics—and not in speaking, reading, and listening. In the normal human brain, areas associated with linguistic processing are less rigid than previously <b>thought.</b> <b>For</b> example, increased familiarity with a language {{has been found to}} lead to decreases in brain activation in left dorsolateral frontal cortex (Brodmann areas, 9, 10, 46).|$|E

25|$|Fanny {{suggested}} that Mrs Troake {{use a small}} pastry boat filled with fruit sorbet and covered with spun sugar, decorated with an orange slice and a cherry through a cocktail stick to give the dish {{the look of a}} small boat, suitable, Fanny <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> the naval guests.

25|$|There, {{a fabulous}} welcome awaited them. On the ramparts above the wreck strewn harbour, on the Barracca, St Angelo and Senglea, great crowds of Maltese {{men and women}} waved and cheered and a brass band {{on the end of}} the mole was giving a {{spirited}} rendition of Rule Britannia. Captain Mason, however, standing at the salute on the battered bridge of Ohio, could spare not a moment's <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> the pride of bringing the ship to harbour, since the creaking plates showed that Ohio might still go to the bottom of the Grand Harbour.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{calligraphy}} {{was influenced}} by, and influenced, Zen <b>thought.</b> <b>For</b> any {{particular piece of}} paper, the calligrapher has but one chance to create with the brush. The brush strokes cannot be corrected, and even a lack of confidence {{shows up in the}} work. The calligrapher must concentrate and be fluid in execution. The brush writes a statement about the calligrapher at a moment in time (see Hitsuzendō, the Zen way of the brush). Through Zen, Japanese calligraphy absorbed a distinct Japanese aesthetic often symbolised by the ensō or circle of enlightenment.|$|E

25|$|Kurzweil's main {{thesis is}} that these {{hierarchical}} pattern recognizers are used not just for sensing the world, but for nearly all aspects of <b>thought.</b> <b>For</b> example, Kurzweil says memory recall {{is based on the}} same patterns that were used when sensing the world in the first place. Kurzweil says that learning is critical to human intelligence. A computer version of the neocortex would initially be like a new born baby, unable to do much. Only through repeated exposure to patterns would it eventually self-organize and become functional.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} line-up of {{the band}} reformed and toured in 1999, playing Shakespeare Alabama in full (a decade ahead of other bands doing similar 'album' tours) and old Moby Grape favourites. During the year the band recorded and played one off gigs in Leicester and London, showcasing some of their new material. However old resentments resurfaced and Smith left the band again. During this period, the band accepted an invitation to contribute to , a tribute album for Moby Grape co-founder Skip Spence, who was terminally ill with cancer. In 2000, the band signed to Hypertension Records and their next album, <b>Thought</b> <b>For</b> Food was released in August.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010 the {{government}} passed the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, which implemented many of Sir Michael Pitt's recommendations.

In also brings in a new regime whereby new building activity which exacerbates flooding by reducing the capacity of land to absorb water {{will need to be}} accompanied by the construction of sustainable drainage systems such as grassy roofs, ponds and soakaways.|$|E
