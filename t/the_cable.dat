The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. <b>The</b> <b>cable</b> is released at a height of about 35% of <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> length after a short, steep ride.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the design of}} a new steerable tip for a laparoscopic instrument. A new tip design is required since current steerable tip designs have problems with the bending stiffness and the lifespan of <b>the</b> <b>cables.</b> Underaction is a main cause of the low tip stiffness. Since one of the design requirements is that the tip {{needs to be able to}} rotate in two perpendicular planes, the tip has two rotational degrees of freedom (DOF). The simplest way to fully actuate the tip and to rotate each DOF over 90 degrees in a clockwise (CW) and counter clockwise (CCW) direction is by using two cables for each DOF, resulting in a total of four <b>cables</b> in <b>the</b> tip. A limiting factor of the lifespan of the tip is the fatigue of <b>the</b> <b>cables.</b> <b>The</b> fatigue is the result of <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> being forced to make a sharp bend during a rotation of the tip. To reduce the fatigue of <b>the</b> <b>cables,</b> <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> therefore need to be guided and to make a bend as large as possible in a g 5 mm tip. As a prove of concept, two prototypes have been produced. From these prototypes it can be concluded that each DOF in the tip is able to rotate up to an angle of 90 degrees in CW and CCW direction. It can also be concluded that the tip is fully actuated. The bending stiffness of the tip therefore only depends on the stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> and <b>the</b> rigid bodies of the tip. Since <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> and rigid bodies will be produced from steel, the bending stiffness of the tip will be high. Considering <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> to have a diameter of 0. 5 mm, <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> will be guided over a guiding with a radius of 3. 48 mm. Compared to the EndoWrist, where the radius of the pulley with similar cables would be 2 mm, the radius is almost 1. 75 as large. The result is that the lifespan of <b>the</b> <b>cables</b> in <b>the</b> new design will be superior. BMDBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
