The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown {{following}} Mr. Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs First Officer Murdoch about <b>the</b> <b>iceberg.</b> He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.|$|E
50|$|Both the AMRC and the AWS {{programs}} {{have participated in}} <b>iceberg</b> studies regarding <b>the</b> monitoring of <b>iceberg</b> motions and <b>the</b> collection of meteorological observations taken {{from the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>icebergs</b> themselves. During <b>the</b> calving of <b>icebergs</b> in 2000, <b>the</b> UW-Madison AWS program installed AWS units on large calved <b>icebergs,</b> while <b>the</b> AMRC tracked <b>the</b> <b>icebergs</b> from space. <b>The</b> research resulted in an improved understanding of the motion of large tabular icebergs that were created by calving mechanisms.|$|R
40|$|The {{legal status}} of <b>the</b> <b>icebergs</b> in <b>the</b> {{international}} law should be studied taking into account both its legal status as the place where this resource is present. <b>The</b> <b>icebergs</b> are an ice formation composed of fresh water that can float adrift in the sea, so {{it is necessary to}} know whether to apply, for purposes of appropriation and exploitation, the general rules of {{the law of the sea}} that governing the different maritime spaces; or well, understand <b>the</b> <b>icebergs</b> as a special resource that requires a particular normative, different from that which exists today in international law...|$|R
60|$|Sammy {{thought that}} Mr. Gibbs's desire could be {{accomplished}} by sinking into the water in which they now lay and sailing under <b>the</b> <b>icebergs</b> to <b>the</b> lake, but Mr. Gibbs did not favor this. He was afraid to go under <b>the</b> <b>icebergs.</b> To be sure, they had already sailed under one of them when the Dipsey had made her way northward from the lake, but they had found that the depth of water varied very much in different places, and <b>the</b> <b>icebergs</b> {{in front of them}} might be heavier, and therefore more deeply sunken, than those which they had previously passed under.|$|R
5|$|In 1996, {{treasure}} hunter Brock Lovett and {{his team}} aboard the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh search the wreck of RMS Titanic for a necklace with a rare diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. They recover a safe containing a drawing {{of a young woman}} wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck <b>the</b> <b>iceberg.</b> Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard Keldysh and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard Titanic.|$|E
5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed {{just in time}} {{to avoid}} a head-on collision, but the change in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike <b>the</b> <b>iceberg</b> with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the starboard side of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E
5|$|In {{boiler room}} No.4, at around 01:20, water began {{flooding}} in from below, possibly {{indicating that the}} bottom of the ship had also been holed by <b>the</b> <b>iceberg.</b> The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the firemen and trimmers to evacuate the forward boiler rooms. Further aft, Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues, and a handful of volunteer firemen and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No.1, 2 and 3 boiler rooms and in the turbine and reciprocating engine rooms. They continued working on the boilers and the electrical generators {{in order to keep the}} ship's lights and pumps operable and to power the radio so that distress signals could be sent. They remained at their posts until the very end, thus ensuring that Titanics electrics functioned until the final minutes of the sinking. None of the ship's 35 engineers and electricians survived. Neither did any of the Titanics five postal clerks, who were last seen struggling to save the mail bags they had rescued from the flooded mail room. They were caught by the rising water somewhere on D deck.|$|E

5|$|Robert van Voren {{noted that}} {{after the fall of}} the Berlin Wall, it became {{apparent}} that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was only the tip of <b>the</b> <b>iceberg,</b> the sign that much more was basically wrong. This much more realistic image of Soviet psychiatry showed up only after the Soviet regime began to loosen its grip on society and later lost control over the developments and in the end entirely disintegrated. It demonstrated that the actual situation was much sorer and that many individuals had been affected. Millions of individuals were treated and stigmatized by an outdated biologically oriented and hospital-based mental health service. Living conditions in clinics were bad, sometimes even terrible, and violations of human rights were rampant. According to the data of a census published in 1992, the mortality of the ill with schizophrenia exceeded that of the general population by 4–6 times for the age of 20–39 years, by 3–4 times for the age of 30–39 years, by 1.5–2 times for the age over 40 years (larger values are for women).|$|E
5|$|Titanic {{received}} six {{warnings of}} sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted <b>the</b> <b>iceberg.</b> Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea. Titanic {{had been designed}} to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more, and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used distress flares and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats. In accordance with existing practice, Titanic's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe refuge {{for many of the}} passengers and crew. Compounding this, poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full.|$|E
25|$|Ice is {{a hazard}} to sailors venturing far below 40° south. Although the ice limit dips south around the horn, icebergs are a {{significant}} hazard for vessels in the area. In the South Pacific in February (summer in Southern Hemisphere), icebergs are generally confined to below 50° south; but in August <b>the</b> <b>iceberg</b> hazard can extend north of 40° south. Even in February, the Horn is well below the latitude of <b>the</b> <b>iceberg</b> limit. These hazards have made the Horn notorious as perhaps the most dangerous ship passage in the world; many ships were wrecked, and many sailors died attempting to round the Cape.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>icebergs</b> that calve {{from the}} glacier edge move towards the river mouth and get entrenched at the bottom. The {{movement}} of <b>the</b> <b>icebergs</b> fluctuates with <b>the</b> tide currents, {{as well as}} being affected by wind. However, they start floating as icebergs when their size is small enough to drift to <b>the</b> sea. These <b>icebergs</b> are seen in two shades: milky white and bright blue, which depends on the air trapped within the ice and is an interplay of light and ice crystals.|$|R

25|$|On {{her fifth}} whaling voyage, Admiral Colpoys sailed to South Georgia via Santiago, Cape Verde. She was lost on 28 November 1817 when an iceberg floated {{into the bay}} {{in which she was}} {{anchored}} and pushed her onshore. Her crew was saved. The crew was able to save 700 barrels of elephant oil which was transhipped to England. However, 800 barrels of elephant oil were lost. Another account reports that <b>the</b> <b>iceberg</b> severed Admiral Colpoyss cable; attempts to break up <b>the</b> <b>iceberg</b> using cannon fire were unable to prevent Admiral Colpoys from drifting on to the rocks. Francis Todrig, in King George, retrieved the crew.|$|E

25|$|Riou {{positioned}} himself near <b>the</b> <b>iceberg,</b> and despatched boats {{to collect the}} ice. By the time the last boats had been recovered night had fallen, when a sudden fogbank descended, hiding <b>the</b> <b>iceberg</b> from view. Riou {{found himself in a}} dangerous situation. Somewhere to leeward lay a large mass of ice, concealed in the darkness and fog. He posted lookouts in the bows and rigging, and began to edge slowly forward. After sometime the danger seemed to be past, and <b>the</b> <b>iceberg</b> left behind, when at 9 o'clock a strange pale glow was reported by the lookout in the bows. Riou ordered the helm to turn hard a starboard, turning into the wind as a wall of ice higher than the ship's masts slid by along the side. It briefly appeared that the danger had been avoided, but as she passed by the Guardian struck an underwater projection with a sudden crash. Caught in a sudden gust of wind the ship reared up and swung about, driving the stern into the ice, smashing away the rudder, shattering her stern frame and tearing a large gash in the hull. Despite the seriousness of the situation Riou remained calm, using the sails to pull clear of the ice, and then taking stock of the damage.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} and altitude of ice-rafted boulders {{relative to the}} modern landscape {{has been used to}} identify the highest level of water in proglacial lakes (e.g., Lake Musselshell in central Montana) and temporary lakes (e.g., Lake Lewis in Washington state. Ice-rafted debris is deposited when <b>the</b> <b>iceberg</b> strands on the shore and subsequently melts, or drops out of the ice floe as it melts. Hence all erratic deposits are deposited below the actual high water level of the lake; however the measured altitude of ice-rafted debris can be used to estimate the lake surface elevation.|$|E
25|$|Tidewater glaciers are glaciers that {{terminate}} in the sea, {{including most}} glaciers flowing from Greenland, Antarctica, Baffin and Ellesmere Islands in Canada, Southeast Alaska, and the Northern and Southern Patagonian Ice Fields. As the ice reaches the sea, pieces break off, or calve, forming icebergs. Most tidewater glaciers calve above sea level, which {{often results in}} a tremendous impact as <b>the</b> <b>iceberg</b> strikes the water. Tidewater glaciers undergo centuries-long cycles of advance and retreat that are much less affected by the climate change than those of other glaciers.|$|E
