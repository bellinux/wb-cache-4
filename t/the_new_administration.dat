5|$|Castro proclaimed <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration</b> {{a direct}} democracy, in which Cubans could {{assemble}} at demonstrations {{to express their}} democratic will. As a result, he rejected the need for elections, claiming that representative democratic systems served the interests of socio-economic elites. U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter announced that Cuba was adopting the Soviet model of rule, with a one-party state, government control of trade unions, suppression of civil liberties, {{and the absence of}} freedom of speech and press.|$|E
5|$|Discontent {{against the}} king grew, however, and {{eventually}} affected also Edmund. The antagonism was largely caused by Edward's preference {{for his new}} favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father. In 1326, Edmund joined a rebellion led by Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, whereby Edward II was deposed. Edmund failed {{to get along with}} <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration,</b> and in 1330 he was caught planning a new rebellion, and executed.|$|E

5|$|In November 2010, a new technocratic {{government}} {{was elected to}} office, which enacted numerous reforms, especially in the security sector. By August 2011, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration</b> and its AMISOM allies had managed to capture all of Mogadishu from the Al-Shabaab militants. Mogadishu has subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction spearheaded by the Somali diaspora, the municipal authorities, and Turkey, a historic ally of Somalia.|$|E

50|$|Populations {{of ethnic}} Serbs and Albanians tended to shift {{following}} territorial conquests. As {{a result of}} the multi-ethnic composition of Kosovo, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administrations</b> provoked a mixed response from the local population.

5|$|Despite its rapid {{gains and}} popular backing, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration</b> {{was marked by}} {{conflicts}} between the radical wing and more conservative forces, especially {{over the issue of}} land reform. Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats, and ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals was made possible by the international context, and former revolutionaries became the original political class in united Romania.|$|E
5|$|Having gained {{prestige}} {{from the}} constructions in the Loggia, Cairano {{received at least}} two commissions from the nobility of Brescia. Involved in the leadership of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration,</b> they were certainly aware of his ability. There are papers dating back to 1496 that document Cairano's commission for the Tomb of Gaspare Brunelli, which, in 1500, {{was placed in the}} Brunelli chapel within the Church of St Francis. During the same period, the Caprioli family commissioned the tomb of Luigi Caprioli to be placed within their chapel in the church of San Giorgio, probably together with other sculptures, made probably in collaboration with the Sanmicheli workshop, to which is attributed the marble jamb decorated with candelabras.|$|E

5|$|Isabella and Mortimer rapidly took {{revenge on}} the former regime. Hugh Despenser the Younger was put on trial, {{declared}} a traitor and sentenced to be disembowelled, castrated and quartered; he was duly executed on 24 November 1326. Edward's former chancellor, Robert Baldock, died in Fleet Prison; the Earl of Arundel was beheaded. Edward's position, however, was problematic; he was still married to Isabella and, in principle, he remained the king, but most of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration</b> {{had a lot to}} lose were he to be released and potentially regain power.|$|E
5|$|John Tyler Jr. (March 29, 1790 – January 18, 1862) {{served as}} the tenth President of the United States (1841–45) after briefly being the tenth Vice President (1841); {{he was elected to}} the latter office on the 1840 Whig ticket with President William Henry Harrison. Tyler ascended to the {{presidency}} after Harrison's death in April 1841, a mere month after the start of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration.</b> He was a supporter of states' rights, and as president he adopted nationalist policies only when they did not infringe on the powers of the states. His unexpected rise to the presidency, with the resulting threat to the presidential ambitions of Henry Clay and other politicians, left him estranged from both major political parties.|$|E
5|$|When Ronald Reagan {{was elected}} {{president}} in November 1980, Scalia hoped for a major position in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration.</b> He was interviewed for the position of Solicitor General of the United States, but the position went to Rex E.

Scalia was offered {{a seat on the}} Chicago-based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in early 1982 but declined it, hoping to be appointed to the highly influential United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit). Later that year, Reagan offered Scalia a seat on the D.C. Circuit, which Scalia accepted. He was confirmed by the US Senate on August 5, 1982, and was sworn in on August 17, 1982.|$|E

5|$|After Roosevelt's {{death and}} Truman's {{succession}} to the Presidency, Minton continued offering advice to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration</b> {{on a range}} of topics, including patronage and political maneuvering. Truman appointed Minton as head of the War Department Clemency Board, a panel of judges charged with overseeing reviews of decisions made by the courts-martial. The panel met every two weeks which, along with his responsibilities on the circuit court, kept Minton very busy and afforded him little rest, leading to a deterioration in his health. While yachting with President Truman on Memorial Day in 1945, Truman asked Minton to accept an appointment to the position of Solicitor General of the United States. Minton declined because of his health, but he told Truman he would be interested in a seat on the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November 2014, the admin of {{the page}} {{announced}} his retirement on Facebook. He stated that he was leaving the page for personal reasons, but that Valor por Tamaulipas would continue under new management. That person, he said, had some relationship with law enforcement. The admin believes {{that this would be}} of benefit for the cyber community because it would allow for citizen reports to reach law enforcement directly. The admin also announced that the pages Responsabilidad, Fortaleza, and Valor por la Huasteca would go under new management too. The new management would be composed of people who he deemed trustworthy given their long history of support or because they had suffered a loss {{as a result of the}} violence. In a closing statement, he bid farewell by thanking God for bringing happiness to his personal and professional life. In the comment section of the Facebook post, many people thanked the admin for his support.

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{election}} as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper {{to conduct a}} then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess {{the attitudes of the}} Soviet government for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration.</b> Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship. On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally. Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy that there was little potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets. After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he should have taken it even more seriously. Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} 12th century the Germans played a {{relatively}} modest {{role in the}} north European trade. However, this was to change {{with the development of}} Hanseatic trade, as a result of which German traders became prominent in the Baltic and the North Sea regions. Following the death of Eric VI of Denmark, German forces attacked and sacked Denmark, bringing with them artisans and merchants under <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration</b> which controlled the Hansa regions. During the third quarter of the 14th century the Hanseatic trade faced two major difficulties: economic conflict with the Flanders and hostilities with Denmark. These events {{led to the formation of}} an organized association of Hanseatic towns, which replaced the earlier union of German merchants. This new Hansa of the towns, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade, was prominent for the next hundred and fifty years.|$|E
5|$|When Bill Clinton {{took office}} as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady and her press {{secretary}} reiterated {{that she would}} be using that form of her name. She was the first inaugural First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House. She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing. She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration</b> and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones. After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.|$|E
5|$|Pierce campaigned vigorously {{throughout}} {{his home state}} for Van Buren's re-election in the 1840 presidential election. The incumbent carried New Hampshire but lost the national vote to William Henry Harrison, the military hero, whose Whigs took a majority of seats in the Twenty-seventh Congress. Harrison died after a month in office, and Vice President John Tyler succeeded him. Pierce and the Democrats were quick to challenge <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>administration,</b> questioning the removal of federal officeholders, and opposing Whig plans for a national bank. In December 1841 Pierce decided to resign from Congress, something he had been planning for some time. New Hampshire Democrats felt that no-one should hold one of the state's Senate seats for longer than one six-year term. Thus, he had little likelihood of re-election. Also, he was frustrated at {{being a member of}} the legislative minority and wished to devote his time to his family and law practice. His last acts in the Senate before resigning in February 1842 were to oppose a bill distributing federal funds to the states – believing that the money should go to the military instead – and to challenge the Whigs to reveal the results of their investigation of the New York Customs House, where the Whigs had probed for Democratic corruption for nearly a year but had issued no findings.|$|E
