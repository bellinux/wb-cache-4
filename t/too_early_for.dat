5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Buemi was the fastest driver with a lap time of {{one minute and}} 2.164 seconds; Di Grassi and Vergne were one-tenth of a second behind in second and third. Heidfeld placed fourth; Abt was fifth-fastest and Piquet sixth. Engel was seventh-fastest, António Félix da Costa eighth, Turvey ninth and Duval completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. During the session, where teams assessed their car's thermal management {{in preparation for the}} race, Bird and Piquet locked their tyres and went off into the turn one run-off area, while Abt stopped on the start/finish straight but was able to restart his car. Duval and Frijns spun within moments of each other. López lost control of his car at the final chicane, and later heavily damaged his vehicle's front-right corner in the session's closing minutes by steering <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> turn 14 and collided with the barrier. The fastest 13 drivers were covered by under one second, indicating there would be a tightly-contested midfield battle.|$|E
25|$|According to the Cāmadevivaṃsa, {{the city}} of Hariphunchai (modern Lamphun) was founded by hermits. Camadevi, a princess of the Lavo Kingdom, was invited to rule the city around 700. However, this date is {{considered}} <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> the foundation of Hariphunchai as Camadevi brought no dharmachakras to the north. Hariphunchai may be a later (10th century) offshoot of the Lavo Kingdom or instead related to the Thaton Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The Going Home Song - A song sung {{every day}} (except Fridays {{due to the}} Official Chart) at 16:10, with three {{people who are going}} home singing to the tune of Nut Rocker by B. Bumble and the Stingers. It is often themed, for people with {{specific}} characteristics. The feature has created some controversy on Rage Against the Answer Machine, with some saying 16:10 is <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> people to be going home, to which Greg responds that they cannot do lots of different Going Home Songs throughout the whole show. In May 2016, singer Craig David recorded his own version of the Going Home Song.|$|E
25|$|He {{considered}} {{standing for}} Parliament {{at the end}} of the war, but the general election was called <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> this to be possible. After the Armistice, he spent the winter of 1918–19 in the Ardennes with his brigade and on 28 March 1919 he transferred to be brigade major of 99th Infantry Brigade. Eden contemplated applying for a regular commission, but they were very hard to come by with the Army contracting so rapidly. He initially shrugged off his mother’s suggestion of studying at Oxford. He also rejected the thought of becoming a barrister; his preferred career alternatives at this stage were standing for Parliament for Bishop Auckland, the Civil Service in East Africa, or the Foreign Office. He was demobilised on 13 June 1919. He retained the rank of captain.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} grazing {{practices}} that also encourage native biodiversity. In Rosenzweig’s book {{he uses the}} example of a rancher in Arizona who intentionally deepened his cattle ponds in order to save a population of threatened leopard frogs (Rana chiricahuensis), with no detriment to the use of those tanks for cattle, and a similar situation has occurred with the vulnerable California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) in the Central Valley of California. Research has shown that without cattle grazing, many of the remaining vernal pools would dry <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> the salamanders to complete their life cycle under global climate change predictions. In Central America, a large percentage of pastureland is fenced using live trees which are not only low maintenance for the farmer, but also provide habitat for birds, bats, and invertebrates which cannot persist in open pastureland. Another example from Rosenzweig involves encouraging loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) to populate pastureland by placing perches around the pasture. These are all simple, low-cost ways to encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting the human uses of the landscape.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no mention}} Tolkien’s {{writings}} of any further development of the alliance with Gil-galad, or of the sending of the aid that he requested {{in his letter to}} Tar-Meneldur; it is indeed said that “Aldarion was too late, or <b>too</b> <b>early.</b> <b>Too</b> late: <b>for</b> the power that hated Númenor had already waked.

Górnik manager Michał Matyas blamed his side's poor start, saying the [...] "first goal came <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> us and we never recovered from this shock." [...] The trophy was Manchester City's fourth major honour in three seasons. It made them the third English club to win the Cup Winners' Cup, after Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United.|$|E
500|$|The CTMS-1TB1 {{project was}} started in 1941 to produce a three-man light tank for the Dutch Army. It was armed with a [...] {{automatic}} cannon and coaxial M1919 machine gun.

The project was then taken over by the Ordnance Department and was tested at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in early 1943. Other, more robust light tanks were being produced at the time, and {{there was no need for}} stop-gap solutions so the prototypes were rejected for U.S. use in May 1943.|$|E

500|$|... {{was given}} the right to anoint a new bishop to Finland in 1209 {{after the death of}} the previous. So the logic and datings of the sixteenth-century writers must be esteemed as false. The date 1209 is far <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> a Dominican like Thomas to step into the office, and so Rodolphus, the first real bishop of Finland and his {{successor}} Folquinus must be considered as 13th-century bishops nominated and appointed by the Danish and not by the Swedes. As an extra proof of this the ancient Finnish taxation system of church taxes has its roots in Denmark, not in Sweden. And the same goes to lay taxes especially in the Åland Islands and to the old Finnish monetary system. As J. W. Ruuth already nearly a hundred years ago pointed out, Finland was at that time a Danish and not a Swedish mission territory, where the Danes according to the Danish annals made there expeditions in 1191, 1202 and possible even 1210 ...|$|E

Hamilton said after the game: [...] "To score for my hometown team at Wembley {{has got to be}} one of the best feelings ever." [...] Kamara added: [...] "Now I am hungry for second helpings of success. And I am absolutely convinced I can get it here. We will not look out of place in the First Division because we have so much quality." [...] County's manager Colin Murphy told the press: [...] "All credit to Bradford, they won it fair and square. And that does not always happen in football. Bradford are a very experienced side compared to mine. Maybe this came a year <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> my boys." [...] Jacobs, the Bradford full-back who played 11 years for the club and won a subsequent promotion to the Premier League, said after his career: [...] "I just look back on some amazing times and I was delighted to be part of them. It was a real blessing to my life. To play at Wembley was a dream fulfilled." ...|$|E
500|$|Joss Whedon's {{impetus to}} create [...] "Hush" [...] was his {{reaction}} to hearing that the primary reason behind Buffys success was the dialogue. He {{felt that he was}} stagnating as a director, turning into a [...] "hack" [...] by making formulaic episodes. Whedon tended to concentrate so much on the visual aspects of the series' production that he was chastised by Fox executives in earlier seasons. Thus, writing and producing [...] "Hush" [...] depended almost solely on visuals and not on dialogue, a prospect that Whedon found terrifying, worried that viewers would find the episode boring. Much like the fourth-season finale [...] "Restless"—which consisted almost entirely of dream sequences—and the sixth season musical [...] "Once More, with Feeling", Whedon was certain he would fail at attempting to present the show in such a novel way. Initially, this was to be the episode where Riley and Buffy have sex, and Whedon took comfort in that plan because he knew people would not mind the silence, but ultimately he decided it was <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> the characters to sleep together, and he scrapped the idea.|$|E
50|$|The age intake {{range of}} UTCs {{have also been}} criticised, with unions arguing that 14 is <b>too</b> <b>early</b> an age <b>for</b> most {{children}} to receive such a specialised education.

We got there about three years <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> our own good!" [...] Walt Disney Studios eventually accepted The Rocketeer because they believed the film had toyetic potential and appeal for merchandising. The Rocketeer was set to be released through the studio's Touchstone Pictures label; Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear all signed a contract which would permit {{them to make a}} trilogy of Rocketeer films. However, Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg switched the film to a Walt Disney Pictures release. According to Stevens, [...] "immediately, Betty and anything else 'adult' went right out with the bathwater. They really tried to shoehorn it into a kiddie property so they could sell toys. All they really wanted {{at the end of the}} day, was the name".|$|E
500|$|The band Motörhead {{was founded}} in 1975 by already {{experienced}} musicians. Their leader Ian [...] "Lemmy" [...] Kilmister was {{a former member of}} the space rock band Hawkwind, Larry Wallis had played with Pink Fairies, and Eddie Clarke had been a member of Curtis Knight's Zeus. Their previous experience is one element which divides critics and fans over whether the band belongs to the new wave of British heavy metal. Some believe that the band should be considered an inspiration for the movement, but not part of it, because they had signed recording contracts, toured the country, and had chart success before any NWOBHM band had stepped out of their local club scene. Motörhead were also the only metal band of the period recording songs with veteran BBC radio DJ John Peel for his Peel Sessions program and the first to reach No.1 in the UK Albums Chart with the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith in June 1981. Lemmy himself said, [...] "the NWOBHM... didn't do us much good", because Motörhead [...] "came along a bit <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> it".|$|E
500|$|Two {{radiocarbon}} datings to {{find the}} age of the bones suggested dates of 1430–60 and 1412–49—both <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> Richard's death in 1485. Mass spectrometry carried out on the bones found evidence of much seafood consumption, which is known to make radiocarbon dating samples appear older than they are. [...] A Bayesian analysis suggested there was a 68.2% probability that the true date of the bones was between 1475 and 1530, rising to 95.4% for between 1450 and 1540. Although by itself not enough to prove that the skeleton was Richard's, it was consistent with the date of his death. The mass spectrometry result indicating the rich seafood diet was confirmed by a chemical isotope analysis of two teeth, a femur and a rib. From the isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in the teeth and bones the researchers discovered the diet included much freshwater fish and exotic birds such as swan, crane and heron, and a vast quantity of wine— all items at {{the high end of the}} luxury market. Close analysis of the soil immediately below the skeleton revealed that the man had been infested with roundworm parasites when he died.|$|E

500|$|The {{inconvenient}} siting {{of stations}} {{and the decline}} in hop-picking in the area all contributed to diminishing returns on the line by the late 1950s. Apart from the 16:25 daily working from Paddock Wood which was well patronised by children, few trains carried {{more than a dozen}} passengers. Passenger journeys were estimated in 1958 at around 170 per day, to which was added around 100 schoolchildren. Even the school traffic was lost once the local authority hired the services of Maidstone & District Motor Company. The line was unpopular with commuters due to the poor connections to and from London. Only the 07:34 service would ensure arrival at [...] before 10:00 with one change at Paddock Wood, the following train at 08.20 would only get the passenger to [...] at 10.15 after two changes. In the evening, the 16:32 departed <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>for</b> many commuters while the eleven-coach 18:18 [...] service was overcrowded and divided at Tonbridge where three coaches were detached for Ashford. Hawkhurst-bound passengers had to change at Paddock Wood and cross over to the bay platform for the branch service which arrived in Hawkhurst at 19:58. Locals preferred the direct bus services to Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells over the indirect railway journey, as shown by the fact that no more than 250 return tickets were sold from Hawkhurst in the final years of the line. Only the line's expanding pot plant traffic justified its continuing existence.|$|E

50|$|The leading {{philosophy}} of TTAs {{is to move}} complexity from hardware to software. Due to this, several additional hazards are introduced to the programmer. One of them is delay slots, the programmer visible operation latency of the function units. Timing is completely {{the responsibility of the}} programmer. The programmer has to schedule the instructions such that the result is neither read <b>too</b> <b>early</b> nor <b>too</b> late. There is no hardware detection to lock up the processor in case a result is read <b>too</b> <b>early.</b> Consider, <b>for</b> example, an architecture that has an operation add with latency of 1, and operation mul with latency of 3. When triggering the add operation, it is possible to read the result in the next instruction (next clock cycle), but in case of mul, one has to wait for two instructions before the result can be read. The result is ready for the 3rd instruction after the triggering instruction.|$|R
