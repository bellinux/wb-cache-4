5|$|A {{grand jury}} petition, bearing over 1,400 {{signatures}} across 134 pages, was {{filed with the}} Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989. <b>The</b> <b>petition</b> alleged that local and state officials violated the state's open meetings, conspiracy, and conflict of interest laws while planning the turnpike.

5|$|Clashes {{over the}} {{interpretation}} and legality of <b>the</b> <b>Petition</b> began almost immediately, with the Lords and Commons arguing with the King {{as early as}} 20 June 1628, leading to the prorogation of Parliament on the 26th. <b>The</b> <b>Petition</b> of Right was not a formal statute, and despite it being reaffirmed as a bill by the Long Parliament in 1641, {{the legal status of}} the initial Petition has been debated. It has been considered a declaratory act, a private bill, or simply a petition, which permitted an individual harmed by the government to take action against the crown. A petition is the oldest form of Parliamentary proceeding, and the one through which most early statutes were originally passed; the King would be petitioned to take action by Members of Parliament, and would assent to their request; laws passed in this way include Magna Carta and the Statute of Westminster. Whether or not this made it legally binding was debated. Modern historians have either taken two positions on the matter. Either the recognition of <b>the</b> <b>Petition</b> was a judicial matter and at best a private bill, and as such it was not binding on the King or on Parliament, or it had the strength of a public bill; it was a legislative act, and as such legally binding.|$|E

The Soviet Union did cite these documents as evidence of poor conditions in the United States.|$|R
5|$|In 1621, a {{bill was}} {{presented}} to Parliament to renew Magna Carta; although this bill failed, lawyer John Selden argued during Darnell's Case in 1627 that the right of habeas corpus was backed by Magna Carta. Coke supported <b>the</b> <b>Petition</b> of Right in 1628, which cited Magna Carta in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary. The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on Magna Carta. Charles initially did not agree to <b>the</b> <b>Petition</b> of Right, and refused to confirm Magna Carta {{in any way that}} would reduce his independence as King.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, a {{group of}} Puerto Ricans met with the {{appointed}} Governor Winthrop, and suggested the organization of a Puerto Rican National Guard. <b>The</b> <b>petition</b> failed because the U.S. Constitution prohibits the formation of any armed force within the United States and its territories without the authorization of Congress.|$|E

40|$|Between 1908 and 1913, Congress {{debated whether}} to grant San Francisco {{the right to}} dam the Hetch Hetchy Valley. The Valley fell within Yosemite National Park, and was thus under the federal government's control. In this public history project, I focus on <b>the</b> <b>petitions</b> {{hundreds}} of citizens submitted to Congress regarding Hetch Hetchy. My main objective is to collaborate with the Center for Legislative Archives (CLA) at the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington, DC to create educational outreach materials based on these petitions. My thesis, therefore, consists of both an online component and a traditional paper. I have created a digital exhibition, which provides researchers with access to <b>the</b> <b>petitions.</b> <b>The</b> paper portion provides greater context for <b>the</b> <b>petitions,</b> and will {{be used by the}} education specialists at CLA to develop a lesson plan that can help teachers use <b>the</b> <b>petitions</b> in <b>the</b> classroom. By focusing specifically on <b>the</b> <b>petitions,</b> I demonstrate how the Hetch Hetchy debates illuminate the larger environmental arguments of the Progressive Era between utilitarian conservation and wilderness preservation. Furthermore, these petitions address larger themes of the Progressive Era, including the changing role of women in politics, the rise in lobbying, and the conflict between local and national interests...|$|R
5|$|In 1990, a {{group of}} {{citizens}} came forward with an initiative to rename one of the streets of Warsaw in honour of John Lennon (see list below). <b>The</b> <b>petition</b> had approximately 5000 supporting signatures and passed through city council unchallenged.|$|E
5|$|In response, the House of Commons {{prepared}} {{a set of}} four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the legal requirement of habeas corpus. These were rejected by Charles, who also announced that Parliament would be dissolved; in response, the Commons met on 6 May to discuss alternatives, and concluded that a petition of right was the way forward. Accordingly, a committee under Sir Edward Coke drafted such a petition, and it {{was passed by the}} Commons on 8 May and sent to the House of Lords. After three weeks of debates and conferences between the two chambers, <b>the</b> <b>Petition</b> of Right was ratified by both houses on the 26th and 27 May. Following additional debates in which the King restricted the right of the Commons to freely speak, he bowed to the pressure; in need of Parliamentary support for the war effort, <b>the</b> <b>Petition</b> was accepted on 2 June. Unhappy with the method chosen, both houses joined together and demanded the King fully ratify <b>the</b> <b>Petition,</b> which he did on 7 June.|$|E
