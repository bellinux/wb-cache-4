5|$|Between 2007 and 2010, {{he pitched}} in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the Philadelphia Phillies' Minor League system {{initially}} as a starter, and subsequently as a reliever. Although he initially saw success in 2007, posting a 2.72 ERA in 10 starts with GCL Phillies and Williamsport Crosscutters, he struggled in 2008, posting an ERA of 5.09 in 27 starts, split between Williamsport and the Lakewood Blue Claws. At {{the conclusion of}} both 2008 and 2009, he pitched in the Florida Instructional League to continue honing his skills on the mound.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Ole Lippman, {{leader of}} the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their {{operations}} by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the building.|$|E
5|$|Kendrick {{was born}} in Houston, Texas, but {{attended}} high school in Mount Vernon, Washington. While growing up, he was greatly influenced by his father, from whom he developed his composure when pitching. Upon graduation, he turned down a scholarship to play college football, instead signing a contract to begin his professional baseball career in the Phillies' organization. After a slow ascent through <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the Phillies' minor league system, he made his MLB debut in 2007, {{and was a member}} of the starting rotation of the 2008 World Series Champion team.|$|E

5|$|Overall the {{operation}} appeared to meet few of its initial aims. The political approach did {{lead to an}} increased discussion amongst <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> Swedish officialdom as {{to the possibility of}} an invasion in Norway. However, it failed to convince the higher levels of government (with the exception of Nordenskiöld, who did not communicate his beliefs to anyone). Even the purchase of Norwegian securities went unnoticed. The overriding belief within the Swedish government was that any invasion of Norway would be diversionary, and that the European mainland would always be the main target of the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Chat Moss may {{be named}} after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, {{but as it}} was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as {{evidenced}} by the numerous wood remains in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.|$|E
5|$|During late November, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted about 625kilometers (390mi) east-southeast of Pohnpei. Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic {{turning in}} <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere, and a trough was located near the surface. The disturbance developed rainbands and gradually became better organized. By December2, the system had an elongated low-level circulation, located {{to the south of}} the convection. At 0600UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression about 735km (450mi) east-northeast of Pohnpei. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and at 1800UTC on December 2 the agency classified the system as Tropical Depression 31W. Initially the depression moved to the west-northwest, and early on December3 the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm.|$|E

5|$|On June16, {{satellite}} imagery revealed {{an area of}} increased convection east of the Bahamas, which was {{believed to have been}} associated with a tropical wave. On June17, the convection increased in organization at <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere. By 1800UTC, the system had organized sufficiently to be designated as a tropical depression, making it the first of the season. Initially, the depression tracked north-northwest under the steering currents of the low-level flow around the western periphery of the Atlantic subtropical ridge. Strong wind shear due to fast upper-level winds associated with a cold-core low over the eastern Gulf of Mexico hindered further intensification for a time, but on June18, an area of deep convection developed north of the center of circulation. Based on analysis of reconnaissance data, the tropical depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arthur at 1900UTC on June19.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the conquest on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> English society is {{difficult}} to assess. The major change was the elimination of slavery in England, which had disappeared {{by the middle of}} the 12th century. There were about 28,000 slaves listed in Domesday Book in 1086, fewer than had been enumerated for 1066. In some places, such as Essex, the decline in slaves was 20 per cent for the 20 years. The main reasons for the decline in slaveholding appear to have been the disapproval of the Church and the cost of supporting slaves, who unlike serfs, had to be maintained entirely by their owners. The practice of slavery was not outlawed, and the Leges Henrici Primi from the reign of King Henry I continue to mention slaveholding as legal.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Cindy {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that departed the western coast of Africa on August8, 1993. Over the following days, the wave tracked steadily west-northwestward across the tropical Atlantic while retaining a distinct cloud pattern on satellite images. Although initial data from a reconnaissance aircraft mission on August13 indicated that the system lacked a defined wind circulation, a second mission at 12:00UTC the next day revealed an improvement in its structure at <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a tropical depressiona tropical cyclone with sustained winds of less than 39mph (62km/h)and initiated public advisories on it soon thereafter.|$|E

5|$|The {{other main}} sources of {{information}} are maps, particularly those published {{at the time the}} canal was to be converted into a railway. These clearly show twin-track inclines at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry, and because most of the traffic was in the downhill direction, a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed, although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been balanced by a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent. The Hirwaunissa incline was longer and narrower than the other two, and only included a single track. Recent research has suggested that the incline was powered by a water wheel, with the waste water running down the incline in a side channel, in order to supply <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the canal.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Nicole {{exited the}} Caribbean Sea and {{dissipated}} on September 29, {{leaving behind a}} broad area of cyclonic circulation at <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere. A southeasterly-moving cold front drifted from the Gulf of Mexico on October 5, and developed into a stationary north-south trough axis the following day. When a tropical wave that {{was associated with the}} previous development of Hurricane Otto traced into the Caribbean on October 7, there was an escalation in the convection associated with the system. Another tropical wave traveled from the Lesser Antilles to the western Caribbean between October 9 and 10. A large low-pressure area formed as the wave interacted with the trough; however, convection decreased on October 10.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} use {{his or her}} Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player {{encounters}} a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may select a maneuver {{for his or her}} Pokémon to fight using one of four moves, use an item, switch his or her active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain number of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon will level up. A Pokémon's level controls its physical properties, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves it has learned. At certain levels, the Pokémon may also evolve. These evolutions affect the statistics and the levels at which new moves are learned (higher levels of evolution gain more statistics per level, although they may not learn new moves as early, if at all, compared with <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> evolution).|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Faxai {{began as}} an area of {{convection}} that persisted about 805kilometers (500mi) west of Guam on October24. Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic turning in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere, and a trough was located near the surface. Convection consolidated around {{the center of the}} low-level circulation, and the upper-level environmentlow wind shear and good divergencefavored development. The following day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Shortly after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as convection deepened around a partially exposed low. The storm traveled northwest under the influences of a subtropical ridge to the north. At 0000UTC on October26, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the system as a tropical depression and gave it the local name Juaning. Around the same time, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Faxai.|$|E
5|$|Moving on a west-northwest {{track at}} roughly 20 mph (30 km/h) early on September 22, the storm {{initially}} changed little in intensity. However, a large upper tropospheric anticyclone {{developed over the}} southern Atlantic coast, producing the favorable wind shear needed for tropical cyclone development. A second reconnaissance flight reported an intensifed tropical cyclone, indicating that the storm system had reached tropical storm strength. At 0000 UTC on September 23, the depression attained tropical storm strength, with maximum winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a central minimum pressure of 1013 mbar (hPa; 29.92 inHg). The US Weather Bureau issued their first advisory on the newly developed tropical storm at 1600 UTC later that day, giving the storm the name Helene. Despite the storm's poor organization, Helene gradually intensified in favorable conditions generated by the large anticyclone. Throughout the day, a second anticyclone moved eastward until it was situated off of the Mid-Atlantic states, while a mean trough in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere became situated over the United States East Coast. This would set up a path for Helene to pass {{very close to the}} United States. The tropical storm attained hurricane intensity by 2200 UTC on 2200 UTC on September 24, while located 425 mi (685 km) east of Fort Pierce, Florida. However, in post-season analysis, it was found that Helene reached hurricane intensity earlier that day, by 1200 UTC. At the time, gale-force winds extended up to 220 mi (355 km) out from the storm's center of circulation.|$|E
