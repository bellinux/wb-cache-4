However, {{some of the}} policies implemented by the Young Turks, such as a <b>tax</b> <b>rise</b> and the interdiction of ethnic-based political parties, discontented minorities. Albanians opposed the nationalist character of the movement and led local uprisings in 1910 and 1912. During the latter they managed to seize most of Kosovo and took Skopje on 11 August. On 18 August, the insurgents signed the Üsküb agreement which provided {{for the creation of}} an autonomous Albanian province and they were amnestied the day later.|$|E
5|$|Tuition is {{paid for}} by general {{taxation}} in Germany, although only 27% of young people gain higher education qualification there, whereas in the UK the comparable figure is 48%. Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised by the Liberal Democrat party as a 'tax cut {{for the rich and}} a <b>tax</b> <b>rise</b> for the poor' because people would be taxed to pay for something that many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and only have to pay them back.|$|E

Early {{in the campaign}} Kulongoski held a large lead over Mannix in the polls but the gap narrowed as the election neared after Mannix put Kulongoski on the defensive. Mannix characterised Kulongoski as a strong tax and spender after he endorsed a proposed 313 million dollar income <b>tax</b> <b>rise</b> to avoid cuts in education and other areas. He also attacked Kulongoski for being soft on crime. A poll in October showed Kulongoski on 45%, only 4 percent ahead of Mannix on 41%.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} {{backed the}} tenth austerity package which went before Parliament on 16 July. The package {{was the first}} in a series of prior actions necessary for negotiations to open up over bailout funding worth 86billion euros. The package came in two parts, with the first being approved on 16 July, and the second on 23 July. The legislation included a rise in VAT across several goods and services, the abolition of the VAT discount for Greek islands, a corporation <b>tax</b> <b>rise</b> from 26% to 29%, a luxury tax on cars, boats and swimming pools, an end to early retirement by 2022, and an increase in the retirement age to 67. Tsakalotos said on 16 July debate, [...] "I don't know if we did the right thing, however, I do know that we felt like we had no other choice but do what we did." [...] The contentious vote was opposed by 109 out of 201 members of the Central Committee of Syriza, and 32 Syriza MPs voted against the proposals on 16 July. It also led to a cabinet reshuffle on 17 July, but Tsakalotos retained his role as Minister of Finance.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 November GDP {{figures were}} {{released}} that showed Japan {{had fallen into}} recession, the two quarters of negative growth following the first stage in the consumption <b>tax</b> <b>rise</b> in April. Abe {{held a press conference}} on 21 November and announced that he was delaying the rise in the consumption tax by 18 months, from October 2015 to April 2017, and calling a snap general election for 14 December. Abe described the election as the [...] "Abenomics Dissolution" [...] and asked the voters to pass judgement on his economic policies. Abe's popularity fell slightly with the announcement and he declared that he would resign if his coalition did not win a simple majority, though analysts agreed this was highly unlikely due to the weak state of the opposition. [...] The opposition parties attempted to field a united front in opposition to Abe's policies, but found themselves divided on them.|$|E
2500|$|In Autumn 2013 Abe {{made the}} {{decision}} to proceed with the first stage of the increase in the consumption tax from 5 to 8 percent in April 2014 (with a second stage envisaged raising it to 10 percent in October 2015). The bill to raise the tax had been passed under the previous DPJ government, but the final decision lay with the Prime Minister. He and Finance Minister Taro Aso explained that the tax would be increased to provide a [...] "sustainable" [...] basis for future social spending, and to avoid the need to finance future stimulus by issuing government bonds. While this was expected to affect economic growth in the quarter following the rise, Abe also announced a 5 trillion yen stimulus package that aimed to mitigate any effects on economic revival. After the increase in April, Japan fell into recession during the second and third quarters of 2014, leading to Abe delaying the second stage of the <b>tax</b> <b>rise</b> until April 2017 and calling a snap election (see below). In response to the recession, Aso announced that the government would ask the Diet to pass a supplementary budget to fund a further stimulus package worth 2–3 trillion yen.|$|E

50|$|The League {{attacked}} the Budget's Finance (1909-10) Act 1910 as Socialist {{because of its}} income <b>tax</b> <b>rises,</b> increased death duties, and a land value tax in order to redistribute this to old age pensions.

50|$|For {{several years}} {{there had been}} crop failure caused by severe winters. Azumidaira farmers had {{suffered}} from this and many people had starved to death. Poverty was rampant. Under the circumstances some households had to sell their daughters to brothels, and others had to kill newborn babies. Some village heads like Tada Kasuke and Oana Zembei tried to relieve the farmers' suffering by giving away rice from their own storehouses. But their acts of righteousness were met with a harsh reprimand from officials in Matsumoto. Tada Kasuke was fired as the headman of Nakagaya village, and Oana Zembei was fired as the headman of Niré village. Then {{in the fall of}} 1686, the domain government raised taxes to an exorbitant level. (The domain lord who was away from home at the time was obviously not informed of the <b>tax</b> <b>rise.)</b> The reason for this <b>tax</b> <b>rise</b> was that the domain government needed more money. The domain lord of Matsumoto was a fudai daimyo, who was obligated to perform many duties, and therefore had {{to spend a lot of}} money. The domain lords of neighboring Takatō and Takashima were not under such pressure to perform such duties, even though they used to be a part of the Matsumoto Domain. They collected lower taxes from their people. When Azumidaira farmers were notified of the <b>tax</b> <b>rise,</b> the atmosphere among tax collectors and peasants became tense, for their neighbors didn't have to pay the same amount of taxes.|$|E
