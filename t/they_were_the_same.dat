5|$|In 1890 Manson was {{replaced}} as locomotive superintendent by James Johnson, {{the son of}} Samuel W. Johnson, then locomotive superintendent at the Midland Railway. In 1893 Neilsons delivered six new 4-4-0 tender locomotives that were more powerful any previous Great North locomotive and the first not to have Clark's smoke prevention apparatus. Classified as Class S and known for rapid acceleration and sustained high speed, these were the blueprint for the later Great North tender locomotives. Manson had left a design for a 0-4-4 tank locomotive and Johnson changed the firebox, boiler and value gear so <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the Class S tender locomotives before ordering nine to work the Deeside Line. These arrived in 1893 and most were transferred to the Aberdeen suburban services in 1900.|$|E
5|$|The {{first point}} regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were {{reported}} missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators {{were able to}} locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, {{they were unable to}} determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} {{was first}} named by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in 1797 as Elephas africanus. The genus Loxodonta was named by Frédéric Cuvier in 1825. Cuvier spelled it Loxodonte, but in 1827 an anonymous author romanised the spelling to Loxodonta; the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature recognises {{this as the}} proper authority. In 1942, 18 subspecies of African elephant were recognised by Henry Fairfield Osborn, but further morphological data has {{reduced the number of}} classified subspecies, and by the 1990s, only two were recognised, the savannah or bush elephant (L.a.africana) and the forest elephant (L.a.cyclotis), the latter having been named in 1900 by German zoologist Paul Matschie. Forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks than bush elephants, and are limited in range to the forested areas of western and Central Africa. A 2000 study argued for the elevation of the two forms into separate species (L.africana and L.cyclotis respectively) based on differences in skull morphology. DNA studies published in 2001 and 2007 also suggested they were distinct species while studies in 2002 and 2005 concluded that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> species. Further studies (2010, 2011, 2015) have supported African savannah and forest elephants' status as separate species. The two species are believed to have diverged 6 million years ago. In 2017, DNA sequence analysis showed that L. cyclotis is more closely related to the extinct Palaeoloxodon antiquus, than it is to L. africana, possibly undermining the genus Loxodonta as a whole. Some evidence suggests that elephants of western Africa are a separate species, although this is disputed. The pygmy elephants of the Congo Basin, which have been suggested to be a separate species (Loxodonta pumilio) are probably forest elephants whose small size and/or early maturity are due to environmental conditions.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue is}} whether Richard was indeed using the same {{specimen}} as Lamarck; the geographical origin {{is said to be}} different, and the descriptions do not match; for example in Lamarck's Cephalanthus chinensis the inflorescences are axillary whereas in Richard's Anthocephalus they are terminal. If specimens were the same, then Anthocephalus is a synonym of the Madagascan Cephalanthus and cannot be a generic name for the Asian kadam tree. If they were different (in spite of Richard's claim that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same)</b> then Anthocephalus could be a generic name for the kadam tree. Based on the latter view, the name Anthocephalus chinensis has been widely used for the kadam tree.|$|E
25|$|Vysotsky {{accompanied}} {{himself on}} a Russian seven-string guitar, with a raspy voice singing ballads of love, peace, war, everyday Soviet life and of the human condition. He was largely perceived {{as the voice of}} honesty, at times sarcastically jabbing at the Soviet government, which made him a target for surveillance and threats. In France, he has been compared with Georges Brassens; in Russia, however, he was more frequently compared with Joe Dassin, partly because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> age and died in the same year, although their ideologies, biographies, and musical styles are very different. Vysotsky's lyrics and style greatly influenced Jacek Kaczmarski, a Polish songwriter and singer who touched on similar themes.|$|E

25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of having periodically or occasionally paid recruits {{was that if}} their money had not arrived on time, they simply left the battlefield, or – in a worse scenario – they revolted, as has happened in several instances. Since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> skilled men-at-arms led by the same leaders previously fighting under the Hungarian flag, they were as difficult to eliminate as the Black Army was to its enemies. However, they could be outnumbered, since {{it was always a}} flank or division which quit the campaign. An easier solution was to have the captain accept some lands and castles to be mortgaged in return of service (in one occasion the forts of Ricsó (Hričovský hrad) and Nagybiccse (Bytča) to František Hag). An example of mass desertion occurred in 1481 when a group of 300 horsemen joined the opposing Holy Roman forces. One of these recorded insurrections was conducted by Jan Švehla, who accompanied Corvinus to Slavonia in 1465 to beat the Ottomans; but when they were approaching Zagreb, Švehla asked for royal permission to officially quit the offensive with his mercenaries due to financial difficulty. His request was denied, and as a consequence, he and two of his vice-captains left the royal banner along with their regiments.|$|E
500|$|Historically, quagga {{taxonomy}} {{was further}} {{complicated by the fact}} that the extinct southernmost population of Burchell's zebra (Equus quagga burchellii, formerly Equus burchellii burchellii) was thought to be a distinct subspecies (also sometimes thought a full species, E. burchellii). The extant northern population, the [...] "Damara zebra", was later named Equus quagga antiquorum, which means that it is today also referred to as E. q. burchellii, after it was realised <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> taxon. The extinct population was long thought very close to the quagga, since it also showed limited striping on its hind parts. As an example of this, Shortridge placed the two in the now disused subgenus Quagga in 1934. Most experts now suggest that the two subspecies represent two ends of a cline.|$|E
500|$|At {{around that}} time, Pablo Santos Sanz, {{a student of}} José Luis Ortiz Moreno at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía at Sierra Nevada Observatory in {{southern}} Spain, claims to have examined the backlog of photos that the Ortiz team had started taking in December 2002. He says that he found Haumea in late July 2005, on images taken on March 7, 9, and 10, 2003. He further said that in checking whether this was a known object, the team came across Brown's internet summary, describing a bright TNO {{much like the one}} they had just found. Googling the reference number for object K40506A on the morning of July 26, they found the Caltech observation logs of Haumea, but according to their account, those logs contained too little information for Ortiz to tell if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> object.|$|E

500|$|Ancient Indian, Greek, Egyptian, Babylonian and Chinese {{observers}} knew of Venus {{and recorded}} the planet's motions. The early Greek astronomers called Venus by two names—Hesperus the evening star and Phosphorus the morning star. Pythagoras {{is credited with}} realizing <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> planet. There {{is no evidence that}} any of these cultures knew of the transits. Venus was important to ancient American civilizations, in particular for the Maya, who called it Noh Ek, [...] "the Great Star" [...] or Xux Ek, [...] "the Wasp Star"; they embodied Venus {{in the form of the}} god Kukulkán (also known as or related to Gukumatz and Quetzalcoatl in other parts of Mexico). In the Dresden Codex, the Maya charted Venus's full cycle, but despite their precise knowledge of its course, there is no mention of a transit. However, it has been proposed that frescoes found at Mayapan may contain a pictorial representation of the 12th or 13th century transits.|$|E
500|$|Stelmach's {{policy on}} health care was {{highlighted}} by his removal of the province's health care premiums effective the end of 2008. [...] Critics had denounced the premiums as being regressive, both because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amount regardless of the payer's income and because people with better-paying jobs often had their premiums covered by their employer. The opposition Liberal and New Democratic parties had long called for their removal. This elimination was announced in a throne speech immediately before {{the dissolution of the}} legislature for the 2008 election, although it was initially promised to take effect by 2012. During this campaign, Stelmach promised to increase the capacity of Alberta universities to train doctors and nurses over four years, eventually resulting in the graduation of 225 more doctors, 350 more registered nurses, and 220 licensed practical nurses. After the registrar of the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons called the plan unfeasible, Health Minister Dave Hancock clarified that most of the increase would in fact come from the immigration of foreign doctors to Alberta, rather than from in-province training.|$|E
500|$|Another {{recorded}} {{copy of the}} Gospel of John {{has also}} been associated with Cuthbert, and sometimes {{thought to be the}} St Cuthbert Gospel. [...] Saint Boisil (d. 664) of Melrose Abbey was Cuthbert's teacher. [...] Bede's prose life of Cuthbert records that during Boisil's last illness, he and Cuthbert read daily one of the seven gatherings or quaternions of Boisil's manuscript of the Gospel of John. [...] The sermon in Miracle 20 identifies this manuscript with the one at Durham, and says that both saints had worn it round their necks, ignoring that it has twelve gatherings rather than seven. [...] There are further references from Durham to Boisil's book, such as a list of relics in the cathedral in 1389, and some modern scholars were attracted to the idea that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> but Brown's palaeographical evidence seems to remove the possibility of Boisil's book being the St Cuthbert Gospel. [...] In the 11th century Boisil's remains had also been brought to Durham, and enshrined next to those of Cuthbert. [...] Around the same time Bede's own remains were stolen from Monkwearmouth–Jarrow for Durham, by a [...] "notably underhand trick", and placed in Cuthbert's coffin, where they remained until 1104.|$|E
