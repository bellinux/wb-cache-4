25|$|More recently, the kype is {{regarded}} as a secondary sex characteristic displayed by males at the spawning grounds. Therefore, its function is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> the fish establish a hierarchy among other males where those with larger kypes are dominant over animals with smaller kypes, and/or characteristics that could be of importance in inter- and intra-sexual evaluations of individual quality. The size of the kype is believed to determine male spawning frequency.|$|E

Although {{they did not}} catch the elusive Mafia boss himself, investigators nonetheless unearthed evidence that 72-year-old Provenzano was still very much alive and {{in control of the}} Mafia, in the form of his cryptic handwritten notes, his preferred method of giving orders to his men. Two months later another raid, which netted over 80 Mafiosi took place, although yet again Provenzano was not among those captured.|$|E
25|$|Starting on 17 April, Undine Marine Industries Co., {{a privately}} held company, began {{to lead the}} search for missing passengers. At 12:30a.m., hull {{investigations}} were started by the ROK Coast Guard {{with the help of}} flares. As of 6:00a.m., 171 ships, 29 aircraft and 30 divers were involved in the rescue effort. The Korea Coast Guard had assigned 20 divers in teams of two. The ROK Navy had also assigned 8 divers. However, the coast guard prevented navy divers from participating while waiting for divers from Undine Industries. At 7:24a.m., civilian groups of expert divers were reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> out in the rescue operations. During the morning, the number of divers involved in the operations reached 555. The Navy also established a military control tower on a Dokdo-class amphibious assault ship. Starting around 2:00p.m., rescue operations were practically stopped due to bad weather conditions. A marine crane arrived on the scene at night.|$|E
25|$|Homeopathy {{achieved}} {{its greatest}} {{popularity in the}} 19th century. It {{was introduced to the}} United States in 1825 by Hans Birch Gram, a student of Hahnemann. The first homeopathic school in the US opened in 1835, and in 1844, the first US national medical association, the American Institute of Homeopathy, was established. Throughout the 19th century, dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States, and by 1900, there were 22 homeopathic colleges and 15,000 practitioners in the United States. Because medical practice of the time relied on ineffective and often dangerous treatments, patients of homeopaths often had better outcomes than those of the doctors of the time. Homeopathic preparations, even if ineffective, would almost surely cause no harm, making the users of homeopathic preparations less likely to be killed by the treatment that was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> them. The relative success of homeopathy in the 19th century may have led to the abandonment of the ineffective and harmful treatments of bloodletting and purging and to have begun the move towards more effective, science-based medicine.|$|E

500|$|Behind {{the playful}} façade of Candide which has amused so many, there lies very harsh {{criticism}} of contemporary European civilization which angered many others. European governments such as France, Prussia, Portugal and England are each attacked ruthlessly by the author: the French and Prussians for the Seven Years' War, the Portuguese for their Inquisition, and the British for {{the execution of}} John Byng. Organised religion, too, is harshly treated in Candide. For example, Voltaire mocks the Jesuit order of the Roman Catholic Church. Aldridge provides a characteristic example of such anti-clerical passages for which the work was banned: while in Paraguay, Cacambo remarks, [...] " [...] are masters of everything, and the people have no money at all…". Here, Voltaire suggests the Christian mission in Paraguay is {{taking advantage of the}} local population. Voltaire depicts the Jesuits holding the indigenous peoples as slaves while they claim <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> them.|$|E
500|$|Don't Look Now—marketed as a [...] "psychic thriller"—was {{released}} in Britain on 16 October 1973, {{as the main}} feature of a double bill. [...] The Wicker Man was its accompanying 'B' feature and—like Don't Look Now—went on to achieve great acclaim. [...] The two films have thematic similarities, and both end with their protagonists being led to preordained fates by a 'child' they believe <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helping.</b> Michael Deeley, who was managing director of British Lion Films {{at the time of}} the film's release, claimed that the film's US reception was hurt by Paramount Pictures rushing the film into cinemas too early, due to the unexpected failure of Jonathan Livingston Seagull; despite its mismanaged distribution, Peter Bart—from his time at Paramount—recalls it performing [...] "fairly well" [...] at the box office. The film had recouped most of its expenses before it was even released, with its $1.1 million budget offset by the fee Paramount paid for the US distribution rights.|$|E

2500|$|Farmers relayed their {{concerns}} about the birds ravaging their crops, and a deputation of ex-soldiers were sent {{to meet with the}} Minister of Defence, Sir George Pearce. Having served in World War I, the soldier-settlers were well aware of the effectiveness of machine guns, and they requested their deployment. The minister readily agreed, although with conditions attached: the guns were to be used by military personnel, and troop transport was to be financed by the Western Australian government, and the farmers would provide food, accommodation, and payment for the ammunition. Pearce also supported the deployment {{on the grounds that the}} birds would make good target practice, although it has also been argued that some in the government may have viewed this as a way of being seen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> the Western Australian farmers, and towards that end a cinematographer [...] from Fox Movietone was enlisted.|$|E
2500|$|By early 1651, it was {{reported}} that no English supply convoys were safe if they travelled more than two miles outside a military base. In response, the Parliamentarians destroyed food supplies and forcibly evicted civilians who were thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> the Tories. John Hewson systematically destroyed food stocks in counties Wicklow and Kildare, Hardress Waller did likewise in the Burren in County Clare, as did Colonel Cook in County Wexford. The result was famine throughout much of Ireland, aggravated by an outbreak of bubonic plague. As the guerrilla war ground on, the Parliamentarians, as of April 1651, designated areas such as County Wicklow and much of the south of the country as what would now be called free-fire zones, where anyone found would be, [...] "taken slain and destroyed as enemies and their cattle and good shall be taken or spoiled as the goods of enemies". This tactic had succeeded in the Nine Years' War.|$|E
2500|$|Email spam, {{also known}} as {{unsolicited}} bulk email (UBE), junk mail, or unsolicited commercial email (UCE), is the practice of sending unwanted email messages, frequently with commercial content, in large quantities to an indiscriminate set of recipients. Spam in email started to become a problem when the Internet was opened up {{to the general public}} in the mid-1990s. It grew exponentially over the following years, and today composes some 80 to 85 percent of all the e-mail in the World, by a [...] "conservative estimate". Pressure to make email spam illegal has been successful in some jurisdictions, but less so in others. The efforts taken by governing bodies, security systems and email service providers seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> to reduce the onslaught of email spam. According to [...] "2014 Internet Security Threat Report, Volume 19" [...] published by Symantec Corporation, spam volume dropped to 66% of all email traffic. [...] Spammers take advantage of this fact, and frequently outsource parts of their operations to countries where spamming will not get them into legal trouble.|$|E

2500|$|That the {{ordinances}} were enacted [...] "'because of,' {{not merely}} 'in spite of'", their suppression of Santería religious practice is {{revealed by the}} events preceding enactment of the ordinances. The minutes and taped excerpts of the June 9 session, {{both of which are}} in the record, evidence significant hostility exhibited by residents, members of the city council, and other city officials toward the Santería religion and its practice of animal sacrifice. The public crowd that attended the June 9 meetings interrupted statements by council members critical of Santería with cheers and the brief comments of Pichardo with taunts. When Councilman Martinez, a supporter of the ordinances, stated that in pre-revolution Cuba [...] "people were put in jail for practicing this religion", the audience applauded. Other statements by members of the city council were in a similar vein. For example, Councilman Martinez, after noting his belief that Santería was outlawed in Cuba, questioned, [...] "if we could not practice this [...] in our homeland , why bring it to this country?" [...] Councilman Cardoso said that Santería devotees at the Church [...] "are in violation of everything this country stands for." [...] Various Hialeah city officials made comparable comments. The chaplain of the Hialeah Police Department told the city council that Santería was a sin, [...] "foolishness", [...] "an abomination to the Lord", and the worship of [...] "demons." [...] He advised the city council that [...] "We need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> people and sharing with them the truth that is found in Jesus Christ." [...] He concluded: [...] "I would exhort you [...] [...] [...] not to permit this Church to exist." [...] The city attorney commented that Resolution 87-66 indicated that [...] "This community will not tolerate religious practices which are abhorrent to its citizens...." [...] Similar comments were made by the deputy city attorney. This history discloses the object of the ordinances to target animal sacrifice by Santería worshippers because of its religious motivation.|$|E
2500|$|Li Cunxu's major {{opportunity}} to assert himself against Later Liang came in late 910. [...] Zhu Quanzhong {{had come to}} suspect his vassals Wang Rong the Prince of Zhao, who controlled Wushun Circuit (武順, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), and Wang Chuzhi the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), of potentially turning against them, and therefore decided to seize the circuits by trick. [...] As Liu Shouguang was threatening Yiwu at that time, he launched an army north, pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> Yiwu and Wushun in defending against a potential Liu Shouguang attack, but then seized Wushun's Shen (深州) and Ji (冀州) Prefectures (both in modern Hengshui, Hebei) and slaughtered Wushun's garrison at those prefectures. [...] Wang Rong, surprised by this turn of events, immediately sought aid from both Li Cunxu and Liu Shouguang. [...] Liu Shouguang refused, but Li Cunxu launched armies commanded by Zhou and later, himself. [...] In spring 911, a joint Jin/Zhao/Yiwu army crushed the Later Liang army, commanded by the major Later Liang general Wang Jingren, at Boxiang (柏鄉, in modern Xingtai, Hebei). [...] In the aftermaths of the victory, Li Cunxu decided to advance further, and he briefly put Wei Prefecture (魏州, in modern Handan, Hebei), the capital of Later Liang's important Tianxiong Circuit (天雄), under siege. [...] However, apprehensive that a major Later Liang army {{under the command of}} the major general Yang Shihou was approaching, and more apprehensive that Liu Shouguang (who by this point was making noise about joining forces with him but demanding a leadership role in the army) might create trouble for him, he soon gave up the siege on Wei, ending the confrontation with Later Liang for the time being. [...] From this point on, Zhao and Yiwu became effectively independent polities, but in close alliance with Jin, all still using the Tang era name of Tianyou (天佑) to signify opposition against Later Liang.|$|E
