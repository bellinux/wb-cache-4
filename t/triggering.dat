2500|$|Double set <b>triggers</b> can {{be further}} {{classified}} by phase. [...] A double set, single phase <b>trigger</b> can only be operated by first pulling the set <b>trigger,</b> and then pulling the firing <b>trigger.</b> [...] A double set, double phase <b>trigger</b> can be operated as a standard <b>trigger</b> if the set <b>trigger</b> is not pulled, or as a set <b>trigger</b> by first pulling the set <b>trigger.</b> [...] Double set, double phase <b>triggers</b> offer the versatility of both a standard <b>trigger</b> and a set <b>trigger.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A single set <b>trigger</b> {{is usually}} one <b>trigger</b> {{that may be}} fired with a {{conventional}} amount of <b>trigger</b> pull weight or may be [...] "set" [...] – usually by pushing forward on the <b>trigger,</b> or by pushing forward on a small lever attached {{to the rear of}} the <b>trigger.</b> This takes up the <b>trigger</b> slack (or otherwise called take-up) in the <b>trigger</b> and allows for a much lighter <b>trigger</b> pull. This is colloquially known as a hair <b>trigger.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Trigger</b> locks prevent {{motion of}} the <b>trigger.</b> However, a <b>trigger</b> lock does not {{guarantee}} that the firearm cannot be discharged (see above). Some <b>trigger</b> locks are integrated into {{the design of the}} weapon, requiring no external parts besides the key. Generally, two pieces come together from either side behind the <b>trigger</b> and are locked in place, which can be unlocked with a key or combination. This physically prevents the <b>trigger</b> from being pulled to discharge the weapon. Other types of <b>trigger</b> locks do not go behind the <b>trigger,</b> but encompass the full area behind the <b>trigger</b> guard making the <b>trigger</b> inaccessible. Identilock is a gun attachment that completely covers and prevents access to the <b>trigger,</b> which makes it different from other <b>trigger</b> locks.|$|R
5|$|Thunderstorm asthma is the <b>triggering</b> of an asthma {{attack by}} {{environmental}} conditions directly {{caused by a}} local thunderstorm. During a thunderstorm, pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind. While larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose, the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs, <b>triggering</b> the asthma attack.|$|E
5|$|Tumors cause pain by {{crushing}} or infiltrating tissue, <b>triggering</b> {{infection or}} inflammation, or releasing chemicals that make normally non-painful stimuli painful.|$|E
5|$|A second {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} <b>triggering</b> a TypeIa supernova is {{the merger of}} two white dwarfs whose combined mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit. The resulting merger is called a super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. In such a case, the total mass would not be constrained by the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E
50|$|IBM DB2 for {{distributed}} systems known as DB2 for LUW (LUW means Linux Unix Windows) supports three <b>trigger</b> types: Before <b>trigger,</b> After <b>trigger</b> and Instead of <b>trigger.</b> Both statement level and row level <b>triggers</b> are supported. If {{there are more}} <b>triggers</b> for same operation on table then firing order is determined by <b>trigger</b> creation data. Since version 9.7 IBM DB2 supports autonomous transactions.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} is investigated of {{a dedicated}} <b>trigger</b> stream in the CMS <b>trigger</b> menu, with an output rate of cal O (1) ~kHz on the First Level <b>Trigger</b> and cal O (1) ~Hz on the High Level <b>Trigger.</b> By combining jet <b>trigger</b> {{information from the}} CMS calorimeter with information from the TOTEM Roman Pot detectors at 220 m distance from the interaction point, the default dijet <b>trigger</b> thresholds foreseen in the CMS <b>trigger</b> tables can be lowered substantially while respecting the CMS <b>trigger</b> bandwidth limits. The efficacy of the dedicated diffractive <b>trigger</b> stream is demonstrated for hard single-diffractive and double-Pomeron exchange events...|$|R
40|$|The {{contributions}} to the <b>trigger</b> rate of an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope and the optimization of the <b>trigger</b> conditions are discussed. Among the <b>trigger</b> options studied are cameras with <b>trigger</b> regions of different sizes, <b>triggers</b> requiring a coincidence of 2, 3 and 4 pixels as well as <b>triggers</b> imposing additional conditions on topology of the <b>trigger</b> pixels. A two-pixel <b>trigger</b> based on neighboring <b>trigger</b> pixels is shown to provide full efficiency, at considerably reduced random <b>trigger</b> rates. Numerical examples of effective areas and rates are given based on {{the parameters of the}} new HEGRA Cherenkov telescopes. Especially addressed are <b>trigger</b> conditions for the observation of extended sources with angular size #approx# 1. (orig.)

5|$|August 19–20, 1955– Hurricane Diane {{moves across}} the center portion of the state only a week after Connie deluged the area, <b>triggering</b> heavy rains in North Jersey. The storm causes {{historic}} flooding in towns along the Delaware River, damaging about 200 homes in Lambertville.|$|E
5|$|August 26–27, 2007: Remnants of Hurricane Dean made {{landfall}} in Santa Barbara area, <b>triggering</b> {{heavy rains}} and minor flooding throughout the southern California Area. Early on August 27, the storm eventually reached Las Vegas, Nevada, and caused flash flooding there as well, before dissipating there {{later in the}} day.|$|E
5|$|Despite Nedvěd's {{signing a}} new {{four-year}} contract with Lazio in April 2001, the club {{tried to sell}} him and teammate Juan Sebastián Verón that summer, <b>triggering</b> fan protests against club chairman Sergio Cragnotti. The players were ultimately sold to Juventus and Manchester United respectively.|$|E
30|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this project}} was to {{establish}} if there are {{significant differences between the}} <b>Triggers</b> which predicted VAPs (VAP <b>triggers)</b> as opposed to <b>triggers</b> which did not predict a VAP (Non VAP <b>triggers)</b> where both groups had <b>triggered</b> an alert.|$|R
50|$|Before <b>trigger</b> is for {{checking}} {{data and}} deciding if operation should be permitted. If exception is thrown from before <b>trigger</b> then operation is aborted and no data are changed. In DB2 before <b>triggers</b> are read only — you can't modify data in before <b>triggers.</b> After <b>triggers</b> {{are designed for}} post processing after requested change was performed. After <b>triggers</b> can write data into tables and unlike some other databases you can write into any table including table on which <b>trigger</b> operates. Instead of <b>triggers</b> are for making views writeable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Triggers</b> {{are fully}} {{supported}} {{and can be}} attached to tables. <b>Triggers</b> can be per-column and conditional, in that UPDATE <b>triggers</b> can target specific columns of a table, and <b>triggers</b> can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the <b>trigger's</b> WHERE clause. <b>Triggers</b> can be attached to views by using the INSTEAD OF condition. Multiple <b>triggers</b> are fired in alphabetical order. In addition to calling functions written in the native PL/pgSQL, <b>triggers</b> can also invoke functions written in other languages like PL/Python or PL/Perl.|$|R
5|$|In October 2007, {{following}} {{months of}} rumors that Hastert would not serve out his term, the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call reported that Hastert {{had decided to}} resign from the House {{before the end of}} the year, <b>triggering</b> a special election.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{formally}} {{resigned from}} his position as MP for Tooting on 9 May, <b>triggering</b> a by-election which was held on 16 June. On 16 June, Rosena Allin-Khan won the by-election in Tooting, with an increased majority. A {{few months after the}} election, Goldsmith also pledged to resign as an MP if the government were to announce plans to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Following the decision to build the runway, Goldsmith stood-down as MP for Richmond Park, <b>triggering</b> a by-election, in which Goldsmith stood as an independent candidate. On 1 December 2016, Goldsmith, was defeated in the by-election by Sarah Olney of the Liberal Democrats, with Goldsmith's loss put down to his stance in favour of Britain's exit from the European Union.|$|E
5|$|A valve ejected due to {{incompatible}} thread (metric valve in imperial cylinder) injured commercial diver by {{impact on}} the back of the helmet during preparations for a dive. Cylinder had been under pressure for several days following hydrostatic testing, and no particular <b>triggering</b> event was identified. Diver was knocked down and bruised but protected from serious injury by the helmet.|$|E
40|$|A fast {{tracking}} <b>trigger</b> {{system based}} on a new scintillating fiber tracker is being built for the upgraded D 0 detector for the Collider Run II at Fermilab. This fiber tracker <b>trigger</b> provides a first level hardware <b>trigger,</b> supplies track seeds for the first level muon <b>trigger</b> and for the second level <b>trigger.</b> The physics requirements and the corresponding algorithms for the hardware <b>trigger</b> will be described. Particularly, PLD (Programmable Logical Device) chips are used to implement our <b>trigger</b> algorithms to achieve pattern recognition from scintillating fiber hits and to format that information for delivery to other <b>trigger</b> systems. Detector <b>trigger</b> efficiency studies will also be presented...|$|R
40|$|Timer-Driven <b>Triggers</b> allow {{users to}} monitor {{interesting}} tuples or interesting changes to tuples of a view. <b>Trigger</b> condition testing takes place periodically, i. e., once every few hours, days or weeks. When the timer of a <b>trigger</b> expires, a new {{copy of the}} view is retrieved and the <b>trigger</b> predicates applied to that view. <b>Trigger</b> predicates could be transition predicates referring to the attribute values of tuples of {{a view from the}} previous timer expiration. Timer <b>Triggers</b> differ from conventional <b>triggers,</b> in that the <b>trigger</b> testing is not done for updated tuples only. Timer <b>triggers</b> could be fired on tuples of a view simply because they satisfy the predic [...] ...|$|R
25|$|In Look Mode, {{the player}} may press {{directional}} buttons corresponding to <b>triggers</b> {{shown on the}} screen. Some <b>triggers</b> will not appear until certain events have taken place, and some <b>triggers</b> will change based on repeated investigation. However, many <b>triggers</b> require TP, <b>Trigger</b> Points, earned in battle. These <b>triggers</b> can cue many things, from battles, to event scenes and free items.|$|R
5|$|ATP {{is also a}} {{substrate}} of adenylate cyclase, {{most commonly}} in G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction pathways and is transformed to second messenger, cyclic AMP, which is involved in <b>triggering</b> calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function, although it {{is involved in the}} regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes.|$|E
5|$|Aloof and arrogant, FBI {{special agent}} Barry Baldwin (Peter Outerbridge) works with Black and Hollis on several cases. During an FBI {{raid on the}} home of a serial killer whose brain was altered by the Millennium Group (<b>triggering</b> his killing spree), Baldwin is injured in an explosion. On the way to the hospital, he is murdered in the {{ambulance}} by a Millennium Group assassin.|$|E
5|$|As suicide {{requires}} a willful attempt to die, some feel it therefore cannot {{be said to}} occur in non-human animals. Suicidal behavior has been observed in salmonella seeking to overcome competing bacteria by <b>triggering</b> an immune system response against them. Suicidal defenses by workers are also noted in the Brazilian ant Forelius pusillus, where {{a small group of}} ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{obstacles}} that hinder database <b>trigger</b> systems from their wide deployment {{is the lack of}} tools that aid users in creating <b>trigger</b> rules. Similar to understanding and specifying database queries in SQL 3, it is di#cult to visualize the meaning of <b>trigger</b> rules. Furthermore, it is even more di#cult to write <b>trigger</b> rules using such text-based <b>trigger</b> rule language as SQL 3. In this paper, we propose TBE (Trigger-By-Example) to remedy such problems in writing <b>trigger</b> rules visually by using QBE (Query-By-Example) ideas. TBE is a visual <b>trigger</b> rule composition system that helps the users understand and specify active database <b>triggers.</b> TBE retains benefits of QBE while extending features to support <b>triggers.</b> Hence, TBE is a useful tool for novice users to create simple <b>triggers</b> in a visual and intuitive manner. Further, since TBE is designed to hide the details of underlying <b>trigger</b> systems from users, it {{can be used as a}} universal <b>trigger</b> interface...|$|R
50|$|The takeup is {{the least}} {{critical}} stage of the <b>trigger</b> pull, and individual preferences vary widely. Two-stage <b>triggers,</b> for example, consist of a noticeable takeup, followed by a distinct increase in the force required to pull the <b>trigger,</b> followed by the break. A single-stage <b>trigger,</b> on the other hand, has no discernible movement before the break. Fully adjustable <b>triggers</b> will provide a two-stage pull, and the option of reducing the first stage travel to zero, essentially making the <b>trigger</b> a single-stage <b>trigger.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Older WASR-series rifles {{commonly}} caused <b>trigger</b> slap, {{which is}} caused by the bolt slamming backward into the <b>trigger</b> assembly and causing significant pain to the shooter's <b>trigger</b> finger. Beginning in 2007, Century International Arms has installed the TAPCO Intrafuse AK G2 <b>trigger</b> group, eliminating the painful <b>trigger</b> slap problem. Rifles with this <b>trigger</b> group will have [...] "TAPCO USA G2" [...] stamped {{on the left side of}} the <b>trigger.</b> Some of these rifles may exhibit canted front sight blocks and gas tubes.|$|R
5|$|Bond and Amasova {{follow a}} {{suspicious}} tanker owned by Stromberg and establish it {{is responsible for}} the missing submarines; the submarine in which they are travelling is also captured by Stromberg. Stromberg plans to destroy Moscow and New York, <b>triggering</b> nuclear war: he planned to then establish a new civilisation. Bond escapes, freeing the submariners captured from the other submarines and follows Stromberg to his headquarters, where he shoots the tycoon and a torpedo destroys the base.|$|E
5|$|Broader {{tensions}} in American society surfaced in Yosemite {{when a large}} number of youths gathered in the park over the summer of 1970, <b>triggering</b> a riot on July4 after rangers tried to evict visitors from camping illegally in Stoneman Meadow. Rioters attacked the rangers with rocks, and pulled mounted rangers from their horses. The National Guard was brought in to restore order.|$|E
5|$|Collisions {{occur when}} two galaxies pass {{directly}} through {{each other and}} have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms will interact, sometimes <b>triggering</b> star formation. A collision can severely distort {{the shape of the}} galaxies, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.|$|E
40|$|This note {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the ATLAS physics selection strategy for the initial running period of LHC and an assumed maximum luminosity of 2 · 10 ^ 33 cm^- 2 s^- 1. We present various contributions to the <b>trigger</b> menu, ranging from inclusive physics <b>triggers</b> over prescaled physics and monitoring <b>triggers</b> to pure calibration and monitoring <b>triggers.</b> We also try to give motivations for the various choices of <b>trigger</b> items where appropriate and useful. Finally, we study the effect of our <b>trigger</b> information compilation on the required abilities and capacities of the LVL 1 <b>trigger,</b> and specifically on the number of required <b>trigger</b> items of the LVL 1 central <b>trigger</b> processor...|$|R
40|$|The <b>trigger</b> {{process of}} L 3 +Cosmics {{experiment}} at CERN is introduced briefly. Also we checked whether the settings of the L 3 +Cosmics <b>trigger</b> system by simulation are correct or not and introduced {{a method for}} <b>trigger</b> efficiency calculation. To get the <b>trigger</b> efficiency for the mu spectrum measurement, an experimental data sample, which includes events passing the <b>trigger</b> set to measure the mu spectrum, not passing, is needed. Then L 3 +C <b>trigger</b> process is simulated with these events in this sample {{to know how many}} events should pass the <b>trigger.</b> By checking a <b>trigger</b> bit recorded in the experimental data, one can know how many events passed the <b>trigger</b> in hardware in these simulated events. The ratio then determines the <b>trigger</b> efficiency for mu spectrum measurement, and the systematic error is analyzed. The results on <b>trigger</b> efficiency have been used in measurement of the mu spectrum. (8 refs) ...|$|R
50|$|In game theory, grim <b>trigger</b> (also {{called the}} grim {{strategy}} or just grim) is a <b>trigger</b> strategy for a repeated game, {{such as an}} iterated prisoner's dilemma. Initially, a player using grim <b>trigger</b> will cooperate, {{but as soon as}} the opponent defects (thus satisfying the <b>trigger</b> condition), the player using grim <b>trigger</b> will defect for the remainder of the iterated game. Since a single defect by the opponent <b>triggers</b> defection forever, grim <b>trigger</b> is the most strictly unforgiving of strategies in an iterated game.|$|R
