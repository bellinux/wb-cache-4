5000|$|Gin {{people like}} antiphonal songs which are melodious and lyrical. Their {{traditional}} instruments include the two-stringed fiddle, flute, drum, gong and the single-stringed fiddle, a unique musical {{instrument of the}} ethnic group. Folk stories and legends abound. Their favorite dances feature lanterns, fancy colored sticks, embroidery and dragons. Gin costume is simple and practical. Traditionally, women wear tight-fitting, collarless short blouses buttoned in front plus a diamond-shaped <b>top</b> <b>apron</b> and broad black or brown trousers. When going out, they would put on a light colored gown with narrow sleeves. They also like earrings. Men wear long jackets reaching down to the knees and girdles. Now most people dress themselves like their Han neighbors though a few elderly women retain their tradition and a few young women coil their hair and dye their teeth black.|$|E

Meissonnier, working in Paris (illustration, below), {{any reference to}} tectonic form is gone: even the marble slab <b>top</b> is shaped. <b>Apron,</b> legs, stretcher have all been seamlessly integrated into a flow of opposed c-scrolls and [...] "rocaille."

50|$|A move {{in which}} a wrestler jumps from a raised {{platform}} (the <b>top</b> turnbuckle, the <b>apron,</b> etc.) and lands his or her knee or knees across a supine opponent. There is also a variation where a wrestler jumps from a raised platform and lands with both knees across the prone opponent and {{is referred to as}} a Diving double knee drop. Melina popularized a version where the attacker jumps and drops two knees into the abdomen of an opponent trapped in the middle ropes in the corner.|$|R
50|$|Metalworking lathes have a {{carriage}} (comprising a saddle and <b>apron)</b> <b>topped</b> with a cross-slide, {{which is a}} flat piece that sits crosswise {{on the bed and}} can be cranked at right angles to the bed. Sitting atop the cross slide is usually another slide called a compound rest, which provides 2 additional axes of motion, rotary and linear. Atop that sits a toolpost, which holds a cutting tool, which removes material from the workpiece. There {{may or may not be}} a leadscrew, which moves the cross-slide along the bed.|$|R
50|$|THE BLACK GONELLAThis is {{the oldest}} dress for women, {{probably}} dating from the 18th century. It is a tunic of knitted wool, consisting of an underskirt, a serge jerkin with embroidered satin sleeves, silver buttons and coloured ribbons. This is <b>topped</b> with an <b>apron,</b> a yellow silk shawl and a cambuix, a lace scarf tied under the neck. It is usually worn with a black, felt, wide-brimmed hat. Jewels on the dress are silver and red coral. Gold, which was traditionally used, became scarce during this time. The jewels are affixed to the body with coloured, embroidered ribbons.|$|R
50|$|A bedgown (sometimes bedjacket or shortgown) is {{an article}} of women's {{clothing}} for the upper body, usually thigh-length and wrapping or tying in front. Bedgowns of lightweight printed cotton fabric were fashionable at-home morning wear in the 18th century. Over time, bedgowns (also called in this context shortgowns) became the staple upper garment of British and American female working-class street wear from the 18th to early 19th centuries, worn over petticoats and often <b>topped</b> with an <b>apron.</b> Made of sturdy cotton, linen, wool or linsey-woolsey, these bedgowns were simply cut to a T-shaped pattern, and were worn overlapped in front or with the front skirts cutaway.|$|R
50|$|An apron is a {{functional}} accessory that layers over one's outfit to protect one's clothes and skin from incidental stains and marks. As a top layer {{that covers the}} front body, the apron is also worn as a uniform, adornment, ceremonial garb or fashion statement. Apron styles adapt to the tastes of the times to suite the values and jobs of the current culture. The practical, fashionable sentimental nature of the apron has made it a cherished accessory for centuries. Because aprons provide comfort, protection {{and a sense of}} preparedness—the apron will always be a go-to garment for people who work, clean, entertain and create. Because the <b>apron</b> is a <b>top</b> layer, the <b>apron</b> will continue to be worn as a fashion accessory both inside—and outside—the home.|$|R
40|$|The {{large amount}} of multi-temporal {{high-resolution}} images acquired {{in the last few}} years offers the opportunity to identify morphological changes associated with recent geologic activity on the surface of Mars. In this study we focus on a single gully in Sisyphi Cavi, located in the south polar region at 1. 44 °E and 68. 54 °S. The gully incises the gullied equator-facing slope of an isolated polar pit within an infilled impact crater. It is important to notice that the following investigations describe the activity and modifications of an existing gully and not the formation of the gully itself. High-resolution image data analyses show new deposits at the terminus of the gully channel and on the gully apron within spring (after solar longitudes of 236 °) of martian years (MY) 29 and 31. Our morphological investigations show that the identified new deposits were formed by dark flows through the entire gully deposited on <b>top</b> of the <b>apron</b> between solar longitudes (L S) ∼ 218 ° and ∼ 226 °. Thermal data show a temperature increase between L S ∼ 218 ° and ∼ 226 °. Near-infrared spectral data show relatively constant band strengths of CO 2 ice and H 2 O ice in this time range. After the formation of the dark flows (after L S ∼ 226 °), temperatures increase rapidly from ∼ 180 K to >∼ 270 K at L S ∼ 250 °. At this time, spectral data indicate that all volatiles on the surface sublimated. However, an earlier beginning of sublimation when the dark flows were observed (between L S ∼ 218 ° and ∼ 226 °) is likely, due to the fact that the instruments can only show the last phase of sublimation (decrease of volatile band strengths). Spectral modeling shows that from winter to mid-spring, the surface of the studied area is covered by translucent CO 2 slab-ice contaminated by minor amounts of H 2 O ice and dust. Furthermore, our spectral modeling indicates that the dark material most likely flows on top of the CO 2 slab-ice cover. Three different scenarios were proposed to explain the identified dark flows, including (1) flows supported by liquid H 2 O, (2) flows supported by CO 2 gas, and (3) dry flows. On the basis of our study we find that scenario (1) is unlikely because of the very low temperatures. While scenario (2) is consistent with the observed beginning of CO 2 ice sublimation in the study area, it is unlikely because of the limitation of the activity to only one gully compared to surrounding gullies that share the same morphologies, slope angles, and volatile contents. Also with scenario (3), dry flows, the activity of only one gully is difficult to explain. Thus, we propose a mixture of scenario (2 and 3), dry flows supported by the ongoing sublimation of CO 2 ice within the gully, to be the most plausible scenario, when the observed active gully comprises different source material than the surrounding gullies, i. e., a higher content of probably sand-sized material from outcrops located in the alcove...|$|R
