40|$|This paper {{develops}} a safety-guaranteed trajectory <b>tracking</b> controller for <b>hovercraft</b> {{by using a}} safety-guaranteed auxiliary dynamic system, an integral sliding mode control, and an adaptive neural network method. The safety-guaranteed auxiliary dynamic system is designed to implement system state and input constraints. By considering the relationship of velocity and resistance hump, the velocity of hovercraft is constrained to eliminate the effect of resistance hump and obtain better stability. And the safety limit of drift angle is well performed to guarantee the light safe maneuvers of <b>hovercraft</b> <b>tracking</b> with high velocities. In view of the natural capabilities of actuators, the control input is constrained. High nonlinearity and model uncertainties of hovercraft are approximated by employing adaptive radical basis function neural networks. The proposed controller guarantees the boundedness of all the closed-loop signals. Specifically, the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Numerical simulations are implemented to demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} designed controller...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} trajectory <b>tracking</b> {{control of}} <b>hovercraft</b> {{vehicles in the}} presence of actuator constraints. A saturated tracking controller is designed by utilizing hyperbolic tangent functions {{to reduce the risk of}} actuator saturation. Adaptive robust techniques are adopted to guarantee the robustness of the control system against unknown parameters and external disturbances. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis shows that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded and tracking errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the British {{electrical}} engineer Eric Laithwaite, {{a professor at}} Imperial College London, developed the first full-size working model of the linear induction motor. He became professor of heavy electrical engineering at Imperial College in 1964, where he continued his successful development of the linear motor. Since linear motors do not require physical contact between the vehicle and guideway, they became a common fixture on advanced transportation systems in the 1960s and 70s. Laithwaite joined one such project, the <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft,</b> although the project was cancelled in 1973.|$|E
25|$|As Minister for Aerospace in 1973, Heseltine was {{responsible}} for persuading other governments to invest in Concorde and was accused of misleading the House of Commons when he stated {{that the government was}} still considering giving financial support to the <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> when the Cabinet had already decided to withdraw funding. Although his chief critic Airey Neave disliked Heseltine as a brash 'arriviste', Neave's real target, in the view of Heseltine's PPS Cecil Parkinson, was Heath, whom Neave detested and later helped to topple as party leader in 1975.|$|E
2500|$|A {{test track}} for a <b>tracked</b> <b>hovercraft</b> system was built at Earith near Cambridge, England. It ran {{southwest}} from Sutton Gault, sandwiched between the Old Bedford River {{and the smaller}} Counter Drain to the west. Careful examination of the site will still reveal traces of the concrete piers used to support the structure. The actual vehicle, RTV31, is preserved at Railworld in Peterborough and {{can be seen from}} trains, just south west of Peterborough railway station. The vehicle achieved [...] on 7 February 1973 but the project was cancelled a week later. The project was managed by <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> Ltd., with Denys Bliss as Director in the early 1970s, then axed by the Aerospace Minister, Michael Heseltine. Records of this project are available from the correspondence and papers of Sir Harry Legge-Bourke, MP at Leeds University Library. Heseltine was accused by Airey Neave and others of misleading the House of Commons when he stated that the government was still considering giving financial support to the Hovertrain, when the decision to pull the plug had already been taken by the Cabinet.|$|E
40|$|Many {{protected}} {{wetlands and}} (especially) fen peatlands in Poland require vegetation management to restore and maintain them as breeding areas for endangered bird species. The current practice of harvesting, baling and transporting grasses, reeds and other vegetation using tracked snow groomers and wheeled farm tractors can {{conflict with the}} nature conservation goals for these sites through disturbance of the ground surface and accidents leading to spillage of oil. To address these problems, the Industrial Institute of Agricultural Engineering (PIMR) is developing new-generation agricultural machinery that will also be applicable in formal paludiculture. This article describes an innovative method for towing large bales of harvested biomass across wetlands that minimises ground pressure using any vehicle, {{and the development of}} amphibian <b>tracked</b> (ATV) and <b>hovercraft</b> vehicles for biomass harvesting operations in wetlands...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{discovery}} {{was that the}} total amount of air needed to lift the craft was a function of the roughness of the surface it traveled over. On flat surfaces, like pavement, the needed air pressure was so low that hovercraft were able to compete in energy terms with conventional systems like steel wheels. However, as the hovercraft lift system acted as both a lift and very effective suspension, it naturally lent itself to high-speed use where conventional suspension systems were considered too complex. This led to a variety of [...] "hovertrain" [...] proposals during the 1960s, including England's <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> and France's Aérotrain. In the U.S., Rohr Inc. and Garrett both took out licenses to develop local versions of the Aérotrain. These designs competed with maglev systems in the high-speed arena, where their primary advantage was the very [...] "low tech" [...] tracks they needed. On the downside, the air blowing dirt and trash out from under the trains presented a unique problem in stations, and interest in them waned in the 1970s.|$|E

50|$|Frustrated with BR's lack of {{interest}} in his hovertrain work, and their lack of funding, in 1967 Laithwaite severed his ties with BR and joined <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> as a consultant. By this time the French government had started providing major funding for Jean Bertin's Aérotrain project, which was substantially similar to the <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> in concept. Laithwaite, always described as persuasive, convinced the government that they were about to lose out on this burgeoning field of high-speed transit, and eventually won £2 million in additional funding.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> was an {{experimental}} high speed train {{developed in the}} United Kingdom during the 1960s. It combined two British inventions, the hovercraft and linear induction motor, {{in an effort to}} produce a train system that would provide 250 mph inter-city service with lowered capital costs compared to other high-speed solutions. Substantially similar to the French Aérotrain and other hovertrain systems of the 1960s, <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> suffered a similar fate to these projects when it was cancelled as a part of wide budget cuts in 1973.|$|E

50|$|During the 1960s, the Sutton Gault hamlet was {{the site}} of one of the world's first <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft,</b> {{designed}} by Eric Laithwaite.

50|$|In 1967, the {{government}} handed control of Hovercraft Development to the National Physical Laboratory. At {{almost exactly the}} same time, Laithwaite severed his ties with BR. The two teams joined forces, re-organizing as <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> to continue efforts to build a full-scale prototype. A combination of factors, including Laithwaite's persuasiveness and Bertin's successes in France, quickly gained the company government funding.|$|E
50|$|Many {{original}} {{documents from the}} <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> project are stored within the Hovercraft Museum library in Hampshire, England, including technical documents, video footage reels, press books and blueprints.

Another scale model of the RTV 31 is kept within the Railworld museum.|$|E
5000|$|Hovertrain is {{a generic}} term, and the {{vehicles}} are more {{commonly referred to}} by the projects that developed them in different countries - in the UK they are known as <b>tracked</b> <b>hovercraft,</b> in the US they are tracked air-cushion vehicles, and in France they are the aerotrains. News sources often conflate maglev trains with hovertrains, as both are levitated above the running surface, [...] "hovering" [...] over them.|$|E

5000|$|A {{study by}} UK <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> Ltd. (see below) {{considered}} the energy {{use of a}} 40-ton 100-passenger hovertrain. At 400 km/h and in a 70 km/h crosswind, they predicted that their hovertrain would require 2,800 kW (3,750 hp) to overcome aerodynamic drag, a figure that compared favourably to {{any other form of}} ground transit. However, in order to provide lift, the vehicle would need to ingest air and accelerate it to vehicle speed before pumping it into the lift pads. This produced what they called [...] "momentum drag", accounting for a further 2,100 kW (2,800 hp). The combined [...] was not unheard of, existing freight locomotives of similar power were already in use. However, these locomotives weighed 80 tons, much of it constituted by the voltage control and conversion equipment, whereas the <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> design was intended to be a very lightweight vehicle. THL's solution was to move this equipment to the trackside, requiring this expensive technology to be distributed all along the line. However the PTACV demonstrated that a 64000 lb, 60 seat vehicle needed only [...] at 142 mph for its air suspension and guidance system. At 431 km/h, the French I80 HV (80 seats) reached similar figures.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} {{construction}} started on Tracked Hovercraft's test track, British Rail was well advanced on {{their plans for}} the steel-wheeled Advanced Passenger Train (APT). The government found itself {{in the position of}} funding two different high-speed train systems whose proponents were quick to point out problems in the competing system. To gain some clarity, they formed an interdepartmental working party that studied several potential inter-city transit solutions on the London-Manchester and London-Glasgow routes. The options included buses, Advanced Passenger Train, <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft,</b> and VTOL and STOL aircraft. Their December 1971 report strongly favoured APT.|$|E

Laithwaite joined one such project, the <b>tracked</b> <b>hovercraft,</b> although the project was cancelled in 1973.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the 1970s, {{construction}} of test track {{started in the}} fens at Earith in Cambridgeshire, supported by <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> Ltd offices in Ditton Walk in Cambridge city. The track was about 6 ft off the ground, running along the earthworks between the Old Bedford River and the Counter Drain just to its north, between Earith and the Denver Sluice. The first 4 mi long section of the planned 20 mi long track was laid to Sutton-in-the-Isle. Along the full 20 mi length it was expected the train would reach 300 mph.|$|E
5000|$|But {{much more}} {{important}} {{was that there was}} no need to ingest and accelerate air to feed into the pads, which eliminated 2,100 kW of load and replaced it by the power needed to operate the magnets. This was estimated to be as little as 40 kW, and had much less dependency on speed. This meant that designs like the <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> were squeezed between the zero-energy [...] "lift" [...] system of steel-wheeled trains and the low-energy lift system of the maglev, leaving no apparent role that one of those systems didn't better serve.|$|E
50|$|On 1 April 1967, Hovercraft Development {{was officially}} {{transferred}} to National Physical Laboratory. Seeking {{to protect their}} investment, and finding little external funding, the NRDC decided to spin off the hovertrain group as <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> Ltd. (THL). They also decided to spool out the funding over four years, starting with a £1 million grant for a single prototype vehicle and a short portion of the test track. Although this funding was enough only for {{the first stage of}} a track, the NRDC suggested it would be quite useful for testing low speed intra-urban versions of the concept.|$|E
50|$|Like their UK {{counterparts}}, {{the seeds}} of the Aérotrain's demise were already being sown by their counterparts at the national railway. In 1966, other SNCF engineers had made the first proposals for higher speed conventional railways, a proposal that would take {{on a life of its}} own and evolve into the TGV program. Like the <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> and APT, the Aérotrain project soon found itself fighting with the TGV for future development. Unlike the UK work, however, the Aérotrain had stronger political backing, and did not suffer from the same lack of funding as its British counterpart.|$|E
50|$|Only a {{week after}} McNair-Wilson's {{comments}} at the run in February 1973, funding for the <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> project was cancelled. Heseltine noted problems with the concept, stated {{that there was no}} prospect of a system being installed before 1985, and very limited possibilities between then {{and the end of the}} century. He stated that further funding, already to the tune of £5 million by this point, made no sense at that time. Work on the LIM would continue to be funded, however, and the Department of Trade and Industry signed a £500,000 contract with Hawker Siddeley to carry on LIM development.|$|E
50|$|Although {{high speed}} travel would require new lines to be laid, {{expensive}} ones, such a train could use existing rail infrastructure at lower speeds. This would allow such {{a train to}} approach existing stations at lower speeds, greatly reducing capital costs of bringing the service into cities. The inter-city sections could be re-laid for higher speeds, where the infrastructure costs were generally lower anyway. BR also showed that the capital cost advantages of the hovertrain concept were offset by the higher vehicle costs; the <b>tracked</b> <b>hovercraft</b> concept made sense for {{a smaller number of}} vehicles or longer lines where the capital costs were concentrated in the tracks, but neither of these characterised BR's operations.|$|E
5000|$|In general terms, the maglev simply {{replaced}} the hover pads with electromagnets. Removing the motors and fans and replacing the pads with magnets reduced vehicle weight by about 15%. This change {{meant that the}} relatively low payload fraction of the hovercraft was greatly increased, as much as doubling it. But much more important {{was that there was}} no need to ingest and accelerate air to feed into the pads, which eliminated [...] and replaced it by the power needed to operate the magnets, estimated to be as little as [...] This meant that the <b>Tracked</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> was squeezed between the zero-energy lift system of the steel-wheeled APT and the low-energy lift system of the maglev, leaving no role that one of those systems didn't better serve.|$|E
