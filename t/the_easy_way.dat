5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So I took <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> out and since I was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E

Disa O'Brien (Jan Graveson) phones The Samaritans and tells Kathy her baby, Billie O'Brien, {{is the product of}} rape and fathered by her stepfather, Ken Raynor (Ian Redford).

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Dan Martin of The Guardian {{described the}} episode as a [...] "sumptuous triumph". Website Den of Geek's Simon Brew applauded Moffat for [...] "not taking <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> out" [...] with the adaptation, {{saying it was}} [...] "really quite mad, undoubtedly festive, and it treats the Dickens source material with respect". However, he also wondered if young children [...] "would have enjoyed 'A Christmas Carol' quite as much" [...] as adults". Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the special an A-, naming it the [...] "best Doctor Who Christmas special" [...] he had seen.

500|$|Smith {{attended}} dedicated {{courses for}} ex-servicemen at Gwebi during 1947 and 1948, learning {{skills such as}} ploughing, herding and milking; he gained practical experience at Taylor's dairy farm near Selukwe and on a tobacco ranch at Marandellas. In 1947, he met Janet Duvenage (née Watt), a schoolteacher from the Cape in South Africa {{who had come to}} Selukwe to stay with family after the death of her husband Pieter on the rugby field. What Janet had planned as a short holiday for herself and her two infant children, Jean and Robert, turned into a permanent move when she accepted a job offer from the Selukwe junior school. Smith later wrote that the qualities that had attracted him most to Janet were her intelligence, courage and [...] "oppos on principle to side-stepping or evading an issue... her tendency was to opt for a decision requiring courage, as opposed to taking <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> out". They became engaged in 1948. Meanwhile, Smith negotiated the purchase of a piece of rough land near Selukwe, bounded by the Lundi and Impali Rivers and bisected by a clear stream. He and Janet gave the previously nameless [...] plot the name that the local Karanga people used to refer to the stream, [...] "Gwenoro", and set up a ranch where they ran cattle and grew tobacco and maize.|$|E

500|$|Indecision {{over his}} {{sexuality}} in the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol" [...] drew some negative reviews of Blaine. Reiter noted that, [...] "So much of Blaine's charm {{has been his}} certainty about who he is." [...] Though she found his subplot with Rachel [...] "fun", she commented: [...] "Blaine's overwrought speech in the coffee shop after Rachel asks him out just felt off-key. Saying 'bye' to the Blaine sexual-confusion storyline wouldn't make us angry at all." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also criticised the storyline, which, he wrote, [...] "seemed like it might be an interesting, complicated look at teenage sexuality {{and how it can}} seem formed but might be more fluid than most teens would give it credit for, then lost its nerve and took <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> out." [...] AfterElton.com Chris O'Guinn felt that the only aspect of the storyline handled acceptably was Blaine questioning whether he was bisexual, rather than outright straight. He criticized the shallow examination of his feelings, and wrote: [...] "Bisexuality is such a contentious issue that it should not be fumbled this way. For a character to say 'maybe I'm bi' in one scene and then the next say, 'nope, definitely gay' is almost cruel in how dismissive it is toward bisexuals by trivializing the intense confusion that many bisexual people feel in coming to terms with their orientation." [...] In a more positive review, Canning opined that Blaine and Kurt's conversation about sexuality was [...] "great". He was [...] "glad it wasn't an easy talk for either of them" [...] and said that it [...] "felt very real for kids in this situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert gave a very {{positive}} review. [...] "Superman is a pure delight, a wondrous combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects and wit. Reeve is perfectly cast in the role. Any poor choice would have ruined the film." [...] Ebert placed the film on his 10 best list of 1978. He would later go on to place it on his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list. James Berardinelli believed [...] "there's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's {{one of the most}} wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s. It's exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be. Perhaps most heartening of all, however, is the message {{at the end of the}} credits announcing the impending arrival of Superman II." [...] Harry Knowles is a longtime fan of the film, but was critical of elements that did not represent the Superman stories as seen in the comics. Dave Kehr felt [...] "the tone, style, and point of view change almost from shot to shot. This is the definitive corporate film. It is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> out in giggly camp. When Lex Luthor enters the action, Hackman plays the arch-villain like a hairdresser left over from a TV skit." [...] Neal Gabler similarly felt that the film focused too much on shallow comedy. He also argued that the film should have adhered more to the spirit of Mario Puzo's original script, and referred to the first three Superman films collectively as [...] "simply puffed-up TV episodes." ...|$|E
