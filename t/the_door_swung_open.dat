60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and {{the girl}} came in gasping, with horror in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Slowly <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> {{and a man}} {{entered the}} room. Barney breathed a deep sigh of relief--it was Joseph.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> {{with the}} same {{promptness}} as before. A villainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the doorway.|$|E
60|$|As the Sultan spoke, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> {{and there}} entered an aged Turk, in a flowing gown and {{coloured}} turban, with a melancholy yellow face, {{and a long}} white beard that swept to his girdle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said Mr. Parr, as <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and {{he led the}} {{way into}} the house, [...] "I'm sorry I can't give you a more cheerful welcome, but my son and daughter, for their own reasons, see fit to live elsewhere." ...|$|R
60|$|He thrust it {{into the}} lock and turned it; <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> {{smoothly}} <b>open.</b> <b>The</b> policeman laid his hand upon Tavernake's shoulder.|$|R
60|$|The key {{was turned}} noiselessly in the lock; {{he raised the}} latch, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> with never a creak.|$|E
60|$|A {{noise in}} the other room startled them both. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and a tall, elderly, dark complexioned man, {{recently}} shaven, hurried into the room.|$|E
6000|$|He {{walked up}} and down the floor, filled with nameless fears, listening, {{starting}} at every trifling sound. Presently <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and a silken page said-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> {{and through}} them came a {{procession}} clad in black, {{followed by the}} Shaman Simbri, who walked {{in front of a}} bier, upon which lay the body of the Khan, carried by eight priests. Behind it was Atene, draped in a black veil from head to foot, and after her marched another company of priests. In front of the altar the bier was set down and the priests fell back, leaving Atene and her uncle standing alone before the corpse.|$|R
60|$|While he was {{wondering}} what it meant, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> suddenly <b>open.</b> A man filled up the entrance, a big man in a tan uniform, blocking the way ominously.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> quickly <b>open</b> and {{he stood}} there in the {{streaming}} sunlight of the morning--so tall he was he seemed to fill the doorway--and he smiled and extended his hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come right in." [...] <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open.</b> [...] "We {{have already}} {{finished}} eating, but {{the fire is}} burning and I can get something up for you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open.</b> Two shadowy figures, shapeless in fur {{coats and}} caps, {{appeared}} in the opening, {{and one of them}} turned sharply when Gallwey slammed the door behind him.|$|E
60|$|He made no answer. The girl's {{words had}} thrilled him. Then <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and Jimmy appeared, very pink and white, very immaculate, and looking rather more {{helpless}} than usual.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here come {{two of them}} now," [...] said Roger, in a low voice, as <b>the</b> tavern <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and {{two young}} men appeared, each wearing a linen duster and a touring cap.|$|R
60|$|As Thorne was {{forcibly}} {{driven away}} from <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> it <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> {{and a man}} sprang out on to the veranda with another close behind, while confused cries went up.|$|R
60|$|The {{driver had}} hardly ceased {{speaking}} before <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and Ninety-four was drawn {{out with a}} rush and a clatter that sounded like sweetest music in Seth's ears.|$|R
60|$|And {{as their}} heads touched the wood, {{from the other}} side came a rousing thump that jarred them. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> {{revealing}} Ernestine with a padded gong-stick in either hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open.</b> It {{was dark}} outside, but Agravaine could {{distinguish}} a female form, and, beyond, a shapeless mass {{which he took}} correctly to be {{the remains of the}} two plug-uglies.|$|E
6000|$|At {{that moment}} the last bolt was withdrawn, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> {{revealing}} several files of soldiers with muskets, and bayonets fixed, in the passage. This sight decided {{the question of a}} rush! ...|$|E
60|$|Hardly had the {{reflection}} {{crossed my mind}} when a noise outside startled me. I had just time enough to thrust the paper into my pocket when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and <b>the</b> tramp appeared.|$|R
60|$|On this day, then, he went {{directly}} to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and spent hours examining it and fussing with the hinges, the knob and the latch. Finally he stumbled upon the right combination, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> creakingly <b>open</b> before his astonished eyes.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then there}} was a knock upon <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> which <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and a cluster of shadowy figures, with their breath {{floating}} like steam about them, appeared outside it. One of them flung a deerhide bag into the room.|$|R
60|$|Oak's hand {{skimmed the}} surface of the door with fingers {{extended}} to an Elymas-the-Sorcerer pattern, till he found a leathern strap, which he pulled. This lifted a wooden latch, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{go in for}} {{squaring}} up {{with old}} Haskers," [...] he said, rather loudly. [...] "He's about as mean----" [...] And then he stopped short, as <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and the second assistant appeared.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and Clarence Colfax, out of breath, {{ran into}} the room. He stopped short when he saw them, his hand fell to his sides, and his words died on his lips. Virginia did not stir.|$|E
60|$|Flambeau was plainly {{in a mood}} {{to break}} down <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with his big shoulders; but the Scotchman, with more reason, if less intuition, fumbled about on the frame of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> till he found the {{invisible}} button; and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> slowly <b>open.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bertram Kneyght greeted {{his cousin}} {{and her friend}} with genuine heartiness, and readily {{accepted}} their invitation to explore the crowded mart that stood temptingly at their elbow. <b>The</b> plate-glass <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and <b>the</b> trio plunged bravely into the jostling throng of buyers and loiterers.|$|R
60|$|Small wonder, in this tense {{passage of}} time, that I had {{forgotten}} the Samurai. Nor did I remember him until <b>the</b> chart-house <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and I caught him by the arm. He steadied and swayed beside me, while he watched that cruel picture of rock and snow and spouting surf.|$|R
6000|$|The slave {{girl looked}} at her in surprise. [...] "It cannot be that you do not know!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Why, they are--" [...] but she got no further. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and an officer stood before them.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I'll {{take them}} myself. No one will rob me." [...] And then <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and, chuckling {{in his usual}} {{whimsical}} fashion, Uncle John came out, wearing his salt-and-pepper suit and stuffing; a bundle of papers into his inside pocket.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open.</b> Too late, Tommy {{remembered his}} scheme of obliterating the unprepossessing Conrad. A {{moment later he}} was glad that he had, for it was not Conrad who entered, but a girl. She carried a tray which she set down on the table.|$|E
60|$|Places {{were set}} at the farther {{end of the table}} for these most {{unexpected}} guests. Presently <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and Croquart with all form and courtesy announced the two Bretons, who entered with the proud and lofty air of gallant warriors and high-bred gentlemen.|$|R
60|$|This flippant {{reply was}} about to draw another and a sterner reproof from the chaplain, when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and two warders entered leading Duncan Warner between them. He glanced round him with a set face, stepped resolutely forward, and seated himself upon the chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "For God's sake, don't shoot! I {{will open}} it! I will open it!" [...] He rushed {{from the room}} with his paper still {{crumpled}} up in his hand. An instant later, with a groaning of old locks and a rasping of bars, <b>the</b> low <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and <b>the</b> Prussians poured into the stone-flagged passage.|$|R
