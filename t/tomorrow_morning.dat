500|$|Both my divisional {{generals and}} brigadiers have {{represented}} {{to me that}} they fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which they have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in morning. Numbers have dribbled back from the firing line and cannot be collected in this difficult country. Even New Zealand Brigade which has only recently been engaged lost heavily and is to some extent demoralised. If troops are subjected to shellfire again <b>tomorrow</b> <b>morning</b> there {{is likely to be a}} fiasco, as I have no fresh troops with which to replace those in firing line. I know my representation is most serious, but if we are to re-embark it must be at once. Hamilton conferred with his naval commanders, who convinced him an evacuation would be almost impossible, and responded; [...] "dig yourselves right in and stick it out... dig, dig, dig until you are safe".

[...] He believed it was important to substitute Giggs and Keane early in the second half {{in order for them to}} recuperate in time for the Dinamo București game. Scholes, however, [...] "…needed a game, which is why I left him on that bit longer." [...] Ferguson felt Manchester United's preparations to the new season were hampered because of the injuries: [...] "It's got a lot to do with summer football. It's not down to the European Championship, but you do wonder why the Copa América can't be at the same time. That harmony is never quite right, from Africa to America to Europe. Something should be done about that." [...] Giggs said Manchester United needed to take the positives out of the match and anticipated Arsenal as their main rivals in the league: [...] " [...] know what to do and how to handle the pressure when it comes around." ...|$|E

After formal introduction, Braunersreuther handed the governor this ultimatum from Captain Glass: [...] "Sir: In reply to your communication of this date I have now, in compliance with the orders of my government, to demand the immediate surrender of the defenses of the Island of Guam, with arms of all kinds, all officials and persons in the military service of Spain now in this island.

2500|$|The {{marriage}} {{finally took}} place {{in an atmosphere of}} crisis. Daniel Heartz suggests that eventually Constanze moved in with Mozart, which would have placed her in disgrace by the mores of the time. Mozart wrote to Leopold on 31 July 1782, [...] "All the good and well-intentioned advice you have sent fails to address the case {{of a man who has}} already gone so far with a maiden. Further postponement is out of the question." [...] Heartz relates, [...] "Constanze's sister Sophie had tearfully declared that her mother would send the police after Constanze if she did not return home [...]" [...] On 4 August, Mozart wrote to Baroness von Waldstätten, asking: [...] "Can the police here enter anyone's house in this way? Perhaps it is only a ruse of Madame Weber to get her daughter back. If not, I know no better remedy than to marry Constanze <b>tomorrow</b> <b>morning</b> or if possible today." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the War of the Fourth Coalition, the 5th Hussars were {{assigned}} to Antoine Lasalle's light cavalry division and brigaded with the 7th Hussars. The hussar brigade helped rout a Prussian flank guard at Zehdenick on 26 October 1806 and fought at the Battle of Prenzlau on the 28th. On 30 October the Capitulation of Stettin occurred. With only 800 hussars, Lasalle bluffed Friedrich Romberg into surrendering the fortress and its garrison of 5,300 Prussians. The demand to surrender was carried by Schwarz, who addressed Romberg, [...] "I’ve been sent by my superior, the Grand Duke of Berg, who summons you to surrender to him <b>tomorrow</b> <b>morning.</b> You will be granted the honors of war." [...] Romberg refused, but Schwarz returned an hour later with an ultimatum announcing that a bombardment would precede an attack by 50,000 troops if Stettin was not surrendered by 8:00 AM. Furthermore, the garrison would not be granted quarter and the town would be sacked. At this, Romberg caved in. The 5th Hussars fought at the Battle of Golymin on 26 December 1806. Schwarz became a general of brigade on 30 December 1806 and a Baron of the Empire on 9 March 1808.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shut-down}} of the Army facility {{proved the}} last straw for Truman. [...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled. The President then told Fairless: [...] "You can settle this thing, Ben, and you've got to settle it. I want it settled by <b>tomorrow</b> <b>morning,</b> or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I will have to do some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now go in there in the Cabinet room, and I want you to come out with a settlement." [...] The two men adjourned to the Cabinet Room. At 4:45p.m., Fairless and Murray told the President that they had reached an agreement. Steelman witnessed its signing.|$|E

Hiko points out that he has lost his killer instinct with his oath to not kill and his [...] "ridiculous" [...] sword, after all it is the strong who survive and the weak who die. That night, Hiko says that something is missing in Kenshin, and that he will be given the night to think about it. If he cannot find what it is, he will die <b>tomorrow.</b> Next <b>morning</b> Hiko reveals his final task as Master to Kenshin - without realising what is missing, Kenshin will return to his old ways and so Hiko has to kill Battousai. Kenshin listens as he is told that he cannot learn the secret until he realises that the will to live is paramount; and so he has learned the secret of Amakakeru.|$|R
2500|$|Police also {{discovered}} several documents on Talcott's body. [...] The documents included {{the letter from}} Mrs. Talcott's sister urging Talcott to act, a grand jury subpoena from the investigation of Moore, and quantities of advertising literature for Hydrox Ice Cream.

[...] Talcott's brother-in-law, George E. Repp, told police that he believed the note was Talcott's effort to record a threat made by Mrs. Talcott. [...] Repp described an angry encounter at the Talcott residence:"Talcott, in writing the threat, was but quoting the words of his own wife. [...] I was {{with them in the}} Talcott home the day before Talcott testified against Dr. Moore.

500|$|In {{contrast}} with the song's tempo, Azalea's rapping is fast-paced and in Southern American English pronunciation throughout. A timed build-drop production formula is used to vary her delivery in which she puts emphasis on certain lyrics and lifts off on others. During the verses, Azalea's delivery is expletively riddled and contains trill consonants, particularly during the bridge, [...] "All about money, the nice never ending / We party till <b>morning,</b> <b>tomorrow</b> we kick it". According to Digital Spy's Lewis Corner, the chorus causes the listener to [...] "adhere to the song's title". In it, Azalea repeatedly raps, [...] "Make it bounce / Make it bounce / Make it bounce / Shake it, break it, make it bounce". Lyrically, [...] "Bounce" [...] is about being carefree, partying, dancing, and celebrating life. Sam Lansky of Idolator describes the lyrics as [...] "party-happy uncomplicated fun". Several critics compared the song to 2 Unlimited's [...] "No Limit" [...] (1993).|$|R
25|$|Afrikaans uses a diaeresis to mark vowels {{that are}} {{pronounced}} separately {{and not as}} one would expect where they occur together, for example voel (to feel) as opposed to voël (bird). The circumflex is used in ê, î, ô and û generally to indicate long close-mid, as opposed to open-mid vowels, for example in the words wêreld (world) and môre (<b>morning,</b> <b>tomorrow).</b> The acute accent is used to add emphasis {{in the same way as}} underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example Dit is jóú boek (It is your book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example appel (apple) and appèl (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes no difference to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are the in the sayings òf... òf (either... or) and nòg... nòg (neither... nor) to distinguish them from of (or) and nog (again, still).|$|R
60|$|We {{remained}} in Nauheim {{a little too}} long. If we had left there {{four or five days}} earlier we should have made Florence in 3 days; but {{by the time we got}} started Livy had got smitten with what we feared might be erysipelas--greatly swollen neck and face, and unceasing headaches. We lay idle in Frankfort 4 days, doctoring. We started Thursday and made Bale. Hard trip, because it was one of those trains that gets tired every seven minutes and stops to rest three quarters of an hour. It took us 3 1/2 hours to get here, instead of the regulation 2.20. We reached here Friday evening and will leave <b>tomorrow</b> (Tuesday) <b>morning.</b> The rest has made the headaches better. We shall pull through to Milan tomorrow if possible. Next day we shall start at 10 a. m., and try to make Bologna, 5 hours. Next day (Thursday) Florence, D. V. Next year we will walk, for these excursions have got to be made over again. I've got seven trunks, and I undertook to be courier because I meant to express them to Florence direct, but we were a couple of days too late. All continental roads had issued a peremptory order that no baggage should travel a mile except in the company of the owner. (All over Europe people are howling; they are separated from their baggage and can't get it forwarded to them) I have to re-ship my trunks every day. It is very amusing--uncommonly so. There seemed grave doubts about our being able to get these trunks over the Italian frontier, but I've got a very handsome note from the Frankfort Italian Consul General addressed to all Italian Customs Officers, and we shall get through if anybody does.|$|R

50|$|Later that day, {{the gunman}} wins a {{challenge}} from the Genji henchman Yoichi to have Shizuka for the night. Before he proceeds with her, he is told by Genji leader Yoshitsune {{that he is}} reminiscent of the legendary female gunslinger Bloody Benten. Later, Shizuka warns the gunman that Yoshitsune sent some men to retrieve a new weapon for Yoichi to use on him. He tells Shizuka to take her son and leave town <b>tomorrow.</b> The next <b>morning,</b> following a tip-off from Shizuka, the sheriff informs Kiyomori of the Genjis' plans. The Heikes ambush the wagon, with Kiyomori acquiring a Gatling gun stored inside a coffin. Meanwhile, as the Genjis race toward the wagon raid, Ruriko, Shizuka and Heihachi are fleeing from town when Shizuka runs back to save the roses. She is mortally shot through the heart by Yoichi. The gunman attempts to intervene, but is forced to drop his guns before being tortured by the Genji thug. Ruriko's servant Toshio suddenly appears and throws a gun at her before she shoots and kills Yoichi and his henchmen, revealing herself to be Bloody Benten. In retaliation for the wagon raid, the Genjis destroy the Heikes' fortress.|$|R
5000|$|Mr Camara Yelli, {{one of the}} {{inhabitants}} of Haourou a village in Guidimakha told me February 25, 2006 that Soundiata Keita the emperor of the Manding in Mali wanted to have the city of Boli in his empire. He promised to all the warriors of his empire {{that the person who}} will help him conquer the city of Boly will have anything he wants from him. Gane, the ancestor of the Camara of Guidimakha, was the strongest warrior of Soundiata Keita Empire. Gane went with his army to the city of Boly he won the battle. He killed the king of Boly cut his head and put it in his bag. He brought it to Sundiata Keita as a proof of his victory. So the city of Boly became a part of Soundiata Keita Empire. He was very happy and wanted to reward his warrior Gane. He told him in front of all his court come <b>tomorrow</b> at early <b>morning</b> I will give to you anything you want that you have seen in my kingdom. This is the big promise that the emperor Soundiata Keita made to Gane. Tekhaye Kante the youngest wife of Soundiata heard it. As she loved Gane she dressed herself as new bride and sat early in the morning {{in the middle of the}} royal court. Soundiata Keita, Gane and the royal court met at this time at the place convened. When Gane saw her, he thought that it was the gift the emperor promised him and thanked Soundiata keita. As an emperor a parole is sacred so he agreed to give to Gane in marriage his wife Tekhaye Kante. However Soundiata Keita was so furious and humiliated and Tekhaye Kante knew it. She advised to her new husband Gane to desert the Soundiata Keita Empire. Gane followed his wife’s advice and left with her and his friends Barri, Gassama, Dagnokho. When they arrived in a village away from Soundiata Keita’s empire, he left his companions and his wife with the chief of that village named Sylla. He went hunting. During his absence, Soundiata Keita’s army came and fought with the sylla in order to bring back with them Tekhaye Kante the ex-wife of the emperor. The sylla won the battle and soon Soundiata’s army went back without Gane’s companions. When Gane came back from hunting he took his companions and left the sylla’s village in order to prevent their hosts from any attack of Soundiata Keita. On the road to Guidimakha he met a cisse and they became friends, continuing the journey together. They arrived to a mountain and found there a king named Magha Soumare. They continued by foot to the top of the mountain. For the warriors of that time, music would be made to let the king know about their presence. He knew that Gane was a strong warrior. The soumare were farmers and they needed protection against the Berbers of Mauritania. Gane agreed to help to protect them. Magha Soumare gave a part of his kingdom to Gane will dominate thus he asked Gane to promise him that the kingdom will take his name. He gave his daughter in marriage to Gane as an alliance. After his death Gane dominated a part of the kingdom but he did what he promised. He named it “Guidimakha” which means the [...] "Mountain of Makha". The Guidimakha is located in the southern Mauritania and the northern Mali.|$|R
