25|$|Dreyfus also {{identified}} a subtler assumption about the world. AI researchers (and futurists and science fiction writers) often {{assume that there}} is no limit to formal, scientific knowledge, because they assume that any phenomenon in the universe can be described by symbols or scientific theories. This assumes that everything that exists can be understood as objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely those <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called ontology, and so Dreyfus calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts about what we can ultimately know and what intelligent machines will ultimately be able to help us to do.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} framework {{has more}} recently been {{put forward by}} Wilken and Ma (2004) who suggest that apparent capacity limitations in VSTM are caused by a monotonic decline {{in the quality of}} the internal representations stored (i.e., monotonic increase in noise) as a function of set-size. In this conception capacity limitations in memory are not caused by a limit on the number of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> encoded, but by a decline in the quality of the representation of each thing as more things are added to memory. In their 2004 experiments, they varied color, spatial frequency, and orientation of objects stored in VSTM using a signal detection theory approach (see also the closely related work by Palmer, 1990). The participants were asked to report differences between the visual stimuli presented to them in consecutive order. The investigators found that different stimuli were encoded independently and in parallel, and that the major factor limiting report performance was neuronal noise (which is a function of visual set-size).|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Allis-Chalmers {{acquired}} the Monarch Tractor Company of Springfield, Illinois, thus adding {{a line of}} crawler tractors. In 1929, it {{acquired the}} La Crosse Plow Works of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The La Crosse Plow Works had a good-quality plow and various desirable implements, which now expanded the Allis-Chalmers implement line. Also in 1929, Harry Merritt was in California when the bright orange California poppy blossoms inspired him {{to think about the}} use of bright colors in marketing. Brightly colored <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen from far away had potential in farm equipment marketing. He soon changed the paint color of Allis-Chalmers's tractors to Persian Orange, the available paint color that he felt most closely resembled the California poppy's color. Thus began the tradition of orange Allis-Chalmers tractors. Various competitors would follow suit over the next decade, as International Harvester switched to all-red (1936), Minneapolis-Moline switched to Prairie Gold (late 1930s), and Case switched to Flambeau Red (late 1930s). John Deere already had a distinctive color scheme with its bright green and yellow.|$|E

500|$|Following {{exposure}} with British {{magazines and}} newspapers and a successful performance on BBC Radio 1, Bloc Party received a contract offer from Parlophone. The band members declined the opportunity {{because they did not}} want to work for a major record label and instead signed a recording contract with East London indie label Wichita Recordings, chosen because it did not want to stamp its agenda on the conception of records. Frontman and chief writer Okereke wanted Silent Alarm to emphasise the importance of finding pleasure in small mundane things, because [...] "those are the sort of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> incredibly touching". The album was born out of [...] "a nagging youthful urgency" [...] and the realisation that responsibility has to be taken for the first time as a young adult. Before recording started, Okereke attended singing lessons to open up his voice.|$|E
500|$|On March 26, 2002, {{recording}} for Poodle Hat officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. By mid-2002, six originals—"Hardware Store", [...] "Party At The Leper Colony", [...] "Wanna B Ur Lovr", [...] "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?", [...] "Bob", and [...] "Genius In France"—had been recorded. The album's first original song is [...] "Hardware Store", which, {{as the title}} suggests, is about a new neighborhood hardware store and the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> purchased therein. The song was originally {{supposed to be a}} style parody of another (unspecified) artist, but it eventually evolved into its own, original composition. [...] "Party At The Leper Colony" [...] describes a party at a leper colony. The song makes heavy use of wordplay, using common English idioms to describe events wherein people literally lose body parts (e.g. [...] "Dance all night to a rotten band/Come on, people, let's give 'em a hand"). [...] "Wanna B Ur Lovr", a pastiche of Midnite Vultures-era Beck, consists of pick-up lines which become steadily more ridiculous and suggestive. Because the spelling of the song's title recalls the manner in which Prince titled many of his records, Yankovic specified on his website that the [...] "song is actually intended to sound like me trying to sound like Beck trying to sound like Prince" [...]|$|E

Burnet states in any case that [...] "...Xenophanes left Ionia before Herakleitos was born." [...] Diogenes relates that as a boy Heraclitus had said he [...] "knew nothing" [...] but later claimed to [...] "know everything."

Following the program, a police investigation found Levy not guilty and close the case, but did write down a disciplinary offense for Levy for using the brothers as sources. Near the end of the year, the Zeiler Commission appointed to investigate the police proceedings during the affair. according to Justice Vardi Zeiler, [...] "if not for Ilana Dayan and her television program, this case wouldn't have been revived and no one would have known what happened. These are <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said with absolute certainty". The commission report eventually led to the resignation of police commissioner Moshe Karadi and the discharge of Levy. Levy filed a lawsuit for libel against Dayan, arguing that her report exaggerated his part in the affair.|$|E

2500|$|Some philosophers' {{views are}} {{difficult}} to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, Ted Honderich holds the view that [...] "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" [...] and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> located in space and time, but are abstract entities. Further, {{even if they were}} micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The [...] "new" [...] problem is how to resolve this conflict.|$|E
