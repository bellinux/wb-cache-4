5000|$|A silo (from the Greek σιρός - siros, [...] "pit {{for holding}} grain") is a {{structure}} for storing bulk materials. Silos {{are used in}} agriculture to store grain (see grain elevators) or fermented feed known as silage. Silos are more commonly used for bulk storage of grain, coal, cement, carbon black, woodchips, food products and sawdust. Three types of silos are in widespread use today: <b>tower</b> <b>silos,</b> bunker silos, and bag silos.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} days of {{mechanized}} agriculture, stalks were cut and collected manually using a knife and horsedrawn wagon, and fed into a stationary machine called a [...] "silo filler" [...] that chopped the stalks and blew them up a narrow tube {{to the top of a}} <b>tower</b> <b>silo.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{the summer}} filling of a <b>tower</b> <b>silo,</b> the {{unloader}} is winched {{as high as}} possible {{to the top of the}} silo and put into a parking position. The silo is filled with a silo blower, which is literally a very large fan that blows a large volume of pressurized air up a 10-inch tube on the side of the silo. A small amount of water is introduced into the air stream during filling to help lubricate the filling tube. A small adjustable nozzle at the top, controlled by a handle at the base of the silo directs the silage to fall into the silo on the near, middle, or far side, to facilitate evenly layered loading. Once completely filled, the top of the exposed silage pile is covered with a large heavy sheet of silo plastic which seals out oxygen and permits the entire pile to begin to ferment in the autumn.|$|E
40|$|Canadian {{farmers are}} {{building}} larger and higher <b>tower</b> <b>silos</b> {{than they did}} in the past, following the modern trend for larger engineering structures. These large <b>tower</b> <b>silos</b> represent a substantial expenditure, and in an effort to reduce costs the foundations are often compromised. When silos were smaller there were generally no problems. However, with larger structures the applied loads often approach the bearing capacity of the foundation soils. This has led to excessive settlements, dangerous tilting, and frequently, complete failure. Silos must have foundations designed for the bearing capacity of the soil and with an adequate factor of safety if the structures are to perform as desired. A method for determining the allowable bearing capacity based on soil tests, and some suggested improvements in the design of foundations are given. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|LCA of Silage – {{comparison}} of <b>Tower</b> <b>silo,</b> Bunker silo and Round-bales The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the differences in environmental impact from three types of silage (silage from <b>tower</b> <b>silo,</b> bunker silo and round-bales) used in Swedish dairy production. The silage was studied from ley cultivation, via harvesting and silage making up to and including delivery at the feeding table. The environmental impact categories studied were: energy use, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP). The results showed only small differences between the studied silage alternatives, with round-bale silage as the most energy efficient and tower silage as the least contributing to GWP, AP and EP. Ley cultivation was the dominant source to GWP, AP and EP for all alternatives. For energy use, the subsequent silage handling chain was more important, including a surprisingly high energy use for producing silage agents. A sensitivity analysis indicated that losses can have a large impact on the environmental outcome of silage production, and that the systems therefore should be optimized to reduce losses...|$|E

40|$|Published in {{association}} with Economics Section, School of Social Sciences, University of Waikato. This is the second report that investigates into <b>tower</b> <b>silo</b> farming in New Zealand. As stressed in the first report, there is insufficient evidence from the past operation of these farming methods in New Zealand to assess their economic profitability. Therefore, three budget situations are explored in detail: winter beef fattening, wintering store beef weaners, and town supply dairy; and the relative profitability {{of the system is}} assessed by this method. It appears that in most cases the initial investment in tower silos will bring about considerable changes in the whole management system. Thus, it is imperative to take into account all the quantifiable benefits and costs of any given <b>tower</b> <b>silo</b> system by looking at most items of the whole farm budget. For this reason, the approach used here has been to attempt to estimate the profitability of the whole farm investment including tower silos and associated buildings and plant. This farm net profit level with silos can be compared with that level expected for the same farm without silos, farmed by more conventional methods, and any difference in favour of the former can be imputed as a return on this incremental farm capital investment, which will be then available for comparison with rates obtainable in other alternative on-farm or off-farm investments...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the effects of dry matter (DM) content and three different storage systems on the quality of alfalfa ensiled on commercial farms. Alfalfa silage samples were collected from 21 bunker silos, 20 silos that limited oxygen infiltration, and 19 <b>tower</b> <b>silos</b> on 43 commercial dairy farms. Storage system and DM content were confounded because silages from bunker silos generally were wetter than silages from O 2 -limiting and <b>tower</b> <b>silos.</b> There was no effect of storage system on crude protein content of the silages. However, silage from bunker silos had higher concentrations of nonprotein N, NH 3 N, and acid detergent insoluble N than did silages from the other two storage systems. The proportion of total N in neutral detergent insoluble N minus acid detergent insoluble N was greatest in silage from O 2 -limiting silos. Fiber components were affected by storage system; silage from bunker silos had the greatest concentration of acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber. Concentrations of acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber were higher in wetter silages from bunker silos, but DM content did not influence fiber content of silages from O 2 -limiting and <b>tower</b> <b>silos.</b> Concentrations of total organic acids, acetic acid, and butyric acid were highest in silages from bunker silos. The general effects of DM on the quality of silages obtained from commercial dairy farms were similar to results obtained from laboratory-scale silos...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} effects of {{mechanical}} treatment on the ensiling process of pasture and maize, its losses, quality, digestibility, intake and subsequent animal production. At present there are four common types of forage harvesters: flail, double-cut and metered-chop machines and the pick-up wagon equipped {{with a large number}} of knives. Compared with a long chop length, short chopping has a positive influence on losses and silage quality, but this effect decreases with high moisture content, early harvesting, additives, high <b>tower</b> <b>silo,</b> etc. The chop length does not influence digestibility {{as long as it is}} over 10 mm and as long as the ensiling process losses are small. A chopping length shorter than l 0 mm can affect digestibility for cattle and sheep. Several studies show that, for maize silage, a chop length between 5 and 15 mm does not cause any significant difference in losses, conservation quality, or digestibility. According to the studies reviewed, fine chopping (less than 20 mm) increases the intake, especially by sheep, but the effect diminishes with a higher proportion of concentrates in the ration. The influence of chop length in milk, meat, and sheep production was variable in several trials, so that further studies are necessary to explain chopping effect under different conditions. No optimal chop length was determined, but it seems that a length of about 20 mm is better in terms of silage quality and intake. Under favourable ensiling conditions a longer chopping length also produces a good silage...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} find the {{fundamental}} principle of the technics of silage-making and also the factors governing quality of silage, samples of the silage made at the experimental farm of this university, were analyzed. In the first experiments corn was ensiled in a <b>tower</b> <b>silo</b> (2. 5 m× 7 m), and samples of the resulted silage were taken seven times as the consumption of silage progressed. The samples from each layer {{were divided into two}} groups, the central and circumferential portions (Fig. 1). In the second experiments a mixture of corn and green soybeans was ensiled in the silo and samples of the resulted silage were taken from three parts, i. e. the top, the middle, and the bottom layers (Fig. 2). In each sample the chemical composition, especialiy the contents of organic acids, the total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen as well as the pH value were determined in the usual manner. It was found that the differences in quality and nutrient contents were not significant, although a slight difference was sometimes found when the resulted silage was not of good quality. In further investigation conducted with the bag sample method, also, the results were almost the same. Small scale experiments of silage-making were carried out with "Sekishomo", Vallisneria spralis L. var. asiatica MAKINO, cale, alfalfa, the peel of "Hassaku", a variety of citrus, the peel of "Unshiu", Citrus Unshiu MAKINO, beet tops and mint feed, i. e. the residual of distillation of mint for obtaining menthol and mint oil. Satisfactory silages were found to be prepared from peel of Unshiu, peel of Hassaku, cale, beet tops and mint feed, but not from Sekishomo. The peels of Unshiu and Hassaku gave fragrant and paratable products rich lactic acid, free of butyric acid, and of pH between 3. 1 and 3. 8. The silage prepared from the peel of Unshiu contained dry matter 23. 35, crude protein 2. 03, ether extract 0. 45, N-free extract 10. 08, crude fiber 0. 35, and ash 0. 89 per cent. The digestibility of the protein in these silages was determined by the usual WEDEMEYER method (Table 14). The protein of the silages Prepared from cale, peels of both Unshiu and Hassaku, and beet tops possessed a satisfactory digestibility, but that of Sekishomo and mint feed did not. The results of the calculation of the digestibility of silage protein by three different methods, WATSON'S, DIJKSTRA'S, and BARNETT'S, may be considered almost to agree...|$|E
