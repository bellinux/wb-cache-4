5|$|In {{geographic}} information systems, flow networks (such as the networks showing how water flows {{in a system}} of streams and rivers) are dual to cellular networks describing drainage divides. This duality can be explained by modeling the flow network as a spanning tree on a grid graph of an appropriate scale, and modeling the drainage divide as <b>the</b> <b>complementary</b> spanning tree of ridgelines on the dual grid graph.|$|E
5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes <b>the</b> <b>complementary</b> strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E

5|$|From the beginning, Welensky was {{involved}} {{in the creation of the}} Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. He had earlier wanted an amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia with a constitution similar to that of Southern Rhodesia (that had granted responsible government to the white Rhodesians). After the British Government rejected this idea, he set about the creation of a federation, and against his judgement, the small colony of Nyasaland was included. His main wish for amalgamation, and later federation, was primarily so <b>the</b> <b>complementary</b> economic strengths of the Rhodesias could be put to best use. He felt that the colonies were missing out on the post-war economic boom.|$|E
5|$|Polymerases are {{enzymes that}} {{synthesize}} polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates. The sequence {{of their products}} is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called templates. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ hydroxyl group {{at the end of}} the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize <b>the</b> <b>complementary</b> strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.|$|E

The museum won the Building Award in the 2003 British Construction Industry Awards, and was shortlisted for the 2004 Stirling Prize. The museum received a largely positive critical reception, with reviewers remarking on the metaphorical power of the building, <b>the</b> <b>complementary</b> effects of the museum's main exhibition with its internal architecture, and the economy with which the museum was built. In August 2005 Imperial War Museum North received its millionth visitor. The museum was, however, criticised in 2008 by The Guardian for poor energy efficiency, as part of a report into the carbon dioxide emissions of UK public buildings.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to <b>the</b> <b>complementary</b> strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E
5|$|Translation is {{the process}} by which a mature mRNA {{molecule}} is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by <b>the</b> <b>complementary</b> codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.|$|E

40|$|The {{replication}} of the circular double-stranded bacteriophage φX 174 replicative form DNA was studied by structural analysis of pulse-labelled replicative intermediates. Evidence is presented that φX replicative form replicates {{according to a}} rolling circle model proposed by Dressler & Wolfson (1970). Replication involves continuous elongation of the viral strand component of replicative form resulting in the displacement of a single-stranded tail of increasing length. Replicative intermediates sedimenting at 27 to 28 s are found to contain linear viral strands of approximately double φX unit length. The synthesis of <b>the</b> new <b>complementary</b> strand on <b>the</b> single-stranded viral tail appears to be initiated with considerable delay and converts the tail to double-stranded DNA. At some time, but before <b>the</b> new <b>complementary</b> strand is completed, the replicative intermediates split to give consequently one replicative form molecule containing <b>the</b> old <b>complementary</b> and <b>the</b> new viral strand and a linear partially double-stranded tail which matures to replicative form by circularization and completion of <b>the</b> new <b>complementary</b> strand...|$|R
40|$|Reciprocity {{laws and}} their residue symbols have {{applications}} {{not only in}} number theory but also in other fields like cryptography. In their effort to develop cryptosystems with security equivalent {{to the difficulty of}} integer factorization, mathematicians utilized these objects to develop such schemes in cyclotomic fields of degree λ− 1, where λ = 2, 3, and 5. A crucial part of such schemes is an efficient and fast residue symbol algorithm. Such algorithms were devised for λ = 2, 3, 5 but not for 7. Here we develop a fast and efficient residue symbol algorithm for λ = 7. We accomplish this by giving explicit conditions on integers in Q(ζ) (with ζ a primitive 7 th root of unity) to be primary, by formulating explicit forms of <b>the</b> <b>complementaries</b> to Kummer’s 7 th degree reciprocity law, and by using the norm-Euclidean algorithm in Q(ζ).
