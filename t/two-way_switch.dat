Here {{we present a}} scheme of nonreciprocal quantum state conversion between microwave and optical photons via an optomechanical interface. By introducing an auxiliary cavity and manipulating the phase differences between the linearized optomechanical couplings, uni-directional state transmission can be achieved. The interface can function as an isolator, a circulator, and a <b>two-way</b> <b>switch</b> that routes the input states to a selected output channel. We show that under a generalized impedance matching condition, the state conversion can reach high fidelity and is robust against the thermal fluctuations in the mechanical mode.

40|$|Blood {{clotting}} is {{a precise}} cascade engineered {{to form a}} clot with temporal and spatial control. Current control of blood clotting is achieved predominantly by anticoagulants and thus inherently one-sided. Here we use a pair of nanorods (NRs) to provide a <b>two-way</b> <b>switch</b> for the blood clotting cascade by utilizing their ability to selectively release species on their surface under two different laser excitations. We selectively trigger release of a thrombin binding aptamer from one nanorod, inhibiting blood clotting and resulting in increased clotting time. We then release the complementary DNA as an antidote from the other NR, reversing {{the effect of the}} aptamer and restoring blood clotting. Thus, the nanorod pair acts as an on/off switch. One challenge for nanobiotechnology is the bio-nano interface, where coronas of weakly adsorbed proteins can obscure biomolecular function.

40|$|Magnetotactic cocci swim {{persistently}} along local {{magnetic field}} lines in a preferred direction {{that corresponds to}} downward migration along geomagnetic field lines. Recently, high cell concentrations of magnetotactic cocci {{have been found in}} the water columns of chemically stratified, marine and brackish habitats, and not always in the sediments, as would be expected for persistent, downward-migrating bacteria. Here we report that cells of a pure culture of a marine magnetotactic coccus, designated strain MC- 1, formed microaerophilic bands in capillary tubes and used aerotaxis to migrate to a preferred oxygen concentration in an oxygen gradient. Cells were able to swim in either direction along the local magnetic field and used magnetotaxis in conjunction with aerotaxis, i. e., magnetically assisted aerotaxis, or magneto-aerotaxis, to more efficiently migrate to and maintain position at their preferred oxygen concentration. Cells of strain MC- 1 had a novel, aerotactic sensory mechanism that appeared to function as a <b>two-way</b> <b>switch,</b> rather than the temporal sensory mechanism used by other bacteria, including Magnetospirillum megnetotacticum, in aerotaxis.

40|$|Notch pathway is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved cell–cell communication mechanism governing cell-fate during {{development and}} tumor progression. It is activated when Notch receptor of one cell binds {{to either of}} its ligand—Delta or Jagged—of another cell. Notch–Delta (ND) signaling forms a <b>two-way</b> <b>switch,</b> and two cells interacting via ND signaling adopt different fates—Sender (high ligand, low receptor) and Receiver (low ligand, high receptor). Notch–Delta–Jagged signaling (NDJ) behaves as a three-way switch and enables an additional fate—hybrid Sender/Receiver (S/R) (medium ligand, medium receptor). Here, by extending our framework of NDJ signaling for a two-cell system, we show that higher production rate of Jagged, but not that of Delta, expands the range of parameters for which both cells attain the hybrid S/R state. Conversely, glycosyltransferase Fringe and cis-inhibition reduces this range of conditions, and reduces the relative stability of the hybrid S/R state, thereby promoting cell-fate divergence and consequently lateral inhibition-based patterns. Lastly, soluble Jagged drives the cells to attain the hybrid S/R state, and soluble Delta drives them to be Receivers. We also discuss the critical role of hybrid S/R state in promoting cancer metastasis by enabling collective cell migration and expanding cancer stem cell (CSC) population...|$|E

40|$|Printed {{electronics}} seek {{to replace}} {{a full range of}} conventional electronic components and circuits with their printed counterparts, and offer an extraordinary range of advantages in producing exible, low-cost, large area coverage, stretchable, wearable devices and circuits. We already witness the incredible advantages and extraordinary contribution of printed electronics in our daily lives, {{as well as in the}} cutting-edge printed electronics innovations and research available today. At an in-depth level, and as an important contribution to printed devices, this work presents the design, production, and characterization of a novel fully printed current-driven switch, referred to here as a Current Switching Transistor (CST). The CST possesses the unique ability to operate as a <b>two-way</b> <b>switch</b> for both direct (DC) and alternating current (AC). In this thesis, CSTs were successfully used for the fabrication of exible fundamental "AND" and "OR" logic gates. At the fundamental level, this work sets out to illustrate that, a printed nanostructured silicon layer could be used as the active material for current switching transistors and other electronic devices. Also investigated was the temperature dependence of the transfer characteristics, in an extended range of temperature from 340 to 10 K, as well as their reliability when subjected to a constant current bias stress. Significantly in this work, the switching behavior observed and the electrical properties of the CSTs produced using nanostructured silicon remained excellent at temperatures as low as 10 K. Such transistor performance demonstrates the transistor's high potential as the candidate for cryogenic applications. The transistor's mechanism of operation was shown to be based on the activated percolation of charge carriers through the network of particles in the active silicon layer. Additionally, this work shows that the ON/OFF ratio of the transistors was temperature dependent, yielding the highest value of 10 ³ achieved at cryogenic temperatures below 150 K. A reliability test achieved through bias stressing the base terminal, with a constant voltage of 52 V or a current of 75 μA for up to 6 hours at room temperature proved the devices to be highly stable. Except for the reversible shift in the switching voltage, which could be attributed to self-heating, no alteration of the device characteristics was observed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of secretory proteins at the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) {{depends on a}} ready supply of energy and metabolites {{as well as the}} close monitoring of the chemical conditions that favor oxidative protein folding. ER oxidoreductases and chaperones fold nascent proteins into their export-competent three-dimensional structure. Interference with these protein folding enzymes leads to the accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER lumen, causing an acute organellar stress that triggers the UPR (unfolded protein response). The UPR increases the transcription of ER chaperones commensurate with the load of newly synthesized proteins and can protect the cell from ER stress. Persistant stress, however, can force the UPR to commit cells to undergo apoptotic cell death, which requires the emptying of ER calcium stores. Conversely, a continuous ebb and flow of calcium occurs between the ER and mitochondria during resting conditions on a domain of the ER that forms close contacts with mitochondria, the MAM (mitochondria-associated membrane). On the MAM, ER folding chaperones such as calnexin and calreticulin and oxidoreductases such as ERp 44, ERp 57 and Ero 1 α regulate calcium flux from the ER through reversible, calcium and redox-dependent interactions with IP 3 Rs (inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphophate receptors) and with SERCAs (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases). During apoptosis progression and depending on the identity of the ER chaperone and oxidoreductase, these interactions increase or decrease, suggesting that the extent of MAM targeting of ER chaperones and oxidoreductases could shift the readout of ER–mitochondria calcium exchange from housekeeping to apoptotic. However, {{little is known about the}} cytosolic factors that mediate the on/off interactions between ER chaperones and oxidoreductases with ER calcium channels and pumps. One candidate regulator is the multi-functional molecule PACS- 2 (phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein- 2). Recent studies suggest that PACS- 2 mediates localization of a mobile pool of calnexin to the MAM in addition to regulating homeostatic ER calcium signaling as well as MAM integrity. Together, these findings suggest that cytosolic, membrane and lumenal proteins combine to form a <b>two-way</b> <b>switch</b> that determines the rate of protein secretion by providing ions and metabolites and that appears to participate in the pro-apoptotic ER–mitochondria calcium transfer...|$|E

Ce mémoire de thèse propose {{un ensemble}} de solutions nouvelles portant sur la problématique de l'isolement ultime de défauts "derniers secours" d'une part, et sur la connexion "automatique" et à faible "coût" d'un circuit en secours. L'objectif de cette approche globale est de concilier "sécurité électrique absolue" et "continuité de service" pour les systèmes de conversion sensibles devant être intégrés au coeur des applications critiques. Le premier chapitre et son annexe permettent de rappeler les causes et les conséquences des défauts internes au sein d'une structure de base d'onduleur à deux niveaux de tension, laquelle fait l'objet de nombreuses simulations de modes dégradés en configuration variateur de vitesse sur machine synchrone. De cette analyse il ressort qu'une structure d'isolement symétrique à deux voies couplées, placées sur les pôles du bus DC, à déclenchement spontané (fusible) et/ou commande (rupteur), est à même de sécuriser toutes les mailles du circuit, de façon modulaire et non intrusive. In all these traditional industries, or in more sensitive sectors and high technology, {{it appears that}} the safe operation of power systems becomes a critical and strategic area essential. In the area of application that focuses, design dependability and now rests primarily on an approach to reliability of components used, the use of close protection, monitoring alarms and management stop / reset / recovery. In our view, this approach is incomplete quickly when electrical safety and absolute continuity of a permanent mission should be carried out simultaneously in the presence of an internal failure of sensitive functions for low and medium power (eg, orders and bodies actuation of vehicles) or highly critical (nuclear). In this area, topologies and failure modes {{are at the heart of}} the problem. In this paper, we will focus primarily on the inverters and choppers structures at two levels of voltage (single-cell arm, < 1 kV), with simple configuration and multiphase parallel, although the concepts are presented, as examples, partially extrapolated to the structures of three voltage levels (arms multicellular) and rectifier (low-frequency phase control and high-frequency switching PWM). We will highlight the need to limit the intensity of these failures and to electrically isolate the defective cell and symmetrically of this inverter by multipole devices, passive or spontaneous breaking mixed cut ordered in the form of fuses integrated and distributed of multi-channel passive isolators, to imagine and develop. We will show that this process of isolation of the last backup is needed to connect, form series or parallel to the defective cell, a cell rescue in passive redundancy. The cell structure backup connection pooled by spontaneous (automatic) is especially promising as detailed in our eyes because of its simplicity and its integrability. Next, we present the isolation technologies fuse (not included, miniatures, CMS and multilayer chip fuse), their characteristics, their current limitations and operating in a switching cell test. A methodology and design of symmetrical two-way fuse (dual-fuse) on FR 4 PCB - Copper will be presented in Comsol and evaluated initially in static thermal IR. A passive <b>two-way</b> <b>switch,</b> relatively original material for integrating energy embedded in FR 4 substrate, will be presented and fully dimensioned plans on electrical, thermal and mechanical also using finite element simulations in Comsol. Another aspect of exploratory analysis, mainly experimental, or to characterize the failure modes of bullets and casings ultimate power compared between the technologies of encapsulation by epoxy resin (standard discrete case) and a silicone gel (module) is provided under conditions of stress controlled and reproducible. This step is necessary to characterize the resistive mode of a chip based on faulty stresses and stability over time of the residual strength according to the nature of the encapsulant, ie the very sustainability of this failure mode. A mixed-encapsulant resin - gel will be presented and characterized, providing an excellent compromise for medium power applications. Positive results and little known today, will allow us to exploit in the next chapter, this property of stable ohmic mode of the chip failed in a structure to aid automated connection series interesting. In the end, we will detail the demonstrator prototype and introduced to the context with which we will validate the isolation structures and prototypes fuses the property of stable ohmic mode highlighted in the aspect of technological analysis of selected devices.

We consider two transmission protocols, power splitting two-way relay (PS-TWR) and time <b>switching</b> <b>two-way</b> relay (TS-TWR) protocols. We present two explicit expressions for the system outage probability of the two protocols and further derive approximate expressions for them in high and low SNR cases. To explore the system performance limits, two optimization problems are formulated to minimize the system outage probability. Since the problems are nonconvex and have no known solution methods, a genetic algorithm- (GA-) based algorithm is designed. Numerical and simulation results validate our theoretical analysis. It is shown that, by jointly optimizing the time assignment and SWIPT receiver parameters, a great performance gain can be achieved for both PS-TWR and TS-TWR. Moreover, the optimized PS-TWR always outperforms the optimized TS-TWR in terms of outage performance. Additionally, the effects of parameters including relay location and transmit powers are also discussed, which provide some insights for the SWIPT-enabled two-way relay networks...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades the reactor {{dynamics}} code DYN 3 D was coupled to thermal hydraulics system codes, a sub-channel code and CFD codes. These earlier developed code systems allow modeling of the thermal hydraulics phenomena occurring during reactor transients and accidents in more detail. Nevertheless, none of these code systems include a sufficiently sophisticated fuel behavior model, which is able i. e. {{to take into account the}} fission gas behavior during normal operation, off-normal conditions and transients. Furthermore, no two-way coupling to a fuel performance code has so far been reported in the open literature for calculating a full core with detailed and well validated fuel behavior models. A new two-way coupling approach between DYN 3 D and the fuel performance code TRANSURANUS is presented. In the coupling, DYN 3 D provides the time-dependent rod power and thermal hydraulics conditions to TRANSURANUS, which in turn transfers parameters like fuel temperature and cladding temperature back to DYN 3 D. The main part of the development is a so-called general TRANSURANUS coupling interface that is applicable for linking of any other reactor dynamics codes, thermal hydraulics system codes and sub-channel codes to TRANSURANUS. Beside its generality, other features of this interface are the application at either fuel assembly or fuel rod level, one-way or <b>two-way</b> coupling, automatic <b>switch</b> from steady to transient conditions in TRANSURANUS (including update of the material properties etc.), writing of all TRANSURANUS output files and possibility of manual pre- and post-calculations with TRANSURANUS in standalone mode. The TRANSURANUS code can be used in combination with this coupling interface in various scenarios: different fuel compositions in the reactor types BWR, PWR, VVER, HWR and FBR, considering time scales from milliseconds (i. e. RIA) over seconds/ minutes (i. e. LOCA) to years (i. e. normal operation) and thence different reactor states. Results of DYN 3 D-TRANSURANUS are shown for a control rod ejection transient in a German PWR. In particular, it appears that for all burn-up levels the two-way coupling approach systematically calculates higher maximum values for the node fuel enthalpy (max. difference of 46 J/g) and node centerline fuel temperature (max. difference of 181 K), compared to DYN 3 D standalone in best estimate calculations. These differences can be completely explained by the more detailed TRANSURANUS modeling of fuel thermal conductivity, radial power density profile and heat transfer in the gap. As known from fuel performance codes, the modeling of the heat transfer in the gap is sensitive and causes also larger differences in case of low burn-up. No convergence problems occurred for DYN 3 D-TRANSURANUS. The coupled code system can improve the assessment of safety criteria, at a reasonable computational cost with a CPU time of less than seven hours without parallelization. JRC.
