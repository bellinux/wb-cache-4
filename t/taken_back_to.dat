5|$|In 1555 Spanish friar Domingo de Vico {{offended}} a local Ch'ol ruler and {{was killed}} by the Acala Ch'ol and their Lakandon allies.

5|$|She {{remained}} aground {{for almost}} a year, protected by temporary measures organised by Brunel and James Bremner. In August 1847, she was floated free {{at a cost of}} £34,000 and <b>taken</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Liverpool, but this expense exhausted the company's remaining reserves. After languishing at the North Dock for some time, she was sold to Gibbs, Bright & Co., former agents of the Great Western Steamship Company, for a mere £25,000.|$|E
5|$|Another {{individual}} {{known as}} Captain Haddock {{had lived in}} this period, who had commanded a fire ship, the Anne and Christopher. It was recorded by David Ogg that this captain and his ship had been separated from their squadron whilst out at sea and so docked at Málaga to purchase goods that could be <b>taken</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Britain and sold for a profit. For this action, Haddock was brought before an admiralty tribunal in 1674, where {{he was ordered to}} forfeit all profits from the transaction and suspended from his command for six months.|$|E
5|$|Captain Francis Laforey on Carysfort {{immediately}} {{attacked the}} larger ship {{and in an}} engagement lasting an hour and fifteen minutes successfully forced its captain to surrender, discovering a number of British prisoners of war below decks. Castor was subsequently <b>taken</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Britain and an extended legal case ensued between the Admiralty and Captain Laforey over the amount of prize money that should be awarded for the victory. Ultimately Laforey was successful, {{in part due to}} testimony from the defeated French captain, proving his case and claiming the prize money. The lawsuit did not harm Laforey's career and he later served at the Battle of Trafalgar and became a prominent admiral.|$|E

5|$|Corder was <b>taken</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Suffolk {{where he}} was tried at Shire Hall, Bury St Edmunds. The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because of the {{interest}} which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and admittance to the court was by ticket {{only because of the}} large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily through the crowds that had gathered around the door.|$|E
5|$|Directly after commissioning, König {{conducted}} sea trials, {{which were}} completed by 23 November 1914. Her crew consisted of 41 officers and 1,095 enlisted men. Afterward, {{the ship was}} attached to the V Division of the IIIBattle Squadron of the German High Seas Fleet, where she would later be joined by her sister ships. On 9 December, König ran aground in the Wilhelmshaven roadstead. Her sister ship Grosser Kurfürst, following right behind, rammed her stern and caused some minor damage. König was then freed from the bottom and <b>taken</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Wilhelmshaven; repair work lasted until 2 January 1915.|$|E
5|$|Drax's henchman Krebs {{is caught}} by Bond {{snooping}} through his room. Later, an attempted assassination by triggering a landslide nearly kills Bond and Brand, as they swim beneath the Dover cliffs. Drax takes Brand to London, where she discovers {{the truth about}} the Moonraker by comparing her own launch trajectory figures with those in a notebook picked from Drax's pocket. She is captured by Krebs, and finds herself captive in a secret radio homing station—intended to serve as a beacon for the missile's guidance system—in the heart of London. While she is being <b>taken</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Moonraker facility by Drax, Bond gives chase, but is also captured by Drax and Krebs.|$|E

5|$|Early in 197BC, Flamininus summoned Attalus to {{join him}} at Elateia (now in Roman hands) and from there they {{traveled}} together to attend a Boeotian council in Thebes to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war. At the council Attalus spoke first, reminding the Boeotians of the many things he and his ancestors had done for them, but during his address he stopped talking and collapsed, with {{one side of his}} body paralyzed. Attalus was <b>taken</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Pergamon, where he died {{around the time of the}} Battle of Cynoscephalae, which brought about the end of the Second Macedonian War.|$|E

Kertosudiro and Sukirah divorced early in Suharto's life and both later remarried. At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother, who had married a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies. In 1929, Suharto's father took him to live with his sister, who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low-yielding farming area near Wonogiri.

5|$|Following these massacres, the Maya {{governor}} of Oxkutzcab, Fernando Kamal, set out with 150 Maya archers to track AjK'in P'ol down. The captured Itza captain {{and his followers}} were <b>taken</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Spanish Captain Antonio Méndez de Canzo, interrogated under torture, tried, and executed. These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695. In the 1640s internal strife in Spain distracted the government from attempts to conquer unknown lands; the Spanish Crown lacked the time, money or interest in such colonial adventures {{for the next four}} decades.|$|E
