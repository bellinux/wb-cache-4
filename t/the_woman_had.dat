However, the patient herself could not recall the incident. Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky's claim, or weave it into their narrative.|$|E
5|$|Detectives {{noted in}} {{released}} court documents that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> “significant bruising to her upper arms consistent with being restrained” and “small abrasions to her knuckles that were scabbed over.” Wacław Kiełtyka told detectives he saw both Piotrowski and Więcek engaged in sex acts {{with the woman}} in the bathroom, while Łysejko and Więcek denied witnessing the incident, and Piotrowski refused comment.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Bavarian Administrative Court {{ruled that}} a woman working in a children's daycare centre, whose {{employment}} had been terminated when her ex-husband identified her as a Scientologist, should be reinstated. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> demonstrated to the court's satisfaction that her Scientological beliefs were irrelevant to her work.

5|$|Before Christmas' escape attempt, Hightower {{delivers}} Lena's {{child in}} the cabin where Brown and Christmas had been staying before the murder, and Byron arranges for Brown/Burch {{to come and see}} her. Brown deserts Lena once again, but Byron follows him and challenges him to a fight. Brown beats the braver, smaller Bunch, then skilfully hops a moving train and disappears. At the end of the story, an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to Tennessee, recounting that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> a child and the man was not the father. This was Lena and Byron, who were conducting a half-hearted search for Brown, and they are eventually dropped off in Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Major {{public works}} {{projects}} financed with deficit spending included {{the construction of a}} network of Autobahns and providing funding for programmes initiated by the previous government for housing and agricultural improvements. To stimulate the construction industry, credit was offered to private businesses and subsidies were made available for home purchases and repairs. On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 percent for each child born. The caveat that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> to remain unemployed was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.|$|E

The count of days begins when the woman first sees her menstrual blood, and ends twelve days later, or seven days after the flow ceases, whichever is later.|$|E

Finally she began a survey, asking female readers with exactly two children, {{at least one of}} them male, to give the sex of both children. Of the 17,946 women who responded, 35.9%, about 1 in 3, had two boys.|$|E
