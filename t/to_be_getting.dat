His manager at Cardiff Lennie Lawrence said that he {{expected}} Ledley <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> a full Wales call-up very shortly. In May, Wales manager John Toshack, when talking about the impact of captain Ryan Giggs retiring, said that he was hopeful for the future because Ledley along with other left-sided youngsters Gareth Bale and Lewin Nyatanga were all very talented players who could play for the national team for years to come.|$|E

25|$|Bishara Khader {{argues that}} this ambitious European project towards its Mediterranean {{neighbours}} {{has to be}} understood {{in a context of}} optimism. On the one hand, the European Community was undergoing important changes due to the reunification of Germany {{after the fall of the}} Berlin Wall in 1989 and the beginning of the adhesion negotiations of Eastern and Central European countries. On the other, the Arab–Israeli conflict appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> closer to achieving peace after the Madrid Conference (1991) and the Oslo Accords (1992). As well, Khader states that the Gulf War of 1991, the Algerian crisis (from 1992 onwards) and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism throughout the Arab world are also important factors in Europe's new relations with the Mediterranean countries based on security concerns.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the centuries}} {{since the first}} Zoroastrians arrived in India, the Parsis have {{integrated}} themselves into Indian society while simultaneously maintaining or developing their own distinct customs and traditions (and thus ethnic identity). This in turn has given the Parsi community a rather peculiar standing: they are Indians in terms of national affiliation, language and history, but not typically Indian in terms of consanguinity or ethnicity, cultural, behavioural and religious practices. However, after over a thousand years of admixture with the local population, they have been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> genetically closer to their locals than their Iranian ancestors. It has been stated {{that a majority of}} Parsis end up marrying outside the community due to the highly restricted standards of marriage and numbers in the community.|$|E
25|$|During {{the climb}} of the Col de Marie-Blanque, Dessel and Mercado again {{proved to be}} the strongest with Dessel coming through first as he had done on the two earlier climbs already: the polka dot jersey was his. Landaluze came closest to coming back as he was about 50 meters behind {{at some point during the}} descent, but the two leaders worked {{together}} not to let that happen. However, about 15 kilometres before the finish line, Mercado was hoping to make a deal with Dessel: since Dessel was going to be winning the yellow and polka dot jersey, he was hoping <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> the stage win from Dessel in return for helping him. However Dessel wanted it all, so Mercado stopped helping and Dessel had to maintain the lead by himself to prevent Landaluze from coming back. In the end, Mercado sprinted past Dessel about 300 metres from the finish and won the stage. Landaluze finished third about a minute behind. Moreni, Rinero, Isasi and Vasseur also managed to stay in front of the pelont, the others were caught.|$|E

25|$|A {{few weeks}} after the Woodward, Asmussen sent Gun Runner to California with {{assistant}} trainer Scott Blasi, exercise rider Angel Garcia and groom Gabino Gutierrez, allowing the horse time to acclimatize. The 2017 Breeders' Cup Classic was help on November 4 at Del Mar Racetrack. Going into the race, handicappers were divided over who was the best horse in North America. Arrogate's victory in the Dubai World Cup over Gun Runner had been ranked as the best performance of the year up to that point, but Arrogate had suffered two losses after returning to the United States. By contrast, Gun Runner had won three straight Grade I races and appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> stronger. Gun Runner was made the 9-5 morning-line favorite over Arrogate at 2-1 in a top quality field of eleven. By post time, the odds on Gun Runner had drifted out slightly to 2.4-1, making him the second betting choice. Collected, who had beaten Arrogate in the Pacific Classic earlier in the year, was the third choice.|$|E
25|$|On , John {{returned}} from the Hieronymites Monastery where he had lunched and retired to Bemposta Palace feeling poorly. He was racked for several days by symptoms including vomiting and convulsions. He appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> better, but by way of prudence designated his daughter, the infanta Isabel Maria, as regent. On the night of 9 March, he took {{a turn for the}} worse and died at approximately 5 a.m. on the 10th. The infanta immediately assumed the internal government of Portugal, and Pedro was recognized as the legitimate heir as Dom Pedro IV of Portugal. Doctors could not definitively determine a cause of death, but it was suspected that he had been poisoned. His body was embalmed and buried in the mausoleum of the kings of Portugal, the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza, in the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora. In the 1990s, a team of investigators exhumed the Chinese ceramic pot that contained his bowels. Fragments of his heart were rehydrated and submitted to an analysis that detected enough arsenic to kill two people, confirming longstanding suspicions of assassination by poison.|$|E

When he eagerly agrees, a flurry of equations and diagrams encircle him and fill his head with this information. Using white rats, a typewriter, and his own blood, among other tools and materials, Wilson creates a giant machine. The radio commends his work and tells him to pull the machine's switch. He hesitates, but at the radio's insistence, he does it; the machine rattles violently {{and a pair of}} ghostly arms whisk him into a different world while an apparition of Maxwell cackles.|$|E
