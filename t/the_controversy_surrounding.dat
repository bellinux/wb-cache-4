5|$|For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, {{the final}} tournament is rotated between confederations, {{allowing}} only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid {{to host the}} tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>surrounding</b> Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018. This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.|$|E

5|$|Sculpturally, Rodin {{possessed a}} unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply {{pocketed}} surface in clay. Many {{of his most}} notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory, modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. Rodin was sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>surrounding</b> his work, but refused to change his style.

5|$|The 1863 Salon des Refusés was {{the same}} {{exhibition}} where Édouard Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe caused a scandal, yet the attention given to Whistler's White Girl was even greater. <b>The</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>surrounding</b> the paintings was described in Émile Zola's novel L'Œuvre (1886). The reception Whistler's painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris. It was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter Gustave Courbet and the poet Charles Baudelaire. The art critic Théophile Thoré-Bürger {{saw it in the}} tradition of Goya and Velázquez. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>surrounding</b> the Rampart Dam project {{illustrated}} the growing {{shift in the}} environmental movement during the 1960s.

Though opposition to Rampart was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas.|$|E
