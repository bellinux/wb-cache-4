The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. ‘Stuff like that {{gets in the way}} of the story,' they were told.

2500|$|The third chapter, [...] "Making Magic: Training the Imagination", {{begins with}} Magliocco's {{assertion}} that the unifying feature of the Pagan movement is the ritual experiences that its practitioners undertake. Devoting {{the rest of the}} chapter to an examination of how Pagans [...] "conceive of and practice magic", she argues that they do not do so in order to escape rationality, but rather they adopt a belief in magic in order to reclaim [...] "traditional ways of knowing that privilege the imagination". Noting that within Paganism, artists are viewed as magicians, she suggests that magic should itself viewed as an art, with both having the goal of bringing about emotional reactions and changes of consciousness. Exploring the various different definitions of [...] "magic" [...] developed within anthropology, Magliocco notes that most contemporary North Americans equate [...] "magic" [...] with superstition and irrational behavior. She then looks at Pagan understandings of magic, highlighting that Pagans typically try to rationalize magic, viewing it as an energy force in an interconnected universe, one that must obey natural laws, rather than as some un-explainable [...] "supernatural" [...] force. Moving on, Magliocco discusses the Pagan concept of a sacred universe, looking at the veneration of the natural world and the celebration of seasonal Sabbats, and the relevance <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> for Pagan magical beliefs. Exploring Pagan ethics surrounding the practice of magic, in particular the Wiccan Rede and the Law of Threefold Return, Magliocco also studies the manner in which Pagans have re-adopted vernacular magic as a part of their religious practices.|$|E
