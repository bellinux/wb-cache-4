5|$|After {{the sharp}} fall in bond prices of 2013 ("taper tantrum"), investors {{continued}} {{to question the}} impact of rising rates on risk parity portfolios or other more concentrated equity portfolios. A historical analysis of episodes of rising rates show the value in distinguishing between orderly and disorderly rising rates regimes. Risk parity has weaker performance in disorderly rising rates environments but its performance over <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> dependent on falling bond yields.|$|E
5|$|In {{recreational}} diving terminology, in a {{bounce dive}} the diver descends {{directly to the}} maximum depth, spends very little time at maximum depth and ascends directly to the surface, preferably at an ascent rate recommended by the decompression model used, and making any necessary decompression stops. In commercial diving a bounce dive is any surface oriented dive, in which the diver is decompressed to surface pressure {{at the end of}} the dive and does not transfer to a hyperbaric habitat where the diver lives at pressure between dives and only decompresses at the end of a tour of duty. The duration of bottom <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> relevant in this usage.|$|E

5|$|Richelieu {{was laid}} down at Toulon in 1869 and {{launched}} on 3 December 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known, {{it was probably}} due to financial pressures caused by slashing of French Navy's budget which was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 coupled with the outdated work practices of the French dockyards at the time, which were not suitable for the Industrial Age. The ship began her sea trials on 12 April 1875, but did not begin her service with the Mediterranean Squadron, of which she became flagship, until 10 February 1876. She was placed in reserve on 3 December 1879.|$|E

5|$|Friedland {{was laid}} down at Lorient in January 1865 and {{launched}} on 15 October 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known, {{the budget for}} the French Navy was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and the French dockyards had not been reformed with working practices more suitable for the industrial age. The ship began her sea trials on 1 May 1875, but was not completed until 20 June 1877. Friedland joined the Mediterranean Squadron in 1878 and the ship bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax from 6–16 July 1881 {{as part of the}} French occupation of Tunisia. She was reduced to reserve in 1887 and decommissioned in 1893. Friedland returned to active duty in 1893, but was paid off in 1898 and condemned in 1902.|$|E

5|$|La Galissonnière {{was laid}} down at Brest on 22 June 1868 and {{launched}} on 7 May 1872. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known, {{the budget for}} the French Navy was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and the French dockyards had not been reformed with working practices more suitable for the industrial age. The ship began her sea trials on 20 April 1874 and was not commissioned until 18 July 1874. She became flagship of the Pacific Squadron on 16 May 1874 {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Perigot. She return to Brest on 19 March 1877, having circumnavigated the world via the Suez Canal. The ship was placed in reserve upon her return until she recommissioned on 15 August 1878 in preparation for a commission as flagship of the Caribbean Squadron which began on 6 October under Rear Admiral Peyron. Two years later she sailed to Cherbourg and was reduced to reserve on 13 May 1880.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{unresolved}} {{questions concerning the}} definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work. Non-work time should not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as housework. Dividing activities into free and dedicated <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering (various individuals {{may or may not}} classify such activities as leisure). The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers. Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure. Further, among some occupational communities, such as police officers or miners, it is common for work colleagues to be off-time friends and to share similar, work-based leisure activities.|$|E
5|$|Trident, {{named after}} the weapon that symbolized mastery of the seas, was laid down in April 1870 in Toulon and {{launched}} on 9 November 1876. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known, {{it is believed that}} reduction of the French Navy's budget after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and out-of-date work practices in French dockyards were likely causes. The ship was completed on 1 November 1878 and became the flagship of the second-in-command of the Mediterranean Squadron the following month. Trident, together with her sister ship , bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax on 15–16 July 1881 as the French occupied Tunisia. She was disarmed and placed in reserve in 1886–89, but was recommissioned on 17 February 1889 and resumed her role as flagship until she was again placed in reserve in 1894. The ship served as a gunnery training ship until she was condemned on 5 March 1900. Trident was renamed Var in 1904 and was sold for scrap five years later.|$|E

She was recommissioned as the flagship of the Pacific Squadron on 17 August 1878 {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Bergasse du Petit-Thouars. The ship participated in the pacification of the Marquesas Islands in 1880, which had been conquered by the admiral's uncle Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars forty years before. Victorieuse returned to Toulon on 23 May 1881.|$|E
