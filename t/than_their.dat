5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John {{is not entirely}} without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older <b>than</b> <b>their</b> synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible <b>than</b> <b>their</b> synoptic parallels.|$|E

5|$|Unlike galagos, {{which have}} longer legs than arms, slow lorises have {{arms and legs}} of nearly equal length. Their intermembral index (ratio of arm to leg length) averages 89, {{indicating}} that their forelimbs are slightly shorter <b>than</b> <b>their</b> hind limbs. As with the slender lorises, their arms are slightly longer <b>than</b> <b>their</b> body, but the extremities of slow lorises are more stout.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium has {{at least}} 20 {{metastable}} ("excited") isomers ranging in mass number from 78 to 102. Multiple excitation states have been observed for 80Y and 97Y. While most of yttrium's isomers {{are expected to be}} less stable <b>than</b> <b>their</b> ground state, 78mY, 84mY, 85mY, 96mY, 98m1Y, 100mY, and 102mY have longer half-lives <b>than</b> <b>their</b> ground states, as these isomers decay by beta decay rather than isomeric transition.|$|E

5|$|A broad {{operational}} definition is sometimes used {{to encompass the}} complexity of these diverse phenomena, where a gene {{is defined as a}} union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. This definition categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or RNA) rather <b>than</b> <b>their</b> specific DNA loci, with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions.|$|E

5|$|Another source may be Aesop's Fables as {{published}} by William Caxton—scholar John MacQueen considers this {{more likely than}} Disciplina clericalis—although the tale itself is not Aesopic but rather of the beast fable (also beast-epic) genre. The plots of such works are more complicated <b>than</b> <b>their</b> Aesopic counterpart, tend more towards ribaldry, and feature the fox making {{a victim of the}} wolf.|$|E
5|$|As Jake {{attempts}} {{to book a}} gig, the mystery woman blows up the phone booth he is using; once again, he is miraculously unhurt. The band stumbles into a gig at Bob's Country Bunker, a local honky-tonk.

5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather <b>than</b> <b>their</b> muscles.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{this ability}} to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger <b>than</b> <b>their</b> mouths. Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{external}} walls and those around the keep were fitted with merlons and parapets, with the parapets of the keep positioned 6.5 meters higher <b>than</b> <b>their</b> counterparts along {{the external}} wall. This {{was done to}} establish a secondary defensive line that enabled the building's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached the external walls. The core building {{was linked to the}} external fortifications by corridors and chambers.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have very}} large aspect ratio, i.e., their length {{is much larger}} <b>than</b> <b>their</b> diameter. Consequently, as expected from the classical electromagnetic theory, elastic light scattering (or Rayleigh scattering) by straight CNTs has anisotropic angular dependence, and from its spectrum, the band gaps of individual nanotubes can be deduced.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the 1st and 2nd centuries, the 3rd and 4th centuries saw {{much greater}} {{fortification}} activity, with many new forts built. Later Roman fortifications, both new and upgraded old ones, contained much stronger defensive features <b>than</b> <b>their</b> earlier counterparts. In addition, the late 3rd/4th centuries saw the fortification of many {{towns and cities}} including the City of Rome itself and its eastern sister, Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Compile-time {{performance}} is generally worse in aspect weavers <b>than</b> <b>their</b> traditional compiler counterparts {{due to the}} additional work necessary for locating methods which match the specified pointcuts.
