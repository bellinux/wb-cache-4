The following year she was towed up the James River and moored at Brandon, Virginia. Manhattan {{was transferred}} to City Point, Virginia in 1881 and then to Richmond, Virginia.

5|$|Prior to the storm's first {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Florida, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings beginning on August29 for areas of Florida's east coast from Palm Beach south <b>to</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West,</b> while storm warnings were issued from Key West to Boca Grande on the peninsula's western coast. Electrical power was purposely stopped in Miami as a precautionary measure {{prior to the}} storm's landfall. Two Red Cross officials were sent to Miami to monitor the area during the storm's passage. Other relief agencies were also preparing supplies {{in the event of}} an emergency. In Pahokee and Belle Glade, an estimated 2,000people evacuated to Okeechobee, fearing a repeat of the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane.|$|E

War was declared in April 1898. Roosevelt resigned his post the next month, a move Long thought foolhardy but later acknowledged was significant in advancing Roosevelt's career.|$|E

5|$|Assigned to the Eastern Gulf Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral Theodorus Bailey, De Soto spent March and April fruitlessly {{cruising}} for CSS Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico. As {{one of the}} few fast steamers in Bailey's command, De Soto {{possessed a}} speed advantage over most of her blockade running prey. This was demonstrated on 24 April, when De Soto sailors boarded and seized two sloops, Jane Adelie and Bright, sixteen hours out of Mobile, Alabama, and each laden with cotton. Two schooners, General Prim and Rapid, were then taken the very next day, and they too carried cotton. All four prizes were sent <b>to</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West</b> for adjudication. On 27 April, De Soto continued the run of good luck, seizing the British schooner Clarita en route from Havana, Cuba to Matamoras.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish–American War in April 1898, Indiana was at Key West {{with the rest of the}} North Atlantic Squadron, at the time commanded by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson. His squadron was ordered to the Spanish port of San Juan in an attempt to intercept and destroy Admiral Cervera's Spanish squadron, which was en route to the Caribbean from Spain. The harbor was empty, but Indiana and the rest of the squadron bombarded it for two hours on 12 May 1898 before realizing their mistake. The squadron returned <b>to</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West,</b> where news arrived three weeks later that Commodore Schley's Flying Squadron had found Cervera and was now blockading him in the port of Santiago de Cuba.

5|$|Following her commissioning, Arkansas {{participated in}} a fleet review on 14 October 1912, for President William Howard Taft. The ship took Taft aboard that day {{for a trip to}} Panama to inspect the Panama Canal, which was still under construction. Arkansas began her {{shakedown}} cruise after delivering Taft and his entourage to the Canal Zone. On 26 December, she returned to the Canal Zone to take Taft <b>to</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West,</b> Florida. After completing the voyage, Arkansas was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and participated in fleet maneuvers off the east coast of the United States. Arkansass first overseas cruise, to the Mediterranean Sea, began in late October 1913. While there, she stopped in several ports, including Naples, Italy on 11 November, where the ship celebrated the birthday of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E
50|$|Gastrophryne carolinensis, {{the eastern}} narrow-mouthed toad, is {{a species of}} microhylid frog. It is a {{relatively}} small, toad-like amphibian found in damp, shady habitats. The species is highly fossorial, and feeds primarily on ants. These North American microhylids (Family: Microhylidae) are distinguished from true toads (genus Bufo), and other anurans by their moist, smooth skin, their lack of eardrums or tympana, their distinguishable squat body shape, and the unique fold of skin superior to their eyes. It {{is found in the}} United States, from southern Maryland <b>to</b> the Florida <b>Keys,</b> <b>west</b> <b>to</b> Missouri and Texas.

5|$|Governor Broward {{ran for the}} U.S. Senate in 1908 but lost. Broward and his predecessor, William Jennings, {{were paid}} by Richard Bolles to tour the state to promote drainage. Broward {{was elected to the}} Senate in 1910, but died before he could take office. He was eulogized across Florida for his {{leadership}} and progressive inspiration. Rapidly growing Fort Lauderdale paid him tribute by naming Broward County after him (the town's original plan had been to name it Everglades County). Land in the Everglades was being sold for $15 an acre a month after Broward died. Meanwhile, Henry Flagler continued to build railway stations at towns as soon as the populations warranted them. News of the Panama Canal inspired him to connect his rail line to the closest deep water port. Biscayne Bay was too shallow, so Flagler sent railway scouts to explore the possibility of building the line through to the tip of mainland Florida. The scouts reported that not enough land was present to build through the Everglades, so Flagler instead changed the plan to build <b>to</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West</b> in 1912.|$|E
5|$|The Weather Bureau {{predicted}} Flora {{to turn to}} {{the northwest}} after entering the Windward Passage and affect the Bahamas. Forecasters advised those in The Bahamas to quickly complete preparations, though the eye of the hurricane did not pass over the archipelago until four days later. When Flora turned to the northeast out to sea, forecasters again advised Bahamian citizens to prepare for the hurricane, and on October 9, weather advisories advised the southeastern Bahamas to prepare for gale-force winds and strong tides. One advisory considered there to be less than a 50% chance of the hurricane reaching southeastern Florida, though weather bulletins advised Florida citizens to monitor the hurricane. At its closest approach to Florida, the hurricane remained 330miles (530km) away, though gale warnings were issued from Stuart <b>to</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West</b> due to the hurricane's large size.|$|E
5|$|The monitor {{was briefly}} {{commissioned}} on 1 January 1871, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Commander Charles Love Franklin, and transferred <b>to</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West,</b> Florida to participate with the North Atlantic Squadron on coast defense maneuvers.

The ship was assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron and was based at Key West until she was decommissioned again on 27 July 1875 and laid up at Port Royal, South Carolina. Recommissioned on 5 November 1875, the ship remained at Port Royal until moved to the James River. She was moored at Brandon, Virginia and at City Point, Virginia, before being placed in ordinary at Richmond, Virginia on 30 June 1891.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} congress, tobacco workers {{initiated}} {{a series of}} strikes at three factories, one of which lasted {{through to the end}} of November. Later, in the summer of 1888, strikes by tobacco workers led to a lockout by factory owners in more than 100 factories. The Círculo de Trabajadores organized a collection drive to support the locked out workers, {{going so far as to}} send representatives <b>to</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West,</b> Florida to solicit donations from American tobacco workers. By October, the lockout was ended by factory owners agreeing to meet with workers in negotiations. The outcome of this situation was so favorable to the Alianza Obrera that the union saw its membership jump from 3,000 to 5,000 in the subsequent six months, making it the most powerful union in Cuba. The following year, Roig San Martín died at age 46, just days after his release from jail by the Spanish colonial government; his funeral was reportedly attended by 10,000 mourners. Just a few months later, in response to a lockout/strike in the tobacco industry, the colonial head Manuel Salamanca y Negrete closed the manufacturer's union, the Alianza Obrera and the Círculo de Trabajadores, although the four schools maintained by the Círculo were allowed to remain open, and the Círculo as a whole was allowed to reopen the following year by the new administration.|$|E
