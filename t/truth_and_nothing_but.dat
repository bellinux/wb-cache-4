2500|$|According to the {{redundancy}} {{theory of}} truth, asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself. [...] For example, making {{the assertion that}} [...] "'Snow is white' is true" [...] is equivalent to asserting [...] "Snow is white". [...] Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality. [...] This theory is commonly attributed to Frank P. Ramsey, who held {{that the use of}} words like fact <b>and</b> <b>truth</b> was <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a roundabout way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a [...] "linguistic muddle".|$|R

I will take a square resolution as soon as I receive Your Majesty's letter; but I swear int he name of my dead father that I will stay no longer in this revengeful country. The schooling ends on the 3rd of June, and I should wait for your answer in August, if at the end of this month I receive no answer, Your Majesty may calculate that I have no Country, I have no parents, and I have no king; I will be a roamer all the days of my life, like a Jew: I will come back to serve you as a souldier, and even as a shoeblacker; but I will never be a slave. Your Majesty may be sure that these words are as true as If I had my hands on the bible while writtin it, theirfore give me hope, and let me die in peace: I will repeat again, that my education is quite sufficient. I can come home alone, not as a child, but as a young man of 21 years old. I have the honor to wish his Majesty a prosperous reign and a long life.|$|R

[...] On the same day this report appeared, handbills were circulated asserting that the Rector of St Mary Magdalen had visited her and was satisfied that she was still a member of the Church of England.

[...] Ledinard asked Canning to confess but was told by Canning that [...] "I have said the whole <b>truth</b> in court, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> the truth; <b>and</b> I don't choose to answer any questions, unless it be in court again."

[...] Canning arrived in Wethersfield, Connecticut, and by arrangement with her supporters went to live with the Methodist Reverend Elisha Williams.
