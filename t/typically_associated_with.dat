5|$|The {{sculptured}} puffball grows solitarily or {{in small}} groups in forest duff. It is <b>typically</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> coniferous forests at high elevations, greater than about , on western mountains like the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range. The United States distribution includes the states of California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. An uncommon species, it fruits throughout spring, summer, and fall during wet weather.|$|E

50|$|For most {{rank and}} file members of the Allgemeine-SS, the Sturm level was the highest which the {{ordinary}} SS member would <b>typically</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with.</b> The Sturm itself was further divided into platoon sized Truppen (sometimes known as Zug) which were in turn divided into squad sized Scharen. For larger Allgemeine-SS commands, the Scharen would be further divided into Rotte which were the Allgemeine-SS equivalent of a fire team.|$|R
5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more <b>typically</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} an abnormally narrow cervical canal, <b>typically</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated {{with the development of}} cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E
5|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS or DNS), {{also known}} as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused {{by the presence of}} all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is <b>typically</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> physical growth delays, characteristic facial features and mild to moderate intellectual disability. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely.|$|E
30|$|Omental cakes <b>typically</b> are <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> ovarian carcinoma, {{as this is}} {{the most}} common {{malignant}} aetiology. Nonetheless, numerous other neoplasms, as well as infectious and benign processes, can produce omental cakes.|$|R

50|$|The Proteus effect {{describes}} a phenomenon {{in which the}} behavior of an individual, within online virtual worlds, is changed by the visual characteristics of their avatar. This change {{is due to the}} individual's knowledge about the behaviors that other users who are part of that virtual environment <b>typically</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> those characteristics. Like the adjective protean (meaning versatile or mutable), the concept's name is an allusion to the shape changing abilities of the Greek god Proteus. The Proteus effect was first introduced by researchers Nick Yee and Jeremy Bailenson at Stanford University in June 2007.|$|R
5|$|Stout, {{a kind of}} porter beer, {{particularly}} Guinness, is <b>typically</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> Ireland, although historically it {{was more}} closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. Cider, particularly Magners (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as Bulmers), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.|$|E
5|$|The keep {{is unusual}} {{both for the}} period and for Devon as a whole, being a very strong {{defensive}} structure, albeit without any independent source of water or facilities to support a garrison {{in the event of}} a siege. Other rectangular 11th century keeps in Devon existed, including at Exter and Lydford, and were <b>typically</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the king or major nobles. Few were built on top of fresh mottes, as at Okehampton, and this may have been made possible in this case because the motte was largely natural and therefore able to support the heavy weight.|$|E
5|$|The park is {{a public}} area and {{has a variety of}} {{activities}} that are <b>typically</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> protected areas meant to be visited by the public. During the warmer months, picnicking, camping, lodging, hiking, and fishing are available. During the winter, cross-country skiing trails open, and other activities such as camping remain available as well. The lodge and cabins are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The 25 cabins are operated by a privately owned entity, the White Pines Inn, and the lodge features a popular private restaurant.|$|E

The null pronoun PRO is an element that impacts a sentence in a similar manner to how a normal pronoun impacts a sentence, but the null pronoun is unaudible. [...] The null PRO is added to the predicate, where it occupies the position that one would <b>typically</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> an overt subject (if one were present). The following trees illustrate PRO in both constituency-based structures of phrase structure grammars and dependency-based structures of dependency grammars: ...|$|R
30|$|The early {{dolomite}} crystals occur dominantly as microcrystalline grains <b>typically</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> biotite lamellae. The biotite lamellae {{appear to}} have been replaced, dilated, and intermittently nesting and impregnating the derivative framboidal pyrite or microcrystalline dolomite crystals (Fig. 3 g-h). The late authigenic dolomite, very similar to the late calcite, occurs as the macrocrystalline blocky cement which sporadically appears in both ferrous and non-ferrous compositions and dominantly fills the intergranular pores reduced by the ensuing compaction. Sparcely, the late dolomite cement also appears to have replaced the calcite and plagioclase grains and wrapped the overgrowths of albite and quartz grains and the kaolinite aggregates.|$|R
40|$|Although {{microbes}} <b>typically</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> surfaces, detailed {{observations of}} surface-associated microbes on natural substrata are technically challenging. We herein introduce a flow channel device named the Stickable Flow Device, which is easily configurable and deployable on various surfaces for the microscopic imaging of environmental microbes. We demonstrated {{the utility of}} this device by creating a flow channel on different types of surfaces including live leaves. This device enables the real-time imaging of bacterial biofilms and their substrata. The Stickable Flow Device expands the limits of conventional real-time imaging systems, thereby contributing to {{a deeper understanding of}} microbe-surface interactions on various surfaces...|$|R
5|$|The {{preferred}} habitats of the Bengal slow loris range across tropical and subtropical regions, {{and include}} evergreen and semi-evergreen rainforests with forest edges and continuous, dense canopies. It {{can also be}} found in bamboo groves. It prefers habitats with larger diameter, tall trees with a large crown depth (defined as the length along the main axis from the tree tip {{to the base of the}} crown); these areas are <b>typically</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> greater food abundance, and decreased risk of predation. Because of its preference for dense forests, it acts as a good indicator of the ecosystem's health.|$|E
5|$|The site of S.iniae {{infection}} and its clinical presentation vary from species to species. In tilapia, S.iniae causes meningoencephalitis, with symptoms including lethargy, dorsal rigidity, and erratic swimming behavior; death follows {{in a matter}} of days. In rainbow trout, it is <b>typically</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> septicemia and central nervous system damage. Symptoms are consistent with septicemia, and include lethargy and loss of orientation (as in tilapia), exophthalmia, corneal opacity, and external and internal bleeding.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor <b>typically</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.|$|E

40|$|We present novel {{methods to}} {{construct}} compact natural language lexicons within a graphbased semi-supervised learning framework, an attractive platform suited for propagating soft labels onto new natural language types from seed data. To achieve compactness, we induce sparse measures at graph vertices by incorporating sparsity-inducing penalties in Gaussian and entropic pairwise Markov networks constructed from labeled and unlabeled data. Sparse measures are desirable for high-dimensional multi-class learning {{problems such as}} the induction of labels on natural language types, which <b>typically</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> only a few labels. Compared to standard graph-based learning methods, for two lexicon expansion problems, our approach produces significantly smaller lexicons and obtains better predictive performance. ...|$|R
50|$|Dendrin mRNA {{levels are}} {{increased}} with nicotine use in adolescent rat brains; however, these same levels of protein {{do not change}} in adults rats. It {{has also been shown}} that dendrin expression is not altered by cocaine or by placing the subject in a new or different environment. The proteins that dendrin <b>typically</b> <b>associates</b> <b>with</b> tend to be proteins that are linked to synaptic modification and learning. Expression of dendrin with even a small amount of nicotine could alter these processes and functions. Increased expression of dendrin caused by nicotine use is found mostly in the forebrain region of rats. Additional increase in dendrin mRNA is also found in the striatum.|$|R
