5|$|By 1952, <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> {{had become}} a burden to Olga and her husband. They were both elderly; their sons had moved away; labor was hard to come by; the Colonel {{suffered}} increasing ill-health, and some of Olga's remaining jewelry was stolen. <b>The</b> <b>farm</b> was sold, and Olga, {{her husband and her}} former maid, Mimka, moved to a smaller five-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, Cooksville, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto now amalgamated into the city of Mississauga. Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid, and Olga nursed her until Mimka's death on 24 January 1954.|$|E
5|$|Cattle {{were raised}} at <b>the</b> <b>farm.</b> Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun {{to show what}} quality of steak the animal would {{eventually}} produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something he loved to do on <b>the</b> <b>farm),</b> he {{made the mistake of}} announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.|$|E
5|$|His father, disapproving of Darling's {{fondness for}} sport, sent {{him away from}} his cricket and Australian rules {{football}} teams to spend twelve months at Roseworthy Agricultural School. Later, Darling worked in a bank for a time and before his father appointed him manager of one of a wheat farm. Working on <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> added size and strength to an already stocky and athletic frame. He was selected for the South Australian team at age 19, but his father would not allow him time off <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> to play.|$|E

50|$|Montgomery Village {{was created}} in 1962 by Kettler Brothers, Inc. The vision for a planned {{community}} in Gaithersburg is credited to architect Charles Kettler, who incorporated Kettler Brothers with his brothers Milton and Clarence in 1952. The first land purchase was <b>the</b> Walker <b>Farm</b> in 1962. Subsequent purchases were <b>the</b> Thomas <b>Farm,</b> <b>The</b> Mills <b>Farm,</b> <b>The</b> French <b>Farm,</b> <b>The</b> Patton <b>Farm,</b> <b>The</b> Fulks <b>Farm,</b> <b>The</b> Wilson <b>Farm,</b> and <b>The</b> James Walter Deppa property. <b>The</b> Walker <b>Farm</b> was <b>the</b> largest of all the properties the Kettlers bought.

Jemima sets about her errand, but <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> collie, Kep, meets her as she carries onions from <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> kitchen and asks her what she is doing and where she keeps going. She reveals her errand, Kep sees through the fox's plan at once, and finds out from Jemima where the fox lives.|$|E

The three books are Shattered Peace, A Clan in Need, and The Heart of a Warrior, which were released on 3 August 2010.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>farms</b> in 1997 {{went through}} a variety of changes. First, <b>the</b> <b>farms</b> expansion, begun in 1996, was completed. This boosted the {{computing}} capacity to something like 20, 000 MIPS (where a MIP is a unit defined by running a program, TINY, on the machine and comparing the machine performance to a VAX 11 / 780). In SpecInt 92, it would probably rate close to 40, 000. The use of <b>the</b> <b>farms</b> was not all that large. The fixed target experiments were not generally in full production in 1997, but spent time tuning up code. Other users processed on <b>the</b> <b>farms,</b> but tended to come and go and not saturate the resource. Some of <b>the</b> old <b>farms</b> were retired, saving the lab money on maintenance and saving <b>the</b> <b>farms</b> support staff effort...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of gastrointestinal protozoa was studied in suckling piglets, fatteners and sows coming from 8 organic farms, 19 hobby farms and 3 forest/nature <b>farms.</b> On <b>the</b> hobby <b>farms</b> and <b>the</b> forest/nature <b>farms</b> <b>the</b> pigs {{were of the}} Bentheim Black Pied breed. The prevalence was determined using faecal microscopic examination of pooled samples. Infections with Balantidium coli, Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp were not found. Infections with coccidia were found on 75 % of <b>the</b> organic <b>farms,</b> on 33 % of <b>the</b> forest/nature <b>farms</b> and on 53 % of <b>the</b> hobby <b>farms.</b> In <b>the</b> fatteners, the highest prevalence was on <b>the</b> hobby <b>farms</b> (75 %). In the sows, the highest prevalence was found on <b>the</b> organic <b>farms</b> (86 %). <b>The</b> number of examined suckling piglets was very low, so percentages from 43 % up to 100 % (1 sample) were found. <b>The</b> <b>farms</b> which had 2 pigs present (Bentheim Black Pied) had a significantly lower {{prevalence of}} coccidial infections, compared to <b>the</b> <b>farms</b> with 3 - 9 animals and farms with > 100 animals present. <b>The</b> <b>farms</b> with over 100 pigs present were <b>the</b> organic <b>farms.</b> No clinical signs were reported...|$|R
5|$|The Briarcliff Farms office, Walter Law's {{personal}} office, {{was also}} the first dairy building; it burned down in 1901, and was rebuilt the following year. From Briarcliff Manor's 1902 incorporation to the construction of its first municipal building in 1913, the office housed the village government. During the 1960s the building was redesigned, rebuilt and became a local union headquarters for the International Union of Operating Engineers. <b>The</b> <b>farm</b> was enclosed, and its pastures were divided by stone walls from within the farm; the stones were also used for roadbeds, and for walls of <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> buildings, office, and Law's house.|$|E
5|$|The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter. It was first published by Frederick Warne & Co. in July 1908. Potter composed the book at Hill Top, a working farm in the Lake District she bought in 1905. Following the purchase, her works began to focus on country and village life, incorporating large casts of animal characters and sinister villains. Jemima Puddle-Duck was the first of her books set wholly at <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> with background illustrations based on <b>the</b> <b>farm</b> buildings and yard, and nearby locales.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>farm</b> {{combined}} {{a practical}} American business model {{with the concept}} of a European country seat or manor, with cows being milked constantly, and with milk promptly chilled and bottled within five minutes, and shipped to stores in New York City each night. <b>The</b> <b>farm</b> was progressive, with sterile conditions, numerous employee benefits, good living conditions for livestock, and regular veterinary inspections to maintain a healthy herd. <b>The</b> <b>farm</b> also made use of tenant farming, established working blacksmith, wheelwright, and harness shops on-site, was located around Walter Law's manor house, and constructed numerous buildings in the Tudor Revival architectural style.|$|E
50|$|One of <b>the</b> local <b>farms</b> {{gave its}} name to the entire area. Many of <b>the</b> <b>farms</b> located on Konnerud have names that ends with rud (mean clearing). It is {{generally}} believed that <b>the</b> <b>farms</b> located near Konnerud date from 1100 - 1400.|$|R

While <b>the</b> government can contribute to this by improving transport infrastructure within <b>the</b> <b>farming</b> villages, <b>the</b> technology producers and marketers have the most important role of setting up distribution outlets closer to <b>the</b> <b>farming</b> communities. Local farmer organizations may also contribute through bulk buying of the improved technologies and directly supplying the same to the members in appropriate quantities.|$|R

5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{remedy for}} farmers of pollinated crops {{is simply to}} switch from using beekeepers {{to the use of}} native bees, such as bumble bees and mason bees.
