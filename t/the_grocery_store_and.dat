5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

500|$|At {{approximately}} 4:30pm the twister, which witnesses {{described as}} a [...] "mass of blowing dust" [...] or [...] "rolling fog bank" [...] entered Comfrey, a town of 550people located in both Cottonwood and Brown Counties. Comfrey's fire chief saw the tornado while storm spotting and ordered the town's sirens activated. The tornado moved {{through the center of}} Comfrey one minute after the sirens went off, and destroyed a grain elevator, the town hall, three of the town's four churches, <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store,</b> <b>and</b> most of the main street businesses downtown. The town's firehouse collapsed, and the school was heavily damaged. Of the 200houses in the town, all but 15suffered damage. Fifty of those homes were destroyed and as a result 100people were left homeless. Approximately 75% of the buildings in Comfrey were damaged or destroyed.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1990s, Chinatown {{has been}} {{struggling}} to redefine itself {{in the face of}} an ageing Chinese population and the declining number of tourists visiting the enclave. As the ageing population shrank, revenues of businesses in the neighbourhood also decreased. While the majority of <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> shops remain, most of the once-famed restaurants on Dundas Street West, especially the barbecue shops located below grade, have closed since 2000.|$|R

5000|$|In 1899, Carl Swanson {{became a}} partner with John O. Jerpe in a small {{wholesale}} company. Jerpe Commission Company purchased eggs and cream from local farmers which they processed and sold. In 1905, Swanson bought the company from Jerpe under a partnership with John Hjerpe and Frank Ellison. They operated a commission business hauling eggs, milk and poultry they bought from local farmers and selling them to <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> hotels in Omaha, Nebraska. The enterprise was eventually incorporated. Frank Ellison died in 1918 and John Hjerpe in 1928. After John Hjerpe's death, Swanson became the sole owner of the corporation.|$|R
60|$|It {{would not}} be exact to say that, after some weeks {{of this sort of}} campaigning, Mr. Crewe was discouraged, for such writhe {{vitality}} with which nature had charged him {{that he did not know}} the meaning of the word. He was merely puzzled, as a June-bug is puzzled when it bumps up against a wire window-screen. He had pledged to him his own gardener, Mrs. Pomfret's, the hired men of three of his neighbours, a few modest souls who habitually took off their hats to him, and Mr. Ball, of the village, who sold groceries to Wedderburn and was a general handy man for the summer people. Mr. Ball was an agitator by temperament and a promoter by preference. If you were a summer resident of importance and needed anything from a sewing-machine to a Holstein heifer, Mr. Ball, the grocer, would accommodate you. When Mrs. Pomfret's cook became inebriate and refractory, Mr. Ball was sent for, and enticed her to the station and on board of a train; when the Chillinghams' tank overflowed, Mr. Ball found the proper valve and saved the house from being washed away. And it was he who, after Mrs. Pomfret, took the keenest interest in Mr. Crewe's campaign. At length came one day when Mr. Crewe pulled up in front of <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> called, as his custom was, loudly for Mr. Ball. The fact that Mr. Ball was waiting on customers made no difference, and presently that gentleman appeared, rubbing his hands together.|$|E

50|$|Mass {{customization}} has {{not taken}} place in most areas of the economy. Mass customization has ruled the food & beverage industry for years. Look at how many choices {{we are faced with}} in <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> supermarkets. Brand extension and dilution are ways companies have sold more under various names, giving us thousands of choices. Most consumption continues to be passive as critics of television, recorded music, and fast food would argue. Indeed, people are generally uninterested in going to the effort of customizing the myriad products that comprise modern consumer culture. In The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less, Barry Schwartz argues that diminishing returns from a confusing abundance of consumer choice is producing stress and dissatisfaction.3 Still, one key area of high-customization is taking place: highly involved hobbyists.|$|R
