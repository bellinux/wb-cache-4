5|$|A test {{series was}} planned to {{determine}} RS-25 engine performance with: the new engine controller unit; lower liquid oxygen temperatures; greater inlet pressure {{due to the}} taller SLS core stage liquid oxygen tank and higher vehicle acceleration; and, more nozzle heating due to the four-engine configuration and its position in-plane with the SLS booster exhaust nozzles.

On Earth, the starship Enterprise is undergoing a major refit; her former commanding officer, James T. Kirk, has been promoted to Admiral and works in San Francisco as Chief of Starfleet Operations.

5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism. After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested.</b>|$|E

The first six spans passed without problems, but under load the seventh span collapsed, {{bringing}} down the eighth and final span, leaving the pier head and pavilion standing.|$|E

A letter from O'Reilly to Melish on June 18 reports that after some modification, Sinnock wrote that the coin was at the very limit of high relief that the mint could coin, and that dies for the Cincinnati piece were expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> by coining trial strikes in early July.|$|E

The Heritage Lottery Fund provided £680,000 towards {{the cost of the}} project, with other grants coming from the London Legacy Development Corporation and the Inland Waterways Association. As well as acting as a lock, the radial gates allow water to be distributed around the Bow Back Rivers for flood prevention purposes. The gates were due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> during the summer months, with a formal opening scheduled for the East London Waterways Festival in August.

The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas.
