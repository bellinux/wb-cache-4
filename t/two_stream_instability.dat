40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{evolution of}} the electrostatic waves observed during the AMPTE (Active Magnetosphere Particle Tracer Explorers) solar wind releases is investigated. Previous linear studies indicate two distinct sets of instabilities {{may be responsible for}} the generation.

To establish which set of instabilities is more viable a detailed linear Vlasov theory has been conducted by numerically solving the full electromagnetic dispersion relation. In addition both the plasma wave as well as the magnetic field measurements by the IRM (Ion Release Module) spacecraft were used to correlate the frequency {{and the power of the}} observed waves with the magnitude and the direction of the solar wind magnetic field.

40|$|Abstract. Parametric instabilities excited in ionospheric heating {{experiments}} are studied. The initial processes excited directly by HF heating (pump) waves include parametric decay instabilities, which decay the HF heating wave to a frequency-downshifted Langmuir/upper hybrid sideband {{together with an}} ion acoustic/lower hybrid wave as the decay mode, and oscillating <b>two</b> <b>stream</b> <b>instabilities,</b> which decay the HF heating wave to two oppositely propagating Langmuir/upper hybrid sidebands and a purely growing mode/field-aligned density irregularities. These instabilities provide effective channels to convert electromagnetic heating waves to electrostatic plasma waves in the F region of the ionosphere. The instability thresholds, growth rates, angular distribution, and regions of excitation are determined. The high frequency sidebands (Langmuir waves and upper hybrid waves) of the initial parametric instabilities can be driven to large amplitudes. These waves then become new pump waves to excite follow-up parametric instabilities, which provide cascade channels to broaden the spectra of plasma waves and generate short-scale density irregularities. The follow-up parametric instabilities include cascades of Langmuir pump waves into Langmuir sidebands and ion acoustic waves, and the filamentation of those hig...|$|R

40|$|Waves {{generated}} {{near the}} lower hybrid resonance frequency by the modified <b>two</b> <b>stream</b> <b>instability</b> have been invoked {{as a possible}} source of energy flux into the topside ionosphere of Venus. These waves are observed above the ionopause in a region known as the plasma mantle. The plasma within the mantle {{appears to be a}} mixture of magnetosheath and ionospheric plasmas. Since the magnetosheath electrons and ions have temperatures of several tens of eV, any instability analysis of the modified <b>two</b> <b>stream</b> <b>instability</b> requires the inclusion of finite electron and ion temperatures. Finite temperature effects are likely to reduce the growth rate of the instability. Furthermore, the lower hybrid waves are only quasi-electrostatic, and the energy flux of the waves is mainly carried by parallel Poynting flux.

40|$|We {{extend the}} simplex-in-cell (SIC) {{technique}} recently {{introduced in the}} context of collisionless dark matter fluids (Abel et al. 2012; Hahn et al. 2012) to the case of collisionless plasmas. The six-dimensional phase space distribution function f(x, v) is represented by an ensemble of three-dimensional manifolds, which we refer to as sheets. The electric potential field is obtained by solving the Poisson equation on a uniform mesh, where the charge density is evaluated by a spatial projection of the phase space sheets. The SIC representation of phase space density facilitates robust, high accuracy numerical evolution of the Vlasov-Poisson system using significantly fewer tracer particles than comparable particle-in-cell (PIC) approaches by reducing the numerical shot-noise associated with the latter. We introduce the SIC formulation and describe its implementation in a new code, which we validate using standard test problems including plasma oscillations, Landau damping, and <b>two</b> <b>stream</b> <b>instabilities</b> in one dimension.

40|$|International audienceAn {{efficient}} numerical method {{based on}} a probabilistic representation for the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations in the Fourier space has been derived. This has been done theoretically for arbitrary dimensional problems, and particularized to unidimensional problems for numerical purposes. Such a representation has been validated theoretically in the linear regime comparing the solution obtained with the classical results of the linear Landau damping. The numerical strategy followed requires generating suitable random trees combined with a Padé approximant for approximating accurately a given divergent series. Such series are obtained by summing the partial contributions to the solution coming from trees with arbitrary number of branches. These contributions, coming in general from multi-dimensional definite integrals, are efficiently computed by a quasi-Monte Carlo method. It is shown how {{the accuracy of the}} method can be effectively increased by considering more terms of the series. The new representation was used successfully to develop a Probabilistic Domain Decomposition method suited for massively parallel computers, which improves the scalability found in classical methods.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the {{observed}} large scale magnetic fields in the Universe is a mystery. The seed of these magnetic fields {{has been attributed to}} physical process in the early universe. In this work we provide a mechanism for the generation of a primordial magnetic field in the early universe via the Weibel instability in the quark gluon plasma. The Weibel instability occurs in the plasma if there is an anisotropy in the particle distribution function of the particles. In early universe, the velocity anisotropy required for Weibel instability to operate is generated in the quark gluon plasma by the collapse of closed Z(3) domain walls that arise in the deconfined phase of the QCD (above T∼ 200 MeV). Such large domains can arise in the context of certain low energy scale inflationary models. The closed domains undergo supersonic collapse and the velocity anisotropy is generated in the shocks produced {{in the wake of the}} collapsing domain walls. This results in a <b>two</b> <b>stream</b> Weibel <b>instability</b> in the ultra-relativistic quark gluon plasma. The instability in turn generates strong magnetic fields in the plasma.
