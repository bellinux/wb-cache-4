5|$|Initially, Chicago still {{preferred}} palazzo-styled {{buildings with}} large light {{courts in the}} centre, because they remained <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profitable</b> designs. The Wrigley Building, built under the 1920 law, demonstrated the effect of two ornamental towers {{on top of a}} skyscraper. Under the revised law, the Straus Building and the Pittsfield Building took the palazzo design and added somewhat stunted towers on top in the early 1920s, producing profitable buildings.|$|E

5|$|The meat of Highland cattle {{tends to}} be leaner than most beef because Highlands are largely {{insulated}} by their thick, shaggy hair rather than by subcutaneous fat. Highland cattle can produce beef at a reasonable profit from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>profitable</b> way to produce Highland beef is on poor pasture in their native land, the Highlands of Scotland. The meat is also gaining popularity in North America as the beef is low in cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} might {{account for}} consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ {{in their ability to}} use each foraging skill and stably specialize on <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profitable</b> one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profitable</b> skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E

Cui Shi's book provides descriptions of rituals for ancestor worship, festival and religious holiday celebrations, conduct for family and kinship relations, farmwork, and the schooling season for boys. Cui Shi's book also provides detailed instructions on which months were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profitable</b> times {{to buy and sell}} certain types of farm-produced goods.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep {{provide a}} wide array of raw materials. Wool {{was one of the first}} textiles, {{although}} in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies. Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation. In the 21st century, the sale of meat is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profitable</b> enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.|$|E

5|$|Saw {{was first}} {{screened}} on January 19, 2004. Lionsgate {{picked up the}} rights and released the film in the United States and Canada on October 29, 2004. Critical responses were generally mixed and divided, but the film gained a cult following. Compared to its low budget, Saw performed very well at the box office, grossing more than $100 million worldwide and becoming, at the time, one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profitable</b> horror films since 1996's Scream. The success of the film prompted a green-light of a sequel soon after Saw opening weekend, which was released the following October.|$|E
5|$|The public {{loved the}} film, with lines {{stretching}} outside of theaters as {{people had to}} wait for the next showing. This, along with box office numbers, led to a reconsideration of the film by critics, and it eventually received a very large amount of praise. It broke box-office records in Japan and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period. It was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profitable</b> black-and-white sound film ever made, and Hitchcock personally realized well in excess of $15 million. He then swapped his rights to Psycho and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of MCA, making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; however, this did not stop them from interfering with his later films. Psycho was, by a large margin, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>profitable</b> film of Hitchcock's career, earning over $12 million for the studio on release, and $15 million {{by the end of the}} year. Hitchcock's second most profitable was Family Plot ($7,541,000), and third place was a tie between Torn Curtain (1966) and Frenzy (1972), each earning $6,500,000. Around the time of the run's end, the film had grossed $32 million in domestic theaters.|$|E

The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers.

5|$|On 18 June, Braathens SAFE {{announced}} that starting on 27 October, the company put one aircraft into {{service on the}} route from Oslo to Stockholm.

The purchase of Transwede was confirmed on 25 June; Braathens SAFE bought 50% of the company's scheduled division, Transwede Airways, with an option to purchase the rest in 1997. The companies planned to integrate their networks, to allow connection between Braathens SAFE's and Transwede flights at Stockholm. Services to Stockholm started on 6 November; after three months, the airline had captured 14% of the Oslo–Stockholm market. In 1996, Braathens SAFE had a 51% domestic market share in Norway, transporting 9.5 million passengers.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>profitable</b> furs in the fur trade {{were those}} of sea otters, {{especially}} the northern sea otter which inhabited the coastal waters between the Columbia River {{to the south and}} Cook Inlet to the north. The fur of the Californian southern sea otter was less highly prized and thus less profitable. After the northern sea otter was hunted to local extinction, maritime fur traders shifted to California until the southern sea otter was likewise nearly extinct. The British and American maritime fur traders took their furs to the Chinese port of Guangzhou (Canton), where they worked within the established Canton System. Furs from Russian America were mostly sold to China via the Mongolian trading town of Kyakhta, which had been opened to Russian trade by the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta.|$|E
