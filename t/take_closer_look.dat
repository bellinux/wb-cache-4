40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{methods of}} calculating fractional differ-integrals numerically. We discuss extensively {{the pros and}} cons of applying the Riemann-Liouville formula, as well as direct approach in form of The Grünwald-Letnikov method. We <b>take</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> at the singularity, which appears when using classical form of Riemann-Liouville formula. To calculate Riemann-Liouville differ-integral we use very well-known techniques like The Newton-Cotes Midpoint Rule. We also use two Gauss formulas. By implementing transformation of the core integrand of Riemann-Liouville formula (we called it “the inverse transformation”), we would like to point the possible way of reducing errors when calculating it. The core of this pa-per is the subject of reducing the absolute error when calculating Riemann-Liouville differ-integrals of some elementary functions; we use our own C++ programs to calculate them and compare obtained results of all methods with, where possible, exact values, where not – with values obtained using excellent method of integration incorporated in Mathematica. We will not discuss complexity of numerical calculations. We will focus solely on minimization of the absolute errors. 1...|$|E

The thesis is composed of chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of freedom {{of expression}}. The general part (chapters II-IV) of the thesis deals with the theoretical view on the concept of freedom of expression, its historical and philosophical sources, as well as legal and judicial limits. Last but not least, it also explores the concept and functions of editorial cartoon as a satirical genre. If we <b>take</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look,</b> Chapter II looks at the freedom of expression from theoretical point of view providing historical and philosophical context, whereas Chapter III focuses on free speech limits in legal framework and case law.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we <b>take</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> at recent {{developments}} for the chase procedure, and provide additional results. Our analysis allows us create a taxonomy {{of the chase}} variations and the properties they satisfy. Two of the most central problems regarding the chase is termination, and discovery of restricted classes of sets of dependencies that guarantee termination of the chase. The search for the restricted classes has been motivated by a fairly recent result that shows that it is undecidable {{to determine whether the}} chase with a given dependency set will terminate on a given instance. There is a small dissonance here, since the quest has been for classes of sets of dependencies guaranteeing termination of the chase on all instances, even though the latter problem was not known to be undecidable. We resolve the dissonance in this paper by showing that determining whether the chase with a given set of dependencies terminates on all instances is coRE-complete. For the hardness proof we use a reduction from word rewriting systems, thereby also showing the close connection between the chase and word rewriting. The same reduction also gives us the aforementioned instance-dependent RE-completeness result as a byproduct. For one of the restricted classes guaranteeing termination on all instances, the stratified sets dependencies, we provide new complexity results for the problem of testing whether a given set of dependencies belongs to it. These results rectify some previous claims that have occurred in the literature. Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1303. 668...|$|E

40|$|On 1 November 1998 I {{observed}} a Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker {{along the north}} shore of Lake McConaughy in Keith County. Specifically, the bird was along the road of the Cedar Vue Recreation Area, just east of the main boat ramp. I studied and photographed the bird from 11 : 32 to 11 : 50 a. m. I was driving along the entrance road to Cedar Vue when I spotted a bird perched in a dead tree. As I approached the tree, I was thinking about stopping when the bird suddenly took flight. The flight silhouette resembled that of a flicker, although the undulating flight and slower wingbeats didn 2 ̆ 7 t seem quite right. The bird landed in a large pine tree not too off the road, so I decided to walk over and have a closer look. I was quite surprised when I discovered the bird was a nutcracker. The bird was roughly the size of a flicker, except that it was a bit chunkier. The head, underparts, and mantle were light gray. On a couple of occasions, I noted {{what appeared to be a}} light brown wash around the base of the bill. The eye was dark, and there was a faint white eye ring. The bill was black, stout at the base, and pointed. The legs were black. The wings were jet black except for a white patch along the trailing edge of the secondaries. The tail appeared black when the bird was perched, but in flight noted that the outer feathers were white. The flight was slow and undulating with deep wingbeats. In fact, it was the distinct flight behavior that caused me to <b>take</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> at the bird in the first place. I did not age the bird, although I wondered if it was an immature because of the appearance of some brown color on the face...|$|E
40|$|Reform of {{the school}} {{inspection}} system in Poland started in 2009 introducing the idea of evaluation to Polish schools. Three years of experience with that new approach to school inspection shows that still {{there is a lot}} of confusion and misunderstanding concerning the evaluation process. One of the possible explanations for those misunderstandings concerning evaluation in education is the communication process in which different actors use different meanings of basic concepts used. Authors of this paper suggest that it is worthy to <b>take</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> at school headteachers’ beliefs and assumption possible to uncover through metaphors used for description of evaluation. Those metaphors reflect and determine their style of thinking which influences both the evaluation process and school development based upon evaluation results. Metaphors help to explore unknown areas. At the same time, the commonly accepted metaphor describes and creates reality. It would be also useful to convince school headteachers to reflect on their own metaphors of evaluation to uncover how they create their own school reality and how they approach the evaluation process. Understanding that issue, can be an important factor in attempts to make evaluation work for the improvement of Polish educational institutions. The paper presents results of the research carried out on the group of school heads from Polish schools. They were asked to finish simple sentence: Evaluation is like… On the basis of the headteachers’s answers, the authors built categories of metaphors used by heads of schools. Authors claim that by deconstructing used metaphors it is possible to understand the culture of a school that the person using the metaphor is working in. It then helps to understand the evaluation process in such a school, and through that, it is possible to better manage the evaluation and development processes. Finally, the authors present some recommendations concerning possible ways of transforming school heads thinking that can support better the use of evaluation in Polish schools...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I look at {{transparency}} {{in theory and}} practice in Norges Bank and the Riksbank, and compare the two banks’ transparency policy, with a particular focus at transparency regarding the monetary policy meeting and future policy inclination. When it comes to communicating future policy intentions, the two central banks are amongst the most transparent in the world, as they publish forecasts of their own behavior. Some observers view this practice of publishing endogenous forecasts for the policy rates as the last frontier of transparency (Blinder et al, 2008). Hence, in this area, they both represent the extreme point on the transparency scale. In this thesis, I <b>take</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> at the reasoning behind publishing endogenous policy rate paths, and review some empirical evidence on how this stabilizes inflation expectations and make central banks more credible and predictable. As regards transparency about the monetary policy meeting, however, Norges Bank and the Riksbank represent the lower and upper range of the scale, respectively. While the Riksbank publishes both attributed minutes and attributed voting records from the monetary policy meetings, Norges Bank publishes neither. I explain how this difference in practice {{is influenced by the}} different institutional arrangements in the two banks. The choice of communication policy also stems from different views on what provides the best monetary policy decisions. Since the Riksbank is one of few central banks to attribute the minutes of the monetary policy meeting, I focus on this feature if the transparency policy, and hence the effects of the said attribution. I ask what explains the differences between their transparency policies, and evaluate how the policies affect the efficiency of the central banks’ internal decision making process and external communication. In addition, I explain why several authors claim that there is an optimal, intermediate degree of central bank transparency. Doing this implies evaluating both positive and normative arguments, as done in other reviews and discussions of transparency (Cuikerman, 2009). I use relevant theoretical- and descriptive literature, applying amongst other things a model of decision making where the agents have career concerns. This indicates that a combination of policy makers with career concerns and extensive transparency can have adverse effects on the decision making process. I also use some available empirical investigations and surveys to see if the theoretical propositions can be traced in the practice of a transparent monetary policy (of the Riksbank and the American Federal Reserve, in particular). I find that, as in most reviews of central bank transparency, neither the theories nor the practices of central bank transparency so far have rendered a clear conclusion as to the optimal design of transparency policy. What is regarded as optimal openness and communication is influenced by institutional arrangements, the general monetary policy framework and policy goals. Finally, the debate on optimal transparency is, to a large degree, influenced by the beliefs on the gains and costs of transparency...|$|E
