5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E
5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E
