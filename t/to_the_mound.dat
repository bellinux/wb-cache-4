5|$|The {{deciding}} Game7 {{was played}} on October 10, 1926, at Yankee Stadium {{in front of}} a crowd of 38,093people. The game featured two future Hall of Famers, who were both winners in their respective pitching appearances earlier in the series. Jesse Haines took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> for the Cardinals; he had pitched in relief in Game1 and threw a complete game shutout against the Yankees in Game3. Waite Hoyt had pitched a complete game 10–5 Yankees victory in Game4.|$|E
5|$|Clark's {{knowledge}} of the region helped him to become {{an expert on the}} West's natural history. Over the years he welcomed travelers, including those interested in natural history, to his home overlooking the Ohio River. Clark supplied details on the area's plant and animal life to John Pope and John James Audubon, and hosted his brother, William, and Meriweather Lewis, prior to their expedition to the Pacific Northwest. Clark also provided information on the Ohio Valley's native tribes to Allan Bowie Magruder and archaeological evidence related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mound</b> Builders to John P. Campbell.|$|E
5|$|Fernández {{began the}} 2015 {{season on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list but was later moved to the 60-day disabled list to continue recovery from Tommy John surgery. It was announced by the Marlins on June 15 {{that he would make}} his season debut on July 2. In his debut, Fernández recorded six strikeouts in six innings. He also hit a home run. Fernández returned to the disabled list in August with a biceps strain in his pitching arm. He returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> in September and set a major league record for consecutive wins at home by a single pitcher with his seventeenth such win on the 25th of that month.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were once}} at least 18 mounds, plus another 19 a short {{distance}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest directly above Carver's Cave. [...] <b>The</b> <b>mounds</b> of <b>the</b> second group were all quite small, under [...] high. [...] Anthropologists ascribe <b>the</b> oldest <b>mounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>mound</b> builders of <b>the</b> Hopewell Tradition, but later cultures also added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mounds.</b> [...] No evidence of habitation has been found among <b>the</b> <b>mounds,</b> so <b>the</b> builders lived elsewhere nearby, probably in a village below the bluff.|$|R

5|$|Interactions {{with the}} Mesopotamian south grew {{during the second}} half of period F (designated LC4) c. 3600 BC, and an Urukean colony was {{established}} in the city. With the end of Uruk culture c 3000 BC, Tell Brak's Urukean colony was abandoned and deliberately leveled by its occupants. Tell Brak contracted during the following periods H and J, and became limited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound.</b> Evidence exists for an interaction with the Mesopotamian south during period H, represented by the existence of materials similar to the ones produced during the southern Jemdet Nasr period. The city remained a small settlement during the Ninevite 5 period, with a small temple and associated sealing activities.|$|E
5|$|Now {{following}} the Wayne–Macomb county line, M-102 separates Warren from Detroit. The highway also runs parallel to, {{and about a}} half mile (0.8km) north of Outer Drive, the original beltway highway proposed in 1918 to encircle Detroit. The road passes the Mound Road Engine facility, a former Chrysler plant next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mound</b> Road intersection. East of the plant, the highway crosses a branch line of the Conrail Shared Assets Operations {{on the east side}} of the plant complex before intersecting M-53 (Van Dyke Road). Further east, 8Mile Road passes north of the Bel Air Center Shopping Center before crossing another Canadian National Railway line next to the intersection with M-97 (Groesbeck Highway).|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{made his}} seventh {{straight}} opening day start, tying Don Sutton for most consecutive opening day starts, and Sutton and Don Drysdale for most total opening day starts by a Dodger. On June 2, {{he struck out}} Jonathan Villar of the Milwaukee Brewers for his 2,000th career strikeout. He was the fifth youngest player in major league history to reach that mark, {{as well as the}} second fastest pitcher to 2,000 strikeouts, accomplishing the feat in 277 games (behind Randy Johnson's 262 games). He was named to his seventh straight all-star game, second most in Dodgers history after Drysdale. On July 23, Kershaw left the game due to back tightness. The same day, he was placed on the 10-day disabled list. He returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> on September 1, but despite his extended absence, he went on to lead the National League in earned run average and wins. In 27 starts, he was 18–4 with a 2.31 ERA and 202 strikeouts.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> and campgrounds, <b>the</b> park {{also has}} a groomed beach for swimming and several kilometers of walking and biking trails. Another popular pastime in the area is fishing. Rice Lake is known to many as a great spot for some boating and fishing. There are also several resorts with water access points.|$|R

25|$|People {{also claimed}} that the Indians were not <b>the</b> <b>Mound</b> Builders because <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> and related {{artifacts}} were older than Indian cultures. Caleb Atwater's misunderstanding of stratigraphy caused him <b>to</b> believe that <b>the</b> <b>Mound</b> Builders were a much older civilization than the Indians. In his book, Antiquities Discovered in the Western States (1820), Atwater claimed that Indian remains were always found right {{beneath the surface of}} the earth. Since the artifacts associated with <b>the</b> <b>Mound</b> Builders were found fairly deep in the ground, Atwater argued that they must be from a different group of people. The discovery of metal artifacts further convinced people that <b>the</b> <b>Mound</b> Builders were not Native Americans. The Indians encountered by the Europeans and Americans were not thought to engage in metallurgy. Some artifacts that were found in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> were inscribed with symbols. As the Europeans did not know of any Indian cultures that had a writing system, they assumed a different group had created them.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the game, First Lady Michelle Obama and Second Lady Jill Biden escorted former Yankees catcher and World War II veteran Yogi Berra <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound,</b> {{where the}} {{ceremonial}} first pitch was thrown by {{a veteran of}} the Iraq War. The Phillies' Ryan Howard got the first hit of the 2009 World Series by doubling in the first inning. Howard was stranded in the first and the game was scoreless after two innings. The Phillies scored first with a two-out solo home run by Chase Utley {{in the top of the}} third inning. Through the first five innings, Philadelphia starting pitcher Cliff Lee allowed no runs and three hits, striking out seven Yankees batters. In the top of the sixth, Utley hit another solo home run to give the Phillies a 2–0 lead. The starting pitchers Lee and CC Sabathia continued to pitch until the top of the eighth when Sabathia was replaced by Phil Hughes. Hughes walked the first two batters and was replaced by Dámaso Marte. Marte got two quick outs and was relieved by David Robertson, who walked Jayson Werth and gave up a two-run single to Raúl Ibañez. The Phillies added two more runs in the ninth with an RBI single by Shane Victorino and an RBI double by Howard. Lee finished with a complete game allowing one unearned run on six hits and striking out ten batters, not walking any of the hitters he faced.|$|E
5|$|Stengel, hired {{only days}} before spring training, had but a limited {{opportunity}} to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, {{where they would}} end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, Stengel went out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> {{to take out the}} angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball had been hit by a batter, and ran to retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.|$|E
5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E
40|$|I {{will examine}} the {{possibility}} that earthen <b>mounds</b> were <b>the</b> result of ritual acts in the Jomon period. In the Kanto district, ring-shaped earthen <b>mounds</b> developed in <b>the</b> Late and the Latest Jomon settlements. While the number of settlements decreased from the Middle Jomon, abundant ritual artefacts have been discovered in settlements and deposits adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mounds.</b> Burnt soil, charcoal, and burnt bone contained in <b>the</b> <b>mounds</b> could be <b>the</b> remains of feasting. As food processing facilities and vessels increased in the Late Jomon, I assert {{that the development of}} feasting led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formation of <b>the</b> <b>mounds...</b>|$|R

50|$|Barton {{made one}} {{significant}} contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> field of archaeology as well. Although his early publication of 1787, Observations on Some Parts of Natural History, incorrectly attributed <b>the</b> prehistoric <b>mounds</b> of Ohio <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Danes, in his 1797 work (mentioned above) he reconsidered his earlier claim, identifying <b>the</b> <b>Mound</b> builders as Native Americans. While {{he was not}} <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> make this claim, {{he may have been}} <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> suggest a significant age <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mounds,</b> positing that they were older than James Ussher's Biblical chronology. Lacking evidence, Barton nevertheless speculated that Native Americans originated in Asia.|$|R
5|$|The New York Mets {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} {{with a record of}} 100–60 while the Dodgers had a 94–67 record. The Mets had won ten of the eleven head-to-head regular season contests and were the favorite in the series. On October 4, 1988, Hershiser posted eight scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1988 NL Championship Series (bringing his unofficial total of consecutive scoreless innings to 67) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning. In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the third out recorded on infield grounders to Hershiser. In the ninth inning, Gregg Jefferies led off with a single on a sinker down the middle and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with Keith Hernandez. Jefferies, a rookie, recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser. With Jefferies on second, Darryl Strawberry posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in the strike zone. Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball. After Hershiser gave up a run in the ninth inning 100 pitches into his performance, pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signaling for a double switch before getting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> to talk to Hershiser. The Dodgers' bullpen had led the league in saves that year. Howell had recorded 18 consecutive scoreless innings in relief. Howell's scoreless streak was longer in calendar days, his last runs allowed occurring on August 11. It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser. Controversially, Mets pitcher David Cone attributed Hershiser's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in the ninth inning. The Mets went on to add two more runs on Gary Carter's shallow fly ball that center fielder John Shelby could not secure until it first hit the ground. The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch, yielding the tying and winning runs. Despite the results, Hershiser's scoreless inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings, as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason.|$|E
25|$|Blue Jays manager Roy Hartsfield went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> {{to talk to}} Singer. As Hartsfield went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound,</b> {{reliever}} Jerry Johnson started {{warming up}} in the bullpen. Singer was able to compose himself and he got Eric Soderholm to hit into a fielder's choice to end the inning.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{inability}} of archaeologists <b>to</b> classify <b>the</b> <b>mound's</b> origins, {{it is likely to}} be a valuable archaeological site if investigated. In recognition of its archaeological value, <b>the</b> Ratcliffe <b>Mound</b> was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.|$|R
25|$|The Giants sent Ryan Vogelsong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound,</b> {{while the}} Royals sent Jason Vargas.

25|$|Singer {{was still}} in the game {{in the top of the}} fifth inning, {{striking}} out Chet Lemon, but Brian Downing and Ralph Garr singled off him. Hartsfield came out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> and pulled Singer out of the game. Singer left to a standing ovation as Jerry Johnson entered the game. Johnson got the final two outs of the fifth inning.|$|E
25|$|According to Frederick , Birmingham {{used him}} badly last season. When Fred was ready and anxious to pitch and warmed up with enough speed {{to throw the}} ball through a brick wall, Birmingham wouldn't let him work. Other days when he didn't even have a glove and had to borrow one, Joe sent him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> and let him stay there until the humane society got an injunction.|$|E

50|$|In the Northeastern United States, Allegheny mound ants (Formica exsectoides) are {{credited}} with causing lesions typically {{in the form}} of a deep constriction about 10 cm long on the main stem of small individuals of a variety of species, both hardwoods and conifers, including white pine and Scots pine (Peirson 1922). Spruces were not mentioned, but Peirson did not state whether spruces had been examined. <b>The</b> <b>mounds</b> vary in size with age, many reaching 1 m in height and 2 m in diameter.

25|$|Kazmir {{was named}} to the American League squad for the 2008 MLB All-Star Game. Though the Rays' {{management}} preferred that Kazmir rest his arm and not pitch in the mid-summer classic if at all possible, the game ended up being the longest ever and Kazmir stepped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> in the 15th inning. He threw a scoreless frame and the AL all-stars scored the winning run {{in the bottom of the}} 15th, making Kazmir the winning pitcher.|$|E
25|$|After a bad {{start in}} Game 2 of the 1986 World Series, Clemens {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> for Game 6, {{which would have}} clinched the World Series for the Boston Red Sox. Clemens left the game after 7 innings leading 3–2, but the Red Sox went on to lose {{the game in the}} 10th inning, and subsequently, the championship. Clemens' departure was highly debated and remains a bone of contention among the participants. Red Sox manager John McNamara claimed Clemens took himself out due to a blister, though Clemens strongly denies that.|$|E
25|$|Schiraldi {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mound</b> for the Red Sox {{trying to}} keep the score even and atone for his blown save. After Knight walked, Mookie Wilson laid down a sacrifice bunt that Gedman threw wide of second in an attempt to get Knight, putting the winning run in scoring position with nobody out. This time, the Mets could not get a run in off Schiraldi as Howard Johnson, pinch hitting for Elster, struck out. Mazzilli and Dykstra then flied out for the remaining two outs, sending the game into extra innings.|$|E
