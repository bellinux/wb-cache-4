5|$|In {{his reelection}} as the Second District congressman, Jennings {{supported}} <b>tariff</b> <b>protection</b> and internal improvements {{and vowed to}} support the presidential candidate that his constituents preferred if the election went to the House to decide the winner. Jennings won reelection to Congress in a close race, beating Jeremiah Sullivan of Madison. In the presidential election of 1824 American political parties organized around three candidates: Andrew Jackson running against John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Jennings favored Adams, and later, Clay; however, when the contested presidential election passed to the House in 1825, Jennings voted with the majority and gave his political support to Jackson, but he was defeated in the House and Adams became president. Indiana voters who supported Jackson hoped for {{a victory in the}} next election.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term in parliament, Playford also gained {{attention}} for his unconvincing command of the English language; he developed a reputation for pronouncing common words incorrectly, bad syntax and speaking in a monotone. He continued to attack his ministers, and complaints {{from the likes of}} Public Works Minister Herbert Hudd only encouraged Playford to further mock him. Playford also consistently opposed the liberalisation of liquor trading, having been unimpressed by the drunken behaviour he had witnessed while in the military. He continued to stridently support economic rationalism, something he would later renege on as premier. He opposed government investment in capital works as a means of generating employment and stimulating the economy during the Depression, and called for a decrease in dairy production within the state on the basis that it was more efficient to import from interstate, where rainfall was higher and grazing was more effective. Playford further criticised government subsidies to work farms designed to alleviate unemployment among Indigenous Australians, claiming that the cost exceeded that of the standard jobless payment. He also endorsed the privatisation of unprofitable state railways and denounced <b>tariff</b> <b>protection</b> as rewarding inefficiency and non-innovation. In 1936, Playford defied his party by voting against the formation of the South Australian Housing Trust. Nevertheless, despite his refusal to toe the party line, Playford was well regarded for his studious attitude to research and his preparation of his speeches.|$|E
25|$|Coal was subsidised in Canada from 1887. The mines of Cape Breton were {{involved}} in this <b>tariff</b> <b>protection</b> to help it compete against American coal entering Ontario via the Great Lakes. Cape Breton coal was dug underground then shipped to Toronto and Montreal. The vast industries of the east, including steel mills, were fuelled with this coal. While there were difficulties and strikes, coal powered Canada into the Second World War. There were several Royal Commissions into coal: one in 1947 and other in 1965.|$|E

The woollen mills closed in 1974 and hectares of warehouse space in the city centre were left empty after wool-handling practices changed. The Target head office opened in North Geelong, Deakin University was established at Waurn Ponds in 1974, and the Geelong Performing Arts Centre opened in 1981.

Thirty years later, Australia <b>tariff</b> <b>protection</b> was removed and local assembly plants closed in 1984 and 1990. GM became a national sales company and a parts distribution centre.

25|$|From 1919-1922, Edge was a Joint Lord of the Treasury {{with his}} main role being {{to act as}} liaison between the Coalition {{government}} and the Labour Party. He was re-elected for Bolton in the 1922 general election standing as a National Liberal, that is as {{a supporter of the}} former coalition government and the Lloyd George faction in the Liberal Party, against Conservative, Labour and Asquithian Liberal opposition. Despite the decision of the Conservative Party at the Carlton Club meeting of 19 October 1922 to end the Coalition Government, there was clearly some goodwill remaining between the parties in Bolton as only one candidate from each stood in the election, and there must have been some crossover of votes from the Conservatives to Edge. The Independent Liberal came bottom of the poll, behind the two Labour candidates. Edge was one of the National Liberal whips from 1922-23 but resigned in protest at the government's industrial policy of safeguarding (i.e. <b>tariff</b> <b>protection),</b> as it particularly affected the cotton industry through a proposed duty on fabric gloves – important in his Lancashire constituency. He was knighted in 1922.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s and 80s {{the removal}} of <b>tariff</b> <b>protections</b> for {{manufactured}} goods in Australia, automation of production processes, {{and an increase in}} the availability of cheap imports from Asia greatly reduced the size of the workforce in the Australian clothing industry. This, combined with a policy of union rationalisation pursued by the ACTU, put pressure on the CATU to effect a merger with other unions in the apparel industry. In 1992 the union merged with the Amalgamated Footwear and Textile Workers' Union of Australia to form the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia.|$|R

500|$|Tariff {{legislation}} generally found {{favor with}} Randall, which put him {{more often in}} alliance with Republicans than Democrats. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, Randall worked to raise tariffs {{on a wide variety}} of imported goods. Even so, he sometimes differed with the Republicans when he believed the tariff proposed was too high; biographer Alfred V. House describes Randall's attitude as supporting [...] "higher tariff rates ... largely because he believed that the benefits of such high rates were passed on to the labor population." [...] In 1870, he opposed the pig iron tariff as too high, against the wishes of fellow Pennsylvanian William [...] "Pig Iron" [...] Kelley. Randall called his version of protectionism [...] "incidental protection": he believed that tariffs should be high enough to support the cost of running the government, but only applied to those industries that needed <b>tariff</b> <b>protection</b> to survive foreign competition.|$|E
50|$|In 1857, John's son Peter Redpath (1821-1894) {{became a}} partner; his brother-in-law, George Alexander Drummond (1829-1910) joined the firm in 1861.

Seven months into the crisis, Hawke told the State Premiers that the [...] "savings of Australia must be freed" [...] to go into business investment for export expansion, and funding to the states was cut. A phase out of <b>tariff</b> <b>protections</b> was continued and company tax was cut by 10% to 39%. In the May mini-Budget, payment to the states was cut by $870 million and tax cuts deferred. The Government declared cost cutting was completed.|$|R
500|$|Practical {{differences}} between the candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if Democrats held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate veterans pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed {{since the end of}} the war, and Union generals at the head of both tickets, the bloody shirt was of diminishing value in exciting the voters. With a few months to go before the election, the Republicans switched tactics to emphasize the tariff. Seizing on the Democratic platform's call for a [...] "tariff for revenue only", Republicans told Northern workers that a Hancock presidency would weaken the <b>tariff</b> <b>protection</b> that kept them in good jobs. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said, [...] "The tariff question is a local question."

50|$|Australia {{experienced}} a prolonged economic boom during the Menzies years. Menzies remained a staunch supporter of {{links to the}} monarchy and British Commonwealth but formalised an alliance with the United States and launched post-war trade with Japan, beginning a growth of Australian exports of coal, iron ore and mineral resources that would steadily climb until Japan became Australia's largest trading partner. John McEwen, as minister for commerce and for trade negotiated the Agreement on Commerce between Australia and Japan which was signed in July 1957. The agreement carried political risk for the Menzies government, because memories of atrocities perpetrated on Australians by Japan in World War II were still strong in the community. Britain meanwhile was negotiating entry into the European Economic Community in the early 1960s with major implications for Australian trade, which had previously enjoyed preferential treatment in the UK McEwen was active in maintaining <b>tariff</b> <b>protections</b> for agriculture, mining and manufacturing, which he believed would sustain employment and contribute to national defence.|$|R

[...] This type of nationalism is associated with the slogan [...] "it's either the state or the States", coined by the Canadian Radio League in the 1930s during their campaign for a national public broadcaster to compete with the private, American radio stations broadcasting into Canada, representing a fear of annexation by the United States. [...] Right-wing nationalism continues to exist in Canada, but tends to be much less concerned with integration into North America, especially since the Conservative Party embraced free trade after 1988.

Among these elements are high <b>tariff</b> <b>protections</b> between the members of CARICOM, low availability of transport routes and their high costs, the heterogeneity in their visa policies as well as the costs related to cross-border trade. Moreover, it does a perfunctory approach to the aid these countries receive for trade and development, within an emphasis on projects related to trade facilitation.
