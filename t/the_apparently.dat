5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> {{poor quality}} of pitch and {{facilities}} the Birmingham County Football Association XI, comprising players from {{teams in the}} Birmingham area, played several representative football matches at Muntz Street. The ground twice hosted matches against the London Football Association, and between 1898 and 1906 four matches were played against teams representing the Scottish Football Association.|$|E
5|$|Herbert {{identifies}} two philosophical problems {{presented by}} quantum theory—the interpretation question, concerning the physical {{nature of the}} reality underlying observation; and the measurement problem, concerning <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> special role of the measurement act in quantum theory, and various approaches to formally defining the measurement act.|$|E
50|$|Another older {{connection}} {{from the}} Rhine to the lakes was the Vecht. Although <b>the</b> Romans <b>apparently</b> {{did not consider}} it navigable, it possibly gave access to the old IJ, {{and from there to}} Velsen where there was a Roman fortification on <b>the</b> coast, <b>apparently</b> <b>the</b> same one which Tacitus referred to as Flevus.|$|R

5|$|In 1917, D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860–1948) {{published}} his book On Growth and Form. His description of phyllotaxis and the Fibonacci sequence, the mathematical {{relationships in the}} spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> complex spiral growth patterns of animal horns and mollusc shells.|$|E
5|$|Shapley's {{measurements}} {{also indicated}} that the Sun is relatively far {{from the center of}} the galaxy, also contrary to what had previously been inferred from <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> nearly even distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, most ordinary stars lie within the galaxy's disk and those stars that lie in the direction of the galactic centre and beyond are thus obscured by gas and dust, whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much further distances.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} caterpillar, such as many hawkmoths (Sphingidae), have eyespots on their {{anterior}} abdominal segments. When alarmed, they retract {{the head and}} the thoracic segments into the body, leaving <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> threatening large eyes {{at the front of}} the visible part of the body.|$|E

50|$|Flights into {{or out of}} <b>the</b> {{airfield}} <b>apparently</b> {{continued to}} at least 1989, but the runways existed into the 2000s (decade) (see the Google maps link for an excellent satellite image of one of <b>the</b> runways <b>apparently</b> being torn up).|$|R
5|$|The Senate, now {{alarmed at}} <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> unstoppable {{rebellion}} occurring within Italy, gave {{the task of}} putting down the rebellion to Marcus Licinius Crassus. Crassus {{was no stranger to}} Roman politics, or to military command as he had been a field commander under Lucius Cornelius Sulla during the second civil war between Sulla and the Marian faction in 82 BC, and had served under Sulla during the dictatorship that followed.|$|E
5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much {{regardless of who}} is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or {{turn away from the}} caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E
5|$|Captivated by Hedren's Nordic looks, Hitchcock becomes {{infatuated}} with her. While filming The Birds, he makes physical advances {{to her in}} the back of a limousine but she rebuffs him and escapes through the back door. In retaliation for her rejection, Hitchcock exposes Hedren to terrifying encounters with birds. A mechanical bird breaks <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> shatterproof glass of a telephone booth during filming, scratching Hedren's face with splintering glass. After arriving on set to shoot a scene where Hedren's character (Melanie Daniels) is trapped in an attic with aggressive birds, she discovers that Hitchcock has ordered the mechanical birds to be replaced with live ones. He demands the scene be repeated until he is satisfied that Hedren's reaction looks authentic. This takes a protracted several days of filming, leaving Hedren traumatised.|$|E

5|$|Established {{traits are}} not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one {{environmental}} context {{may be much}} less fit if environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to preserve such a trait, it becomes more variable and deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a vestigial manifestation of the trait, also called evolutionary baggage. In many circumstances, <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other advantageous traits in a phenomenon known as preadaptation. A famous example of a vestigial structure, {{the eye of the}} blind mole-rat, is believed to retain function in photoperiod perception.|$|E
5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{generally}} accepted Bede's report of Coenred's and Offa's abdications, but Barbara Yorke {{has suggested that}} they may not have relinquished their thrones voluntarily. There are instances of kings being forcibly removed and placed in holy orders to make them ineligible for kingship; one such was King Osred II of Northumbria, who was forced into a monastery. On the other hand, if Coenred went willingly, as Bede relates, then <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> friendly relationship between Offa and Coenred, his overlord, makes it clear that the relationship between an overlord and his underking was not hostile in every case.|$|E

5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} for climate modification have also been studied, as global warming and global dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> opposing forces of global warming and global dimming can occur at the same time. Global dimming interacts with global warming by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|Like Pedra Branca, the Sultan of Johor {{held the}} {{original}} ancient title to Middle Rocks. As Singapore had not exercised any {{rights as a}} sovereign over Middle Rocks, the ICJ determined that Malaysia retained sovereignty over this maritime feature. As for South Ledge, the ICJ noted that it fell within <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> overlapping territorial waters of mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As the Court had not been mandated {{to draw the line}} of delimitation with respect to the territorial waters of Malaysia and Singapore in the area in question, it simply held that sovereignty over South Ledge belonged to the state which owned the territorial waters in which it is located.|$|E
5|$|Now at his wit's end, Presto storms {{backstage}} {{to catch}} Alec, but he accidentally releases a weight holding down some stage props, and his foot gets {{caught in a}} rope that lifts {{him up to the}} fly space above the stage. When his foot comes loose from the rope, he falls, along with suspended scenery (including a piano). Alec, realizing that Presto will be crushed, uses the magic hat to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for both himself and Presto. Presto gives Alec <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> restored carrot, as well as second billing on the posters advertising the show, and they are rewarded for each show they do, with roses for Presto and carrots for Alec.|$|E

5|$|On 23 May 2008, the Court {{ruled that}} Pedra Branca is under Singapore's sovereignty, while Middle Rocks belongs to Malaysia. As regards South Ledge, the Court {{noted that it}} falls within <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> {{overlapping}} territorial waters generated by mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As it is a maritime feature visible only at low tide, {{it belongs to the}} state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.|$|E
5|$|Quiriguá {{suffered}} a hiatus from {{the turn of}} the 6th century that lasted through {{to the middle of the}} 7th century. This may be linked to the Tikal hiatus of the Middle Classic caused by Tikal's defeat by Calakmul. There is evidence that Quiriguá {{suffered a}}n attack by unknown enemies in this period, as demonstrated by <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> deliberate defacement of Stela U and Monument26, characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors. No monuments were erected during this hiatus, which lasted from 495 to 653.|$|E
5|$|South Ledge {{falls within}} <b>the</b> <b>apparently</b> {{overlapping}} territorial waters {{generated by the}} mainland of Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. Although in the Special Agreement and in their final submissions Malaysia and Singapore had asked the Court to decide which state had sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the Court had not been mandated to delimit {{the extent of the}} territorial waters of the two states in the area in question. Therefore, it simply held that South Ledge, as a low-tide elevation, belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.|$|E
