Carburization is a method of producing mild steel having <b>tough</b> inner <b>core</b> and hard outer surface. Three Heat Treatment process namely Quenching, Carburizing and Tempering were done.

The {{results indicated that the}} process of carburization greatly improves the mechanical and wear properties like hardness, tensile strength and wear resistance and these properties increases with increase in the carburization temperature but apart from this, the toughness property decreases and it is further decreases with increase in carburization temperature. The mild steels carburized at the temperature of 950 o C gives the best results for the mechanical and wear properties because at this temperature it gives the highest tensile strength, hardness and wear resistance, so it must be preferred for the required applications...|$|R

Pre-cracking between adhesive and core may grow either interfacially or into the core (kinking), as decided by energy release criteria. Under load-control conditions, initiation of either kind of crack leads to immediate (brittle) structural failure.

50|$|Applies various {{chemical}} processes (browning, bluing, Parkerization, among others) {{to the metal}} parts of guns to develop corrosion resistant surface layers on the steel. They may also apply case hardening to low carbon steel parts. Case hardening is a combined chemical and heat-treatment process which introduces carbon into the surfaces of low steel alloys that does not contain sufficient carbon to allow total ("through") heat treatment. This carbon rich surface is then heat treated resulting in a thin, very hard surface layer with a <b>tough,</b> malleable <b>core.</b> This process can be done solely for the mechanical properties (hardness and toughness) it imparts, or, by packing the parts in bone charcoal and other chemicals and heating in a heat treatment furnace for varying time periods, {{it is possible to}} introduce rich colors into the carbonized surface. This type of case hardening, known as color case hardening, is prized for its rich mottled blues, purples, browns and grey tones. It is possible, with highly skilled craftsmen using highly proprietary processes, to control the hues and patterns so closely that one familiar with high grade custom firearms can usually recognize the maker of another shooter's firearm solely by the colors and patterns on its parts; an important distinction on extremely costly firearms of the highest grade. Typically, its use is usually restricted to receivers, rarely barrels. Although providing corrosion resistance, the colored surface layers are subject to wear and may also fade with time. Antique firearms for sale frequently note the specific percentage of the factory original case coloring remaining on the receiver and lockplates. Renewing this color case hardening to the specific patterns of the firearm when it was new has become an important sub-area of the gunsmithing field.|$|R

The majority of research work refers to improvement of mechanical and tribological properties of coatings, deposited on 2 ̆ 7 hard 2 ̆ 7 substrates, i. e. ceramics and tool steels, and used for cutting and forming tools. However, requirements in the case of machine elements are quite different from those for tools. In addition to a hard, wear resistant surface with good frictional characteristics, a <b>tough,</b> fracture resistant <b>core</b> is necessary. In contrast to tool steels, hardened and tempered low-alloy steels have high fracture toughness. On the other hand, high hardness and internal compressive stresses of the case formed by proper thermochemical treatment can lead to increased load-carrying capacity of the steel substrate as well as to improved tribological properties of coated parts. Therefore, the combination of thermochemical treatment and hard-coating, known as a duplex treatment, would allow function sharing between the core material, the hardened case and wear resistant surface, which is of special interest for applications involving machine elements subjected to complex stresses. This paper shows that by proper selection and control of substrate treatment and coating deposition, thin hard coatings could also be successfully used in the case of machine elements subjected to complex stresses...|$|R
