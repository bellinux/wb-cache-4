When Goizueta died in 1997, the company's share price was at a level well above what it was when he had taken over 16 years earlier and its position as market leader even more firmly established. At the time Roger Enrico, then head of Pepsi's American operations, likened New Coke to the Edsel.

25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, for <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>reason</b> that such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E

[...] Hugh MacDonald concurs that Liszt [...] "held an idealized view of the symphonic poem" [...] as being evocative rather than representational. [...] "He only rarely achieved in his symphonic poems the directness and subtle timing that narrative requires," [...] MacDonald explains; he generally focused more on expressing poetic ideas by setting a mood or atmosphere, refraining on the whole from narrative description or pictorial realism.|$|E
500|$|Hannibal had {{defeated}} {{the equivalent of}} eight consular armies (16 legions plus {{an equal number of}} allies). Within just three campaign seasons (20 months), Rome had lost one-fifth (150,000) of the entire population of male citizens over 17 years of age. Furthermore, the morale effect of this victory was such that most of southern Italy joined Hannibal's cause. After Cannae, the Hellenistic southern provinces of Arpi, Salapia, Herdonia, Uzentum, including the cities of Capua and Tarentum (two of the largest city-states in Italy) revoked their allegiance to Rome and pledged their loyalty to Hannibal. As Livy noted, [...] "How much more serious was the defeat of Cannae than those which preceded it, can be seen by the behavior of Rome's allies; before that fateful day, their loyalty remained unshaken, now it began to waver for <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>reason</b> that they despaired of Roman power." [...] In the same year the Greek cities in Sicily were induced to revolt against Roman political control, while the Macedonian king, Philip V, pledged his support to Hannibal, initiating the First Macedonian War against Rome. Hannibal also secured an alliance with the new King Hieronymus of Syracuse, the only independent left in Sicily.|$|E
500|$|Other {{commentators}} have cautioned against {{the conclusion that}} The Oceanides is either an example of impressionism or somehow stylistically indebted to Debussy. Tawaststjerna, for example, believes that the piece's [...] "anchorage in the major-minor harmony and the relatively sparing use of modal and whole-tone formulae" [...] indicates that the tone poem [...] "belongs {{to the world of}} late romanticism", the impressionistic character of its texture, harmonic vocabulary, and rhythmic patterns notwithstanding. Hurwitz has likewise criticized the [...] "roaring cataract of nonsense in the Sibelius literature" [...] about the influence of the French impressionists on the composer. [...] "Similar musical problems often produce similar solutions", Hurwitz notes. [...] "In this case, any symphonic portrait of the ocean is bound to rely more on texture and color than on vocal melody, for <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>reason</b> that the ocean is not a person and does not sing... nor does it lend itself to... anthropomorphic approach...". Layton detects the presence of [...] "normal Sibelian procedures and techniques" [...] in The Oceanides, dismissing any serious debt to Debussy. [...] "Its growth from the opening bars onward is profoundly organic", Layton writes.

500|$|Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding {{fault with}} the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind {{as well in}} that these {{generally}} posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality. [...] Nonetheless, this {{does not imply that}} the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality.Indeed, physicalism or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less real than physical events. In terms of our common-sense experience, differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For example, we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from one’s childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, for <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>reason</b> that they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.|$|E

[...] Sethumadhavan N of the Bangalore Mirror rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Make no mistake, Srimanthudu is certainly a big commercial entertainer and has most of the elements needed for the same. But to deliver a total commercial which doesn't have a great plot and yet remaining engaging all the way isn't easy at all. That is where the writing by Siva emerges triumphant." [...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Though there are a few hiccups, Srimanthudu is a good emotional drama with excellent performance by Mahesh Babu, supported by good content with neat dialogues". Hemanth Kumar C.R. of Outlook India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and stated, [...] "In an industry where weaving a story to suit the image of an A-list star is common, Mahesh Babu's latest, Srimanthudu, takes a different course. The film might lack a big-starrer firepower, but by letting go of such conventions, what we get in the end is a sensible film full of heart and humanity." [...] IndiaGlitz rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and called Srimanthudu a [...] "family entertainer with mass appeal, thanks to Mahesh's understated acting" [...] and added, [...] "Koratala Shiva doesn't really unleash a Mirchi-fied Mahesh Babu even in the second half.
