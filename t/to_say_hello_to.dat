Nate later helps Chris and Lucy see that they need to think the idea through more thoroughly, and they draw up a contract detailing how their child will be raised. When they learn that they are both carriers of spinal muscular atrophy, Chris tells Lucy that she should find another donor. But when Chris sees how down Lucy is, he changes his mind and they go ahead with the insemination. A couple of weeks later, Lucy calls Chris to tell him that she is pregnant. Chris plans to visit New York for the scan, but Nate confesses he is banned from the States for overstaying his visa there previously. Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) agrees to help lift the ban, but Nate misses a meeting and Chris accuses him of not taking it seriously. Lucy returns for a visit and Chris decides he wants to split his time between Erinsborough and New York when the baby comes, although Nate is against this idea. Nate realises that they want different things, and they break-up. Chris then decides to move to New York with Lucy and leaves after a farewell party at The Waterhole. A few months later, Amber contacts Chris and Lucy via video call after learning that they have had a daughter. Chris and Lucy introduce her to Anne, and Chris asks Amber <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>hello</b> <b>to</b> Nate for him.|$|E
500|$|Dick Enberg {{hosted the}} post-match {{ceremony}} during which a victorious del Potro requested to address his fans in Spanish. Enberg declined the request {{saying that he}} was running out of time, but went on to list the corporate sponsored prizes del Potro won. A couple of minutes later, del Potro made the same request again, and only then did Enberg relent saying, [...] "Very quickly, in Spanish, he wants <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>hello</b> <b>to</b> his friends here and in Argentina." [...] An emotional del Potro finally spoke a few sentences in Spanish to a cheering crowd. Many viewers expressed disappointment with Enberg and broadcaster CBS over the interview. A CBS executive later defended Enberg, noting that the contract with the United States Tennis Association required that certain sponsors receive time during the ceremony.|$|E
500|$|His father's last {{move was}} in 1944, back to Wapakoneta. Armstrong {{attended}} Blume High School and took flying lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield. He earned a student flight certificate on his 16th birthday, then soloed later in August; all {{before he had}} a driver's license. Armstrong {{was active in the}} Boy Scouts and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. As an adult, he was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award. On July 18, 1969, while flying toward the Moon inside the Columbia, Armstrong greeted the Scouts: [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>hello</b> <b>to</b> all my fellow Scouts and Scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week; and Apollo11 would like to send them best wishes". [...] Houston replied: [...] "Thank you, Apollo11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news. Certainly appreciate that." [...] Among the very few personal items that Neil Armstrong carried with him to the Moon and back was a World Scout Badge.|$|E

2500|$|On March 26, Butch {{was greeted}} at Pearl Harbor by {{a horde of}} reporters and radio announcers. During a radio {{broadcast}} in Honolulu, he enjoyed the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>hello</b> <b>to</b> Rita ("Here's a great big radio hug, the best I can do under the circumstances") and to his mother ("Love from me to you"). On April 8, he thanked the Grumman Aircraft Corporation plant at Bethpage (where the F4F Wildcat was made) for 1,150 cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes, {{a grand total of}} 230,000 smokes. Ecstatic Grumman workers had passed the hat to buy the cigarettes in appreciation of O'Hare's combat victories in one of their F4F Wildcats. A loyal Camel smoker, Butch opened a carton, deciding that it was the least he could do for the good people back in Bethpage. In his letter to the Grumman employees he wrote, [...] "You build them, we'll fly them and between us, we can't be beaten." [...] It was a sentiment he would voice often in the following two months.|$|E
2500|$|... "A Short Trip Home", Saturday Evening Post, January 17, 1927. [...] "Joe Jelke and {{two other}} boys were along, {{and none of the}} three could manage to take their eyes off her, even <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>hello</b> <b>to</b> me. She had one of those {{exquisite}} rose skins frequent in our part of the country, and beautiful until the little veins begin to break at about forty; now, flushed with the cold, it was a riot of lovely delicate pinks like many carnations. She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or at least he was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she laughed a lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming—that she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside. I walked home with a certain depression of spirit and lay for an hour in a hot bath thinking that vacation was all over for me now that she was gone; feeling, even more deeply than I had yesterday, that she was out of my life." ...|$|E
30|$|The general {{responsibility}} of store greeters is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>hello</b> or <b>to</b> welcome customers {{as they approach}} or enter a retail store (or access an online retail site).

5000|$|This album signalled a sharp {{departure}} from the band's last release, What It Is <b>to</b> Burn. <b>Say</b> <b>Hello</b> <b>to</b> Sunshine introduced a harder, gritty sound, with less screaming and a more alternative rock sound when compared to earlier recordings.

50|$|Finch was an American post-hardcore {{band from}} Temecula, California. The band {{released}} an EP Falling Into Place and two full-length albums, What It Is <b>to</b> Burn and <b>Say</b> <b>Hello</b> <b>to</b> Sunshine before declaring a hiatus in 2006. Finch reformed in 2007, playing a reunion show on November 23 at the Glasshouse in Pomona, California.

After playing a group of shows commemorating the ten-year anniversary of What It Is to Burn in 2012, Finch signed with Razor & Tie in 2014 and revealed that they were working on a new studio album.

40|$|According to the {{literary}} Establishment, {{there is no}} such thing as a progressive culture in the United States. Maybe they’re not looking in the right places. Within every major city in the U. S. there are communities of cultural workers whose work never makes it onto the radar screen. It lurks somewhere just below the surface of recognition. Last summer I went to a book party for Robert Roth’s Health Proxy. It was held at the Brecht Forum in Westbeth, a longtime artistic community on West Street, near the Hudson River in New York City. I was literally amazed by the number of people in the room who are in one way or another involved in the writing or producing of very critical works in the areas of visual art, music, literature and theatre. They present their work in unfashionable venues like bars and in small literary magazines. Their books are published by small presses. You can’t even order most of their books on Amazon. com. The Brecht Forum is a radical school for people who want to gain a better understanding of the way the world works. It does not issue college credits so people go to classes there after work-ing a 9 - 5 job because they are actually interested in learning something that they don’t already know. There is also a lecture series on local and global political issues at the Brecht Forum as well as events like the screening of new documentaries and book parties like the one I attended there last summer. My friend, Eric Whellis and I had been reading Robert Roth’s book Health Proxy and I had brought him to the book party to meet the author. While waiting for the reading of selections from the book to begin, Eric and I sat next to D. H. Melhem, an Upper West Side poet and novelist. She has published seven books of poetry, three novels and a critical study of Gwendolyn Brooks. Her latest book contains volumes two and three of her trilogy called Patrimonies and is entitled Stigma and The Cave. The first volume called Blight was published in 1995 and is in development as a movie. We had been communicating via email but this was our first face-to-face meeting. It was very hot in the room even though the air conditioner was on full blast. Soon there was little space <b>to</b> move <b>to</b> even <b>say</b> <b>hello</b> <b>to</b> people because of the number of bodies in the room. Robert came over to me to introduce me to Joel Shatzky...|$|R

50|$|While it's {{clear that}} peace in Israel won't come about easily, the {{documentary}} {{suggests that the}} steps towards a harmonious coexistence between the Jews and Arabs are simple. In fact, they're {{as simple as a}} few kind words. “We hate whoever hates us. We respect those who respect us,” Abu explains.
