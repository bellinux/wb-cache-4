25|$|Replacing {{the legendary}} Torchy Clark would prove {{impossible}} for his successors. <b>The</b> <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> would replace him, went a combined 96–180 (.347) in 10 seasons, including only one {{season with a}} winning record. Hired to be Clark's replacement, Chuck Machock, an assistant coach at Ohio State, took the helm for the 1983–84 season. That year, Machock led the Knights to a 15–13 record, earning the teams sixth Sunshine State Conference regular season championship in their final year in the conference. The next year, UCF ascended to the ranks of Division I, earning a 10–18 record under Machock in {{what would be the}} Knights first losing season, and Machock's final season with the team. In two seasons, Machock led the Knights to a 25–31 (.446) record.|$|E

60|$|By {{the time}} we got to stone-throwing, the Fire People had massed thick {{at the base of the}} cliff. Our first volley must have mashed some heads, for when they swerved back from the cliff three of their number were left upon the ground. These were {{struggling}} and floundering, and one was trying to crawl away. But we fixed them. By this time we males were roaring with rage, and we rained rocks upon <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> were down. Several of the Fire-Men returned to drag them into safety, but our rocks drove the rescuers back.|$|E

6000|$|What is {{extremely}} important too, you could try this method with safety; extension of the suffrage you cannot so try. With even an approximately heroic Prime Minister, you could get nothing but good from prescribing to him thus, to choose the fittest man, under penalties; to choose, not the fittest of the four or <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> were in Parliament, but the fittest from the whole Twenty-seven Millions that he could hear of,--at his peril. Nothing but good from this. From extension of the suffrage, some think, you might get quite other than good. From extension of the suffrage, till it became a universal counting of heads, one sees {{not in the least}} what wisdom could be extracted. A Parliament of the Paris pattern, such as we see just now, might be extracted: and from that? Solution into universal slush; drownage of all interests divine and human, in a Noah's-Deluge of Parliamentary eloquence,--such as we hope our sins, heavy and manifold though they are, have not yet quite deserved! ...|$|E
60|$|After a {{few minutes}} of watching, it became {{apparent}} to <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> the turmoil far below had not yet ceased. At short irregular intervals the hell-broth in the hole seemed as if boiling up. It rose and fell again and turned over, showing in fresh form much of the nauseous detail which had been visible earlier. The worst parts were the great masses of the flesh of the monstrous Worm, in all its red and sickening aspect. Such fragments had been bad enough before, but now they were infinitely worse. Corruption comes with startling rapidity to beings whose destruction has been due wholly or in part to lightning--the whole mass seemed to have become all at once corrupt! The whole surface of the fragments, once alive, was covered with insects, worms, and vermin of all kinds. The sight was horrible enough, but, with the awful smell added, was simply unbearable. The Worm's hole appeared to breathe forth death in its most repulsive forms. The friends, with one impulse, moved {{to the top of the}} Brow, where a fresh breeze from the sea was blowing up.|$|E
6000|$|The storm left a solid bank {{of clouds}} in the east for a while after it was all blue in the western half of the sky, and a rainbow came out against the clouds. It looked so firm and thick that Dave said you could cut it with a scythe. It seemed to come solidly {{down to the ground}} in the woods in front of the hay-mow window, and the boys said {{it would be easy to}} get the crock of gold at the end of it if they were only in the woods. [...] "I'll bet that feller's helpin' himself," [...] said Dave, and they began to wonder how many dollars a crock of gold was worth, anyhow; they decided about a million. Then they {{wondered}} how much of a crock full of gold a boy could get into his pockets; and they all laughed when Jake said he reckoned it would depend upon the size of the crock. [...] "I don't believe that fellow could carry much of it away if he hain't got more on than he had in front of the barn." [...] That put Frank in mind of the puzzle about <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> found a treasure in the road when they were travelling together: the blind man saw it, and the man without arms picked it up, and the naked man put it in his pocket. It was the first time Dave had heard the puzzle, and he asked, [...] "Well, what's the answer?" [...] But before Frank could tell him, Jake started up and pointed to the end of the rainbow, where it seemed to go into the ground against the woods.|$|E
50|$|None of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>men</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Cyber Leader {{will keep}} his word about letting them escape, {{but they have}} to keep moving towards the target zone as they are being monitored.

5000|$|Allal hurriedly {{returned}} to his house. Unfortunately the men continued the chase and saw him enter the house. Although Allal's human form was still lying on the floor, there was not time for Allal to transition back into it.

50|$|However, these noble {{plans are}} thwarted by the play's final plot twist. Fräulein Doktor Mathilde von Zahnd, head of Les Cerisiers, enters {{the drawing room}} and reveals to <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> she has {{eavesdropped}} on their entire conversation. Furthermore, she has known about Möbius for years and has been secretly copying his documents and using his scientific discoveries to construct an international empire.

50|$|In September 1965 Exeter {{earned a}} place in UFO history when two Exeter police officers, Eugene Bertrand and David Hunt, {{witnessed}} a bright red UFO at close range with a local teenager, Norman Muscarello.

5000|$|It {{was later}} claimed, through {{an article in}} the Sinn Féin {{newspaper}} An Phoblacht, Dignam had been detained by the RUC over Perry's disappearance in the summer of 1991.

5000|$|When on the Grassy Knoll, Lister, Rimmer and Cat {{are dressed}} up as tramps, an outfit which the {{normally}} vain and shallow Cat would not be seen dead in: [...] "Superficial is my middle name".

50|$|A {{book titled}} Rocky Goes West by author Paul Toohey claims that, in 1979, Rockefeller's mother hired a private {{investigator}} to go to New Guinea and try to resolve the mystery of his disappearance. The reliability of the story has been questioned, but Toohey claims that the private investigator swapped a boat engine for the skulls of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> a tribe claimed were the only white men they had ever killed.

However, the History Channel program Vanishings reported that Rockefeller's mother did pay a $250,000 reward to the investigator which was offered for final proof whether or not Michael Rockefeller was alive or dead.|$|E

5000|$|The 5th Wheel was a spinoff {{show that}} was created after the huge success of the sister show, {{featuring}} more provocative and sexual content and airing between 2001 to 2004. Each episode would begin {{with a group of}} four daters divided 2/2 by gender. After all combinations of man/woman spent some time together and interviewed (privately) how they felt things were going, the titular [...] "5th Wheel" [...] would be introduced. The 5W person could either be male or female and would compete with the now-trio of the 3/2 gender split for the affections of the remaining 2 men/women. At the end of the show, all of the contestants would say who they wanted to go out with again (or fairly often, they'd say [...] "none of these jackasses") and if there was a Tinder-style match the couple would usually hug and kiss and then interview that they were looking forward to seeing each other outside the show. While there was almost always one person left dateless, there were exceptions to this: in one episode a man and woman chose each other but the remaining two women BOTH chose the remaining man and he also chose both of them, and in another the two women were so grossed out by <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>that</b> they both chose none of them and left them in miserable loser-dom.|$|E
