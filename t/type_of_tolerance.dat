Nonetheless, solutions to other areas such as setup planning and fixturing remain elusive. Setup planning research has received increased attention in recent years. The importance <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> analysis in setup planning has been recognised. However, {{due to the lack}} of a common measure for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerances,</b> the analysis is carried out in an ad hoc fashion and often results in suboptimal setup plans. In this paper, a tolerance normalisation approach is presented to provide an accurate means for direct comparison <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> geometric <b>tolerances</b> and dimensional tolerances.

50|$|Worst-case {{tolerance}} {{analysis is}} the traditional <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> stackup calculation. The individual variables are placed at their tolerance limits {{in order to make}} the measurement as large or as small as possible. The worst-case model does not consider the distribution of the individual variables, but rather that those variables do not exceed their respective specified limits. This model predicts the maximum expected variation of the measurement. Designing to worst-case tolerance requirements guarantees 100 percent of the parts will assemble and function properly, regardless of the actual component variation. The major drawback is that the worst-case model often requires very tight individual component tolerances. The obvious result is expensive manufacturing and inspection processes and/or high scrap rates. Worst-case tolerancing is often required by the customer for critical mechanical interfaces and spare part replacement interfaces. When worst-case tolerancing is not a contract requirement, properly applied statistical tolerancing can ensure acceptable assembly yields with increased component tolerances and lower fabrication costs.|$|E

40|$|Cycloxydim-Tolerant Maize (CTM) was {{developed}} by researches at the University of Minnesota. CTM plants were regenerated from tissue culture selected for callus growth {{in the presence of}} cycloxydim, and the resulting plants were shown to contain a nuclear mutation, expressed as a single, partially dominant gene (known as Acc 1) that conferred tolerance to the herbicide. Cycloxydim is a systemic herbicide for post emergence application in dicot crops to selectively control grass weeds. Corn, like most grasses is susceptible to cycloxydim due to inhibited acetyl-coenzyimeA carboxylaze enzyme activity. There are two key benefits of this technology: first, cycloxydim applications in CTM hybrids can be delayed until the weed spectrum and population density exceed agro-economic threshold; second, cycloxydim can be applied at either stage of plant development with no effect on basic agronomic traits, compared to non treated plants. Nevertheless, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> requires 2 genes to be fully effective, i. e. gene must be present in both inbred parents to provide complete tolerance in the resulting hybrid. Such <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> doubles the chances for yield drag and doubles the number of inbred conversions needed. This also limits germplasm integration and increases time lag in developing hybrids. Despite these difficulties, many seed companies introduce tolerance to cycloxydim into their commercial inbreds, and many of them have already commercialized CTM hybrids. Finally, it came as a logical question what is more important – hybrid performance or new trait? Critical to the success of this technology has been yield performance of CTM hybrids. At the same time, performance and herbicide tolerance do not exclude each other and can surely co-exist. To be accepted, this coexistence must secure high profitability to corn producers. However, CTM hybrids will not replace conventional ones on a large scale, but {{could be used as a}} specific tool, or could enhance the use of alternative weed control options in corn production...|$|E

40|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of many experimental fevers {{is the development}} of a diminished reactivity, usually defined as "tolerance, " to repeated inoculations of the pyrogenic agent. In the case of Gram-negative endotoxins, tolerance generally appears gradually, reaches its maximum in the 2 nd week of dally injections, and persists for several weeks after inoculations are discontinued (1). Since tolerance lapses after a short rest period when antibody titers are still elevated, and may be abolished by blockade of the reticuloendothelial system (2), it clearly does not depend entirely upon specific humoral immunity. Furthermore, tolerance to one endotoxin confers a cross-tolerance to endotoxins of other Gram-negative organisms but there is a degree of specificity since endotoxin-tolerant animals are fully responsive to unrelated pyrogenic agents (3 - 8). In contrast, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> which characteristically follows one or more injections of myxovirus is transient, and less specific in that the host may be rendered less reactive to entirely different pyrogenic stimuli.

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} a closer {{inspection}} <b>of</b> how <b>tolerance</b> and politics interact. Within geography and beyond there is rising concern about post-political situations, whereby potential disagreements are foreclosed and situated beyond the remit of political debate. This is conceptualised {{as a process of}} de-politicisation that operates ‘much more effectively’than alternative ways in which politics can be and has been disavowed (Žižek, 1999 : 198). While Žižek associates liberal tolerance with the post-political condition, however, theories <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> are at odds over whether it represents an everyday enactment of the political. Although some authors have indeed associated tolerance with a depoliticising tendency (Brown, 2006), others insist that certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> are capable <b>of</b> nurturing simultaneous recognition and disagreement, which directly contradicts the conditions of post-politics (Forst, 2003).

This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> can be due both to passive T-cell anergy and active immunosuppression. Using ovalbumin-fed mice we studied whether putatively immunostimulatory cytokines could break {{this state of}} mucosal tolerance. Cytokines were administered locally {{at the site of}} attempted sensitization. It was found that neither interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) nor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) could restore the response to immunization. In contrast, local administration of IL- 12 at the site of attempted immunization resulted in full recovery of DTH reactivity. The dichotomy between the two Th 1 stimulatory cytokines IFN-gamma and IL- 12 was also reflected by different effects on ovalbumin-specific antibody isotypes. Although both IFN-gamma and IL- 12 downregulated serum IgG 1 -levels in tolerant mice, suggesting decreased ovalbumin-specific Th 2 function, only local administration of IL- 12 led to increased serum IgG 2 a levels.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of guinea pigs with 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl (DNP) t derivatives of the copolymer of D-glutamic acid and D-lysine (D-GL) induces {{a state of}} specific immunologic tolerance in the recipient (1). The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> induced is unusual {{in that it is}} DNP specific. That is, challenge of such guinea pigs with a DNP conjugate of ovalbumin (DNP-OVA) elicits anti-DNP responses markedly smaller than those of animals which have not been pretreated with DNP-B-GL. The degree of depression in responsiveness is related to the dose of tolerogen, to the mode of immunization with DNP-OVA, and to the interval between the two events. A similar type of haptenspecific tolerance, in mice, has recently been described by both Hraba et al. (2) and by Golan and Borel (3).

This phenomenon may be clearly dissociated from the classical immune response by its rapid onset, relatively short duration, non-specificity and lack of correlation with serum antibody levels. Crucial evidence for the difference is the observation that patients with agammaglobulinemia acquire tolerance to serial injections of endotoxin in a normal fashion (6). In several respects, tolerance to the pyrogenic effects of the various viruses in the influenza group resembles that occurring with endotoxins. It is also relatively non-specific, with the injection of one virus conferring a certain degree of cross-tolerance to other viruses in the same group. Virus tolerance likewise cannot be correlated with serum antibody levels and is of brief duration: approximately 11 days as compared with 3 weeks in the case of endotoxins (7).

40|$|Object {{recognition}} requires both selectivity {{among different}} objects and tolerance to vastly different retinal {{images of the}} same object, resulting from natural variation in (e. g.) position, size, illumination, and clutter. Thus, discovering neuronal responses that have object selectivity and tolerance to identity-preserving transformations is fundamental to understanding object recognition. Although selectivity and tolerance are found {{at the highest level}} of the primate ventral visual stream [the inferotemporal cortex (IT) ], both properties are highly varied and poorly understood. If an IT neuron has very sharp selectivity for a unique combination of object features ("diagnostic features"), this might automatically endow it with high tolerance. However, this relationship cannot be taken as given; although some IT neurons are highly object selective and some are highly tolerant, the empirical connection of these key properties is unknown. In this study, we systematically measured both object selectivity and tolerance to different identity-preserving image transformations in the spiking responses of a population of monkey IT neurons. We found that IT neurons with high object selectivity typically have low tolerance (and vice versa), regardless of how object selectivity was quantified and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> examined. The discovery of this trade-off illuminates object selectivity and tolerance in IT and unifies a range of previous, seemingly disparate results. This finding also argues against the idea that diagnostic conjunctions of features guarantee tolerance.

Northern hardwood (A. saccharum, B. alleghaniensis, and F. grandifolia) {{and other species}} of the Northeastern U.S. display large declines in stomatal conductance with little change in leaf water potential during drought (Federer and Gee 1976; Kubiske and Abrams 1994). Species are also capable of permitting and tolerating declines in leaf water potential (e.g., anisohydry); however, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> strategy appears to be less common.

Adaptations that enable Northeastern U.S. tree species to tolerate lower water potentials generally include adjustments in osmotic potential (Parker et al. 1982; Kubiske and Abrams 1994) or cell wall thickness (Kubiske and Abrams 1994) to sustain or minimize reductions in cell turgor pressure. Within the Northeastern U.S. there is some evidence for osmotic adjustments, particularly for species growing in more xeric sites (Kubiske and Abrams 1994).
