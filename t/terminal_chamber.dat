6000|$|... "Mr. Murray has {{combined}} with a careful examination of the soundings a constant use of the tow-net, usually at the surface, but also at depths of from ten to one hundred fathoms; and he finds the closest relation to exist between the surface fauna of any particular locality and the deposit which is taking place at the bottom. In all seas, from the equator to the polar ice, the tow-net contains Globigerinoe. They are more abundant and of a larger size in warmer seas; several varieties, attaining a large size and presenting marked varietal characters, {{are found in the}} intertropical area of the Atlantic. In the latitude of Kerguelen they are less numerous and smaller, while further south they are still more dwarfed, and only one variety, the typical Globigerina bulloides, is represented. The living Globigerinoe from the tow-net are singularly different in appearance from the dead shells we find at the bottom. The shell is clear and transparent, and each of the pores which penetrate it is surrounded by a raised crest, the crest round adjacent pores coalescing into a roughly hexagonal network, so that the pores appear to lie {{at the bottom of a}} hexagonal pit. At each angle of this hexagon the crest gives off a delicate flexible calcareous spine, which is sometimes four or five times the diameter of the shell in length. The spines radiate symmetrically from the direction of the centre of each chamber of the shell, and the sheaves of long transparent needles crossing one another in different directions have a very beautiful effect. The smaller inner chambers of the shell are entirely filled with an orange-yellow granular sarcode; and the large <b>terminal</b> <b>chamber</b> usually contains only a small irregular mass, or two or three small masses run together, of the same yellow sarcode stuck against one side, the remainder of the chamber being empty. No definite arrangement and no approach to structure was observed in the sarcode, and no differentiation, with the exception of round bright-yellow oil-globules, very much like those found in some of the radiolarians, which are scattered, apparently irregularly, in the sarcode. We never have been able to detect, in any of the large number of Globigerinoe which we have examined, the least trace of pseudopodia, or any extension, in any form, of the sarcode beyond the shell.|$|E

5000|$|There are two siphon {{sections}} {{where the}} aqueduct cross low {{spots in the}} terrain. The western of these crosses the Sudbury River, and consists of a steel pipe 3605 ft in length that is built over the river as an arch mounted on stone abutments the eastern one crosses Happy Hollow and under Massachusetts Route 126, and is 1100 ft long. At {{each end of the}} siphons stands a control house that is 21 ft square, styled similarly to the metering chambers. At the Weston end of the aqueduct is a channel chamber, a 17' by 24' hip-roofed structure from which the flow into the open channel can be regulated. The open channel is 1500 feet long and about 20 feet, and is lined with riprap. The open channel is spanned by the Ash Street Bridge, a concrete arch bridge faced in stone. The Weston Reservoir was carefully designed by the Olmsted Brothers to appear natural; the final element of the aqueduct is the <b>terminal</b> <b>chamber</b> near the reservoir outlet, from which distribution pipes channel the water onward. The building housing the <b>terminal</b> <b>chamber</b> is larger and more elaborate than the other structures, but is similarly styled.|$|E

40|$|Burrowing arachnids are {{important}} to modern soil ecosystems, but knowledge of these animals in ancient soil ecosystems is limited. In this study, two species of bur-rowing spiders were studied: Gorgyrella inermis (South African trapdoor spider) and Hogna lenta (field wolf spider). Individuals of each species were studied to investigate their burrowing techniques and behaviors and to categorize the morphologies of their burrows. Experiments were run with variations in sediment density and sediment mois-ture to evaluate the effects of environmental conditions on burrow morphology. Seven burrow architectures were produced by the spiders: vertical shafts, vertical shafts with <b>terminal</b> <b>chambers,</b> subvertical shafts, subvertical shafts with <b>terminal</b> <b>chambers,</b> J-shaped burrows, Y-shaped burrows, and isolated chambers. All burrow architectures share common features that make them identifiable as spider burrows. Sediment den-sity and moisture had little influence on burrow morphology, but architecture diversity was greatest in sediments of moderate density and moisture. Results from this study show that spiders produce unique biogenic structures that can be distinguished from the burrows of other soil organisms. Data collected from this study {{can be used to}} bet-ter interpret the paleoecology and evolutionary history of spiders and soil arthropods...|$|R

5000|$|Burials in gallery graves {{were made}} in the gallery itself, or in small burial {{chambers}} opening off the gallery. This is known as a [...] "complex gallery grave". When the adjacent burial chambers are paired, the structure is known as a [...] "transepted gallery grave". Gallery graves may also have their galleries subdivided by interior stone slabs. These are known as [...] "segmented gallery graves". When two parallel galleries lead to a single <b>terminal</b> burial <b>chamber,</b> this is known as a [...] "parallel gallery grave".|$|R
5000|$|The tumulus (or [...] "barrow") {{covering}} a gallery grave may be ovate or long. The {{sides of the}} tumulus may be parallel or not. The tumulus was designed so {{that the end of}} the gallery (or the <b>terminal</b> burial <b>chamber,</b> if one existed) was at the center of the tumulus. A tumulus may contain several gallery graves radiating outward from the center. Since the earth atop the gallery grave was only loosely piled up, it often washed away due to erosion. Many gallery graves today lie exposed to the air, when originally they would have lain deep within a tumulus.|$|R
50|$|Phillips's {{kangaroo}} rat is nocturnal {{and lives in}} a burrow by day. Some burrows have a single entrance about 7.5 cm in diameter, entering the ground at a slight angle, while others have several entrances a metre or so apart. The tunnels consist of curved cylindrical tubes about 5 cm in diameter and a <b>terminal</b> <b>chamber.</b> Phillips' {{kangaroo rat}} forages on calm nights, even in frosty weather, but do not venture out during severe storms.

50|$|Globigerinoides sacculifer {{exhibits}} {{two different}} morphologies, known as G. sacculifer with sac and G. sacculifer without sac. The sac feature is a sac shaped <b>terminal</b> <b>chamber</b> that is formed {{prior to the}} production of the gametogenic calcite. When using G. sacculifer tests for bulk isotope analysis tests without the sac morphology are often preferentially selected. G. sacculifer is also notable for certain in vivo experiments that have been conducted on it. It was found that individuals of this species are able to reconstruct their tests after injury when subjected to slight crushing in a laboratory setting. These repaired tests would often have nonstandard morphologies.|$|E
50|$|It was {{determined}} that the tunnel would be redundant to the existing Hultman Aqueduct by connecting Shaft C on the existing Cosgrove Tunnel in the west with Shaft 5 on the existing City Tunnel, and with the Weston Aqueduct <b>Terminal</b> <b>Chamber</b> Area in the east end. These criteria resulted in terminal connections at Shafts D, 5A and W, respectively, and definition of the general alignment of the tunnel facility. Additional major connections to existing MWRA transmission facilities resulted in Shaft E, Shaft L, Shaft NW and Shaft NE. Connections to serve community clients resulted in the five small diameter riser shafts to supply water to customers along the tunnel alignment.|$|E
40|$|Large benthic foraminifera (LBF) are {{prolific}} {{producers of}} calcium carbonate sediments in shallow, tropical environments {{that are being}} influenced by ocean acidification (OA). Two LBF species, Amphistegina gibbosa (Order Rotaliida) with low-Mg calcite tests and Archaias angulatus (Order Miliolida) with high-Mg calcite tests, were studied to assess the effects of pH 7. 6 on oxygen and carbon isotopic fractionation between test calcite and ambient seawater. The delta 18 O and delta 13 C values of <b>terminal</b> <b>chambers</b> and of whole adult tests of both species after 6 weeks {{were not significantly different}} between pH treatments of 8. 0 and 7. 6. However, tests of juveniles produced during the 6 -week treatments showed significant differences between delta 18 O and delta 13 C values from control (pH 8. 0) when compared with the treatment (pH 7. 6) for both species. Although each individual's growth was photographed and measured, difficulty in distinguishing and manually extracting newly precipitated calcite from adult specimens likely confounded any differences in isotopic signals. However, juvenile specimens that resulted from asexual reproduction that occurred during the experiments did not contain old carbonate that could confound the new isotopic signals. These data reveal a potential bias in the design of OA experiments if only adults are used to investigate changes in test chemistries. Furthermore, the results reaffirm that different calcification mechanisms in these two foraminiferal orders control the fractionation of stable isotopes in the tests and will reflect decreasing pH in seawater somewhat differently...|$|R

50|$|The cave {{is unique}} within the UK {{in that the}} first chamber has been formed {{by the action of}} the sea, whereas the inner {{chambers}} are freshwater passages, formed from rainwater dissolving the carbonate dolostones. Partway through the cave the waters of Allt Smoo also drop in as a 20m high waterfall. This is mainly due to the nearby dolostone - quartzite geological boundary where the Allt Smoo stream crosses the impermeable quartzites and sinks on meeting the permeable dolostones. Essentially the cave {{can be thought of as}} two caves formed by different mechanisms which have joined together over time. The cave is composed of three main sections; a large sea cave entrance chamber, a waterfall chamber and a short freshwater passage which leads to a <b>terminal</b> sump <b>chamber</b> with some interesting flowstone formations at the rear.|$|R
50|$|The Chestnut Hill Reservoir {{was built}} between 1865 and 1870 to {{supplement}} {{the capacity of the}} Brookline Reservoir, which was then the terminus of the Cochituate Aqueduct. The Sudbury Aqueduct was completed in 1878, providing water to the reservoir from the Sudbury River in Boston's western suburbs. Its <b>terminal</b> <b>chamber,</b> a single-story granite Romanesque structure with a hip roof, stands across Beacon Street from the reservoir, and houses gates for controlling flow into the reservoir from both the Cochituate Aqueduct (now defunct) and the Sudbury Aqueduct (in backup service), and from the reservoir to the Brookline Reservoir.

5000|$|The inland robust {{scorpion}} builds and {{resides in}} a spiral burrow in the sand. A field study near Broken Hill measured the burrows and found {{they all had}} the same basic structure: a sloping entrance chamber {{to a depth of}} 8-10 cm, followed by up to nine spiral turns leading to a lower horizontal <b>terminal</b> <b>chamber.</b> The depth of the burrow and number of spiral turns depended on the instar of the scorpion; the younger (2nd instar) scorpion burrows were 15-20 cm deep while those of the oldest (6th instar) scorpions reached a depth of around 100 cm. The scorpion digs by moving sand with its chelicerae and scraping it backwards under successive pairs of legs. The amount of sand removed can be 200-400 times its own weight. Experiments showed inland robust scorpions could build burrows in 8-10 hours.|$|E
50|$|Females {{lay their}} eggs about one to two months after mating. The nesting season can fall in nearly every month of the year. In the {{northern}} extremes of the distribution (i.e. Somalia ot Egypt), the nesting season is December through February while in the southern limits (i.e. South Africa or Tanzania) is in August through December. In crocodiles between these distributions egg-laying is in intermediate months, often focused between April and July. The dates correspond to about {{a month or two}} into the dry season within that given region. The benefits of this are presumably that nest flooding risk is considerably reduced at this time and the stage at which hatchlings begin their lives out of the egg falls roughly {{at the beginning of the}} rainy season, when water levels are still relatively low but insect prey is in recovery. Preferred nesting locations are sandy shores, dry stream beds, or riverbanks. The female digs a hole a few metres from the bank and up to 500 mm (20 in) deep, and lays on average between 25 and 80 eggs. The number of eggs varies and depends partially on the size of the female. The most significant prerequisites to a nesting site are soil with the depth to permit the female to dig out the nest mound, shading to which mother can retire during the heat of the day and access to water. She finds a spot soft enough to allow her to dig a sideways slanted burrow. The mother Nile crocodile deposits the eggs in the <b>terminal</b> <b>chamber</b> and packs the sand or earth back over the nest pit. While, like all crocodilians, the Nile crocodile digs out a hole for a nest site, unlike most other modern crocodilians, female Nile crocodiles bury their eggs in sand or soil rather than incubate them in rotting vegetation. The female may micturate sporadically on the soil to keep it moist, which prevents soil from hardening excessively. After burying the eggs, the female then guards them for the three-month incubation period. Nests have been recorded seldomly in concealed positions such as under a bush or in grasses, but normally in open spots on the bank. It is thought the Nile crocodile cannot nest under heavy forest cover as can two of the three other African crocodiles because they do not utilize rotting leaves (a very effective method of producing heat for the eggs) and thus require sunlight on sand or soil the surface of the egg chamber to provide the appropriate warmth for embryo development. In South Africa, the invasive plant Chromolaena odorata has recently exploded along banks traditionally used by crocodiles as nesting sites and caused nest failures by blocking sunlight over the nest chamber.|$|E

These disparate phyla are united by their means of moulting, but otherwise share few morphological characters—none {{of which has}} a meaningful fossilization potential. As such, the early evolutionary history of {{the group as a}} whole is largely uncharted.

40|$|A fossil {{discovery}} in the mid-Cretaceous Blackleaf Formation of southwest Montana, USA, has yielded the first trace and body fossil evidence of burrowing behaviour in a dinosaur. Skeletal remains {{of an adult}} and two juveniles of Oryctodromeus cubicularis gen. et sp. nov., a new species of hypsilophodont-grade dinosaur, {{were found in the}} expanded distal chamber of a sediment-filled burrow. Correspondence between burrow and adult dimensions supports Oryctodromeus as the burrow maker. Additionally, Oryctodromeus exhibits features of the snout, shoulder girdle and pelvis consistent with digging habits while retaining cursorial hindlimb proportions. Association of adult and young within a <b>terminal</b> <b>chamber</b> provides definitive evidence of extensive parental care in the Dinosauria. As with modern vertebrate cursors that dig, burrowing in Oryctodromeus may have been an important adaptation for the rearing of young. Burrowing also represents a mechanism by which small dinosaurs may have exploited the extreme environments of polar latitudes, deserts and high mountain areas. The ability among dinosaurs to find or make shelter may contradict some scenarios of the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event. Burrowing habits expand the known range of nonavian dinosaur behaviours and suggest that the cursorial ancestry of dinosaurs did not fully preclude the evolution of different functional regimes, such as fossoriality...|$|E
50|$|Walter Kidde, {{who was the}} trustee-in-{{bankruptcy}} for the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad after {{filing for}} bankruptcy reorganization in 1937, noticed that most commuter traffic was heading to Midtown Manhattan, and that the major railroads in the area had or little or no service to Midtown. The Lincoln Tunnel had been completed in 1937, and Kidde offered {{the idea that it}} might be faster for commuters to head to Midtown by connecting with bus companies that used State Highway Route S-3. A couple years later, Railway Age noted that it was common to backtrack from the Erie Railroad's Pavonia Ferry <b>terminal</b> at <b>Chambers</b> Street to midtown. This new connection would save money for commuters from Paterson, Hackensack and Butler to get service to Times Square.However, the idea immediately met opposition by bus companies and the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad when the Susquehanna went forward with proposing this new service in 1938. The Interstate Commerce Commission held hearings during 1938 and 1939 and in May 1939, the rulings fell in favor of the Susquehanna. During this time period, Kidde had proposed bustituting (replacing rail with bus) between North Hawthorne and Butler, but this was torpedoed by neighborhoods opposing the change, such as Pompton Lakes as well as a jump in ridership.|$|R
5000|$|Some gallery graves {{were not}} {{rectangular}} in shape, but rather narrowed toward the rear. These {{are known as}} wedge-shaped gallery graves. The ceilings of wedge-shaped gallery graves often sloped toward the rear, and a sill of stone set some distance inside the away from the entrance or one or two slabs set upright in the earth defined a sort of antechamber. The wedge-shaped gallery grave was usually topped by a cairn (covering of stones) rather than an earthen mound (or [...] "tumulus"), although an earthen mound was sometimes used. The cross-sectional shape of the cairn could be round, oval, or D-shaped, and often a kerb (ring of stone) was used to help revet the cairn and keep it in place. Some wedge-shaped gallery graves had curved rear walls, while others were linear. A few had the <b>terminal</b> burial <b>chamber</b> {{at the rear of}} the gallery, although this was usually blocked off. Wedge-shaped gallery graves sometimes had a set of outer walls.

40|$|Cardiac {{activity}} of Drosophila melanogaster and Manduca sexta changes during metamorphosis. The larval heart has only anterograde contractions. Adult heart activity becomes a cyclic alternation of anterograde and retrograde contractions originated by putative anterograde and retrograde pacemakers. During development, the larval skeletal muscle motoneuron- 1 in abdominal segments 7 and 8 becomes respecified to innervate the terminal cardiac chamber of adult Manduca and undergoes morphological and physiological reorganization. MNs- 1 activate and sustain the anterograde pacemaker {{activity of}} the <b>terminal</b> <b>chamber.</b> The innervation of the adult abdominal heart of Drosophila melanogaster was studied {{to determine whether the}} adult heart receives neuronal input or whether its complex activity must be considered independent from the nervous system. The larval heart lacks innervation suggesting a myogenic cardiac impulse. At metamorphosis, neural processes grow onto the myocardium. A pair of glutamatergic transverse nerves innervates bilaterally each cardiac chamber. In addition, CCAP-immunoreactive fibers originating from peripheral, bipolar neurons (BpNs) fasciculate with the transverse nerve projections and terminate segmentally throughout the abdominal heart. To determine the role of this innervation in cardiac function, a novel optical technique based on the movement of GFP-labeled nerve terminals was developed to monitor heartbeat in intact preparations. Simultaneous monitoring of adjacent cardiac chambers revealed the direction of contractions and allowed correlation with volume changes. Intracellular recordings from the first abdominal cardiac chamber, the conical chamber, revealed pacemaker action potentials and the excitatory effect of local glutamate application. Bath-applied glutamate initiated retrograde contractions in semi-intact preparations. Similarly, electrical stimulation of the transverse nerve that serves the conical chamber caused a chronotropic effect and initiation of retrograde contractions. This effect is distinct from that of peripheral CCAP-immunoreactive neurons, which potentiate the anterograde beat. Cardiac reversal was evoked pharmacologically by sequentially applying CCAP and glutamate to the heart. The role of the neuropeptide, Crustacean Cardioactive Peptide (CCAP) in adult Drosophila melanogaster cardiac function was studied by RNA interference (RNAi) and targeted cell ablation. CCAP has a cardioacceleratory effect when it is applied in vitro. Lack of CCAP-innervation in CCAP knock-out flies altered one cardiac phase, the anterograde beat, without preventing the cyclic cardiac reversal...|$|E
