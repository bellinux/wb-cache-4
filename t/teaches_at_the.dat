25|$|Later, Marxist {{political}} thinker Louis Althusser was {{a student}} at ENS and taught there for many years, and many of his disciples later became known for their own thought: among them were Étienne Balibar, philosopher Alain Badiou, who still <b>teaches</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school as an emeritus professor, and Jacques Rancière. Still later, in the 1940s and 1950s, the world-renowned thinker Michel Foucault, founder of the history of systems of thought and future professor at the Collège de France {{was a student}} a few years ahead of the founder of deconstruction, Jacques Derrida and the thinker of individuation Gilbert Simondon. The tradition continues today through such philosophers as Jacques Bouveresse, Jean-Luc Marion, Claudine Tiercelin and Quentin Meillassoux, and the school has also produced prominent public intellectuals like Stéphane Hessel and such New Philosophers as Bernard-Henri Lévy and Benny Lévy.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the late}} 20th century and early 21st century {{there has been a}} revival in {{interest}} in Kabbalah in all branches of liberal Judaism. The Kabbalistic 12th-century prayer Anim Zemirot was restored to the new Conservative Sim Shalom siddur, as was the B'rikh Shmeh passage from the Zohar, and the mystical Ushpizin service welcoming to the Sukkah the spirits of Jewish forbearers. Anim Zemirot and the 16th-century mystical poem Lekhah Dodi reappeared in the Reform Siddur Gates of Prayer in 1975. All Rabbinical seminaries now teach several courses in Kabbalah—in Conservative Judaism, both the Jewish Theological Seminary and the Ziegler School of Rabbinical Studies of the University of Judaism in Los Angeles have full-time instructors in Kabbalah and Hasidut, Eitan Fishbane and Pinchas Giller, respectively. In the Reform movement Sharon Koren <b>teaches</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew Union College. Reform Rabbis like Herbert Weiner and Lawrence Kushner have renewed interest in Kabbalah among Reform Jews. At the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, the only accredited seminary that has curricular requirements in Kabbalah, Joel Hecker is the full-time instructor teaching courses in Kabbalah and Hasidut.|$|E

500|$|Holby City storylines {{are planned}} eight months in advance. The series utilises {{a number of}} scriptwriters, who are found and {{scheduled}} by script development editor Simon Harper. Harper receives around 20 speculative scripts a week, and also finds writers through the BBC Writers Academy, a course established in 2005 which guarantees its graduates {{the opportunity to work}} on prime time television. McHale <b>teaches</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> academy, and graduate Abi Bown {{went on to become a}} regular writer for Holby City. Harper also recruits writers through the BBC's Continuing Drama Shadow Scheme, open to writers from all levels of experience. He believes that scripts which demonstrate synthesis between guest and serial storylines are [...] "the spine of the show", and has stated that, [...] "Good, cracking, intelligent, ballsy dialogue is a must," [...] explaining: [...] "It's about getting the characters' voices because the characters drive these shows. It is a love for and investment in these characters and the consistency of those characters." [...] Harper does not require that writers are necessarily familiar with the show, and would like to attract more female scriptwriters.|$|E
500|$|Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute, which {{promotes}} intelligent design, contested this, saying, [...] "the problem for their logic is that ID {{is not an}} arbitrary explanation, because we have much experience with intelligent agents producing the type of informational complexity we see in nature." [...] Columnist Jeff Jacoby wrote in The Boston Globe that intelligent design [...] "isn't primitivism or Bible-thumping or flying spaghetti. It's science." [...] This view of science, however, {{was rejected by the}} United States National Academy of Sciences. Peter Gallings of Answers in Genesis, a Young Earth Creationist ministry said [...] "Ironically enough, , in addition to mocking God himself, are lampooning the Intelligent Design Movement for not identifying a specific deity—that is, leaving open the possibility that a spaghetti monster could be the intelligent designer... Thus, the satire is possible because the Intelligent Design Movement hasn’t affiliated with a particular religion, exactly the opposite of what its other critics claim!" [...] Mark Coppenger, a pastor who <b>teaches</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, commented, [...] "I'm happy to say I think FSM hurts the evolutionists' program since, by mocking the Christian tradition... it reinforces the correct impression that there is genuine contempt for biblical faith in that camp... Besides, the parody is lame, and there are few things more encouraging than cheap shots from one's opponents." ...|$|E

500|$|Niffenegger is {{an artist}} who <b>teaches</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She {{produced}} some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that The Time Traveler's Wife {{would have to be}} a novel: [...] "I got the idea for the title, and when I draw I have this big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So I wrote down this title and after a while I started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel." [...] She was intrigued by the title because [...] "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel Man and Time: [...] "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." [...] Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, [...] "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." [...] Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.|$|E
