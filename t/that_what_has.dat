Stewie then claims that he is not yet ready to kill Lois or take over the world, until the right time. Brian tells Stewie that hypothetical viewers would be angered by the simulation. Stewie counters by saying that at least the simulation didn't end like the final episode of The Sopranos, where it just cut to black mid-sentence. As Stewie is saying this, the scene cuts to black mid-sentence.|$|E

500|$|Madonna's {{music has}} been the subject of much {{analysis}} and scrutiny. Robert M. Grant, author of Contemporary Strategy Analysis (2005), commented <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> brought Madonna success is [...] "certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist, musician, dancer, songwriter, or actress, Madonna's talents seem modest." [...] He asserts Madonna's success is in relying on the talents of others, and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career. Madonna's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of [...] "Find a winning formula and stick to it." [...] Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Grant concluded that [...] "having established herself as the queen of popular music, Madonna did not stop there, but continued re-inventing." [...] Musicologist Susan McClary wrote that [...] "Madonna's art itself repeatedly deconstructs the traditional notion of the unified subject with finite ego boundaries. Her pieces explore various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition." [...] According to Thomas Harrison in the book Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties, Madonna was [...] "an artist who pushed the boundaries" [...] of what a female singer could do, both visually and lyrically.|$|E

[...] Such experiences seem particularly liable to occur to those who deliberately cultivate lucid dreams. [...] However, they may also occur spontaneously and be associated with the experience of sleep paralysis.|$|E

2500|$|Tsai's {{music has}} been the subject of music {{analysis}} and scrutiny. China Times commented <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> brought Tsai success is [...] "certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist or dancer, Tsai's talents seem modest." [...] It asserts Tsai's success is mostly due to her effort and diligence. Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images. Grant concluded that having established herself as the [...] "Queen of C-pop", Tsai did not stop there, but continued re-inventing. Before emerging as a dance-pop star, Tsai began her career as a teen idol. Since the release of her debut album, 1019 (1999), which foreshadowed several trends in her later works, Tsai has spent her early years in teen pop that mainly appealed to teenagers. Her early dance-pop roots can be found on her second studio album, Don't Stop (2000). Tsai moved to dance-pop direction with Magic (2003), mixing nu-disco and hip hop music with dance tunes. The album's songs reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, and she continued to make dance songs for Castle (2004) and J-game (2005). Her mature artistic statement was visible in Dancing Diva (2006) and Agent J (2007). With Dancing Diva, Tsai began as a dance music diva, in an era that did not have any such Chinese singers to speak of, and she had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music in Greater China. Myself (2010) and Muse (2012) largely focused in electronic dance music, which she has embraced since Dancing Diva. Myself is considered among her most adventurous, with almost all tracks are pure dance songs, which had never previously attempted by any Chinese singer. Muse incorporated different genres of music, including progressive house, trance, and techno music. Tsai experimented with more dubstep and trap music in Play (2014). According to Today newspaper, the album [...] "melds dance hall with bubblegum pop, breathtaking love songs with hilariously catty weirdness and euphorically catchy melodies with propulsive rhythms." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sacrifice is {{the story}} of Gilthas, the weak son of Tanis Half-Elven and Laurana. [...] It begins with two elves meeting with Dalamar the Dark, a black-robed mage, gaining his help to trap Gilthas in Qualinesti that he might become a puppet ruler of the elves. [...] The scene goes to Gilthas, the {{protected}} and weak youth, who is rebellious against his parents. [...] He receives a letter from a Qualinesti Senator, Rashas, to meet him in an inn, and Gilthas runs off to do so. Tanis goes after him and discovers signs that make him believe that Gilthas was ambushed, though it is in fact not true. [...] Dalamar appears to him and Tanis is knocked out. [...] Gilthas's fate is revealed; he was met by Rashas, who rode a griffin, and taken to Qualinost, capital of the elves. [...] There, he is taken to a room where the elven Queen Alhana Starbreeze resides against her will. [...] Rashas goes to make preparation for Gilthas's coronation, and Gilthas is forced to stay in the city. [...] Dalamar reveals to Tanis that Gilthas is to be made king of the Qualinesti, and they begin to make plans. [...] Gilthas is told he will be crowned the next day. [...] Dalamar reveals to Tanis <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> transpired has destroyed the chance for a massive alliance as was planned, thanks to Rashas. [...] Alhana's servant Samar comes to rescue them, but Rashas arrives in time to stop it. [...] Samar is arrested, and Gilthas and Alhana are separated. [...] Gilthas tells Rashas he will not swear the oath to become King, but Rashas threatens to kill Alhana if he doesn't; Gilthas agrees. [...] Tanis and Dalamar, aided by magic, go to try to stop the coronation, and when Tanis commands Gilthas to take off the medallion that allows him to be King, Gilthas refuses and swears to become Speaker. [...] Dalamar and Tanis rescue Alhana, and after Dalamar escapes the pair of them are exiled from Qualinesti. [...] Tanis is sent to the border where he meets Dalamar and discovers Alhana has already gone on with Samar. [...] Gilthas appears to say good-bye to his father, and after he does so returns to Qualinesti. [...] Tanis and Dalamar then depart.|$|E
2500|$|Up to and {{including}} Rashi, the Talmudic commentators occupied themselves only with the plain meaning ("peshaṭ") of the text; but after {{the beginning of the}} twelfth century the spirit of criticism took possession of the teachers of the Talmud. Thus some of Rashi's continuators, as his sons-in-law and his grandson Samuel ben Meïr (RaSHBaM), while they wrote commentaries on the Talmud after the manner of Rashi's, wrote also glosses on it in a style peculiar to themselves. The chief characteristic of the Tosafot is that in spite of the great respect in which Rashi was held by the Tosafists, the latter freely corrected him. Besides, the Tosafot do not constitute a continuous commentary, but like the [...] "Dissensiones" [...] to the Roman Code of {{the first quarter of the}} twelfth century, deal only with the difficult passages of the Talmudic text. Single sentences are explained by quotations which are taken from other Talmudic treatises and which seem at first glance to have no connection with the sentences in question. On the other hand, sentences which seem to be related and interdependent are separated and embodied in different treatises. It must be added that the Tosafot can be understood only by those who are well advanced in the study of the Talmud, for the most entangled discussions are treated as though they were simple. Glosses explaining the meaning of a word or containing a grammatical observation are very rare. [...] The Tosafot may be considered from the point of view of a methodology of the Talmud. The rules are certainly not gathered together in one series, as they are, for instance, in Maimonides' introduction to the Mishnah; they are scattered in various parts, and their number is quite considerable. Neither are they stated in fixed terms; a generally accepted rule is followed by [...] "This is the way of the Talmud" [...] or [...] "The Talmud usually declares." [...] Sometimes the negative expression is found, [...] "This is not the way of the Talmud." [...] A frequently recurring rule is indicated by some such formula as [...] "We find many like this." [...] It must be borne in mind <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been said hitherto concerns the general features of the Tosafot, and does not conflict with the fact that the writings of different tosafists differ in style and method. With regard to method, it should be said that the Tosafot of Touques (see below) concern particularly the casuistic interpretation of the traditional law, but do not touch halakic decisions.|$|E
