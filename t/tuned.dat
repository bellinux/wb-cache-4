5000|$|Hakka Hill Songs is {{also called}} Jiu Qiang Shi Ba Diao(nine airs {{eighteen}} <b>tunes)</b> {{because of its}} various types of <b>tunes</b> created by different Hakka accents and environmental issues [...] The so-called nine airs are Hailu air, Sixian air, Raoping air, Fenglu air, Meixian air, Songkou air, Guangdong air, Guangnan air, Guangxi air, and the eighteen <b>tunes</b> are Pingban <b>tune,</b> Shangezi <b>tune,</b> Laoshange tune(also call South Wind <b>tune),</b> Siniange <b>tune,</b> Bingzige <b>tune,</b> Shibamo <b>tune,</b> Jianjianhua tune(also called the Ancients in December <b>tune),</b> Chuyizhao <b>tune,</b> Taohuakai <b>Tune,</b> Shangshancaica <b>tune,</b> Guanziren <b>tune,</b> Naowujin <b>tune,</b> Songjinchai <b>tune,</b> Dahaitang <b>tune,</b> Kuliniang <b>tune,</b> Xishoujin <b>tune,</b> Tiaomaijiu <b>tune,</b> Taohuaguodu tune(also called Chengchuange <b>tune),</b> and Xiuxiangbao <b>tune.</b> Hakka Hill Songs actually has more <b>tunes</b> than the above, but the other featureless ones are not recorded and so remained unknown. Hakka Hill songs includes the use of seventeen kinds of Hakka flat intonation, and seven kinds of oblique intonation. Its structure is usually four sentences each with seven words, and the first line,the second line and the fourth line often include flat intonation.|$|R

50|$|A <b>tuning</b> wrench (also {{called a}} <b>tuning</b> lever or <b>tuning</b> hammer) is a {{specialized}} socket wrench used to <b>tune</b> string instruments {{such as the}} piano, harp, and hammer dulcimer, that have strings wrapped around <b>tuning</b> pins. Other string instruments do not require a <b>tuning</b> wrench because their <b>tuning</b> pins or pegs come with handles (as with the violin), or geared <b>tuning</b> machines (as with the guitar or banjo).|$|R
5|$|In {{high-duty}} cycle echolocation, bats emit {{a continuous}} call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. The ears of these bats are sharply <b>tuned</b> {{to a specific}} frequency range. They emit calls outside this range to avoid deafening themselves. They then receive echoes back at the finely <b>tuned</b> frequency range {{by taking advantage of}} the Doppler shift of their motion in flight. The Doppler shift of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. These bats must deal with changes in the Doppler shift due to changes in their flight speed. They have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.|$|E

5|$|Since {{approximately}} 1850, clarinets {{have been}} nominally <b>tuned</b> according to twelve-tone equal temperament. Older clarinets were nominally <b>tuned</b> to meantone. A skilled performer can use {{his or her}} embouchure to considerably alter the tuning of individual notes or produce vibrato, a pulsating change of pitch often employed in jazz. Vibrato is rare in classical or concert band literature; however, certain clarinetists, such as Richard Stoltzman, use vibrato in classical music. Special fingerings {{may be used to}} play quarter tones and other microtonal intervals.|$|E
40|$|Fuzzy PID <b>tuning</b> {{requires}} {{two stages}} of tuning; low level <b>tuning</b> followed by high level <b>tuning.</b> At the higher level, a nonlinear <b>tuning</b> is performed to determine the nonlinear characteristics of the fuzzy output. At the lower level, a linear <b>tuning</b> is performed to determine the linear characteristics of the fuzzy output for achieving overall performance of fuzzy control. First, different fuzzy systems are defined and then simplified for two-point control. Non-linearity <b>tuning</b> diagrams are constructed for fuzzy systems in order to perform high level <b>tuning.</b> The linear <b>tuning</b> parameters are deduced from the conventional PID <b>tuning</b> knowledge.

5000|$|Among {{alternative}} tunings for guitar, a major-thirds <b>tuning</b> is {{a regular}} <b>tuning</b> in which each interval between successive open strings is a major third ("M3" [...] in musical abbreviation). Other names for major-thirds <b>tuning</b> include major-third <b>tuning,</b> M3 <b>tuning,</b> all-thirds <b>tuning,</b> and augmented <b>tuning.</b> By definition, a major-third interval separates two notes that differ by exactly four semitones (one-third of the twelve-note octave).|$|R
5000|$|In a radio receiver, a {{bandspread}} {{control is}} a secondary <b>tuning</b> control that allows accurate <b>tuning</b> of closely spaced frequencies of a radio band. With a main <b>tuning</b> control that covered {{a wide range of}} frequencies, for example 10-14 megahertz in a few turns of the <b>tuning</b> knob, a very small motion might change the <b>tuning</b> by tens of kilohertz and would make accurate <b>tuning</b> to any particular frequency difficult. A calibrated bandspread <b>tuning</b> control allows the main <b>tuning</b> to be set to a predefined spot on the control, and the bandspread allows <b>tuning</b> of a particular frequency within some restricted range of the main <b>tuning</b> control.|$|R

5|$|<b>Tuned</b> bells: The {{earliest}} {{complete set}} of <b>tuned</b> bells, sixteen in all, were found in Tomb 8 of Marquis Su of Jin at Qucun, southern Shanxi.

Of the sixty-four bronze bells found in the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng interred by 433 BC, forty-seven of them produce two notes with minor third intervals while sixteen produce two notes with major third intervals.|$|E
5|$|A four-stop continuo organ {{was built}} for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton-based organ builder Kenneth Tickell. The instrument, {{contained}} {{in a case of}} dark oak, is portable, and can be <b>tuned</b> to three pitches: A=440Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415Hz and A=465Hz. Iit is also possible to tune at A=430. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed.|$|E

5|$|Although effective, the B-52 was {{not ideal}} for the {{low-level}} role. This {{led to a}} number of aircraft designs known as penetrators, which were <b>tuned</b> specifically for long-range low-altitude flight. The first of these designs to see operation was the supersonic F-111 fighter-bomber, which used variable-sweep wings for tactical missions. Similar aircraft also emerged for other users as well, notably the BAC TSR-2, and later, Panavia Tornado and Sukhoi Su-24. A number of studies on a strategic-range counterpart followed.|$|E

5|$|Darlington {{considers}} the topology of coupled <b>tuned</b> circuits to involve a separate approximation technique to the insertion-loss method, but also producing nominally flat passbands and high attenuation stopbands. The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, {{or in the}} case of a two-section filter, by mutual inductance. These are most useful where the design requirement is not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E

This paper investigates the influence of <b>tuning</b> methods on the oscillator phase noise. Five <b>tuning</b> methods are compared: varactor <b>tuning,</b> band switching, oscillator switching, active <b>tuning,</b> and phase shift <b>tuning.</b> In addition, for the <b>tuning</b> methods active <b>tuning</b> and phase shift <b>tuning,</b> effective quality factors are introduced as a figure of merit to assess the phase noise performance.
