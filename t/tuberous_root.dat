5|$|The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root {{vegetable}} {{closely related to}} the carrot and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, <b>tuberous</b> <b>root</b> has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant is}} a {{herbaceous}} perennial vine, bearing alternate heart-shaped or palmately lobed leaves and medium-sized sympetalous flowers. The edible <b>tuberous</b> <b>root</b> {{is long and}} tapered, with a smooth skin whose color ranges between yellow, orange, red, brown, purple, and beige. Its flesh ranges from beige through white, red, pink, violet, yellow, orange, and purple. Sweet potato cultivars with white or pale yellow flesh are less sweet and moist than those with red, pink or orange flesh.|$|E
25|$|Taíno {{groups in}} the more {{developed}} islands, such as Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, relied more on agriculture (farming and other jobs). Fields for important root crops, such as the staple yuca, were prepared by heaping up mounds of soil, called conucos. This improved soil drainage and fertility as well as delaying erosion, allowing for longer storage of crops in the ground. Less important crops such as corn were raised in simple clearings created by slash and burn technique. Typically, conucos were three feet high and nine feet in circumference and were arranged in rows. The primary root crop was yuca/cassava, a woody shrub cultivated for its edible and starchy <b>tuberous</b> <b>root.</b> It was planted using a coa, a kind of hoe made completely from wood. Women processed the poisonous variety of cassava by squeezing it to extract the toxic juices. Then they would grind the roots into flour for baking bread. Batata (sweet potato) was the next most important root crop.|$|E

500|$|Sugar beet {{became a}} major source of sugar in the 19th century when methods for extracting the sugar became available. It is a {{biennial}} plant, a cultivated variety of Beta vulgaris in the family Amaranthaceae, the <b>tuberous</b> <b>root</b> of which contains a high proportion of sucrose. It is cultivated as a root crop in temperate regions with adequate rainfall and requires a fertile soil. The crop is harvested mechanically in the autumn and the crown of leaves and excess soil removed. The roots do not deteriorate rapidly and may be left in a clamp in the field for some weeks before being transported to the processing plant. Here the crop is washed and sliced and the sugar extracted by diffusion. Milk of lime is added to the raw juice [...] and carbonatated in a number of stages in order to purify it. Water is evaporated by boiling the syrup under a vacuum. The syrup is then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals. The white sugar that crystallizes out can be separated in a centrifuge and dried. It requires no further refining.|$|E
500|$|Cicuta spp. are {{perennial}} {{plants that are}} all similar in morphology, growing up {{to a maximum of}} [...] in height. The stem of the plant is branching, erect, smooth and hollow (except for partitions at the junction of the leaves and stem), sometimes being purple-striped, or mottled (typically only C. maculata has the purple stripes or spots). Attached {{to the base of the}} stem is a <b>tuberous</b> <b>root</b> with thickened rootstocks. The rootstocks are multichambered and contain a yellowish oily liquid which turns reddish brown on exposure to air and emits a characteristic smell of raw parsnip. The alternate leaves are 2 or 3 pinnately compound and may reach [...] to [...] in length. The leaflets are lanceolate, serrate, [...] to [...] in length, and sharply toothed. The plant flowers in spring or early summer; the flowers are small with green or white petals clustered in an umbrella shape (umbel) characteristic to this family; the umbel measures [...] to [...] across.

40|$|Many {{transcriptional}} factors harboring the R 2 R 3 -MYB domain, basic helix-loop-helix domain, or WD 40 repeats {{have been}} identified in various plant species as regulators of flavonoid biosynthesis in flowers, seeds, and fruits. However, the regulatory elements of flavonoid biosynthesis in underground organs have not yet been elucidated. We isolated the novel MYB genes IbMYB 1 and IbMYB 2 s from purple-fleshed sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L. Lam. cv Ayamurasaki). IbMYB 1 was predominantly expressed in the purple flesh of <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots</b> but was not detected (or only scarcely) in other anthocyanin-containing tissues such as nontuberous roots, stems, leaves, or flowers. IbMYB 1 was also expressed in the <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots</b> of other purple-fleshed cultivars but not in those of orange-, yellow-, or white-fleshed cultivars. Although the orange- or yellow-fleshed cultivars contained anthocyanins in the skins of their <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots,</b> we could not detect IbMYB 1 transcripts in these tissues. These results suggest that IbMYB 1 controls anthocyanin biosynthesis specifically in the flesh of <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots.</b> The results of transient and stable transformation experiments indicated that expression of IbMYB 1 alone was sufficient for induction of all structural anthocyanin genes and anthocyanin accumulation in the flesh of <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots,</b> as well as in heterologous tissues or heterologous plant species...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} for cassava is the rapid deterioration after harvesting cassava <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots,</b> which limits the possibilities for production and distribution of cassava in the world. Postharvest deterioration is an inherent problem for cassava since wounding and mechanical damage of the <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots</b> cannot be prevented during harvesting, which includes postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD) and secondary deterioration. To date, the molecular mechanism and biochemical pathways of PPD are poorly understood. The aim of this project, which is focusing on the early stages (first 72 hrs), is to gain molecular insight and identify important metabolic pathways {{during the process of}} PPD in cassava <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots.</b> Finally by reverse genetic approaches to delay or even prevent the process of PPD in cassava <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots.</b> By using a new RNA fingerprinting method, called cDNA-AFLP, we have screened more than 6, 000 TDFs (Transcript Derived Fragments) via up to 100 primer combinations during the early process of PPD in cassava. Only 10 % of the TDFs are developmentally regulated, while the other 90 % are expressed throughout the process of PPD in cassava <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots.</b> Furthermore, in order to set up a functional catalogue of differentially expressed genes during PPD, 70 TDFs were selected and isolated based on their expression patterns, which were either up-regulated, down-regulated or transiently induced. Around 40 of these TDFs were found to be similar with known genes in databases. The other 30 TDFs were present mostly genes without known function. Through data analysis, it is shown that important biochemical and physiological processes, such as notably oxygen stress, carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism and phenolic compounds synthesis, are involved in PPD in cassava <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots...</b>|$|R

40|$|Ranunculus asiaticus is an {{ornamental}} {{flowering plant}} with {{potential to be}} more widely used by the floriculture industry. Unfortunately, growers are faced with many challenges when producing these plants from their dry <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots</b> following storage; including poor sprouting, non-uniform growth, disease issues upon planting, as well as inconsistent cultural recommendations and lack of proper storage and handling protocols. Several experiments were conducted to {{determine the influence of}} temperature and relative humidity during storage on growth and quality of R. asiaticus plants. From our experiments it can be concluded that R. asiaticus tubers store best under low relative humidity and cool temperatures (above freezing). Also important from a storage perspective, unlike other flower bulbs, we show that R. asiaticus <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots</b> are not susceptible to ethylene damage while in the dry state. Prior to planting, tubers should be submerged in room-temperature water at around 20 oC, for 24 h, and then provided a fungicide treatment. We have shown that proper hydration temperature for R. asiaticus <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots</b> is critical for optimal growth. By following the protocol generated from our experiments, many of the production challenges associated with R. asiaticus <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots</b> may be avoided...|$|R

Also, there were determined a series of relationships between soluble dry matter content and main plant characteristics, like average shoots per plant and average weight of the <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots</b> at harvesting. The study was conducted for two years at University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca on seven cultivars of Dahlia variabilis ‘cactus’ type: 'Kennemerland', 'TsukiYori No Sisha', 'Hayley Jane', 'Purple Gem', 'Star Favourite', 'Park Princess' and 'Friquolet'. Based on the results obtained {{it can be concluded}} that the forcing of the <b>tuberous</b> <b>roots</b> affected the accumulation of soluble dry matter content at dahlia tubers, but it also depends on the cultivar. The highest content of soluble dry matter was at following cultivars 'Star Favourite'/forced tubers (25. 47 %), 'TsukiYori No Sisha'/unforced tubers (24. 80 %), ‘Kennemerland’/unforced tubers (24. 27 %), 'Hayley Jane'/forced tubers (23. 97 %), and 'TsukiYori No Sisha'/forced tubers (22. 57 %).
