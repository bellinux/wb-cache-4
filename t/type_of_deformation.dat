25|$|Troubled by this paradox, Gerard 't Hooft {{analyzed}} the emission of Hawking radiation in more detail. He noted that when Hawking radiation escapes, {{there is a}} way in which incoming particles can modify the outgoing particles. Their gravitational field would deform the horizon of the black hole, and the deformed horizon could produce different outgoing particles than the undeformed horizon. When a particle falls into a black hole, it is boosted relative to an outside observer, and its gravitational field assumes a universal form. 't Hooft showed that this field makes a logarithmic tent-pole shaped bump on the horizon of a black hole, and like a shadow, the bump is an alternative description of the particle's location and mass. For a four-dimensional spherical uncharged black hole, the deformation of the horizon is similar to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> which describes the emission and absorption of particles on a string-theory world sheet. Since the deformations on the surface are the only imprint of the incoming particle, and since these deformations would have to completely determine the outgoing particles, 't Hooft believed that the correct description of the black hole would be by some form of string theory.|$|E

After extensive field and laboratory studies, no credible evidence has been found for shock metamorphism or any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> indicative of a hypervelocity extraterrestrial impact. While coesite, an indicator of shock metamorphism, had initially been reported as being present in rock samples collected from the Richat Structure, further analysis of rock samples concluded that barite had been misidentified as coesite. In addition, the Richat Structure lacks the annular depression that characterizes large extraterrestrial impact structures of this size. Also, it {{is quite different from}} large extraterrestrial impact structures in that the sedimentary strata comprising this structure is remarkably intact and [...] "orderly" [...] and lacking in overturned, steeply dipping strata or disoriented blocks. A more recent multianalytical study on the Richat megabreccias concluded that carbonates within the silica-rich megabreccias were created by low-temperature hydrothermal waters, and that the structure requires special protection and further investigation of its origin.|$|E

50|$|Deformation in geology {{refers to}} any {{alterations}} {{to the size}} or shape of a rock formation {{since the time of}} its creation. There are many different ways deformation can occur but it is always the result of some amount of stress within a formation. This stress leads to the formation of many structures that can either extend or shorten the length of the crust in the area. Some of the most common structures are faults and folds. Thick-skinned deformation is a specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> that can take the form of either faults or folds. The term thick-skinned specifically applies <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> which affects not only the sedimentary and metamorphic cover rocks near the surface but also affects the much deeper crystalline rock of the basement and may extend even deeper into the lower crust. Thin-skinned deformation is the counterpart to thick-skinned deformation and can frequently be found in similar areas. As the term implies, thin-skinned deformation is deformation that only affects the upper layers of the cover rocks and does not continue into the deeper basement. There is also one other term which may be used as an intermediary between these two extremes. The term basement-involved thin-skinned deformation can be applied to deformation that affects the cover rocks and may cut some into the basement then level off before going too deep.|$|E
50|$|This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{deformation}}</b> is irreversible. However, {{an object}} in the plastic deformation range will first have undergone elastic deformation, which is reversible, so the object will return part way to its original shape. Soft thermoplastics have a rather large plastic deformation range as do ductile metals such as copper, silver, and gold. Steel does, too, but not cast iron. Hard thermosetting plastics, rubber, crystals, and ceramics have minimal plastic deformation ranges. An example of a material with a large plastic deformation range is wet chewing gum, which can be stretched dozens of times its original length.|$|E

50|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of rocks {{that control the}} rate and mode of strain, such as yield strength or viscosity, depend on the thermodynamic state of the rock and composition. The most important thermodynamic variables in this case are temperature and pressure. Both of these increase with depth, so to a first approximation the mode of deformation can {{be understood in terms}} of depth. Within the upper lithosphere, brittle deformation is common because under low pressure rocks have relatively low brittle strength, {{while at the same time}} low temperature reduces the likelihood of ductile flow. After the brittle-ductile transition zone, ductile deformation becomes dominant. Elastic deformation happens when the time scale of stress is shorter than the relaxation time for the material. Seismic waves are a common example of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation.</b> At temperatures high enough to melt rocks, the ductile shear strength approaches zero, which is why shear mode elastic deformation (S-Waves) will not propagate through melts.|$|E
50|$|The narrowest colloquial {{sense of}} the term {{reserves}} it only for machines that perform metal cutting—in other words, the many kinds of conventional machining and grinding.

However, economists use a slightly broader sense that also includes metal deformation of other types that squeeze the metal into shape without cutting off swarf, such as rolling, stamping with dies, shearing, swaging, riveting, and others. Thus presses are usually included in the economic definition of machine tools. For example, this is the breadth of definition used by Max Holland in his history of Burgmaster and Houdaille, which is also a history of the machine tool industry in general from the 1940s through the 1980s; he was reflecting the {{sense of the}} term used by Houdaille itself and other firms in the industry.

50|$|Most {{polycrystalline}} {{metals and}} alloys usually deform via shear caused by dislocations, twins, and / or shear bands. This leads to pronounced plastic anisotropy at the grain scale and to preferred grain orientation distributions, i.e. crystallographic textures. Cold rolling textures of most face centered cubic {{metals and alloys}} for instance range between two types, i.e. the brass-type texture and the copper-type texture. The stacking fault energy {{plays an important role}} for the prevailing mechanisms of plastic deformation and the resultant textures. For aluminum and other fcc materials with high SFE, dislocation glide is the main mechanism during cold rolling and the {112}<111> (copper) and {123}<634> (S) texture components (copper-type textures) are developed. In contrast, in Cu-30 wt.% Zn (alpha-brass) and related metals and alloys with low SFE, mechanical twinning and shear banding occur together with dislocation glide as main deformation carriers, particularly at large plastic deformations. The resulting rolling textures are characterized by the {011}<211> (brass) and {01 1}<100> (Goss) texture components (brass-type texture). In either case non-crystallographic shear banding plays an essential role for the specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> texture evolved.|$|E
