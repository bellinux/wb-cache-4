5|$|The Oxford English Dictionary derives {{the word}} straightforwardly from Old English butorflēoge, butter-fly; similar names in Old Dutch and Old High German {{show that the}} name is ancient.

5|$|This sparrow feeds {{primarily}} on small grass and forb seeds, fresh grass stems, and tender plant shoots during autumn and winter. During these seasons, insects such as ants, grasshoppers, ground beetles, and scale insects {{as well as}} spiders make up {{a small part of}} its diet. In <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>summer,</b> the bird's diet includes a greater quantity and variety of insects.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} saprobic, and is found growing in {{groups on the}} ground or on moss-covered {{decaying}} wood, especially amongst fallen pine needles. In North America, fruit bodies appear in <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>summer,</b> and are fairly common; in Britain, the fungus fruits from winter to spring, and is rare.

5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>summer</b> populations, but most adults {{from the earlier}} {{emergence}} die {{before the end of}} summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>summer,</b> {{conditions}} {{along the}} east coast of Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder air above it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones. Since records began in 1791, hailstorms in the month of January form approximately 13% {{of the total number of}} hailstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area, and over 15% of all events with 'large hail'.|$|E

Incidents such as these prompted the Pennsylvania Assembly, with the approval of Governor Penn, to reintroduce the scalp bounties offered during the French and Indian War, which paid money for every Native killed above the age of ten, including women.|$|E
