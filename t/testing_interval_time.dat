40|$|A set {{of general}} {{formulas}} is {{proposed for the}} probability of failure on demand (PFD) assessment of MooN architecture (i. e. k-out-of-n) systems subject to proof tests. The proof tests can be partial or full. The partial tests (e. g. visual inspections, partial stroke testing) are able to detect only some system failures and leave the others latent, whereas the full tests refer to overhauls which restore the system to an as good as new condition. Partial tests may occur at different time instants (periodic or not), up to the full test. The system performances which are investigated are the system availability according to time, the PFD average in each partial <b>test</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval,</b> and the total PFD average calculated on the full <b>test</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval.</b> Following the given expressions, parameter estimations are proposed to assess the system failure rates and the partial test effectiveness according to feedback data from previous test policies. Subsequently, an optimization of the partial test strategy is presented. In the 2 oo 6 system given as example, an improvement of about 10 % of the total PFD average has been obtained, just by a better (non-periodic) distribution of {{the same number of}} partial tests, in the full <b>test</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval...</b>|$|R

Materials and Methods: Several pulp tissues are obtained from both endodontically treated teeth and also by orthodontically extracted premolar teeth and were sectioned with a surgical blade into seventy-five pieces of same size and weight. Pulp tissues were then divided into Allium sativum extract (ASE) group, NaOCl group, and NaCl group and tissues were immersed in the test solutions for 30, 60, and 90 min, respectively. Further tissues were weighed using a precision balance at <b>tested</b> <b>intervals,</b> and the percentage weight loss was calculated and statistically analyzed.

40|$|Background: To {{study the}} {{interaction}} of calcium channel blocker (Nifedipine) with Antipsychotic drug (Haloperidol) on Conditioned avoidance Response and catalepsy in Rats. Methods: Every group consisted of 10 healthy albino rats of either sex. Different groups received Nifedipine (5, 10 & 20 mg/kg, i. p.), Haloperidol (ED 50 - 0. 2 mg/kg for CAR & 0. 4 mg/kg for catalepsy) alone and combined doses of both drugs. The Antipsychotic effect of drugs was measured by Conditioned avoidance response (CAR) using Cook&# 146;s Pole climbing apparatus and Adverse drug effect (Extra pyramidal syndrome) was measured by Catalepsy. Results: 5 mg/kg i. p. of Nifedipine inhibited CAR in 50 % of Rats (compared to control, p< 0. 001). 10 mg/kg i. p. of Nifedipine inhibited CAR in 60 % of Rats (p< 0. 001) & 20 mg/kg i. p. inhibited CAR in 70 % of Rats (p< 0. 001). When Nifedipine (5 mg/kg i. p) was combined with Haloperidol ED 50 - 0. 2 mg/kg the CAR was inhibited in 70 % of the rats (p< 0. 01) and after combining Nifedipine (10 mg/kg) with Haloperidol ED 50 - 0. 2 mg/kg the CAR was inhibited in 80 % Rats (p< 0. 001). Nifedipine at the dose of 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (i. p.) did not induce catalepsy in the rats at any <b>testing</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval.</b> At 20 mg/kg i. p., it produced catalepsy in 2 rats at half hour and in 4 rats at 1 hour and 2 hour <b>testing</b> <b>interval</b> each (p< 0. 01). In the dose of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, pretreatment with Nifedipine significantly increased Haloperidol induced cataleptic scores at all <b>testing</b> <b>intervals</b> (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Temporal {{models of}} pitch {{are based on}} the {{assumption}} that the auditory system measures the <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> between neural events, and that pitch corresponds to the most common <b>time</b> <b>interval.</b> The current experiments were designed to <b>test</b> whether <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> are analyzed independently in each peripheral channel, or whether the time-interval analysis in one channel is affected by synchronous activity in other channels. Regular and irregular click trains were filtered into narrow frequency bands to produce target and flanker stimuli. The threshold for discriminating a regular target from an irregular distracter click train was measured in the presence of an irregular masker click train in the target band, as a function of the frequency separation between the target band and a flanker band. The flanker click train was either regular or irregular. The threshold for detecting the regular target was 5 - 7 dB lower when the flanker was regular. The data indicate that the detection of temporal regularity (and thus, pitch) involves cross-channel processes that can operate over widely separated channels. Model simulations suggest that these cross-channel processes occur after the time-interval extraction stage and that they depend on the similarity, or consistency, of the time-interval patterns in the relevant channels...|$|R

The FAA and NASA do not support pressure proof testing the fuselage of aging commercial transport aircraft.

Target lines at an oblique orientation and orthogonal background elements were presented with various onset delays, and subjects’ performance in target detection was measured. Detection rates increased for short delays compared to synchronous stimulus presentation, with a maximum at Δt= 30 – 60 ms. Control experiments showed that this effect did not reveal specific interactions between target and background lines; a similar effect was obtained when targets were cued with non-oriented stimuli presented shortly before stimulus onset. Specific and non-specific cues improved the target detection rate even when four cues, at different potential target positions were shown simultaneously. Non-localized cues, however, and cues at positions irrelevant for the task did not improve performance. While the effect might partially resemble the temporal modulation transfer function of the visual system, {{we did not find}} evidence for other dynamic processes in the <b>tested</b> <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> (10 – 300 ms), in particular not for synchronization effects as assumed to provide perceptual linking of background elements...|$|R
