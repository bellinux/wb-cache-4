5|$|Many {{positions}} are winnable although {{at first sight}} <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> non-winnable. For example, the position in the middle diagram is a win for Black in 154 moves (the white pawn is captured at around 80 moves).|$|E
5|$|Nematodes of {{the genus}} Schistonchus {{are found in the}} syconia (and the {{pollinator}} wasps) of many species of fig, with F. rubiginosa hosting two species. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less species-specific than wasps. S. altermacrophylla is generally associated with F. rubiginosa though it has been recorded on several other fig species.|$|E

5|$|A second {{possible}} aetosaur nest site {{is known}} from northeastern Italy. The nests are preserved as depressions in carbonate rock that are circular or horseshoe-shaped, with high ridges around the sides. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unusually complex for nests created by Triassic reptiles. Archosaur footprints were found nearby that resembled aetosaurs, {{although they were}} not present in the same layer. Because the tracks were found {{so close to the}} nests, it is likely that aetosaurs built them.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It {{should also be noted}} that <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{numbers of}} {{children}} show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve as predictors of later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles {{as part of the}} range of attachment disorders.|$|E
6000|$|To recompense [...] "Westminister" [...] for {{the loss}} of his day's work, to make a dubious {{statement}} that nights were never so black as <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> was all that he could venture to do. Creed hesitated in the doorway.|$|R

5|$|Stargazy pie (sometimes called starrey gazey pie, stargazey pie {{and other}} variants) is a Cornish dish made of baked pilchards (or sardines), along with eggs and potatoes, {{covered with a}} pastry crust. Although {{there are a few}} {{variations}} with different fish being used, the unique feature of stargazy pie is fish heads (and sometimes tails) protruding through the crust, so that <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gazing skyward. This allows the oils released during cooking to flow back into the pie.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{men of the}} Minch, {{also known}} as storm kelpies or in Scottish Gaelic as na fir ghorma, fear gorm or sruth nam fear gorm, are mythological creatures inhabiting the stretch of water between the {{northern}} Outer Hebrides and mainland Scotland, looking for sailors to drown and stricken boats to sink. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> localised to the Minch and surrounding areas, unknown {{in other parts of}} Scotland and without counterparts {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{varieties}} of the two-colored bolete: borealis and subreticulatus. Both varieties {{have a very}} similar habitat {{to that of the}} main species, except <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> limited to just the North American continent. Both varieties also have a slightly different coloration than that of the two-colored bolete, have deeper pores, and are not as often eaten or used in regional recipes.|$|E

5|$|In Asia, {{the normal}} diet {{includes}} rice and noodles {{as the main}} energy source, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians, will not eat root vegetables or avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> just as effective.|$|E
5|$|Many wasp lineages, {{including}} those in the families Vespidae, Crabronidae, Sphecidae, and Pompilidae, attack and sting prey items that they use as food for their larvae; while Vespidae usually macerate their prey and feed the resulting bits directly to their brood, most predatory wasps paralyze their prey and lay eggs directly upon the bodies, and the wasp larvae consume them. Apart from collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the body fluids of their prey. Although vespid mandibles are adapted for chewing and <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> feeding on the organism, they are often merely macerating it into submission. The impact of the predation of wasps on economic pests is difficult to establish.|$|E
5|$|The first iron {{production}} {{started in}} the Middle Bronze Age but it took several centuries before iron displaced bronze. Samples of smelted iron from Asmar, Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between 3000 and 2700BC. The Hittites established an empire in north-central Anatolia around 1600 BC. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first to understand the production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in their society. The Hittites began to smelt iron between 1500 and 1200BC and the practice spread {{to the rest of}} the Near East after their empire fell in 1180BC. The subsequent period is called the Iron Age.|$|E

40|$|The MSR {{conference and}} {{workshop}} series has published 270 papers, including 117 full papers, 26 position papers, 67 short/poster/lightning papers, and 60 challenge papers. Four {{of the authors}} of this paper carefully read all 117 full papers from MSR 2005 to 2012, and extracted a total of 268 comments from them; comments <b>were</b> selected if <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> generalizable observations or recommendations about doing work in the field, and if <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> supported by evidence in the paper. The authors also extracted the names of any tools that were developed or used in the studies...|$|R

5|$|The river martins form a {{distinctive}} subfamily Pseudochelidoninae within the swallow and martin bird family Hirundinidae. The two species are the African river martin Pseudochelidon eurystomina, {{found in the}} Congo and Gabon, and the white-eyed river martin Pseudochelidon sirintarae, known only from one site in Thailand. These are medium-sized, largely black swallows that have a light buoyant flight and feed on insects caught in the air. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more terrestrial than other swallows, frequently walking rather than perching, and the white-eyed may be crepuscular. The African species excavates nest holes in sandy ridges in rivers, while the breeding locations and habits of the Asian bird are unknown.|$|E
5|$|There exist several {{categories}} of Type II supernova explosions, which are categorized {{based on the}} resulting light curve—a graph of luminosity versus time—following the explosion. Type II-L supernovae show a steady (linear) decline of the light curve following the explosion, whereas Type II-P display a period of slower decline (a plateau) in their light curve followed by a normal decay. Type Ib and Ic supernovae are a type of core-collapse supernova for a massive star that has shed its outer envelope of hydrogen and (for Type Ic) helium. As a result, <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lacking in these elements.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason for}} DNA testing was to {{determine}} the rates of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern populations have more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids. Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the result of pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} shows a {{large room}} in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid {{during the reign of}} King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> placed outside the picture space in a position {{similar to that of the}} viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.|$|E
