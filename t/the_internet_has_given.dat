40|$|Introduction When I {{first started}} in on this study, I was {{thinking}} that there probably wasn't much to this whole web community thing. After all (without naming names), many, many sites have the highest in aspirations for creating community, but the people they attract really seem to {{have no interest in}} seeing a community grow. These sites are dominated by huge amounts of gutter level, bargain basement conversation. In my mind, web sites did little for creating a global village. Putnam [6] argues that many factors, including the vast increase of suburban sprawl after World War II for example, have reduced the amount we interact with each other. What I <b>had</b> seen on <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> me little reason to think that this new vehicle for communication would help somehow increase our social capital, at least not in any major way. I chose Jazz Central Station (JCS) [2] for this study because it is a well designed site that seemed to have a fair amount of conversation going on. ...|$|R

40|$|Though {{electronic}} mathematical publishing {{is still}} in its infancy, the technology offers tantalizing possibilities.

Animations to illustrate dynamic concepts seem to be another reasonable expectation. While this kind of format is currently available on the World Wide Web, we have yet to see a text combining these features with the first-rate mathematical typesetting and ease of use that we are accustomed to in traditional books and are rightly hesitant to sacrifice.
