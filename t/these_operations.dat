5|$|Operation Graffham was a {{military}} deception employed by the Allies during the Second World War. It formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic deception designed to disguise the imminent Allied invasion of Normandy.

5|$|After January 1943 {{as part of}} the Southern Front, {{that became}} the 4th Ukrainian Front on 20 October 1943, the 51st Army took part in the Rostov, Donbass (August–September 1943), Melitopol (September–November 1943) and the 1944 Crimean {{offensive}} operation. On 1 April 1944, 51st Army included the 1st Guards Rifle Corps (33rd Guards, 91st and 346th Rifle Divisions), 10th Rifle Corps (216th, 257th, and 279th Rifle Divisions), 63rd Rifle Corps (263rd, 267th, and 417th Rifle Divisions), the 77th Rifle Division, the 78th Fortified Region, artillery, armor and other support units.

5|$|After this success, he {{was sent}} to Asia Minor, where the Turkish raids on the Byzantine borderlands had become a menace, and where Turkish {{settlers}} had begun encroaching upon imperial territory. He remained there until 1267 and achieved some success, securing the lands around the valley of the Maeander River and restoring the defences of the region. The historian George Pachymeres certainly praised his conduct of <b>these</b> <b>operations,</b> and alleged that the mere mention of his approach caused fear to his enemies.|$|E
5|$|As the {{intelligence}} {{available to them}} was not conclusive, the Allies believed that Tirpitz still posed a potential threat. Accordingly, Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons made two further attacks on the battleship after she moved to Tromsø on 15 October; <b>these</b> <b>operations</b> were more straightforward to conduct than Operation Paravane as the port was {{within the range of}} Lancasters flying from airfields in northern Scotland. The first raid, Operation Obviate, took place on 29 October but caused only minor damage to the battleship. During the subsequent attack conducted on 12 November, Operation Catechism, Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized with heavy loss of life among her crew.|$|E
40|$|The {{method for}} {{determining}} the voltage security operation limits in a practical voltage security analysis (VSA) system based on VSAT software for large power systems is introduced in this paper. <b>These</b> <b>operation</b> limits include bus voltage limits, branch/corridor transfer power limits and P-load limit of the whole system. The voltage security operation limits {{are determined by the}} most critical contingency among the studied contingency set. The most critical contingency determines the P-load limit of the whole system, and all kinds of operation parameter limits are operation parameter values corresponding to this P-load limit under pre-contingency. An operation parameter limit is upper limit if the function relationship between this operation parameter and load power is an increasing curve, or lower limit if the function relationship between this operation parameter and load power is an decreasing curve. <b>These</b> <b>operation</b> parameter limits are helpful for operators to monitor the system operation state. © 2005 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

5|$|Chauvel gained another {{important}} {{success in the}} Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger {{and the threat of}} its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off the battle, with Chauvel's concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day. The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray's mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In July, he was mentioned in despatches for <b>these</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
