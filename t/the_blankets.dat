He had downed a Ju 88 and two Bf 109s on a morning interception to interdict German air operations. One of his victims, a Bf 109 from III./JG 77 crash-landed at Larissa. His success took Pattle's total from 47 to 49. At 17:00 in the afternoon, another raid approached. He was seen, just before an air raid alarm, in the mess, lying on a couch, shivering under <b>the</b> <b>blankets.</b> He was detailed to take a patrol over the lines but during the mission briefing, around 100 German bombers with fighter escort attacked the capital, seeking to attack Allied shipping in the harbour. He ran for the door towards a Hurricane. His adjutant, George Rumsey, tried to stop him, but Pattle was determined to fly. On {{the way to his}} fighter, he narrowly avoided being killed in a strafing attack by a low-flying Bf 110. He took to the skies minutes later. Pattle climbed to gain altitude and headed for Piraeus Harbour at 20,000 feet.|$|E

25|$|Diseases such as typhus or cholera {{appeared}} very quickly. The close confinement of {{the accommodations}} {{and the number}} of prisoners per barrack, on average 250, partly explains the phenomenon, as the foul air circulated very little. An official policy of integration of different nationalities mean that typhus tended to spread rapidly from Russian troops, among whom it was endemic, to the French and British who had little immunity to it. In February 1915, the camp at Chemnitz was placed under quarantine; one prisoner wrote that the only vehicles approaching the camp were those transporting coffins. Serious outbreaks of typhus occurred at the camps at Wittenberg, Gardelegen, Cassel and Cottbus, among others: at Cassel, for example, of 18,300 prisoners, there were 7,218 cases of typhus, with a mortality rate of 11 per cent. In November 1915, a circular from the war ministry was sent to the various camps to put in place rules of hygiene. The fight against lice was at the centre of measures to be taken by using hair-removing creams and disinfecting rooms. Vaccines were also ordered, and a vaccination frenzy ensued. For instance, Charles Gueugnier was vaccinated against typhus on 28 September 1915, only to be re-vaccinated on 2 and 7 October. At Merseburg camp, <b>the</b> <b>blankets</b> were de-loused {{for the first time on}} 5 June 1915.|$|E

40|$|In fusion reactors, <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> {{design and}} its {{characteristics}} {{have a major}} impact on the reactor performance, size, and economics. The selection and arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> materials, dimensions of <b>the</b> different <b>blanket</b> zones, and different requirements of the selected materials for a satisfactory performance are the main parameters, which define <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> performance. These parameters translate to a large number of variables and design constraints, which need to be simultaneously considered in <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> design process. This represents a major design challenge because of the lack of a comprehensive design tool capable of considering all these variables to define <b>the</b> optimum <b>blanket</b> design and satisfying all the design constraints for the adopted figure of merit and <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> design criteria. <b>The</b> <b>blanket</b> design techniques of the First Wall/Blanket/Shield Design and Optimization System (BSDOS) have been developed to overcome this difficulty and to provide the state-of-the-art techniques and tools for performing blanket design and analysis.

In addition, the use of the optimization technique of the BSDOS can result in a significant blanket performance enhancement and cost saving for the reactor design under consideration. In this report, examples are presented, which utilize an earlier version of the ITER solid breeder blanket design and a high power density self-cooled lithium blanket design for demonstrating some of <b>the</b> BSDOS <b>blanket</b> design techniques...|$|R

Jack assumes it is out of concern and tells her Michael is okay, but then she makes one last gasp and passes, dying with Hurley at her bedside. She is buried beside Ana Lucia, coincidentally during the reappearance of Desmond aboard the Elizabeth. Two weeks later, Hurley visits Libby's grave and expresses how much he misses her before leaving a flower.|$|E

Although Libby (Cynthia Watros) advises Ana Lucia {{not to try to}} get revenge on Henry, she is determined and asks James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) for a gun, but is rejected. Ana Lucia returns and after Sawyer still refuses to give her a gun, she has sex with him, and is able to distract him long enough to steal the gun. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) return with Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau). Michael wakes up and tells everyone in the hatch that he tracked the Others down and found out that they are living worse off than the survivors. He also says that once he is healthy, he will organize a rescue mission to reclaim his son Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley). After Locke and Jack begin to plan a rescue mission for Walt, they realize that they need more guns, and go to Sawyer, who realizes that Ana Lucia has stolen his. Elsewhere, Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) has planned a romantic picnic for himself and Libby, but Hurley gets lost and leads them back to the survivors' beach. There, he realizes that he forgot to pack a blanket and Libby offers {{to go back to the}} hatch to retrieve one. She also suggests that Hurley ask Rose and Bernard for some wine for the picnic, a suggestion that Hurley is delighted to hear. Meanwhile, back in the hatch, Michael asks Ana Lucia what is going on and she explains a few things: Sawyer has all the guns, Jack, Locke, and Kate left to get the guns, and they currently have one of the Others, Henry, in captivity inside the armory. She mentions that Henry tried to kill her earlier in the day and that although she was about to kill Henry, she was not able to pull the trigger. Michael offers to do it, but after she hands him the gun he turns around and shoots her dead. Libby walks in with <b>the</b> <b>blankets</b> and startles Michael causing him to shoot her too.

40|$|Abstract. Flocs size is an {{important}} parameter in <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> clarifier process, hence, {{it is necessary to}} investigate flocs average diameter in different blanket height to achieve optimum operation parameters of the process. To investigate the flocs size under different operational conditions，flocs were sampled from different locations of <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> in various operating stages to analyze its size. Experimental works with water plant wastes flocculated with polyacrylamide (PAM) suspended in a pilot-scale <b>blanket</b> confirmed <b>the</b> theoretical predictions. Change in operational conditions such as raw water concentration and up-flow rate would affect <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> flocs size, there exists a linear relationship between up-flow rate and flocs average size, and flocs size were improved along with the increase of raw sludge concentration. The experimental results identified an inverse proportion between flocs average size and <b>the</b> <b>blanket</b> depth, <b>the</b> average flocs diameter increased along with the depth of <b>the</b> <b>blanket...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Externally, Columbia was {{the first}} orbiter in the fleet whose surface was mostly covered with High & Low Temperature Reusable Surface Insulation (HRSI/LRSI) tiles as its main thermal {{protection}} system (TPS), with white silicone rubber-painted Nomex – known as Felt Reusable Surface Insulation (FRSI) blankets – in some areas on the wings, fuselage and payload bay doors. FRSI once covered almost 25% of the orbiter; the first upgrade resulted in its removal from many areas, and in later flights it was only used on the upper section of the payload bay doors and inboard sections of the upper wing surfaces. The upgrade also involved replacing many of the white LRSI tiles on the upper surfaces with Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation (AFRSI) blankets (also known as Fibrous Insulation Blankets, or FIBs) {{that had been used}} on Discovery and Atlantis. Originally, Columbia had 32,000 tiles – the upgrade reduced this to 24,300. The AFRSI blankets consisted of layers of pure silica felt sandwiched between a layer of silica fabric on the outside and S-Glass fabric on the inside, stitched together using pure silica thread in a 1-inch grid, then coated with a high-purity silica coating. <b>The</b> <b>blankets</b> were semi-rigid and could be made as large as 30" [...] by 30". Each blanket replaced as many as 25 tiles and was bonded directly to the orbiter. The direct application of <b>the</b> <b>blankets</b> to the orbiter resulted in weight reduction, improved durability, reduced fabrication and installation cost, and reduced installation schedule time. All of this work was performed during Columbia's first retrofitting and the post-Challenger stand-down.|$|E
