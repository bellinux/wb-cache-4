40|$|Literature on women’s {{leadership}} {{over the}} last three decades suggests that women’s leadership perspectives have been predominantly influenced by either Euro-centric patriarchal views or those of women in economically developed countries. These are significantly different from an economically developing Pacific Island like the Solomon Islands, in particular, its Santa Isabel Island. The literature, therefore, overlooks the impacts women’s indigenous culture may have in order to understand their leadership beliefs and practices. Bourdieu (1977 b) argues that people’s practices are embodied within their cultures, forming habitus through their past and present experiences, both consciously and unconsciously. I argue that women leaders’ leadership beliefs and practices cannot be fully understood without considering these social and cultural norms operating in their specific cultures. My thesis explores the impact of the Santa Isabel matrilineal culture on women’s formed leadership beliefs and practices. The main research question therefore is: How do women leaders’ leadership beliefs and practices form in the Santa Isabel matrilineal culture? Sub questions arising from this are: 1. 	In what ways does the Santa Isabel matrilineal culture influence women leaders’ beliefs and practices? 2. 	To what extent does the Santa Isabel matrilineal culture contribute to the formation of women leaders’ cultural leadership beliefs and practices? 3. 	How do women leaders practice leadership in the Santa Isabel matrilineal culture? My research was undertaken using a case study methodology, linked with Bourdieu’s (1977 b) habitus as a lens for exploring women leaders’ leadership practices in Santa Isabel in the Solomon Islands context through using interviews, informal observations and focus groups. The findings were generated through Bourdieu’s (1977 b) habitus theory for capturing an in-depth understanding of how women leaders’ leadership beliefs and practices were formed. Key findings demonstrated that women leaders’ leadership beliefs and practices were influenced by their matrilineal culture and early learning experiences in Santa Isabel. The study also revealed that these women leaders used leadership practices appropriate for their context. As a result, they formed leadership beliefs and practices that demonstrated a symbolic <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> their cultural habitus that reflected their existing leadership thinking. The study has contributed to the research field by recognising the impact of cultural embodiment, the habitus and social <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> the Santa Isabel matrilineal culture on women’s leadership beliefs and practices. It fills a critical gap in understanding women’s leadership as a symbolic <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> their cultural beliefs and practices which has been overlooked in women’s leadership literature...|$|R

50|$|The <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> {{regarding}} the female, {{leads to an}} increase of digestive enzymes. This allows her to eat more prey and to stock more nutrients.

Once the offspring are born, and until the mother dies, the mother regurgitates for two weeks the fluids stocked inside as highly nutritive food for the progeny. Ninety-five per cent of the mother's mass is digested by the offspring. They will grow to three times their original size between their birth and dispersion. During the period when female spiders are caring for their hatched offspring, the mothers do not eat, and their offspring only eat the food that the mother regurgitates along with the mother's body {{at the end of this}} time.|$|R

This muscle, therefore, appears {{to be much more}} common in the male than in the female sex; and on the principle of the descent of man from some lower form, its presence can be understood; for it has been detected in several of the lower animals, and in all of these it serves exclusively to aid the male in the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction.</b>|$|R

The subject is that of the creation of life by a scientist, thus bestowing life through the application and technology of medical science rather than by the natural <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction.</b> The short novel has been adapted into many films and productions ranging from the early versions with Boris Karloff to later versions featuring Kenneth Branagh, among others.|$|R
60|$|To {{put some}} stop to the {{progressive}} loss of agricultural capital, {{which is now}} taking place, and which it will be by no means easy to recover, it might be advisable to pass a <b>temporary</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> restriction, whatever may be {{the intention of the}} legislature in future. But, certainly it is much to be wished that as soon as possible, consistently with due deliberation, the permanent policy intended to be adopted with regard to the trade in corn should be finally settled. Already, in the course of little more than a century, three distinct changes in this policy have taken place. The <b>act</b> <b>of</b> William, which gave the bounty, combined with the prohibitory <b>act</b> <b>of</b> Charles II was founded obviously and strikingly upon the principle of encouraging exportation and discouraging importation; the spirit of the regulations adopted in 1773, and acted upon some time before, was nearly the reverse, and encouraged importation and discouraged exportation. Subsequently, as if alarmed at the dependence of the country upon foreign corn, and the fluctuations of price which it had occasioned, the legislature in a feeble <b>act</b> <b>of</b> 1791, and rather a more effective one in 1804, returned again to the policy of restrictions. And if the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> 1804 be left now unaltered, it may be fairly said that a fourth change has taken place; as it is quite certain that, to proceed consistently upon a restrictive system, fresh regulations become absolutely necessary {{to keep pace with the}} progressive fall in the value of currency.|$|R

60|$|Fritz Müller {{states that}} certain species of Melita are {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} amphipods by the females having “the coxal lamellæ of the penultimate pair of feet produced into hook-like processes, of which the males lay hold with {{the hands of the}} first pair.” The development of these hook-like processes probably resulted from those females which were the most securely held during the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> having left the largest number of offspring. Another Brazilian amphipod (Orchestia Darwinii, fig. 7) is described by Fritz Müller, as presenting a case of dimorphism, like that of Tanais; for there are two male forms, which differ in the structure of their chelæ.[417] As chelæ of either shape would certainly have sufficed to hold the female, for both are now used for this purpose, the two male forms probably originated, by some having varied in one manner and some in another; both forms having derived certain special, but nearly equal advantages, from their differently shaped organs.|$|R

50|$|The first clause {{repealed}} {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Parliament, those of 1765, 1773, 1785, and 1796. Those were all <b>temporary</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Irish Parliament, and the British Parliament in 1807 renewed {{all of them}} for 21 years, and that renewal came to expire in the year 1828. It was then renewed for one year for that Session of Parliament to allow legislation to take place. Those Acts are all founded upon the vestry system of management of towns. Some of the large towns had by local Acts got lighting and other matters under vestries in the parishes, and all those Acts were founded upon the idea of extending the vestry system to the management of towns; but the vestries never made the way in Ireland which they did in England, {{because there was no}} poor law. The basis of vestries being so popular in England, being on account of the poor law administration. There was no poor law in Ireland until 1838, and the vestries had no real basis to rest on; and in 1828 they were in a most unpopular portion, because the agitation which overthrew them in 1833 the Tithe Commutation Act 1838 by the extinction of what is called parish cess, the same as the church rates in England, was just at its height. 1828 was within five years of the total extinction of Irish church rates, to that they had become quite unpopular and unmanageable bodies.|$|R
50|$|The {{spawning}} {{behavior has}} significant consequences for captive breeding (see below). The celestial pearl danio {{appears to be}} adapted to somewhat ephemeral habitats. It {{does not have a}} dedicated spawning season, nor do the females lay continuously. Rather, they produce small batches of around 30 eggs per spawning episode. The time between spawnings is unknown at present. Eggs are not strewn freely into the water, but they are not deposited in clutches to a prepared surface either; rather, it seems, that they are hidden away in vegetation as a loose batch. Courting males will seek out and try to defend a patch of dense vegetation. While pursuit swimming has been observed, {{it does not seem to}} be connected directly to the actual <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> in which the male displays to a passing female, and tests her readiness with a brief chase. The pair then moves into the substrate and deposits the eggs. Other males noticing reproduction will try and follow the mating pair, either to try to fertilize the eggs with their own sperm or eat them.|$|R
60|$|The {{belief in}} the power of sexual {{selection}} rests chiefly on the following considerations.

The males (passing over a few exceptional cases) are the more active in courtship; they are the better armed, and are rendered the more attractive in various ways. It is to be especially observed that the males display their attractions with elaborate care {{in the presence of the}} females; and that they rarely or never display them excepting during the season of love. It is incredible that all this should be purposeless. Lastly we have distinct evidence with some quadrupeds and birds, that the individuals of one sex are capable of feeling a strong antipathy or preference for certain individuals of the other sex.|$|R

40|$|Many species live {{in stable}} pairs, usually to breed and raise {{offspring}} together, but this cannot be assumed. Establishing whether pairing {{is based on}} mating, or an alternative cooperative advantage, can be difficult, especially where species show no obvious sexual dimorphism and where the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> itself is difficult to observe. In the tropical marine fishes known as rabbitfish (Siganidae), half of extant species live in socially monogamous, territorial pairs. It has been assumed that partnerships are for mating, but the reproductive mode of pairing rabbitfish is currently unconfirmed. Using passive acoustic telemetry to track movements of fishes belonging to one such species (Siganus doliatus), we provide the first evidence that paired adult fish undertake highly synchronized migrations with multiple conspecifics on a monthly cycle. All tagged individuals migrated along the same route in three consecutive months and were absent from home territories for 2 – 3 days just after the new moon. The timing and directionality of migrations suggest that S. doliatus may form spawning aggregations, offering the potential for exposure to multiple reproductive partners. The finding raises fundamental questions about the basis of pairing, mate choice and partnership longevity in this family...|$|R
60|$|We thus see that, {{although}} there is a clear and great difference between the mere adhesion of grafted stocks and the union of the male and female elements in the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> yet that there is a rude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing distinct species. And as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the facility with which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so I believe that the still more complex laws governing the facility of first crosses are incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. These differences in both cases follow, to a certain extent, as might have been expected, systematic affinity, by which term every kind of resemblance and dissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be expressed. The facts by no means seem to indicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or crossing various species has been a special endowment; although in the case of crossing, the difficulty is as important for the endurance and stability of specific forms {{as in the case of}} grafting it is unimportant for their welfare.|$|R
