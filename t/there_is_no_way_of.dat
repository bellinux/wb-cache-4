5|$|Clement {{begins the}} fourth {{book with a}} belated {{explanation}} of the disorganized nature of the work, and gives {{a brief description of}} his aims for the remaining three or four books. The fourth book focuses on martyrdom. While all good Christians should be unafraid of death, Clement condemns those who actively seek out a martyr's death, arguing {{that they do not have}} sufficient respect for God's gift of life. He is ambivalent whether any believing Christian can become a martyr by virtue of the manner of their death, or whether martyrdom is reserved for those who have lived exceptional lives. Marcionites cannot become martyrs, because they do not believe in the divinity of God the Father – their sufferings are in vain. There is then a digression to the subject of theological epistemology. According to Clement, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> empirically testing the existence of God the Father, because the Logos has revelatory, not analysable meaning, although Christ was an object of the senses. God had no beginning, and is the universal first principle.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{caesarean}} section (CS).

25|$|British {{political}} scientist David B. MacDonald wrote a comprehensive {{root cause analysis}} of the inflated numbers in his 2003 book:By contrast with Jasenovac, however, most impartial historians converged on much lower number of dead, suggesting that Bleiburg {{was by no means}} as significant as the largest death-camp in Yugoslavia.... Jasper Ridley attempts a more precise figure, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> knowing for sure.... Of these, he noted that the Allies agreed to surrender 23,000 to the Partisans between 24 and 29 May - a mixture of Slovenians, Serbians, and Croatians. Reports from the time according to Ridley, indicate that not all 23,000 were killed.|$|E

25|$|The {{rest of the}} Pyramid is {{interpreted}} by Alford as a network of secret chambers in which religious relics were concealed– hence {{the title of his}} book Pyramid of Secrets. This is the weakest part of his case, as the textual support for the idea is thin and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> knowing what might have been contained in the chambers that we know of today. Once again, Alford’s theory can be proven or negated by future exploration, since it is central to his case that further secret chambers exist. In this regard, his thoughts are guided by the scholar J.P. Lepre, who claimed that anomalous patterns in the Pyramid’s masonry joints might be signs to the existence of hidden passages and chambers.|$|E
25|$|While {{concrete}} {{figures are}} difficult to determine, the International Labour Organization (ILO) recently reported that {{there are at least}} 600,000 children involved in forced begging. The problem may be much more extensive, however, with China's Ministry of Civil Affairs reporting that as many as 1.5 million children are forced into begging. Additionally, a recent study done in Senegal by Human Rights Watch projected that a minimum of 50,000 children within the country and neighboring nations have been trafficked for the purposes of begging. Begging is often the primary source of income for street children in a number of countries, with a current study conducted by UNICEF finding that 45.7% of children who work on the streets of Zimbabwe engaged in begging, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> knowing whether it was through forced means.|$|E
25|$|But if Tilney's {{censorship}} {{restricted the}} writers, his support protected them from generally hostile civic authorities. The polite fiction of aristocratic patronage did not obscure {{the reality that}} the troupes were commercial enterprises; however, that fiction brought the theatres under royal protection; in 1592, the Lord Mayor of London named Tilney {{as one of the}} obstacles to ending public drama in the city. However, Tilney's censorship was not of a generalising nature. While he did omit politically volatile passages and scenes, some, like the deposition scene in Richard II and the murder of Julius Caesar, were allowed to remain. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> knowing whether Julius Caesar was allowed to be performed uncensored.

25|$|The radio {{emission}} from radio-loud active galaxies is synchrotron emission, as inferred from its very smooth, broad-band nature and strong polarization. This {{implies that the}} radio-emitting plasma contains, at least, electrons with relativistic speeds (Lorentz factors of ~104) and magnetic fields. Since the plasma must be neutral, it must also contain either protons or positrons. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> determining the particle content directly from observations of synchrotron radiation. Moreover, {{there is no way}} to determine the energy densities in particles and magnetic fields from observation: the same synchrotron emissivity may be a result of a few electrons and a strong field, or a weak field and many electrons, or something in between. It is possible to determine a minimum energy condition which is the minimum energy density that a region with a given emissivity can have, but for many years there was no particular reason to believe that the true energies were anywhere near the minimum energies.|$|E

2500|$|In this sense, {{there is}} no {{question}} of agricultural policies versus industrial policies, of permanent and determined disagreement.
