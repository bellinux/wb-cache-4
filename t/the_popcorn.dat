5|$|Although boogaloo {{was already}} a fad dance and a music genre in the 1960s, it did not become a dance style until Boogaloo Sam learned it, {{expanded}} it, and started performing it in public venues. He was influenced to expand boogaloo by cartoons; the 1960s social dances the Twist, <b>the</b> <b>Popcorn,</b> and the Jerk; and the movements of everyday people. As a dance style, it is characterized by rolling hip, knee, and head movements as if the body has no bones. Electric boogaloo is the signature dance style of The Electric Boogaloos. It {{is a combination of}} boogaloo and popping.|$|E

But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E

The news of a standalone Superman film were later confirmed by Dany Garcia, Henry Cavill's manager. While promoting Arrival, Amy Adams confirmed work has begun on the screenplay.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Nigel Dick and was filmed from 4 to 6 October 1999 at the Mission Tiki drive-in theatre in Montclair, California. In the video, Raven sings the song while {{she is in a}} car with a boy, while Larsen sings and plays the guitar in front of another car. This footage is mixed with M2M singing together at the drive-in, people dancing, the projectionist struggling with his malfunctioning equipment, and the concession stand worker who has an overflowing popcorn maker. When <b>the</b> <b>popcorn</b> stand explodes, M2M continue to perform surrounded by people as popcorn rains down. Air cannons were used to fire 200 garbage bin-sized bags of popcorn into the air to create the raining popcorn effect. In the US the music video made its premiere on 24 October on The WB following that night's screening of 7th Heaven. It began airing on The Box and MuchMusic in early November 1999 and began airing on MTV on 15 November.|$|E
5|$|They then wander to the {{concessions}} stand. There the babies find popcorn, orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, candy bars, ketchup, mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice the babies because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks <b>the</b> <b>popcorn</b> both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take {{interest in the}} soda dispensers, pushing the buttons and spilling the soft drinks on the counters and floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start playing with the ketchup and mustard dispensers by the hot dog sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie points out the stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs. As soon as the babies leave, the two teenagers notice the massive mess and scream.|$|E

25|$|A very {{different}} method of popcorn-making {{can still be}} seen on the streets of some Chinese cities and Korea today. The un-popped corn kernels are poured into a large cast-iron canister — sometimes called a 'popcorn hammer' — that is then sealed with a heavy lid and slowly turned over a curbside fire in rotisserie fashion. When a pressure gauge on the canister reaches a certain level, the canister is removed from the fire, a large canvas sack is put over the lid and the seal is released. With a huge boom, all of <b>the</b> <b>popcorn</b> explodes at once and is poured into the sack. This method {{is believed to have been}} developed, during the Song dynasty, originally for puffing rice.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Depression, popcorn {{was fairly}} {{inexpensive}} at 5–10 cents {{a bag and}} became popular. Thus, while other businesses failed, <b>the</b> <b>popcorn</b> business thrived and became a {{source of income for}} many struggling farmers, including the Redenbacher family, namesake of the famous popcorn brand. During World War II, sugar rations diminished candy production, and Americans compensated by eating three times as much popcorn as they had before. The snack was popular at theaters, much to the initial displeasure of many of the theater owners, who thought it distracted from the films. Their minds eventually changed, however, and in 1938 a Midwestern theater owner named Glen W. Dickson installed popcorn machines in the lobbies of his theaters. The venture was a financial success, and the trend soon spread.|$|E
25|$|The first Kiss {{performance}} was on January 30, 1973, {{for an audience}} of three at <b>the</b> <b>Popcorn</b> Club (renamed Coventry shortly afterward) in Queens. For the first three gigs, January 30 to February 1, they wore little to no makeup; the iconic makeup designs associated with Kiss made their debut during the March 9–10 shows at The Daisy in Amityville, New York. On March 13 of that year, the band recorded a five-song demo tape with producer Eddie Kramer. Former TV director Bill Aucoin, who had seen the group at a handful of showcase concerts {{in the summer of}} 1973, offered to become the band's manager in mid-October. Kiss agreed, with the condition that Aucoin sign the band to a record label within two weeks. On November 1, 1973, Kiss became the first act signed to former teen pop singer and Buddah Records executive Neil Bogart's new label, Casablanca Records.|$|E

500|$|When {{production}} restarted in 2005, {{there was}} a more budget-conscious approach to filming The Fountain, whose original budget was mostly intended for visual effects. Libatique reflected, [...] "Visual effects [...] {{a lot of the}} budget in the original conception. <b>The</b> <b>popcorn</b> moments were in there to justify the budget and bring target audiences into the theater. Ultimately, I think the streamlining of the film helped us tell the story more effectively. It's been stripped down to the core, to what it's really about: a search for immortality, when the truth of life is mortality. I {{think at the end of}} the day, the theme of the film will be easier to feel." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{original}} title was simply Killer Klowns, but the filmmakers added the words [...] "from Outer Space" [...] to prevent audiences from assuming {{the film was}} a slasher movie.

The film was Christopher Titus' first role in a motion picture. <b>The</b> <b>popcorn</b> gun used by the clowns in the film, which included a compressor that would allow the weapon to actually propel popcorn, was the most expensive prop made for the production, costing $7,000 to create and taking six weeks to build.
