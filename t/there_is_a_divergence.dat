The two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by Appian and Plutarch detail very different events.

The best case scenario for shale gas development in Europe {{is one in which}} declining conventional production can be replaced and import dependence maintained at a level of around 60%." [...] <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>divergence</b> of opinion among the Weimar Triangle countries with regard to shale gas development.

60|$|This book is {{composed}} (on the Linotype), in Scotch. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>divergence</b> of opinion regarding the exact origin of this face, some authorities holding {{that it was}} first cut by Alexander Wilson & Son, of Glasgow, in 1837; others trace it back to a modernized Caslon old style brought out by Mrs. Henry Caslon in 1796 {{to meet the demand}} for modern faces brought about by the popularity of the Bodoni types. Whatever its origin, it is certain that the face was widely used in Scotland, where it was called Modern Roman, and since its introduction into America it has been known as Scotch. The essential characteristics of the Scotch face are its sturdy capitals, its full rounded lower case, the graceful fillet of its serifs and the general effect of crispness.|$|E

I presume {{you would}} say that in artistic {{teaching}} there are some points on which there would be common ground, and others upon which there must be specific teaching; for instance, in sculpture and painting {{there is a point}} up to which the proportions of the human figure have to be studied, but afterwards <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>divergence</b> between the two arts of chiseling marble and laying colors on the canvas?--Certainly. I should think all that might be arranged in an Academy system very simply. You would have first your teaching of drawing with the soft point; and associated with that, chiaroscuro: you would then have the teaching of drawing with the hard or black point, involving the teaching of the best system of engraving, and all that was necessary to form your school of engravers: you would then proceed to metal work; and on working in metal you would found your school of sculpture, and on that your school of architecture: and finally, and above all, you would have your school of painting, including oil painting and fresco painting, and all painting in permanent material; (not comprising painting in any material that was not permanent:) and with that you would associate your school of chemistry, which should teach what was permanent and what was not; which school of chemistry should declare authoritatively, with the Academy's seal, what colors would stand and what process would secure their standing: and should have a sort of Apothecaries' Hall where anybody who required them could procure colors in the purest state; all these things being organized in one great system, and only possibly right by their connection and in their connection.|$|E

50|$|In {{spite of}} its many unifying factors, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>divergence</b> between the {{northern}} and southern principalities. In 1169, Prince Andrei Bogoliubskii of Vladimir sacked Kiev, which exemplifies the princely rivalry that undermined central dynastic authority. The modern Russian language also began to form in the 11th century, due to the late consolidation of the northern Slavic tribes under Rus. More so, the conquerors and local peoples mixed their languages, mixing Finno-Ugric with Old East Slavic.|$|R
25|$|Led {{by former}} {{minister}} William Pugsley, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>divergence</b> of opinion concerning {{the purchase of}} the submarines. Initially heralded by Prime Minister Robert Borden as a masterstroke, rumours began to circulate about problems developing on the submarines and the exorbitant cost the Government of British Columbia, and then Canada, had paid and that Paterson, the president of Seattle Construction, had pocketed a large commission. These rumours led to the submarine purchase being investigated by a Royal Commission into dubious war purchases.|$|R

According to the author, both cases reveal that the application of the law, when free non-Whites were involved, was apparently open to interpretation and that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>divergence</b> in this respect between the colony and the metropole. Author assesses this conflict between the theory of the law and the practice of the administration of justice in the colonies...|$|R

40|$|In ultrarelativistic {{heavy ion}} {{collisions}} a finite size QCD medium is created. In this paper we compute radiative energy loss to zeroth order in opacity by {{taking into account}} finite size effects. Transition radiation occurs on {{the boundary between the}} finite size medium and the vacuum, and we show that it lowers the difference between medium and vacuum zeroth order radiative energy loss relative to the infinite size medium case. Further, in all previous computations of light parton radiation to zeroth order in opacity, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>divergence</b> caused {{by the fact that the}} energy loss is infinite in the vacuum and finite in the QCD medium. We show that this infinite discontinuity is naturally regulated by including the transition radiation. ...|$|R

5000|$|When consumed, a {{merit good}} creates {{positive}} externalities (an externality being a third party/spill-over effect which {{arises from the}} consumption or production of the good/service). This means that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>divergence</b> between private benefit and public benefit when a merit good is consumed (i.e. the public benefit {{is greater than the}} private benefit). However, as consumers only take into account private benefits when consuming merit goods, it means that they are under-consumed (and so under-produced).|$|E

50|$|Early surf skis were {{constructed}} {{in the same way}} as early surfboards, being laminated from light wood and sometimes covered with fabric. In the 1960s, the first foam surfboards and surf skis <b>were</b> carved from <b>a</b> single block of expanded polystyrene foam, strengthened with wooden stringers and covered with a thin layer of fibreglass. As the demand for surf skis grew in the 1970s, this custom method of production proved too costly and moulds were made from the most successful surf skis so that moulded craft could be made more cost effectively out of glass-fibre. At the same time, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>divergence</b> in ski design, one type becoming known as the lifesaving specification surf ski (spec ski) and the other being the long distance or ocean racing surf ski.|$|R

50|$|Sympathetic preganglionic fibers {{tend to be}} {{shorter than}} {{parasympathetic}} preganglionic fibers because sympathetic ganglia are often closer to the spinal cord than are the parasympathetic ganglia. Another major {{difference between the two}} ANS (autonomic nervous systems) is divergence. Whereas in the parasympathetic division <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>divergence</b> factor of roughly 1:4, in the sympathetic division there can be a divergence of up to 1:20. This is due to the number of synapses formed by the preganglionic fibers with ganglionic neurons.|$|E
5000|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>divergence</b> {{of views}} within Buddhism {{as to whether}} vegetarianism is required, with some schools of Buddhism rejecting such a requirement.

Some Buddhists do strongly oppose meat-eating {{on the basis of}} scriptural injunctions against flesh-eating accorded in Mahayana sutras.|$|E
50|$|The role of amicus curiae briefs in the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute {{settlement}} system is controversial. The controversy arises {{due to the}} governmental nature of WTO disputes.
