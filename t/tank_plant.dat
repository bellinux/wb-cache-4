25|$|Lima {{benefited from}} {{increased}} production during World War II {{and a growing}} population, but suffered a significant economic decline {{at the end of}} the decade when industry retooled for peacetime production. In May 1941, based in the steel foundry, construction began on Lima Army <b>Tank</b> <b>Plant</b> to manufacture centrifugally cast gun tubes. In November 1942, United Motors Services took over operation of the plant to process vehicles under government contract. The plant prepared many vehicles for Europe, including the M5 light tank and the T-26 Pershing tank. At its peak during the war, the Lima Tank Depot (now the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, operated by General Dynamics), employed over 5,000 people.|$|E
500|$|This {{agreement}} {{laid the}} foundations for the upcoming <b>tank</b> <b>plant</b> at the industrial polygon of Las Canteras, {{near the town of}} Alcalá de Guadaíra. [...] Several parts of the tank were subcontracted to other Spanish companies, including Astilleros Españoles (turret), Boetticher, Duro Felguera and E. N. Bazán. [...] The grade of local production varied per batch. [...] The first 20 tanks were to have 18% of each vehicle manufactured in Spain; the next 40 would have 40% of the vehicle manufactured in Spain. [...] The other 120 had 65% of the tank manufactured in the country. [...] Production began in 1974, at a rate of five tanks per month, and ended on 25 June 1979. [...] The first five tanks were delivered to the Uad Ras Mechanized Infantry Regiment on 30 October 1974. [...] This batch also replaced the M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks and M48 Patton tanks in the Armored Cavalry Regiment Villaviciosa and the Armored Infantry Regiment Alcázar de Toledo, receiving 23 and 44 tanks, respectively.|$|E

The <b>tank</b> power <b>plant</b> has evolved from predominantly petrol and adapted large-displacement aeronautical or automotive engines during World Wars I and II, through diesel engines to advanced multi-fuel diesel engines, and powerful (per unit weight) but fuel-hungry gas turbines in the T-80 and M1 Abrams.|$|R
2500|$|Chrysler was {{appointed}} to manage a new <b>tank</b> <b>plant,</b> the Detroit Arsenal <b>Tank</b> <b>Plant,</b> to manufacture the M2, and the US Government contracted on 15 August 1940 for 1,000 vehicles to be produced {{at a rate of}} 100 a month and to be delivered by August 1942 at a fixed price of [...] $33,500 per tank. Events in Europe made it obvious that the M2 was obsolete, and the government modified the contract two weeks later, before production began. Instead of M2 medium tanks, the plant would now build 1,000 M3 Grant tanks once they had been designed. In the interim production of the M2 was given to the Rock Island Arsenal, where 94 M2A1s were built up to August 1941. The M2A1 had slightly better armor and a slightly larger turret than the original M2, since it had the turret from the M3 Light Tank, with gun mantlet armor 2inches (51mm) thick.|$|E

Also a visible difference {{in the shape of}} the swim bladder can be seen above and behind the silverish abdominal cavity. To breed these fish, they should be given a small, dedicated breeding <b>tank</b> <b>planted</b> with thick bunches of fine-leaved plants such as Myriophyllum on which they can lay eggs.

ET system sizing requirements were determined {{from the water}} balance equation. Water loss from lysimeters planted with trees (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) or lawn grass and from bare soil and gravel was monitored over several months and compared to pan evaporation measured during the same period. It was found that ET from bare soil and grass followed similar trends to pan evaporation, ranging from 30 - 60 % of pan evaporation for soil and from 60 - 80 % of pan evaporation for grass. ET rates increased in the <b>tanks</b> <b>planted</b> with trees as the plants grew and exceeded pan evaporation rates.
