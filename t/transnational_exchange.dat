40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{a phase of}} {{experimental}} social policy has emerged in the EU {{in the wake of}} various generations of funding programmes and projects that actively encouraged <b>transnational</b> <b>exchange</b> and mutual learning. Underlying these programmes are a number of assumptions: that <b>transnational</b> <b>exchange</b> will lead to individual learning, that individual learning will lead to organisational learning and that the result of organisational learning will be changes to policy and practice. These assumptions were tested using an EU-funded project named ‘Local Strategies for the Active Inclusion of Young People facing multiple disadvantages—Com. In’. This project was carried out by local authorities, NGOs and research organisations in four European cities from 2011 to 2013. The results demonstrate a number of barriers to moving from <b>transnational</b> <b>exchange</b> to changes to policy and practice. However, it also identified inter- and intra-agency relationships as a key area where positive change could come about and the conditions that made such change possible.

These <b>transnational</b> <b>exchanges</b> allow us to map Hollywood-China relationship in the new millennium, which transcends literal and figurative borders and boundaries and obtains new significations through different cultural articulations.

40|$|Who benefited {{more from}} the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade: Ghanaians or Europeans? ” That’s the test {{question}} on the official government syllabus/standards for Ghanaian schools. The syllabus also lists the benefits of colonization and that list far outweighs the detriments. The lack of a broader understanding about the devastation {{brought on by the}} Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade (TAST) is not exclusive to Ghana, but proves similar in the United States and likely throughout the world. Generally, the TAST appears lost in Trans-lation in secondary schools. The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade forms the most <b>transnational</b> <b>exchange</b> surrounding Africa and the African Diaspora. The TAST to the Americas relocated millions of people, killed untold more, and treated those who survived as property based on their melanin, causing many wars that affect the world to today. To broaden our understanding of the pedagogies of the TAST, Ghanaian secondary teachers were interviewed; textbooks and the national standards were reviewed along with Ghana's role {{at the heart of the}} TAST with Cape Coast as a central embarking point. We discovered a lack of instruction about the transnational and contemporary impacts of the TAST at the secondary level. Through our study of the TAST’s instruction in Ghana’s secondary schools a need to expand how teachers inform students about the breadth of the TAST was discovered. This article will focus primarily on Ghana’s lack of transnational reach at the secondary school level due to the limits of standardized testing, the Ghana Educational Service’s syllabus, the textbooks utilized, assessments, poverty, teacher awareness and neocolonialism.

We then examine the effect of the EC legal system on policy outcomes at both the national and supranational levels in two policy domains: the free movement of goods and gender equality. Our theory outperforms its leading rival, intergovernmentalism. The evidence shows that European integration has generally been driven by transnational activity and the efforts of EC institutions to reduce transaction costs, behavior which governments react to but do not control...|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} European {{integration}} is provoked and {{sustained by the}} development of causal connections between three factors: <b>transnational</b> <b>exchange,</b> supranational organization, and EC rule-making. We explain the transition in any given policy sector, from national to intergovernmental to supranational governance, in two ways. First, cross-border transactions and communications generate a social demand for EC rules and regulation, which supranational organizations work to supply. We thus expect that the Community competencies will be unevenly constructed, both across policy sectors and over time, {{as a function of the}} intensity of these demands. Second, once the EC rules are in place, a process of institutionalization ensues, and this process provokes further integration. Although we recognize the importance of intergovernmental bargaining in EC politics, our theory is not compatible with existing intergovernmental theorizing...|$|E

A focal point in ‘second-wave’ Italian feminism, these groups were profoundly shaped by feminist debates and practices in, notably, the USA and France. The analysis highlights the centrality of local actors in translating, appropriating and re-(and de-) contextualizing transnational sources, thus transforming their meanings. Questioning the often automatic status ascribed to the nation-state as analytical framework, the article illustrates that re-contextualization equally takes place on the local (as distinct from national) level, and that these layered transfer processes are central to understanding the complexity and effectiveness of postwar social movements such as feminism...|$|E

This article reports the results of a panel study of 36 countries of the East European and Mediterranean neighbourhood of the EU for the years 1988 — 2004. The analysis shows robust and strong effects of EU political conditionality on democracy in the neighbouring countries if the EU offers a membership perspective in return for political reform. Absent the offer of membership, however, EU incentives such as partnership and cooperation do not reliably promote democratic change.

30|$|This article {{started by}} {{introducing}} a genuine typology of immigrant responses to their family’s {{and their own}} health care need {{in an era of}} increased <b>transnational</b> <b>exchanges.</b> In this sense, it has bridged the conceptual gap between rather static understandings of social protection as developed by social policy scholars and the unspecified strategies to access formal care discussed in previous work on transnational migration. Building on the concept of transnational social protection arrangement, we then discussed how immigrants articulate these different strategies according to different heterogeneity markers that operate in the various national contexts where transnational family networks are active. For our particular case study of Andean MDW, these markers were gendered responsibilities within the family, class, and ethnicity as experienced in the sending and receiving context but also religiosity, generational positioning within families and level of transnational engagement.|$|R
40|$|With the European Neighbourhood Policy, the European Union (EU) {{intensified}} {{functional cooperation}} {{in a wide}} range of sectors. This contribution investigates whether this kind of <b>transnational</b> <b>exchange</b> can trigger subtle processes of democratization. It argues that third state officials become acquainted with democratic governance by participating in transgovernmental policy networks implementing functional cooperation between state administrations of established democracies and authoritarian regimes. In this vein, it enriches the governance model of democracy promotion by adding a new level, the micro-level of democratic socialization. Empirically, the argument is tested taking two Twinning projects that the EU has set up in Morocco, that is, the projects on competition policy and on the environment. The conclusion is that in some non-politicized policy fields, such as the environment, EU transgovernmental policy networks can successfully yield processes of democratic socialization in the context of a stable authoritarian regime, like that in Morocco...|$|E

In the case of Australia, these workers are mostly home-based and not in factories.

Such perspectives on displacement suggest {{that it is not the}} place of exiled artists, which needs to be reassessed within national dance histories; rather, these artists offer an opportunity to assess the contours of the historical narrations themselves and, with them, other forms of belonging. The case studies of Valeska Gert and Kurt Jooss highlight the micropolitics of exile’s <b>transnational</b> <b>exchange.</b> These intricate, personalized cross-currents were catalyzed by survival strategies that registered in the work itself and left traces in history, which can only be seen by engaging with multiple forms of otherness...|$|E
30|$|More recently, {{the concept}} of social {{remittances}} has given birth to the cognate idea of “political” remittances, in which the ongoing <b>transnational</b> <b>exchanges</b> between migrants and stay-at-homes serve as vehicles for “remitting” political experiences, ideas, values and expectations (Lacroix, Levitt, & Vari-Lavoisier, 2016; Piper, 2009). Unlike economic remittances – where the impact derives from the wage difference in sending and receiving country, for example – non-material remittances become channeled to the political arena only when the migration entails a move across institutionally distinctive polities. In this light, exposure to the disparate characteristics of the receiving polity, whether more democratic, peaceful, representative, participatory, accountable, or institutionally more predictable (or less), leads migrants to remit implicit and explicit political ideas, preferences, and behaviors related to their new, possibly “enriching” experiences back home to their compatriots (Batista & Vicente, 2011).|$|R
