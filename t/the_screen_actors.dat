5|$|Another major {{challenge}} {{that came up}} in production was who Monk's new psychiatrist would be.

5|$|Cagney {{announced}} in March 1942 {{that his brother}} William and he were setting up Cagney Productions to release films though United Artists. Free of Warner Bros. again, Cagney spent some time relaxing on his farm in Martha's Vineyard before volunteering to join the USO.
