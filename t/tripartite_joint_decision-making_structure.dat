40|$|This article {{examines}} the federal legislative regime for governing offshore oil development in Australia. Adopting an evolutionary perspective, the article considers how the Australian petroleum regime {{has been able to}} avoid the 'asymmetry of costs and benefits' which have shut down the offshore oil leasing program on the US west coast. To this end, it is shown that the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act has overcome jurisdictional issues by creating a partnership between the federal and state governments, enabling both to share in the benefits of policy making. This <b>joint</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>structure</b> is narrowly focused upon exploitation, though, and does not deal with environmental issues outside of its original scope. The absence of a complementary regime to fill this policy gap permits environmental costs to go unaccounted in petroleum development. This shortcoming notwithstanding, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act provides a useful model by which federal/state jurisdictional limitations can be overcome. Ocean and coastal issues are currently receiving political attention in Australia, and it is timely for the cooperative governance model to be revisited and also extended to other marine policy sectors. Moreover, joint authority approaches could be considered by other federations struggling with offshore jurisdiction issues...|$|R
30|$|Compared {{with the}} {{traditional}} image hashing concept, the superiority of content-based fingerprint concept lies in its potential high discriminating capability, better robustness, and multilayer security arising from the combination of various robust feature descriptors and a <b>joint</b> <b>decision-making</b> process. Same as in any information fusion processes, theoretically the discrimination capability of the content-based fingerprinting with effective <b>joint</b> <b>decision-making</b> scheme should outperform a single image hashing. Since the content-based fingerprint consists of several hash vectors, which are generated based on various robust features and different secret keys, {{it is argued that}} the framework of content-based fingerprinting results in a better robustness and multilayer security when an efficient <b>joint</b> <b>decision-making</b> is available. However, combining multiple image hashes approaches requires additional computation cost for the generation of content-based fingerprinting. The tradeoff between computation cost and performance is a concern with great importance in practice.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to explain <b>decision-making</b> <b>structures</b> in Swiss politics. <b>Decision-making</b> <b>structures</b> describe {{the relations between}} collective actors collaborating and fighting for influence in a policy network and are defined by two main dimensions, which are power and conflict. For the explanation of <b>decision-making</b> <b>structures,</b> the paper relies on factors such as Europeanization, media presence, federalism, the pre-parliamentary phase and the referendum. I assume that these different factors {{interact with each other}} when they influence the <b>decision-making</b> <b>structure.</b> In order to assess the importance of these factors, the paper compares the 11 most important decision-making processes in Switzerland between 2001 and 2006. The analysis relies on an innovative integration of two methods. In a first step, I apply Social Network Analysis to describe the two dimensions of <b>decision-making</b> <b>structures.</b> In a second step, in order to detect the different combinations of causes which lead to different structures, the 11 cases are compared by a Qualitative-Comparative Analysis (QCA). The results suggest that all five factors are important to understand <b>decision-making</b> <b>structures</b> and that equifinality and conjunctural causation are at work...|$|R

40|$|The {{previous}} chapter uncovered {{important differences}} between <b>decision-making</b> <b>structures</b> across the 11 processes investigated by this study. As we have noted, both historically and in much contemporary literature, the Swiss political {{system has been}} described as highly consensual. And yet, when we focus on differences between <b>decision-making</b> <b>structures</b> across different policy domains, important elements appear that point toward a more conflictual style of decision-making. Both when there is a power balance between coalitions and {{in the presence of a}} dominant coalition, coalition interactions are conflictual in the majority of cases. Based on the descriptive account of these differences in Chapter 4, the present chapter studies the conditions under which given <b>decision-making</b> <b>structures</b> emerge. Under which circumstances are actors able to form a dominant coalition, and which conditions lead to a situation where power is more evenly balanced between coalitions? Which conditions lead actors to develop a conflictual rather than a consensual type of interaction? Answering these questions can give us some indication of the factors responsible for different types of <b>decision-making</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{previous}} chapter {{presented the}} overall <b>decision-making</b> <b>structure</b> in Swiss {{politics at the}} beginning of the 21 st century. This provides us with a general picture and allows for a comparison over time with the <b>decision-making</b> <b>structure</b> in the 1970 s. However, the analysis of the overall <b>decision-making</b> <b>structure</b> potentially neglects important differences between policy domains (Atkinson and Coleman 1989; Knoke et al. 1996; Kriesi et al. 2006 a; Sabatier 1987). Policy issues vary across policy domains, as do the political actors involved. In addition, actors may hold different policy preferences from one policy domain to the next, and they may also collaborate with other partners depending on the policy domain at stake. Examining differences between policy domains is particularly appropriate in Switzerland. Because no fixed coalitions of government and opposition exist, actors create different coalitions in each policy domain (Linder and Schwarz 2008). Whereas important parts of the institutional setting are similar across policy domains, <b>decision-making</b> <b>structures</b> might still vary. As was the case with the cross-time analysis conducted in the two previous chapters, a stability of 'rules-in-form' might hide important variations in 'rules-in-use' also across different policy domains...|$|R

40|$|Pavement {{management}} systems {{need to address}} not only maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) decisions, but also facility inspection decisions. The {{state of the art}} in pavement management is lacking of any consistent methodology for making such decisions on a cost-effectiveness basis. Such a methodology must recognize the presence of interactions between M&R and inspection decisions. These interactions argue for a <b>joint</b> <b>decision-making</b> approach, where the sum of inspection and M&R costs is minimized. This paper reviews different possible mathematical formulations to such a <b>joint</b> <b>decision-making</b> model, having various levels of restriction and computational complexity. These formulations are then compared and the effect of the forecast uncertainty on the minimum expected costs produced by each of them is investigated empirically. It is concluded that optimizing inspection decisions jointly with M&R decisions can lead to substantial cost savings, especially for high precisions of forecasting. ...|$|R

This is mainly due to the as yet neglected phenomenon of the interaction between representative institutions at different levels in the European Union that characterises <b>joint</b> <b>decision-making.</b> The European Parliament, as a co-legislator with veto power in the co-decision procedure, has been a crucial organisational actor. Its interactions with other actors such as national parliaments and the Council of Ministers and the European Commission are particular relevant in the building-up of more appropriate and legitimate incentives for the correct implementation of common policies, internalising many externalities. It has also allowed for a more active role of EU national parliaments in the EU legislative process, increasing their leverage vis-à-vis their respective governments as far as European legislation is concerned.

We offer a general treatment that allows one to analyze {{the full range of}} organizational architectures between extreme centralized and decentralized forms (often referred to as hierarchies and polyarchies). Our approach furthermore allows designers to examine the change in the overall reliability of the organizational structure as the number of actors within the organization changes. We provide general proofs that show how <b>decision-making</b> <b>structures</b> can be constructed so they maximize reliability for a given number of agents. Our model can be used directly for a qualitative assessment of <b>decision-making</b> <b>structures.</b> It is thereby useful for assessment of the many complicated hybrid structures that we see in actual decision-making organizations, such as banks, purchasing departments, and military intelligence.

We use survey data from 107 manufacturing plants. This research identifies three different structures: centralised at the network headquarter, decentralised to the plant and integrated between central headquarters and the plant. All decision areas follow the same pattern, i. e. full centralisation, full decentralisation or full integration. We do not find any support for that some decisions are centralised while others are decentralised. Product volume and process type are significantly associated with the choice of <b>decision-making</b> <b>structure.</b> In particular, high product volumes are associated with a centralised approach, and a low degree of process flow orientation (such as project manufacturing, job shop and flow shop) is associated with a decentralised approach.
