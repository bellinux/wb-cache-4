50|$|After loading in the station, {{the train}} moves forward and stops. Mist blows {{in front of}} the train and thunder sounds as the train {{launches}} to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds by linear synchronous motors. The train immediately goes into a 140 ft Immelmann loop. After the first element, the train then goes down its first drop into a 125 ft vertical loop, the tallest vertical loop on a Wing Coaster, surpassing Wild Eagle at Dollywood. After the vertical loop, the train crosses over the exit from The Voyage's second drop, goes through an overbanked turn, and then an overbanked elevated spiral. The train then goes through a zero-g-roll parallel to The Voyage. After several curves next to The Voyage's triple-down drop and spaghetti bowl, the train dips down into a barn (which is the keyhole) where it then curves left back into the barn by doing an inline twist, crossing over The Voyage's underground tunnels. Once the inline <b>twist</b> <b>ends</b> the train enters the brake run to a right turn to another set of brakes before entering the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 1 minute and 18 seconds.|$|E
