Furthermore, locating the <b>Tragion</b> (t) was difficult due to shadowing from the subjects hair in the ear region; this problem has been reported previously [28].|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} clarify the {{relationship}} between displacement of center of gravity（ CG） and 3 -point shot success rate in basketball. The movement of CG during 3 -point shots in experienced players with high 3 -point shot success rates was compared with that in inexperienced players with low success rates. The subjects were selected from 52 members of a university women’s basketball team. The experienced group comprised 6 players subjectively evaluated to have high 3 -point shot success rates by 2 coaches accredited by the Japan Sports Association as advanced coaches. The inexperienced group comprised 6 players subjectively evaluated as having poor 3 -point shot success rates by the same coaches. CG movement during a 3 -point shot was measured using a two-dimensional direct linear transformation method. The 3 -point shot success rate for each group was calculated from 100 attempts and the success rate was significantly higher in the experienced group（ 72. 8 ± 4. 7 ％ vs. 35. 8 ± 6. 6 ％, p< 0. 05 ）. To compare differences in shooting motion between the experienced and inexperienced groups, the following phases of the 3 -point shot were established:（ 1 ） stance → catch,（ 2 ） catch → set,（ 3 ） stance → set,（ 4 ） set → release,（ 5 ） release → maximum, and（ 6 ） set → maximum. The main {{results of the present}} study were as follows: 1 ． In the experienced group, vertical displacements of CG were significantly smaller in the stance → catch, set → release, release → maximum, and set → maximum phases, while horizontal displacements of CG were also significantly smaller in the stance → catch, catch → set, stance → set, and set → maximum phases（ p< 0. 05 ）. 2 ． In the experienced group, vertical acceleration of CG was significantly smaller in the stance → set, set → release, and set → maximum phases, while horizontal acceleration was also significantly smaller in the stance → set phase（ p< 0. 05 ）. 3 ． In the experienced group, vertical displacements of the <b>tragion</b> were significantly smaller in the stance → catch and set → maximum phases, while horizontal displacements of the <b>tragion</b> were significantly smaller in the catch → set and stance → set phases （p< 0. 05 ）. 4 ． Significant negative correlations were found between 3 -point shot success rate and vertical displacement of CG in the set → release and set → maximum phases, horizontal displacement of CG in the stance → set phase, vertical displacement of the <b>tragion</b> in the stance → catch phase, and horizontal displacement of the <b>tragion</b> in the catch → set and stance → set phases（ p< 0. 05 ）. These results indicate that it is important to reduce the displacement of CG and the <b>tragion</b> when coaching 3 -point shots in basketball...|$|E
30|$|Phase 2 : {{preparation}} of the face to be mapped. The face must be free of make-up, with the hair back, to clearly and completely expose {{the parts of the}} face to be mapped and the natural texture of the skin. An operator identifies the anatomical skin landmarks on the face through direct method of inspection and palpation. In the present study, 33 landmarks were used, as selected from those according to Sforza et al. and Swennen and Farkas [28 – 32], and as illustrated in Figure  4. These were then marked by the same operator using hypoallergenic eyeliner to more easily locate the positions of these various anatomical landmarks (Figure  5). The operator then applies three especially made hypoallergenic coded targets to the face at points N’, T_dx, and T_sx. The main skin landmarks used are [29, 33 – 35] midpoints (trichion (Tr), glabella (G), skin nasion (N’), pronasal (Prn), subnasal (Sn), labialis superior (Ls), labial inferior (Li), sub labialis (Sl), skin pogonion (Pg’), skin menton (Me’)) and bilateral points (upper orbital (Os), frontotemporal (Ft), endocanthion (En), exocanthion (Ex), chresta philtri (Chp), cheilion (Ch), <b>tragion</b> (T’), nasal wing crest (Ac), skin antegonial point (Go’)).|$|E
40|$|AbstractAny {{developmental}} {{relationship between}} bipolar disorder and schizophrenia engenders continuing debate. As {{the brain and}} face emerge in embryological intimacy, brain dysmorphogenesis is accompanied by facial dysmorphogenesis. 3 D laser surface imaging was used to capture the facial surface of 13 male and 14 female patients with bipolar disorder in comparison with 61 male and 75 female control subjects and with 37 male and 32 female patients with schizophrenia. Surface images were analysed using geometric morphometrics and 3 D visualisations to identify domains of facial shape that distinguish bipolar patients from controls and bipolar patients from those with schizophrenia. Both male and female bipolar patients evidenced significant facial dysmorphology: common to male and female patients was overall facial widening, increased width of nose, narrowing of mouth and upward displacement of the chin; dysmorphology differed {{between male and female}} patients for nose length, lip thickness and <b>tragion</b> height. There were few morphological differences in comparison with schizophrenia patients. That dysmorphology of the frontonasal prominences and related facial regions in bipolar disorder is more similar to than different from that found in schizophrenia indicates some common dysmorphogenesis. Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia might reflect similar insult(s) acting over slightly differing time-frames or slightly differing insult(s) acting over a similar time-frame...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the accuracy and repeatability of linear anthropometric measurements on the soft tissue surface model generated from cone beam computed tomography scans. Materials and Methods: The study sample consisted of seven cadaver heads. The accuracy and repeatability were assessed by means of a series of 21 standardized, linear facial measurements derived from 11 landmarks taken both directly on the face with a set of digital calipers and indirectly from a three-dimensional soft tissue surface model generated from a cone beam computed tomography scan of the heads using SimPlant (R) Ortho Pro software. The landmarks and measurements were chosen to cover various regions of the face with an emphasis on the oral-nasal region. The cone beam computed tomography measurements were compared with the physical measurements. Statistical analysis for the repeatability was done by means of the intraclass coefficient. Accuracy was determined by means of the absolute error and absolute percentage error. Results: The cone beam computed tomography measurements were very accurate when compared with the physical measurements (0. 962 to 0. 999). Except for one measurement, between point <b>tragion</b> (t) and nasion (n) (mean, 1. 52 mm), all the measurements had a mean absolute error of less than 1. 5 mm. Conclusions: The three-dimensional surface models derived from cone beam computed tomography images are sufficiently precise and accurate for the anthropometric measurements...|$|E
40|$|Human surrogates {{for safety}} applications, such as crash dummies, are often {{constructed}} {{to represent the}} mean or average of individuals within a population. Generating accurate mean headforms is particularly challenging, even with three-dimensional (3 D) surface measurement technology, because hair limits the ability to accurately represent {{the shape of the}} head. This report presents a new midsizemale headform generated using statistical analysis of head dimensions and landmark data, combined with a reference shape obtained by averaging the head shapes of two men close in size to the target stature and body weight. The locations of 26 head and face landmarks from 1747 men were extracted from the 1988 U. S. Army Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR) and registered using a Procrustes superimposition. A linear regression predicted landmark locations as a function of stature and body mass index, using target values of 1755 mm and 27. 3 kg/m 2. To construct a reference head shape, two bald men whose head and face dimensions were within 2 % of the target mean values were extracted from a large database of head scans. The scans were visually aligned using landmark locations, then resampled cylindrically and averaged. The reference head shape was then morphed to match the target landmark locations using a radial-basisfunction (RBF) morphing method with a multiquadric kernel. A second morphing step was performed to match the desired head length, head breadth, and the distance from the <b>tragion</b> landmarks {{to the top of the}} head. In contrast with headforms obtained solely by averaging individuals close to the desired body size, the current headform is generated from a statistical model that represents a large range of head size and shape, and hence a broad set of statistically consistent headforms can be generated programmatically without additional analysis.
