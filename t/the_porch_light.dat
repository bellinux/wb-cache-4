60|$|In <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>light</b> Una beheld a heavy-shouldered, typical American {{business}} man, in derby hat and clipped mustache, his jowls shining with {{a recent}} shave; an alert, solid man of about forty-five. She remembered {{him as a man}} she had been glad to meet; she felt guiltily that she ought to know him--perhaps he was a Wilkins client, and she was making future difficulty in the office. But place him she could not.|$|E

It said something for her pluck that she had met him as if the interview at Ashness, when Osborn had driven him away, had never taken place. All this was comforting, but Kit was vaguely disturbed on her account.|$|R
50|$|The ranger {{station is}} located on a terrace between the Middle Fork of the Smith River and US 199. The main office is a 1-1/2 story frame {{structure}} completed in 1938, facing U.S. 199. The main roof is end-gabled, with a large cross-gabled front <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> building measures about 37 ft by 41 ft. In plan it originally was two rooms downstairs, with an attic storage room. Pine tree cut-outs are painted green against the white gables, and the stationary shutters feature similar cut-outs. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> <b>lights</b> are designed to resemble fire lookout cabins.

50|$|At 10:35 p.m., Officer Roy McCowan {{received}} a jarring phone call. A girl was screaming hysterically {{on the other}} end, and McCowan heard the words “come quick!” The connection, however, broke off before the girl could identify herself. At that late hour, the test board at the telephone company was not staffed, and the call could not be traced. At about 1:35 a.m., the Romacks returned home to find the front Venetian blinds open and <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>light</b> illuminated.

5000|$|The {{following}} morning around 9 a.m., Kirby {{and her boyfriend}} visited the house after Streeter and McCall {{failed to show up}} at her home; they had planned to spend the day at a water park, and were supposed to leave from Kirby's residence. Upon arriving, Kirby found the front door unlocked and entered the home, but found no sight of Streeter, McCall, or Levitt; each of the women's cars were parked outside. She also reported to police that the glass lamp shade on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>light</b> was shattered, though the lightbulb itself was intact. Kirby's boyfriend innocuously helped her sweep the broken glass off the porch, which police later determined may have destroyed potential evidence. Inside the house, Kirby found Levitt and Streeter's dog, a Yorkshire Terrier named Cinnamon, who appeared agitated; while inside, Kirby also answered a [...] "strange and disturbing call" [...] from an unidentified male who made [...] "sexual innuendos". She hung up and immediately received another call of a sexual nature, again hanging up the phone.|$|E

5000|$|A boy {{claims he}} is sick, {{to stay home}} from school one day after hearing his parents arguing. The father storms out, and the mother puts on her [...] "outfit" [...] and goes to work, leaving the boy reading. He explores his parents' bedroom, and then walks out towards Birch Creek to fish. On the way {{a woman in a}} red car pulls over and offers him a ride. He doesn't say much, and when he gets out, fantasizes about her. At Birch Creek he catches a small fish, and moves down the river, until he sees a young boy on a bike, looking at a huge fish in the water. They try to work {{together}} to catch it, but the young boy swipes at it with a club, and the fish escapes. Further downstream, they find the fish, and the young boy chases it into the boy's grasp. They decide to cut the fish in two to have half each, but then argue about who gets which half. The young boy gets the tail. When the boy arrives home he shows his parents, but his mother is horrified, and his father tells him {{to put it in the}} garbage. The boy holds the half-fish under <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Bellevue became {{incorporated}} in 1953 {{and the police}} department was created by City Ordinance #8 on April 28, 1953.Chief G.L. [...] "Jerry" [...] Plowman was appointed as Chief of Police. By May 1953, staff included four officers (Chief Plowman, Sgt. George Whitman, and Officers Bob Sollitto and Jack Allen), and service was 24 hours per day. The first police headquarters was located at Chief Plowman's house in the Surrey Downs neighborhood, where calls would be taken and <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>light</b> turned on to notify Chief Plowman to stop by for orders. Police headquarters was moved to a rented space in the old V.F.W. hall, and in 1954 an old school at 100th Avenue and Main Street became the new home of the City of Bellevue. During the Department's formative years, surrounding departments, including the King County Police and the Washington State Patrol, helped the new staff at BPD to get started, {{and the city of}} Kirkland rented space in their jail for Bellevue to use in 1954. By 1955, the population of Bellevue was 9,000, and there were 10 Officers working for the Department. In October 1960, the Department moved into new quarters at 106th Avenue NE and NE 8th Street. By 1962, the population of Bellevue was 14,700, with Department personnel numbering 22 sworn officers. In 1963, the Department had its first dispatch center. In 1964, the Department moved to 116th Avenue SE and Main Street, where it remained until 2006. In 1965, the Department created a traffic division, and assigned 5 officers to Traffic enforcement duties. Also in 1965, Bellevue experienced its first homicide. In 1968, Bellevue had 49 sworn officers. That same year the college incentive program was offered. By 1970, the city, through annexation, grew to be the 4th largest city in the state of Washington, and the Department had 92 personnel. In 1971 the Department formed the vice and narcotics detail, as well as the harbor patrol. In 1972, the rank of Sergeant was eliminated with the move to combine the Police and Fire Departments into one department. The potential merger drew intense criticism and was eventually scrapped, but the Sergeant's position was never reinstated, and first line supervisors in the Department remain Lieutenants. In 1973, the department grew to 106 personnel, including 26 civilian personnel. In May of that year, one person was killed and another injured by the [...] "Bellevue sniper." [...] The sniper was apprehended and later convicted for homicide. In June 1975, the Department entered into a new phase of policing called [...] "team policing" [...] in which Officers worked more closely with the community than they had in the past. In order to meet the increased demands in the patrol section, 10 new positions were added in 1981. The city's public safety training center became a reality in 1983. The training facility houses a firing range, exercise facility, classrooms, drill tower, and K-9 area, as well as a large paved parking lot which is used for motorcycle officer training and recertification. The decade between 1975 and 1984 saw many advances and changes with the Department. During those years the crime prevention unit was formed, uniformed officers took a greater role in investigations, the Tactical Arms Group was formed, and the crime analysis unit was formed. 1986 saw the beginning of the Crime Scene Investigator (CSI) role. 7 officers received the initial training, which involved crime scene and evidence processing. CSI officers gather evidence at major crime scenes, resulting in faster and more thorough crime scene processing. In 1990 there were 144 Police Officers in Bellevue. A 1991 survey of Bellevue Residents found that 85.7 percent of respondents reported feeling very safe or moderately safe in their neighborhoods. Also in 1991 there were, {{for the first time in}} nearly two decades, no fatal traffic collisions. The first citizens academy graduated in 1992, and has been an important community outreach program that continues to this day. In 1994 and 1995, the Department went through several changes, including the opening of the Factoria substation, the initiation of a summer park patrol program, and the receipt of a Federal grant which added 4 officers to the Department. In September 1997 the Department began the School Resource Officer (SRO) program, placing Officers in each of Bellevue's 4 high schools. In 1998 the traffic division was moved under the umbrella of the patrol section, and the Department also formed its honor guard that year. The Department moved into the new Bellevue City Hall located at 450 110th Avenue NE in April 2006.|$|E

50|$|The chapel is a {{single-storey}} {{building of}} red-brown brick {{laid in the}} English bond pattern. The brickwork is still visible on the attached cottage, but the chapel has been rendered with stucco. The cottage has two storeys but is the same height as the chapel; they share a roof, which is laid with tiles. The façade consists of four bays of which the leftmost is formed by the cottage. A gabled porch is placed centrally, {{and there is a}} chimneystack halfway along the roof and another {{on the end of the}} cottage. The divide between the cottage and the chapel is marked by quoins, and a cornice runs across the façade below the roofline. The chapel has three arched windows: the two to the right of <b>the</b> entrance <b>porch</b> are full-height, but the other (between the cottage and <b>the</b> <b>porch)</b> <b>lights</b> only <b>the</b> upper section of the chapel. There is a door below it which may have replaced the lower section.

She re-opened the window to see into the courtyard, and heard a voice that sounded [...] "angry, very agitated" [...] but that she could not hear words. She shut off her lights to reduce glare and see better, and saw two men on the ground one on top of the other. She heard a cry for help, that she thinks was made by [...] "the boy", and then heard [...] "pop, pop, pop". She saw one of the men get up, and hold his head while the other stayed on the ground face down. Surdyka's 911 call was then played.On cross-examination, the defense asked about the cries for help that she heard, and she confirmed she heard only two cries; one for help, and then a [...] "yelp" [...] just before the gunshot. West asked her if she had heard the other 911 calls and cries for help previously. West asked her if [...] "the loud voice could have been someone on a cell phone in the wind", and she replied [...] "I guess". She clarified that there was five to ten minutes between the initial [...] "loud voice" [...] and the later argument and fight; she assumed they were the same voice. She said that during the argument, the [...] "loud" [...] voice initiated, and a [...] "meek" [...] voice replying. She commented that when <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>lights</b> are off, it is [...] "pitch black" [...] in the yard, but that she could see well enough to see that the person on top was wearing a dark or black shirt or jacket. West asked her to reconcile Martin's chest wound, with her testimony that Zimmerman stood up from on top, with Martin underneath him, face down. West pressed her to admit that she assumed which voice was which, but she replied that she felt the aggressive voice was [...] "a man's", and that the other voice was higher pitched and she felt that it was [...] "a boy's".|$|R

25|$|Trick-or-treating {{typically}} happens between 5:30pm and 9:30pm on October 31, {{although some}} municipalities choose other dates.

40|$|The Dominican Monastery was {{a closed}} system: it en- gaged {{the world by}} taking a distance. We are now asked to turn the – by {{definition}} isolated – monastery into an accessible, multifunctional meeting place aimed at innovation and production of knowledge. The walled, closed architecture of the complex needs to become transparent, open. We propose to open the Dominican Monastery to the city by literally showing its interior to the outside: a new ur- ban passage connects the {{different parts of the}} complex, linking the entrance on the Ploegstraat to the entrance on the Provinciestraat and creating a public street servicing all the functions of the community centre. The inside of the plot is politely revealed and made public by the appearance of the passage. The passage is built in a very classical fashion, with light structure and glazed roof. The passage snakes through the plot generating a sequence of greenhouses and gar- dens that follow the existing layout of the monastery and are populated by a multitude of plants, flowers and fruit, creating a pleasant and unexpectedly exotic environment with sunlight filtering from the roof. The two new entrances disclose the newly accessible interior of the monastery. Along the Provinciestraat, the façade of the old church is removed and substituted with a new <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> is <b>the</b> prosecution of the passage. It introduces/ concludes the sequence of the greenhouses wrapping the church in an envelope of glass and vegetation. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> allows <b>the</b> inside of the church to appear on the street and invades the space with abundance of <b>light.</b> <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> is a <b>light</b> structure, hosting a variety of plants growing from hanging pots. From the outside, the neo-gothic interior of the church appears through a new light screen populated by a multitude of plants...|$|R
