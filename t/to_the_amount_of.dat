This ratio is approximately proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> gold medals won by the respective nations at the Olympics. East Germany was particularly successful in the 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored doping.|$|E

5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Barbara McLaren engaged Lutyens {{to design}} a {{memorial}} for the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which Spalding Urban District Council had purchased in 1897 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Lutyens proposed a U-shaped cloister sheltering a Stone of Remembrance {{standing in front of}} a circular lily pool, in the centre of which would be a cross. McLaren hoped to include space for the families of those commemorated to add their own epitaphs but this proved impractical due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> space that would have been required; she insisted that her husband not receive any special commemoration beyond that afforded to the other casualties.|$|E

Protoceratopsidae {{is considered to be}} the sister group of Ceratopsoidea. The fragmentary Asiaceratops was included in these studies and is found to have a variable position, either as a basal neoceratopsian or as a leptoceratopsid, most likely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> missing information.

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2011, there were two {{accidents}} (one serious) caused by what {{is believed to be}} loose objects hitting riders while riding the roller coaster. The most serious accident was when a man got struck with an object and had to get his eye removed due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> damage. On the same day that the man got hit, Universal Studios announced that the coasters would not duel until an investigation was completed. For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid-October 2011, Universal made the decision to remove the dueling aspect of the ride permanently without any explanation to what caused the injuries. No injuries have been reported since.|$|E
5|$|Flashback is {{the fifth}} studio album by Puerto Rican reggaetón {{recording}} artist Ivy Queen, released on October 4, 2005 through Univision and on September 15, 2007 as Greatest Hits in Germany and Spain.

Queen began working on Flashback after the moderate success of Real in early 2005. Featuring content dating back to 1995, {{when she was still}} a part of the all-male group The Noise, the album includes four new pieces of work all produced by Rafi Mercenario, the genre's most requested record producer at the time.|$|E
5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance of counsel of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected. Irrespective of any conflict of interest, the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness. To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> prejudice arising from its denial.|$|E

Both extremely arid and arid lands {{are considered to be}} deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{researchers}} from six different orangutan field sites {{who used the}} same behavioural coding scheme compared the behaviours of the animals from the different sites.

As {{a result of the}} accident, in 1991 the United States Coast Guard suspended his masters' license for a period of nine months. Hazelwood was acquitted on all felony charges, but was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil, fined $50,000, and sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service.|$|E

In 1863, Stevens aided the passage of the National Banking Act, that required that banks limit their currency issues <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> federal bonds that they were required to hold.

Approximately 70% of the island, including most of the tourist areas, is located inside gated communities.
