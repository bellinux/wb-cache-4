50|$|In Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, cantarella is {{extensively}} used.

50|$|Repositioning the earlobe is {{the most}} {{difficult}} part of the otoplasty, because when a pinna (external ear) that has been repositioned in its upper two-thirds, and that yet retains a prominent lobule (earlobe) will appear disproportionate to and malpositioned upon the head — as it did in the original, uncorrected deformity. The otoplastic technique most effective for lobular repositioning is the Gosain technique (or a variant), wherein the surgeon cuts the skin on the medial surface of the earlobe, and, in suturing it closed, <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>of</b> the conchal undersurface to pull the earlobe towards the head.|$|R

60|$|And {{right here}} Baseek erred. Had he {{contented}} himself with looking fierce and ominous, all {{would have been}} well.

As he bent his head carelessly to smell it, White Fang bristled slightly. Even then it was not too late for Baseek to retrieve the situation.
