Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the individual Nazis, {{many of whom were}} overweight. Speer surrounded the site with 130 anti-aircraft searchlights. Speer described this as his most beautiful work, and as the only one that stood <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} English players and {{commentators}} noted Bradman's discomfort in playing the short, rising delivery. The revelation {{came too late}} for this particular match, but was to have immense significance in the next Ashes series. Australia won the match by an innings and regained the Ashes. The victory made an impact in Australia. With the economy sliding toward depression and unemployment rapidly rising, the country found solace in sporting triumph. The story of a self-taught 22-year-old from the bush who set a series of records against the old rival made Bradman a national hero. The statistics Bradman achieved on the tour, and in the Test matches in particular, broke records {{for the day and}} some have stood <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> In all, Bradman scored 974runs at an average of 139.14 during the Test series, with four centuries, including two double hundreds and a triple. As of 2012, no-one has matched or exceeded 974runs or three double centuries in one Test series; the record of 974runs exceeds the second-best performance by 69runs and was achieved in two fewer innings. Bradman's first-class tally, 2,960runs (at an average of 98.66 with 10centuries), was another enduring record: the most by any overseas batsman on a tour of England.|$|E

Many advanced database application domains such as spatial databases, multimedia databases, temporal databases, and object-oriented databases, call for index structures that are specially designed and tailored for the domains. Interestingly, {{in each of these}} domains, we find methods that are based on one distinct structure - the B-tree. Invented some thirty years ago, the B-tree has been challenged repeatedly, but has retained its competitiveness. In this paper, we first give a quick review of B-trees. We then present its adaptations to various domains. For each domain, we present representative B-tree-based structures and their search operations. We conclude that the B-tree is truly an ubiquitous structure that has stood <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> with wide acceptance in many domains...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address <b>the</b> <b>test</b> {{scheduling}} problem for Builtin Self-tested (BISTed) embedded SRAMs (e-SRAMs) when Data Retention Faults (DRFs) are considered. <b>The</b> proposed <b>test</b> scheduling algorithm utilizes <b>the</b> ”retention-aware ” <b>test</b> power model [1] to minimize <b>the</b> total <b>testing</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> e-SRAMs while not violating given power constraints. Without losing generality, we consider both cases where the pause time for data retention faults is fixed and cases {{where it can be}} varied.

50|$|Following the {{disastrous}} 1913 flood in the Great Miami River Valley, residents {{realized that the}} only way to prevent future flooding was to deal with protection on a watershed basis. Citizens from all the major cities in the valley, Piqua, Troy, Dayton, Carlisle, Franklin, Miamisburg, Middletown, and Hamilton, gathered together to find a solution. They worked with legislative representatives to draft enabling legislation to create the Miami Conservancy District. It was passed by the state and signed into law by Governor James Cox. Although challenged several times in the courts, the laws withstood those attacks. The law and District have also withstood <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> By 1915, <b>the</b> District hired an engineering staff, which developed plans for valley-long channel improvements, levees, and storage basins to temporarily retain excessive rains. The system was designed to withstand rains and flows that would be up to 40% greater than those of 1913. Waters have been retained more than 1,000 times, thereby preventing flooding. Construction began in 1915 and was completed in 1923.|$|R
40|$|The work {{is focused}} on {{studying}} of a single silver adatom hopping inside a half unit cell of Si(111) - 7 × 7 reconstruction. It is possible to estimate activation energies and frequency prefactors for hops between particular adsorption sites. It was necessary to make fundamental modifications on a low temperature STM {{as a part of}} the work. The modificaations have been made on top of a sample cooling system and on inertial motor for coarse approach of the sample to a tip. The vacuum properties of the STM chamber have been improved. A considerable progress in technology of electrochemically etched tungsten tip preparation has been achieved. Further treatement of the tips has been studied with accent on field emission effect on the tip apex. The 7 × 7 reconstruction could not be prepared inside the vacuum chamber. Reason is probably a poor degassing of the sample. Further planned experiments could not be performed so far.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{relationship between}} time deformation and generalised {{autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity}} (GARCH) is examined. Despite time deformation and GARCH being mean and variance equation phenomena respectively, they are argued herein to share a common motivation relating to the examination {{of changes in the}} temporal evolution <b>of</b> <b>time</b> series processes.

It is found that the presence of GARCH can result in the spurious detection <b>of</b> <b>time</b> deformation, particularly when examining the heavy-tailed distributions and volatile data typically considered in empirical finance. It is shown that although the application of heteroskedasticity corrected covariance matrix estimators often increases, rather than corrects, the detected oversizing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> deformation, <b>the</b> application of GARCH filters does provide a solution to size distortion.
