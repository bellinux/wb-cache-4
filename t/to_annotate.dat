25|$|When a {{programming}} language evolves a more elaborate type system, it gains a more finely grained rule set than basic type checking, but this {{comes at a price}} when the type inferences (and other properties) become undecidable, and when more attention must be paid by the programmer <b>to</b> <b>annotate</b> code or to consider computer-related operations and functioning. It is challenging to find a sufficiently expressive type system that satisfies all programming practices in a type safe manner.|$|E

25|$|Jinkins {{developed}} Doug from {{drawings in}} his sketchbook that he created {{over the course}} of the 1980s. Doug, a mostly autobiographical creation, was largely inspired by Jinkins's childhood growing up in Virginia, with most characters in the series being based on real individuals. He first pitched Doug as a children's book to uninterested publishers before Nickelodeon purchased the show. Following this, the series underwent further development, in which Jinkins meticulously detailed every aspect of the show's setting. Jinkins was insistent that the series have a purpose, and instructed writers <b>to</b> <b>annotate</b> each script with a moral. The show's unusual soundtrack consists largely of mouth noises.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Overall’s {{group would}} go on <b>to</b> <b>annotate</b> the {{complete}} human and mouse protease-inhibitor degradomes in 2003. As the complexity of proteolytic networks was uncovered, more thorough descriptions of the degradome and ways to study it became necessary. In 2007, Dr. Overall updated the field with a review co-authored by Dr. Carl Blobel detailing how advanced methods were revolutionizing protease-substrate discovery. They described the process of linking proteases to their substrates on a step by step process, beginning with biochemical and proteomic discovery, validation using cellular based assays, and progressing to whole organism levels using animal models. More recently, as technology and techniques have advanced, the Overall Lab and others have continued to direct the field using more powerful and quantitative techniques.|$|E
25|$|A good map has to {{compromise}} between portraying the items of interest (or themes) {{in the right}} place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a slightly incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space on the ground. A good example from the late 1980s was the Ordnance Survey's first digital maps, where the absolute positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of metres away from ground truth, when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need <b>to</b> <b>annotate</b> the features.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Annotating {{datasets}} with metadata is {{an important}} part of organizing and curating data. However, it is a time consuming process and often not done in a rigorous fashion. In this paper, we propose a new approach <b>to</b> <b>annotating</b> datasets through the use of reconstructed provenance. A detailed survey of the related work in this area is given. Additionally, we provide an overview of our approach for both reconstructing provenance and using that provenance <b>to</b> automatically <b>annotate</b> datasets with metadata. This approach leverages existing work in AI planning and change detection algorithms...|$|R

25|$|Adobe Acrobat is {{one example}} of {{proprietary}} software that allows the user <b>to</b> <b>annotate,</b> highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as free software (under the GNU General Public License) is PDFedit. Another GPL-licensed application native to the unix environment is Xournal. Xournal allows for annotating in different fonts and colours, as well as a rule for quickly underlining and highlighting lines of text or paragraphs. Xournal also has a shape recognition tool for squares, rectangles and circles. In Xournal annotations may be moved, copied and pasted. The freeware Foxit Reader, available for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux, allows annotating documents. Tracker Software's PDF-XChange Viewer allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. Apple's macOS's integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations as does the freeware Skim, with the latter supporting interaction with LaTeX, SyncTeX, and PDFSync and integration with BibDesk reference management software. Freeware Qiqqa can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs.|$|E

500|$|With {{the advent}} of fast and {{inexpensive}} sequencing instruments, the growth of databases of DNA sequences is now exponential (e.g., the NCBI GenBank database [...] ). Faster and efficient tools are needed {{to keep pace with}} the high-throughput sequencing, because the BLAST-based approaches such as MG-RAST or MEGAN run slowly <b>to</b> <b>annotate</b> large samples (e.g., several hours to process a small/medium size dataset/sample [...] ). Thus, ultra-fast classifiers have recently emerged, thanks to more affordable powerful servers. These tools can perform the taxonomic annotation at extremely high speed, for example CLARK [...] (according to CLARK's authors, it can classify accurately [...] "32 million metagenomic short reads per minute"). At such a speed, a very large dataset/sample of a billion short reads can be processed in about 30 minutes.|$|E
