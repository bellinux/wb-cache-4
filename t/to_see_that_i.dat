"It's {{very close}} to home [...] I OK'd it with my family and {{everything}} because they think it's important, because we're obviously very different now than we were when we were younger. And it's {{important for people to}} see that raw kind of emotion that happens in life. It sucks sometimes, so it's important <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think. And that's what we're portraying in the video." ...|$|E

I will look in your eyes and tell you that I'm not dumb enough or moronic enough to think that you are dumb or moronic enough not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would have stolen a melody. If you put the songs next to each other, side by side, the only {{similarities}} are the chord progression. It's the same one that has been in disco music for the last 50 years. Just because I'm the first fucking artist in 25 years to think of putting it on Top 40 radio, it doesn't mean I'm a plagiarist, it means I'm fucking smart. Sorry." ...|$|E
500|$|Astronomer Carl Sagan {{wrote in}} his book The Cosmic Connection that Clarke and Kubrick asked his opinion on how to best depict {{extraterrestrial}} intelligence. Sagan, while acknowledging Kubrick's desire to use actors to portray humanoid aliens for convenience's sake, argued that alien life forms were unlikely to bear any resemblance to terrestrial life, and that {{to do so would}} introduce [...] "at least an element of falseness" [...] to the film. Sagan proposed that the film suggest, rather than depict, extraterrestrial superintelligence. He attended the premiere and was [...] "pleased <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been of some help." [...] Kubrick hinted at the nature of the mysterious unseen alien race in 2001 by suggesting, in a 1968 interview, that given millions of years of evolution, they progressed from biological beings to [...] "immortal machine entities", and then into [...] "beings of pure energy and spirit"; beings with [...] "limitless capabilities and ungraspable intelligence".|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 2006, Villa {{had become}} an {{integral}} part of Luis Aragonés' plans and ousted Raúl from the team. Proving vital in Spain's qualification for Euro 2008, he scored six goals, including a bicycle kick against Liechtenstein. He was subsequently called up for the tournament where he formed a striking relationship with Torres, with whom he would often celebrate his goals. He scored a hat-trick in Spain's 4–1 win over Russia, making him the first player to do so at a UEFA European Championship since Patrick Kluivert in 2000, and only the seventh overall. After the third goal, he went out of his way to meet Torres, who was on the bench at the time, to celebrate with him: [...] "I had just scored a hat-trick and I knew people would be talking about me, but I wanted them <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had benefited from Torres's work, just as he sometimes benefits from mine." [...] In the next match, he secured a 2–1 win against Sweden with a goal in the 92nd minute. Rested for the next match against Greece, he started once again in the quarter-finals, where Spain beat Italy 4–2 on penalties; Villa took the first penalty and scored.|$|E

He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his proofs <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> {{realized that}} my own way was in impoverishment, in lack of knowledge and in taking away, in subtracting rather than in adding." ...|$|E
2500|$|I have {{convinced}} myself {{that there is}} nothing in the world — no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Doesn't it follow that I don't exist? No, surely I must exist if it's me who is convinced of something. [...] But there is a deceiver, supremely powerful and cunning whose aim is <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am always deceived. But surely I exist, if I am deceived. Let him deceive me all he can, he will never make it the case that I am nothing while I think that I am something. Thus having fully weighed every consideration, I must finally conclude that the statement [...] "I am, I exist" [...] must be true whenever I state it or mentally consider it.

2500|$|On 20 April 2010, Ochoa {{released}} a statement indicating her intent to retire from professional golf. [...] At a press conference held in Mexico City on 23 April 2010, Ochoa said her last tournament would be the 2010 Tres Marias Championship to be played from 29 April through 2 May. She said that her career plan had always been to play for [...] "around ten years" [...] and to be the number 1 ranked player in the world. She also said: [...] "I {{just want to be}} honest with all of you. I went to Asia, and after two or three days of being in Thailand, it was really easy to me – it was really clear <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to be out there, you know. I just was thinking of other things. I wanted to get home. I wanted to start working on the foundation. I wanted to be here close to my family." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E
