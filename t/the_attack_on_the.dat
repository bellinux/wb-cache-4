5|$|Back in Lisbon, the 'Armed Revolutionary Action' {{branch of}} the Portuguese Communist Party, which {{was created in the}} late 1960s, and the Revolutionary Brigades (BR), a left-wing organisation, worked to resist the colonial wars. They had carried out {{multiple}} sabotages and bombings against military targets, such as <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NATO headquarters at Oeiras in October of the same year. <b>The</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese ship Niassa illustrated the role of the colonial wars in this unrest. Niassa (named after a Mozambican province) was preparing to leave Lisbon with troops to be deployed in Guinea. By the time of the Carnation Revolution, 100,000 draft dodgers had been recorded.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Johnson {{was one of}} {{the first}} four flying {{officers}} of the Eighth Air Force, and served on it staff during its formative period at Savannah, Georgia. In 1943, he assumed command of the 44th Bombardment Group, which flew the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. Johnson led <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> German naval installations at Kiel in May 1943 and <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ploesti oil fields in August 1943, for which the 44th Bombardment Group received Distinguished Unit Citations. He commanded the 14th Combat Bombardment Wing from September 1943 until May 1945.|$|E
5|$|He was wrong; the Austrians {{engaged with}} the French advance guard {{numbered}} closer to 50,000, and constituted {{the main body}} of Charles' army, not its advance guard.

5|$|In July 1918 Vasey was {{assigned}} to 3rd Division Headquarters as a staff officer (GSO3) but this appointment was brief; his successor at the 11th Infantry Brigade was wounded and Vasey returned to his former post. As such, he participated in the defence of Amiens, the Battle of Amiens in August 1918 and <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hindenburg Line in September. He was also twice Mentioned in Despatches. He served for a time as GSO2 of the 3rd Division before embarking for Australia on 14 September 1919.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, {{families}} of American {{victims of the}} attacks filed a lawsuit in Brooklyn, New York, naming Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, chief of the I.S.I., as being complicit in the Mumbai attacks. On 22 September 2011, <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> American Embassy in Afghanistan, was attributed to Pakistan via cell phone records identical to the attacks in Mumbai, also linked to Pakistan. The investigation is on-going.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{publicize}} the N-3PB operations, the British Air Ministry circulated a report that two Norwegian-flown aircraft {{had been involved in}} <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> German battleship Bismarck on 21–22 May 1941, but it was merely an example of wartime propaganda. Despite many aviation historians disputing the claim, it still appears in current accounts of the sinking of the Bismarck.|$|E

5|$|Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1) was {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ursel and Maldegem airfields. Oberstleutnant Herbert Ihlefeld led the Geschwader. The formation was mixed; Stab., (headquarters flight or Stabschwarm, attached to every Geschwader), I. and II./JG 1 operated the Fw 190 while the III./JG 1 flew the Bf 109. I./JG 1 lost four of their number to friendly anti-aircraft fire. Three of the four pilots were killed.|$|E
5|$|Just {{one week}} after the MEF had taken over Anbar, insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a convoy {{carrying}} four American mercenaries from Blackwater USA on 31 March, killing all of them. An angry mob then set the mercenaries' bodies ablaze and dragged their corpses through the streets before hanging them over a bridge crossing the Euphrates. The American media compared <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mercenaries to the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, where images of American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Somalia prompted the United States to withdraw its troops.|$|E
5|$|Krasin helped {{manufacture}} bombs {{to use in}} <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stagecoach. Kamo's gang smuggled bombs into Tiflis {{by hiding}} them inside a sofa. Only weeks before the robbery, Kamo accidentally detonated one of Krasin's bombs while trying to set the fuse. The blast severely injured him in the eye, leaving a permanent scar. Kamo was confined to his bed for a month owing to intense pain, and had not fully recovered {{by the time of}} the robbery.|$|E

5|$|New Mexico {{was part}} of the Marshall Islands {{invasion}} force on 12 January 1944. She shelled Kwajalein and Ebeye from 31 January to 1 February. Replenishing at Majuro, on 20 February the ship shelled Wotje, and then the following month also shelled New Ireland and Kavieng. After that, she sailed to the Solomon Islands to practice <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mariana Islands, stopping at Sydney, in Australia, on the way.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of May 9, Benedict Arnold quite unexpectedly arrived on the scene. Flourishing a commission from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, he asserted his right to command the expedition. The assembled men refused to acknowledge his authority, insisting they would only follow Allen's lead. In a private discussion, Allen and Arnold reached an accommodation, the essence of which was that Arnold and Allen would both be {{at the front of}} the troops when <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fort was made.|$|E
5|$|Sandor Clegane tracks {{down some}} of the Brotherhood Without Banners men and brutally kills them, searching for their leader.

Sandor bargains with Beric, who allows him to personally hang two of the men. Beric and Thoros try to recruit Sandor into the Brotherhood, explaining that they intend to head north to fight the White Walkers and need his strength.|$|E

5|$|The 19th-century Louisiana {{historian}} Charles Gayarré also embellished {{the story}} of a conspiracy behind the Natchez revolt, composing in his book a lengthy speech by the Great Sun in which the leader exhorted his warriors to invite the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Yazoo to join in <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> French. In his 2008 book on the Natchez revolt, Arnaud Balvay wrote that more likely than not, the conspiracy claim was false because of incoherence in primary sources.|$|E
5|$|The 44th Bombardment Group {{took part}} in an even more costly raid, <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Romanian Ploesti oil fields, on 1 August 1943. When Johnson arrived at the target leading his group, {{he found that the}} 93d Bombardment Group had already {{attacked}} their target by mistake, and as a consequence, the defenders were alert. Although he would have been justified in turning back, Johnson led his group in through thick smoke, flak and explosions that concealed the tall smokestacks and barrage balloon cables. On the way home, they had to fight off Me109 fighters.|$|E
5|$|The French {{authorities}} imprisoned Long {{and many}} of his supporters, who openly admitted their aim of overthrowing French authorities at the trial. During the 1916 Cochinchina uprisings against French rule, many of Long's supporters attempted to break him out of jail. The French easily repelled <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> jail, decimating Long's movement. Following the attempted breakout, Long and his key supporters were put to death. Many of the remnants of his support base went on to join what later became the Cao Đài, a major religious sect in Vietnam.|$|E
