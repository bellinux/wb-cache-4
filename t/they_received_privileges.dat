At Milan, they materially advanced {{the interests of the}} city by their industry and commerce. At Bologna, Pisa, Naples and numerous other Italian cities, they freely exercised the Jewish religion again. They were soon so numerous that Fernando de Goes Loureiro, an abbot from Oporto, filled an entire book with the names of conversos who had drawn large sums from Portugal and had openly avowed Judaism in Italy.|$|E
50|$|The {{territory}} of present-day Slovakia was rich in raw materials like gold, silver, copper, iron {{and salt and}} therefore the mining industry developed gradually in the region. The development of the mining industry and commerce enstrengthened the position of some settlements and <b>they</b> <b>received</b> <b>privileges</b> from the kings. The list of towns with the earliest charters contains Spišské Vlachy (1243), Košice (before 1248), Nitra (1248), Banská Štiavnica (1255), Nemecká Ľupča (1263), Komárno (1269), Gelnica (before 1270), Bratislava (1291) and Prešov, Veľký Šariš and Sabinov (all in 1299). The Saxons in Spiš (Zips) were granted a collective charter (1271) by King Stephen V of Hungary.|$|E

They served as camp guards (Lagerpolizei), barracks clerks (Blockschreiber), and the senior prisoners (ältesten - [...] "elders") at the camp (lagerältester), barracks (blockältester) and room (stübenältester) levels of camp organization. <b>They</b> <b>received</b> <b>privileges</b> like bigger (and sometimes better) food rations, better quarters (or even a private room), luxuries (like tobacco or alcohol), {{and access to the}} camp's facilities (like the showers or the pool). Failure to please their captors meant demotion and loss of privileges - and an almost certain death at the hands of their fellow inmates.|$|E

50|$|The ten-lanced nobles (tízlándzsások), also Szepes lancers or Spiš lancers, were {{group of}} {{conditional}} noblemen {{living in the}} Szepes region of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Spiš in Slovakia). <b>They</b> <b>received</b> their <b>privileges</b> from King Béla IV of Hungary in 1243. They were obliged to equip ten knights or lancers. Initially, they formed about 40 families, but their number decreased to less than 20 families by the 16th century. They lost their special status in 1804.|$|R
50|$|In Poland, {{they were}} notably {{active in the}} Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Miechów, which <b>received</b> many <b>privileges</b> from Casimir of Bytom, and Casimir II the Just after many Canons came to settle their after their {{expulsion}} from the Holy Land. After the ultimate fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to the Muslims in 1291, the Superior of the convent at Miechów took the title of General of the order, later claiming the style of Grand Prior, and Miechów became {{the headquarters of the}} organisation for centuries. Here, the order initiated the custom of setting up, decorating, and visiting Christ’s graves on {{the last days of the}} Passion Week. It was in Miechów that the oldest replica of the Holy Sepulchre in Europe, the goal of numerous pilgrims, has been preserved. In Poland, <b>they</b> also <b>receives</b> <b>privileges</b> from Przemysł II.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} side of the {{argument}} are those who contend that no surplus value was generated from labour activity or from commodity markets in the socialist planned economies and therefore claim that there was no exploiting class, even if inequalities existed. Since prices were controlled and set below market clearing levels there was no element of ‘value added’ at the point of sale as occurs in capitalist market economies. Prices were built up from the average cost of inputs, including wages, taxes, interest on stocks and working capital, and allowances to cover the recoupment of investment and for depreciation, so there was no ‘profit margin’ in the price charged to customers. Wages did not reflect the purchase price of labour since labour was not a commodity traded in a market and the employing organizations did not own the means of production. Wages were set at a level that permitted a decent standard of living and rewarded specialist skills and educational qualifications. In macroeconomic terms, the plan allocated the whole national product to workers in the form of wages for the workers’ own use, with a fraction withheld for investment and imports from abroad. The difference between the average value of wages and the value of national output per worker did not imply the existence of surplus value since it was part of a consciously formulated plan for the development of society. Furthermore, the presence of inequality in the socialist planned economies did not imply that an exploiting class existed. In the USSR communist party members were able to buy scarce goods in special shops and the leadership elite took advantage of state property to live in more spacious accommodation and sometimes luxury. Although <b>they</b> <b>received</b> <b>privileges</b> not commonly available and thus some additional income in kind there was no difference in their official remuneration in comparison to their non-party peers. Enterprise managers and workers received only the wages and bonuses related to the production targets that had been set by the planning authorities. Outside of the cooperative sector, which enjoyed greater economic freedoms and whose profits were shared among all members of the cooperative, there was no profit-taking class.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{all of the}} {{repression}} and ham-fisted Stalinist tactics, North Korea had nonetheless made impressive economic progress in {{a short amount of}} time in contrast to South Korea which remained a stagnant, impoverished Third World nation completely reliant on US economic aid. Pyongyang scored a further propaganda victory in 1959 when several thousand resident Koreans in Japan agreed to return home, and nearly all of them made their home in the North rather than South Korea. Many of these Koreans were educated and possessed useful scientific or technical skills, and their arrival in North Korea was welcomed. Although <b>they</b> <b>received</b> extensive <b>privileges</b> at first, some eventually ended up in labor camps out of suspicion for their being exposed to foreign ideas.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of cues signaling reward, threat or danger {{would suggest that}} <b>they</b> <b>receive</b> processing <b>privileges</b> in the neural systems underlying perception and attention. Previous research has documented enhanced processing of motivationally salient cues, and has pointed to the amygdala as a candidate neutral structure underlying the enhancements. In the current study, we examined whether the amygdala was necessary for this emotional modulation of attention to occur. Patients with unilateral amygdala lesions and matched controls completed an emotional attentional blink task in which emotional distractors impair the perception of subsequent targets. Emotional images proved more distracting across all participant groups, including those with right or left amygdala lesions. These data argue against a central role for the amygdala in mediating all types of attentional capture by emotional stimuli...|$|R
2500|$|In addition, Britain {{experienced}} increased hostilities with Spain, which {{added to}} the anti-Catholic and anti-Spanish feelings by the authorities. In 1691 the British Crown ordered all New York officials to swear oaths under the Test Act. These oaths consisted {{of a series of}} declarations against the authority of the Catholic Church and its religious practices. All potential officeholders were obliged to swear that <b>they</b> had not <b>received</b> <b>privilege</b> from the Pope. As tensions between England and Spain escalated, the Test Act was determined to be too lenient for Catholics. By 1700 the New York anti-priest law utterly outlawed the presence of Catholic priests under penalty of life imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|St. Casimir, son of King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir IV, was canonized in 1602. In {{conjunction}} with his feast day celebrations, merchants established a fair. In 1827, <b>they</b> <b>received</b> a <b>privilege</b> {{to hold the}} fair in the Cathedral Square. In 1901, after a monument to Catherine the Great was unveiled in the Cathedral Square, the fair was moved to Lukiškės Square. During the Soviet era, the fair was held in Kalvarijos Market. In 1991, it returned to the Old Town of Vilnius. It was first held in Pilies Street but has since grown to span Gediminas Avenue, traverse the Cathedral Square, and branch out into Pilies Street, B. Radvilaitės Street, passing St. Anne's Church, and the Orthodox Cathedral of the Theotokos, and into the Tymas' Quarter on the left bank of Vilnia River near Užupis. It is estimated that as of 2013, the fair attracted 2,000 merchants and half a million visitors over three days (Friday to Sunday).|$|R
50|$|As Germans began {{establishing}} towns throughout northern Europe {{as early}} as the 10th century, <b>they</b> often <b>received</b> town <b>privileges</b> granting them autonomy from local secular or religious rulers. Such privileges often included the right to self-governance, economic autonomy, criminal courts, and militia. Town laws were more or less entirely copied from neighboring towns, such as the Westphalian towns of Soest, Dortmund, Minden, and Münster. As Germans began settling eastward, the colonists modelled their town laws on the pre-existing 12th century laws of Cologne in the west, Lübeck in the north (Lübeck law), Magdeburg in the east (Magdeburg rights), and either Nuremberg or Vienna in the south.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, the German {{settlements}} of the Hernád (present-day Hornád) and Poprád (present-day Poprad) basins created a special political territory {{with its own}} administration. <b>They</b> <b>received</b> collective <b>privileges</b> from King Stephen V in 1271, which were confirmed and extended by King Charles I in 1317, because the Szepesian Germans had helped him to defeat the oligarchs of the Kingdom of Hungary in the battle at Rozgony (present-day Rozhanovce) in 1312. The territory was granted self-government privileges {{similar to those of}} the royal free towns. In 1317, the special territory included 43 settlements, including Lőcse (present-day Levoča) and Késmárk (present-day Kežmarok), which however withdrew before 1344. From 1370 the 41 settlements of the territory subscribed to a uniform special Szepes law system (called Zipser Willkür in German). Initially, the special territory was called [...] "Communitas (or Provincia) Saxonum de Scepus". By the mid-14th century, the territory was reduced to 24 settlements and later the name was changed to Provincia XXIV oppidorum terrae Scepusiensis in Latin (Bund der 24 Zipser Städte in German [...] ). The province was led by the Count (Graf) of Szepes elected by the town judges of the 24 towns.|$|R
