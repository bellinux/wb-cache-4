5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|The Great Fire {{started at}} the bakery (or baker's house) of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor) on Pudding Lane shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September and spread rapidly west across the City of London. The major {{firefighting}} technique of the time was to create firebreaks by means of demolition; this, however, was critically delayed owing to the indecisiveness of Lord Mayor of London Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time that large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> already fanned the bakery fire into a firestorm that defeated such measures. The fire pushed north on Monday {{into the heart of}} the City.|$|E

25|$|Allied {{aircraft}} {{had already}} reported {{the position of}} the German ships about 1300. About the same time a lone German Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor sighted and attacked both cruisers only to be repelled by anti-aircraft gunfire. The German aircrew immediately turned north-east, reporting {{the position of the}} British cruisers more than half an hour later to Erdmenger. Captain Charles Clark on HMS Glasgow, assuming that he had been reported then also turned north-east, working around Erdmenger's position to intercept. The sea was becoming rougher and <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> increased to 30 knots, making sailing difficult for the destroyers and torpedo boats.|$|E
25|$|The English ships {{except in}} the rigging and masts had {{sustained}} only little damage, since the Spanish aim was to board and overpower. None of this was achieved as the English fire or the rough sea, depending on sources, had been strong enough not to allow the Spanish galleys into grappling position. The English casualties were only light at best but soon <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> died down and therefore were becalmed just before Gibraltar itself. They were {{in desperate need of}} shot and powder as most of the bigger ships were close to being out of ammunition {{by the end of the}} action.|$|E

The fourth weapon {{could not be found}} despite an intensive search of the area—the only part that was recovered was the parachute tail plate, leading searchers to postulate that the weapon's parachute had deployed, and that <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> carried it out to sea.|$|E

25|$|During April 1881, {{under the}} command of John William Nicholson, the Advance got away from a near miss when leaving the Grey River at Greymouth under tow of the steam tug Dispatch. The tow ropes were lost and the vessel drifted into the breakwater, moving too fast for the anchor to have held her. The sails were raised, but <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> died away, and the crew lost control of the vessel. The Dispatch, however, managed to take the Advance in tow once again and left her on the flat {{opposite}} the town. Three feet of water had washed aboard, but no major damage was sustained.|$|E
25|$|On 25 October, Hawkins sighted two strange vessels {{some five}} or six leagues off Pointe du Raz. Dispatch {{captured}} both, which {{proved to be the}} French gun-vessels No. 345 and No. 353. Each was armed with two brass guns, one a 32-pounder and the other a 6-pounder. Each had a crew of 20 soldiers. They had left Brest for Odierne (or Dandiorne) but <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> blown them out to sea. Conquest arrived on the scene and then the British sighted two more gun-vessels. Dispatch captured one, No. 371, armed like the two already captured, but with a crew of 22. Hawkins thought it too dangerous to try to send the three gun-vessels to England so he sank them after having removed the guns.|$|E
25|$|On September 1, 1905, Sevona left Allouez, Wisconsin, {{bound for}} Erie, Pennsylvania, with a cargo of iron ore and {{a crew of}} twenty men and four women. Later that night, an {{unexpected}} storm hit the area. By midnight, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> reached gale-force strength. At around 6:00 a.m. on September 2, Sevona ran aground on a shoal and broke in half. No other vessel was {{in the area to}} aid Sevona, so crew members on the stern section of the ship boarded the lifeboats. Crew members on the bow section, separated from the lifeboats, were forced to construct a raft out of hatch covers and doors. All crew members on the makeshift raft later lost their lives in the storm. Three other vessels, including the schooner-barge Pretoria, were lost in the storm.|$|E

5000|$|It is also {{necessary}} {{to mention that the}} first-person pronouns again appear in a great frequency; but the possessive pronoun [...] "my" [...] predominates. Unlike the frequent use of the [...] "I" [...] in the previous canto that made the canto sound self-conscious, this canto might now sound self-possessed. The canto is no more a request or a prayer as {{it had been in the}} fourth canto—it is a demand. The poet becomes <b>the</b> <b>wind's</b> instrument, his [...] "lyre" [...] (57).

25|$|Aware {{that the}} people on Clorinde would swamp his boat if he drew {{alongside}} the frigate, possibly drowning all concerned, Willoughby instead commandeered a punt {{and used it to}} come aboard the frigate. Once on board, Willoughby persuaded La Poype to surrender the ship without the formalities observed outside the harbour, raising the Union Flag. The Haitians were consequently unable to fire on a ship in possession of their ally, Willoughby going ashore to meet with Dessalines, who promised assistance. Willoughby returned with a number of boats crewed by Haitians and was joined by several British boats in anticipation of removing the crew and passengers from the stricken ship. On his return however, Willoughby discovered that <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> fallen significantly, allowing him to use the boats instead to haul Clorinde off the rocks and into deeper water. Her hull was still intact, and by the evening Clorinde had joined the rest of the British squadron off the mouth of the harbour.|$|E
25|$|Pliny and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends {{attributed}} to burning villages. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again but <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> not changed. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed, escaping ultimately by land. Very likely, he had collapsed and died, which is the most popular explanation of why his friends abandoned him, although Suetonius offers an alternative story of his ordering a slave to kill him to avoid the pain of incineration. How the slave would have escaped to tell the tale remains a mystery. There is no mention of such an event in his nephew's letters.|$|E
25|$|Rain {{had fallen}} for {{considerable}} time overnight, making the pitch difficult, though MacLaren and Palairet cut 36 off the target before lunch was taken. Palairet was then bowled by Saunders, and Tyldesley and MacLaren followed, the latter caught {{far out in}} the field by Duff for 35. Australia's Saunders then dropped Abel before rain stopped play again. After the break, England's batsmen were instructed to hit out. Abel added 20 with Ranjitsinhji, who looked uncertain against Trumble and was eventually given lbw, and Trumble and Saunders kept at the English batsmen. Abel was bowled trying to drive, Jackson caught at mid off, Braund stumped, and Lockwood bowled, England now requiring 11 to win with two wickets in hand. Rhodes came in and struck a boundary, and Lilley hit two scoring shots to take the tally to 116, before Hill, starting from long on, took a brilliant running catch square in the deep, in front of the pavilion, to dismiss him when the ball, albeit held up in <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> <b>had</b> seemed sure to go for four.|$|E

More than any film since The Birth of a Nation, it unleashed a variety of social forces that foreshadowed an alliance of white liberals and blacks who encouraged the expectation that blacks would one day achieve equality. According to Cripps, the film eventually became a template for measuring social change.|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot in}} command then decided on the descent plan, {{involving}} an initial descent to 1,200meters (4,000ft), then down to 900meters (3,000ft), before making a swing towards localizer 255. Then the aircraft should descend to 640meters (2,100ft) and head towards Namsos Beacon inbound. After that, minimum height was set to 640meters (2,100ft).

To avoid such inconveniences, Tremplin du Praz was built into the mountain side to minimize wind exposure.
