40|$|The {{effect of}} purinergic {{compounds}} on [Ca 2 +]i and membrane currents of cell lines {{derived from the}} airway epithelium of normal and cystic fibrosis individuals has been investigated. 2 -Chloroadenosine (2 -CADO), {{as well as other}} agonists of the A 1 adenosine receptors, causes a transient elevation of cytosolic [Ca 2 +] that is antagonized by the A 1 adenosine receptor antagonist 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 dipropylxanthine (DPCPX). ATP is also effective, but at a lower extent. The [Ca 2 +]i increase induced by 2 -CADO and ATP is abolished by preincubation with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate and the Ca(2 +) -ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. This latter result suggests that purinergic agonists mobilize Ca 2 + from inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate-sensitive stores. Pertussis toxin completely inhibits the effect of 2 -CADO, whereas only it partially affects that of ATP, suggesting the involvement of different types of G proteins. Perforated patch clamp experiments carried out in both current clamp and voltage clamp modes show that 2 -CADO and ATP activate K(+) - and Cl(-) -selective membrane currents, with a mechanism inhibited by preincubation with DPCPX and thapsigargin. These data indicate that activation of adenosine A 1 receptor, in a similar way to ATP receptor, causes [Ca 2 +]i increase and ion channels activation <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism</b> that is not impaired in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) such as {{hydrogen}} peroxide serve as second messengers in the induction of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, and hence in the activation and replication of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) in human cells. During inflammatory reactions, many oxidative species are produced, {{one of which is}} hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is responsible for the microbicidal effects of activated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Treatment of a T-lymphocytic cell line with micromolar concentrations of HOCl promoted the appearance of transcription factor NF-kappaB (the heterodimer p 50 /p 65) in the nucleus of the cells, {{even in the absence of}} de novo protein synthesis. Western blot analysis of the NF-kappaB inhibitory subunits (IkappaB) demonstrated that both IkappaB-alpha proteolysis and p 105 processing were induced by the treatment. NF-kappaB activation was very effective when cells were subjected to hyperthermia before being treated with HOCl. Various antioxidants, such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, p-bromophenacyl-bromide and nordihydroguaiaretic acid could strongly reduce NF-kappaB translocation, demonstrating the importance of oxidative species in the transduction mechanism. Moreover, ACH- 2 cells treated with HOCl or H 2 O 2 released tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the supernatants. The importance of TNF-alpha release in NF-kappaB induction by HOCl or H 2 O 2 was demonstrated by the fact that: (1) the nuclear appearance of NF-kappaB was promoted in untreated cells; and (2) synergism between TNF-alpha and HOCl was detected. Collectively, these results suggest that HOCl should be considered as an oxidative species capable of inducing NF-kappaB in a T-lymphocytic cell line <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism</b> involving ROS, and having a long-distance effect through subsequent TNF-alpha release...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Hedgehog {{signaling}} proteins play {{important roles}} in development by controlling growth and patterning in various animals including Drosophila and mammals. Hedgehog signaling triggers changes in responsive cells <b>through</b> <b>a</b> novel <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism</b> that ultimately controls the transcription of specific target genes via the activity of zinc finger transcription factors of the Cubitus interruptus /GLI family. In flies, key Hedgehog signal transduction components have been identified including the kinesin-related protein Costal 2, the serinethreonine kinase Fused, and the PEST-containing protein Suppressor of Fused. These proteins control Cubitus interruptus cleavage, nucleo-cytoplasmic localization and activation. In fly embryos, Costal 2, Fused, Suppressor of Fused and Cubitus interruptus are associated {{in at least one}} cytoplasmic complex, which interacts with the microtubules in a Hedgehog-dependent manner.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on anaesthetized cats {{to test the hypothesis}} that fluid flow through dentinal tubules is part of the mechanism involved in the transduction of pain-producing stimuli in teeth. In 11 animals, fluid flow through dentine and single- and multi-unit activity in intradental nerves were recorded simultaneously during the application of changes in hydrostatic pressure (- 500 to + 500 mmHg) to exposed dentine. Seventeen A-fibres (conduction velocity (CV), 10. 6 - 55. 1 m s− 1) were isolated that were pressure sensitive. The thresholds of these units in terms of dentinal fluid flow were in the range 0. 3 - 2. 1 nl s− 1 mm− 2 during outward flow from the pulp and 2. 0 - 3. 5 nl s− 1 mm− 2 during inward flow. All the units were more sensitive to outward than inward flow. Twenty-eight units (CV, 0. 6 - 48. 8 m s− 1) were not pressure sensitive, and 12 of these had conduction velocities in the C-fibre range (< 2. 5 m s− 1). The velocities of the tubular contents were calculated by estimating the number and diameters of dentinal tubules exposed. At the threshold of single-fibre responses these velocities were in the range 31. 7 - 222. 9 μm s− 1 during outward flow, and 211. 4 - 369. 6 μm s− 1 during inward flow. Repetitive pressure stimulation of dentine resulted in a progressive reduction in the evoked discharge, which was probably due to pulp damage. In seven animals, 10 single intradental nerve fibres were selected that responded to hydrostatic pressure stimuli and their responses to the application of hot, cold, osmotic, mechanical and drying stimuli to exposed dentine were investigated. With these stimuli dentinal fluid flow could not be recorded in vivo for technical reasons and was therefore recorded in vitro after completion of the electrophysiological recordings. With each form of stimulus, the discharge evoked in vivo was closely related to the flow predicted from the in vitro measurements. The results were therefore consistent with the hypothesis that the stimuli act <b>through</b> <b>a</b> common <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism</b> that involves fluid flow through dentine...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we have {{demonstrated}} that dopamine (DA) stimulates growth hormone (GH) release from the goldfish pituitary through DA D 1 receptors. In the present study, the role of cAMP in DA D 1 -stimulated GH release was investigated using static incubation of goldfish pituitary cells. The D 1 agonist SKF 38393 (1 nM- 10 microM) induced GH release and cAMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner with ED 50 s of 73 +/- 32 and 109 +/- 53 nM, respectively. In contrast, the D 2 agonist LY 171555 (1 nM- 10 microM) was not effective in these regards. The GH-releasing action of SKF 38393 was mimicked by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (0. 1 - 40 microM) {{as well as the}} phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (0. 1 microM- 1 mM). Dideoxyforskolin (0. 1 - 40 microM), a derivative of forskolin inactive in stimulating adenylate cyclase, did not affect basal GH secretion. Similar stimulatory effects on GH release were also observed using the membrane-permeant cAMP analogs (10 microM- 2 mM), dibutyryl cAMP and 8 -bromo cAMP (8 Br. cAMP). In the presence of a high dose (1 mM) of Br. cAMP, the ability of SKF 38393 (1 nM- 10 microM) to stimulate GH release was abolished, suggesting that the GH-releasing actions of cAMP and DA D 1 stimulation are mediated <b>through</b> <b>a</b> common signal <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In the present study, the possible involvement of the cAMP-dependent enzyme protein kinase A (PKA) in DA D 1 -stimulated GH release was also examined.

In this study, we investigated {{the existence of}} a NOS system in eosinophils. Our results demonstrated that rat peritoneal eosinophils strongly express both type II (30. 2 +/- 11. 6 % of counted cells) and type III (24. 7 +/- 7. 4 % of counted cells) NOS, as detected by immunohistochemistry using affinity purified mouse mAbs. Eosinophil {{migration in}} vitro was evaluated by using 48 -well microchemotaxis chambers and the chemotactic agents used were N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP, 5 x 10 (- 8) M) and leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4, 10 (- 8) M). L-NAME (but not D-NAME) significantly inhibited the eosinophil migration induced by both fMLP (54 % reduction for 1. 0 mM; P < 0. 05) and LTB 4 (61 % reduction for 1. 0 mM; P < 0. 05). In addition, the type II NOS inhibitor 2 -amino- 5, 6 -dihydro- 6 -methyl- 4 H- 1, 3 -thiazine and the type I/II NOS inhibitor 1 -(2 -trifluoromethylphenyl) imidazole also markedly (P < 0. 05) attenuated fMLP- (52 % and 38 % reduction for 1. 0 mM, respectively) and LTB 4 - (52 % and 51 % reduction for 1. 0 mM, respectively) induced migration.

40|$|AbstractIt was {{recently}} {{suggested that the}} opening of neutrophil plasma membrane Ca 2 + channels by chemotactic agents is mediated by a rise in free cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i).

The dynamics of a granular chain of six, 1 [*]mm diameter chrome steel spherical beads, was excited at one end using a sinusoidal displacement signal at 73 [*]kHz, and terminated by a rigid support. Output from this model was compared with the solution provided by the equivalent discrete dynamics model, and good agreement obtained. An experimental configuration involving the same chain, but terminated by an annular support made of a liquid photopolymer resin was also simulated and the velocity of the last sphere obtained through simulation was compared with laser vibrometer measurement, with good agreement. This model was then extended whereby the granular chain was coupled to an acoustic medium with the properties of water, via a thin vitreous carbon cylinder. Finite element predictions of the acoustic pressure indicate that, for a 73 [*]kHz excitation frequency, harmonic rich acoustic pulses with harmonic content close to 1 [*]MHz are predicted...|$|R
40|$|Intrinsic mechanoelectrical {{conversion}} {{properties of}} skin tissues are investigated, and their origin is suggested to originate primarily from electrokinetic phenomena (streaming potentials) {{operating in the}} dermis. Human dermis is considered in analogy to other connective tissue as a biphasic, composite material in which the extracellular fluid permeates a negatively charged gel-like matrix of glycoproteins. A synthetic analog implementing <b>a</b> mechanoelectrical <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism</b> thought to operate in dermis is realized. A biomorphic tactile sensor is devised and its dynamic transduction response is theoretically and experimentally analyzed. The streaming potential artificial skin appears to be particularly suited for applications in which ideal mechanical matching with body tissues or soft touch grasp are required...|$|R
40|$|MEMS {{resonators}} {{are today}} widely investigated as a desirable alternative to quartz resonators in real-time clock applications, {{because of their}} low-cost, integration capability properties. Nevertheless, MEMS resonators performances are still not competitive, {{especially in terms of}} frequency stability and device equivalent resistance (and, then, power consumption). We propose a new structure for a MEMS resonator, with <b>a</b> vertical-like <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which exhibits promising features. The vertical resonator can be fabricated with the low-cost, high performance THELMA technology, and it is designed to be efficiently frequency tunable. With respect to the commonly investigated lateral resonators, it is expected to have lower equivalent resistances and improved large-scale repeatability characteristics...|$|R
40|$|A soluble enzyme {{obtained}} from rat forebrain catalyzes the NADPH-dependent formation of nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline from L-arginine. The NO formed stimulates the soluble guanylate cyclase and this stimulation is abolished by low concentrations of hemoglobin. The synthesis of NO and citrulline {{is dependent on}} the presence of physiological concentrations of free Ca 2 + and is inhibited by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, but not by its enantiomer NG-monomethyl-D-arginine or by L-canavanine. L-Homoarginine, L-arginyl-L-aspartate, or L-arginine methyl ester can replace L-arginine as substrates for the enzyme. These results indicate that NO is formed from L-arginine in the brain <b>through</b> <b>an</b> enzymic reaction similar to that in vascular endothelial cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, adding support to our hypothesis that the formation of NO from L-arginine is <b>a</b> widespread <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase...|$|R
40|$|A FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) {{controlled}} inclinometer {{based on}} MEMS structures {{is presented in}} this paper. Pull-in voltage measurements are used in this work as the <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The pull-in phenomenon {{is characterized by the}} sudden loss of stability in electrostatically actuated parallel-plate actuators and since pull-in voltage is stable and easy to measure, it enables <b>an</b> interesting <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism.</b> By successively bringing the microstructure to pullin while measuring the pull-in voltage allows the detection of external accelerations. A FPGA is responsible to control the entire system increasing its performance and reliability. The sensor resolution is defined by the resolution of the measured pull-in, i. e., resolution of the actuation voltage. Experimental results show a sensitivity of 50 mV/o with the resolution of the actuation voltage set below 1 V using a 24 -bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC).

40|$|To {{qualify as}} a “basic ” taste quality or modality, defined {{as a group of}} {{chemicals}} that taste alike, three empirical benchmarks have commonly been used. The first is that a candidate group of tastants must have <b>a</b> dedicated <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the peripheral nervous system. The second is that the tastants evoke physiological responses in dedicated afferent taste nerves innervating the oropharyngeal cavity. Last, the taste stimuli evoke activity in central gustatory neurons, some of which may respond only to that group of tastants. Here we argue that water may also be an independent taste modality. This argument is based on the identification of <b>a</b> water dedicated <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the peripheral nervous system, water responsive fibers of the peripheral taste nerves and the observation of water responsive neurons in all gustatory regions within the central nervous system. We have described electrophysiological responses from single neurons in nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and parabrachial nucleus of the pons, respectively the first two central relay nuclei in the rodent brainstem, to water presented as a taste stimulus in anesthetized rats. Responses to water were in some cases as robust as responses to other taste qualities and sometimes occurred in the absence of responses to other tastants. Both excitatory and inhibitory responses were observed. Also, th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} system composed of two sensors, the semicircular canal and the sacculus, is suggested. The model is described by three lines of blocks, each line of which has the following structure: a biomechanical block, <b>a</b> mechanoelectrical <b>transduction</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and <b>a</b> block describing the hair cell ionic currents and membrane potential dynamics. The response of this system to various stimuli (head rotation under gravity and falling) is investigated. Identification of the model parameters was done with the experimental data obtained for the axolotl (Ambystoma tigrinum) at the Institute of Physiology, Autonomous University of Puebla, Mexico. Comparative analysis of the semicircular canal and sacculus membrane potentials is presented. 1...|$|R
