Connor is arrested and charged, while the now-cleared Dickerson resumes circling obituaries in the newspaper.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior to escape aversive tasks or demands. For example, {{when a child is}} told <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bath</b> he begins to cry, and his mother tells him he no longer has <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bath.</b> Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a series of math problems, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principals office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing math problems. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, novel tasks, etc.|$|E
25|$|Wargrave then {{suggests}} searching all the rooms, and any {{potentially dangerous}} items they {{can think of}} are locked up. Lombard's gun is missing from his room.

Wargrave, however, is still downstairs. The others find him seated, immobile and crudely dressed up in the attire of a judge.

25|$|While Sano was {{initially}} scared, {{according to her}} own statements, she eventually just gave up and accepted her fate. Allegedly, the kidnapper kept her tied up for several months and used a stun gun for punishments {{if she did not}} videotape the horse racing on TV. Sano was also threatened with a knife and beatings. Her kidnapper shared his men's clothes with her and gave her food three times per day, either instant food or meals cooked by his mother, who lived downstairs in the house. He also cut Sano's hair. Since there was no bath or toilet upstairs where Sano was confined, she was only able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bath</b> infrequently, when permitted by her captor.|$|E
25|$|Minos {{searched for}} Daedalus by {{traveling}} {{from city to}} city asking a riddle; he presented a spiral seashell and asked for it to be strung all the way through. When he reached Camicus, Sicily, King Cocalus, knowing Daedalus would be able to solve the riddle, fetched the old man. He tied the string to an ant, which walked through the seashell, stringing it all the way through. Minos then knew Daedalus was in the court of King Cocalus and demanded he be handed over. Cocalus managed to convince him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bath</b> first; then Cocalus' daughters and Daedalus, with Minos trapped in the bath, scalded him to death with boiling water.|$|E
25|$|The Bhagavata Purana also narrates: Krishna's {{elder brother}} Balarama was staying in Ambadi on Yamuna's banks {{for a few}} months. Once, he was frolicking with the gopis on the river banks and desired {{to play in the}} waters. Intoxicated with liquor and {{experiencing}} heat of the alcohol, Balarama felt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bath</b> in the river. However, he refused to walk to the waters and called upon the river to come near him, but the chaste Yamuna refused despite repeated orders from Balarama. An angry Balarama dragged the river by his weapon – the plough and changed its course, hurting the river goddess. Terrified, the river assumed her form as a goddess and bowed to Balarama and asked his forgiveness. A calmed Balarama ordered the river to flood the forest so he could bathe and play in her waters, and the river complied.|$|E

25|$|Once, while Parvati wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bath,</b> {{there were}} no attendants around to guard her and stop anyone from accidentally {{entering}} the house. Hence she created {{an image of a}} boy out of turmeric paste which she prepared to cleanse her body, and infused life into it, and thus Ganesha was born. Parvati ordered Ganesha not to allow anyone to enter the house, and Ganesha obediently followed his mother's orders. After a while Shiva returned and tried to enter the house, Ganesha stopped him. Shiva was infuriated, lost his temper and severed the boy's head with his trident. When Parvati came out and saw her son's lifeless body, she was very angry. She demanded that Shiva restore Ganesha's life at once. Shiva did so by attaching an elephant's head to Ganesha's body, thus giving rise to the elephant headed deity.|$|E
25|$|Hazumu's parents, {{her father}} , {{and her mother}} , are almost always shown {{together}} throughout the series. When Hazumu goes missing after getting rejected from Yasuna, both of Hazumu's parents are completely distraught, and {{do not know what}} to do. After Hazumu's transformation, both parents become overjoyed to have a daughter in place of a son which is shown through their eccentricities. Toru works as a magazine photographer and loves to take pictures of Hazumu any chance he gets; often this is after his wife has already dressed Hazumu in some feminine garment. Additionally, Hazumu's father repeatedly attempts <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bath</b> with Hazumu, but is always stopped by his wife. Kahoru loves to buy feminine clothes for Hazumu to wear, and buys these clothes without consulting Hazumu herself, though regardless she finds herself wearing them anyway. Directly after Hazumu turned into a girl, her mother even goes ahead and buys her a female school uniform to wear from now on. Hazumu becomes annoyed by her parents' new behavior toward her, and finds trying on her new clothes very tiring. When Hazumu bakes cookies for the first time, Kahoru loves it, but Toru simply wolfs down most of the cookies for himself. Since his mother had always wanted a daughter instead of son, she often dressed Hazumu up in young girl's clothes, saying that gender discrimination is not a good thing.|$|E
25|$|Chen Biao {{requested}} {{to serve in}} the military just like his father before him, and was placed in command of 500 troops. He was eager to win the hearts of his soldiers so he treated them well and they were willing to die for him. Once, there was an incident of grand theft and the suspect was Shi Ming (施明), a soldier from the Wunan (無難) camp. Shi Ming had been arrested and interrogated, but he remained fierce, refused to reveal the truth, and even expressed his willingness to die. The Minister of Justice (廷尉) was unable to do anything to him. Sun Quan heard that Chen Biao understood a soldier's mentality well so he ordered Chen to take up Shi Ming's case. Chen Biao had Shi Ming released from his shackles and allowed him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bath</b> and have a change of clothes, and treated him to a feast. Shi Ming was so touched by Chen Biao's generous treatment that he confessed to the crime and named his accomplices. Sun Quan was very surprised and impressed with Chen Biao, so he granted a special pardon to Shi Ming to protect Chen's reputation – because Chen would be labelled as a hypocrite if Shi were to be executed after confessing under Chen's kind treatment. Shi Ming's accomplices, on the other hand, were not so lucky as they were all executed. Shi Ming mended his ways and gradually rose through the ranks to become a general in Eastern Wu.|$|E

500|$|As Uttanka was {{returning}} to Veda's ashram, he decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bath</b> in a water tank. He left his things {{on the bank of}} the river and went <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bath.</b> At that time, Takshaka came there in the disguise of a naked mendicant and stole the earrings. Uttanka tried to pursue the mendicant, but Takshaka had reverted to his original form of a serpent and slithered away into a hole in the ground, reaching Naga-loka, the abode of the Nagas. Uttanka then tried to dig through the hole. Indra, the king of the gods, saw Uttanka in the process of digging and sent his weapon Vajra (thunder-bolt) to help him carve a tunnel to the realm of the Nagas. When Uttanka entered the snake world, he started praising the virtues of the snake king Takshaka and his clan, but to no avail as Takshaka was not moved to give up the earrings.|$|E

500|$|Ramayana and Mahabharata {{refer to}} Pushkar Lake as Adi Tirtha, or the [...] "original sacred water-body". The famous Sanskrit poet and play-writer Kalidasa also {{referred}} to this lake in his poem Abhijñānaśākuntalam. The Ramayana mentions that Vishwamitra performed penance at Pushkar Lake for a thousand years. In spite of Brahma appearing before him and granting him the higher status of a rishi instead of a royal-sage (rajarishi), Vishwamitra continued his penance, but, the celestial nymph apsara, Menaka came to the lake <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bath.</b> Vishwamitra was enamoured by her beauty {{and they decided to}} live together in pursuit of pleasure for ten years. Then, Vishwamitra realized that his main activity of penance was disturbed. He, therefore, took leave of Menaka and went away to the north to continue his meditation. Vishwamitra was also described as building the Brahma temple at Pushkar after Brahma's yagna. Mahabharata mentions that Pushkar is a holy place of the god Vishnu, considered as the Adi Tirtha where millions of tirthas united during sunrise and sunset, and visiting the lake and taking a holy bath in the lake would wash off all sins.|$|E
