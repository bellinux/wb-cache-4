40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with {{a comparison of the}} treatment of fixed capital in some multi-sectoral models. First, the dynamic Leontief model is investigated. Scrutiny shows that this model suffers from conceptual misconceptions which result from restrictive assumptions concerning full-capacity production and the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> in place, and from the definition of technical coefficients. Whereas most input-output (IO) models are based on the assumption of infinite life of fixed capital, the Sraffian concept is to treat used fixed capital items as 'intermediate' goods, which appear as joint products until they are worn out. To compare that approach with some IO models, an application of the concept of a 'plant' is provided. Finally, it is demonstrated that Leontief's model, as well as some recent generalizations, are special cases of a Sraffa-von Neumann type of model.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} data from American Community Survey (ACS) to study the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> for {{immigrants}} from China, India, Korea, Philippines, and Vietnam. The {{results of this study}} suggest that, first, human capital acquired in the U. S. is valued generally higher than that acquired in the home country, with a few exceptions. Moreover, there exists significant difference in the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> among different places of origin in Asia. In addition, this paper further concludes that education obtained from the source country is more transferable for immigrants from the countries that have colonial history either under the United States or the Great Britain; the labor market experience, however, is more transferable for immigrants from the countries that are more economically developed...|$|R
40|$|We draw on Bourdieu's {{theory of}} {{practice}} {{to examine a}} group of Indian academics' accounts of their careers in a research-intensive university. Using the concepts <b>of</b> habitus and <b>capital,</b> we argue that international staff are very well placed to craft {{a career in the}} increasingly market driven UK academic context, challenging the discourse of disadvantage associated with the careers of international academics as well as other highly skilled migrants. Central in our analysis is the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> <b>capitals</b> between different fields and the importance <b>of</b> understanding <b>capital</b> as part <b>of</b> the multiple fields that agents belong to. However, drawing attention to the changing rules of the research-intensive university system, we also suggest that these academics' career trajectory may not continue to yield positive results...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{earnings}} differentials between {{immigrants and}} natives. We focus on returns {{and on the}} (imperfect) international <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital.</b> Data are drawn from the 2009 Italian Labour Force Survey (LFS). We show that returns to human capital are considerably lower for immigrants as compared to natives {{and that there is}} no return to pre-immigration work experience, suggesting imperfect <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital.</b> We also explored the role <b>of</b> human <b>capital,</b> for immigrants and natives, in explaining inter-occupational and intra-occupational earnings progression (differentials). Our findings suggest that the returns on human <b>capital</b> (main source <b>of</b> wage progression) for immigrants (is) are mainly driven by intra-occupational earnings progression. Moreover, and contrary to what is observed for natives, we detect through quantile analysis a glass-ceiling effect for immigrant workers, who appear to face a large penalty in accessing high paying occupations. A number of robustness checks confirm our main results...|$|R
30|$|It {{is likely}} that no {{singular}} reason drives these patterns. For instance, the overqualification of these migrants might derive from poor recognition of their skills in the German labor market, from German-specific human capital that these migrants lack, from imperfect <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> across borders, or from the lower quality of the degrees obtained.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the way immigrant earnings are determined in Australia. It uses the overeducation/required education/undereducation (ORU) framework (Hartog, 2000) and a decomposition of the native-born/foreign-born differential in the payoff to schooling developed by Chiswick and Miller (2008). This decomposition links overeducation to the less-than- perfect international <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> immigrants' human <b>capital,</b> and undereducation to favorable selection in immigration. Comparisons are offered with findings from analyses for the US and Canada to enable {{assessment of the}} relative impacts of favorable selection and the limited international <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> to the lower payoff to schooling for the foreign born. The sensitivity {{of the results of}} the decomposition to several measurement issues is assessed. immigrants, schooling, occupations, earnings, rates of return, selectivity, skill transferability, ORU analysis...|$|R
40|$|Nearly {{two decades}} ago, Ladwig {{outlined}} the theoretical and methodological implications of Bourdieu's {{concept of the}} social field for sociological analyses of educational policy and school reform. The current analysis extends this work to consider the sociological import {{of one of the}} most ubiquitous forms of educational reform found around the planet: school reform networks. On the one hand, this analysis highlights the extent to which schooling is composed of multiple, co-existing social fields, which offer school reform networks ample leverage points for change. On the other hand, the degree to which reform networks hope to realise their ambitions fundamentally depends on their capacity to leverage the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> <b>capitals</b> among those social fields that govern the daily practices of schooling...|$|R
30|$|While data {{limitations}} do {{not permit}} us to distinguish between these possible drivers, the qualification assessment policy introduced in Germany with the Recognition Act of 2012 will provide a framework that might improve the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> home-country human <b>capital.</b>|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> {{acquired}} abroad is imperfectly portable, {{the higher the}} homeland education the greater {{the gap between the}} native and the immigrant’s human capital, making assimilation more difficult among the more educated immigrants 17. As human capital acquired abroad becomes more portable (because of its proximity), we ought to expect that this lack of convergence between immigrants and natives with a university degree fades away.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the difference between}} the payoffs to schooling for immigrants and the native born in Canada, using 2001 Census data. Analyses are presented for males and females. Comparisons are offered with findings for the US. The paper uses the Overeducation/Required education/Undereducation framework (Hartog, 2000) and a decomposition developed by Chiswick and Miller (2008). This decomposition links overeducation to the less-than-perfect international <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> immigrants' human <b>capital,</b> and under-education to favourable selection in immigration. The results show that immigrants have a lower payoff to schooling because of the different effects under-education and over-education have on their earnings. The effects of under-education, or selection in immigration, are, however, twice as large as the effects of over-education, or limited international <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital.</b> Favourable selection in immigration appears to be less important in Canada than in the US, where it predominates among the least educated. immigrants, skill, schooling, earnings, rates of return, Canada...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> across {{countries}} and the contribution <b>of</b> imperfect human <b>capital</b> portability to the explanation of the immigrant-native wage gap. Using data for West Germany, our results reveal that, overall, education and in particular labor market experience accumulated in the home countries of the immigrants receive signifiantly lower returns than human capital obtained in Germany. We further find evidence for heterogeneity in the returns to human <b>capital</b> <b>of</b> immigrants across countries. Finally, imperfect human capital transferability {{appears to be a}} major factor in explaining the wage differential between natives and immigrants...|$|R

The model reveals that high migration flows and high skill-transferability are mutually interdependent. Moreover, we show that high mobility within a Federation is necessary to attract highly skilled immigrants into the Federation. We study in how far and in what way the European public policy behind the Bologna and the Lisbon Process can contribute to higher mobility in Europe. human capital, migration, transferability, public policy...|$|R
3000|$|Recent {{research}} on immigrants’ over/under-education has typically {{focused only on}} the formal education qualifications of migrants and has compared the possible labour market mismatch of immigrants or ethnic minorities (i.e., second/third generation migrants) with natives. There is an almost universal consensus in the literature that immigrants are more often over-educated than their native counterparts and researchers forward different, and very plausible, arguments for this disparity. These range from imperfect international <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> to discrimination in the labour market to, perhaps, a combination of language and country of origin effect (Chiswick and Miller [2009]; Green et al [...]...|$|R

It draws on the theoretical arguments postulated in the labour economics literature and discusses their extension {{in the analysis of}} the causes and effects of immigrants' educational mismatch in the destination country. Relevant empirical approaches have been presented which show that immigrants are in general more over-educated than natives and that the reasons for those range from imperfect <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> to discrimination to perhaps lack of innate ability.

30|$|One of the {{few studies}} that {{considered}} the role of job experience accumulated in the home country in explaining the immigrants’ education mismatch in the host country labour market is Chiswick and Miller ([2009]). They found that a greater amount of home country experience is associated with poorer job matches in the US and argued the imperfect international <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> as the main driving force for that outcome. The authors, however, implicitly assume no education mismatch in the immigrants’ country of origin labour market. In other words, they suppose that the professional experience gained prior to immigration was in jobs requiring exactly the education level obtained from formal schooling.|$|R
30|$|According to Leuven and Oosterbeek (2011), only a {{few studies}} have {{addressed}} the incidence of over- and undereducation among migrants. The available evidence indicates that migrants {{are more likely to be}} overeducated. Different arguments are presented as the source of divergence, for example, the imperfect international <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> (Chiswick and Miller, 2009 a), low destination-country language skills (Green et al., 2007) or previous work experience in the home country (Piracha et al. 2012). Most of these contributions are at a national level. This is the case for the labour markets of Canada (Wald and Fang, 2008), Sweden (Dahlstedt, 2011; Joona et al., 2014) and Denmark (Nielsen, 2011).|$|R
3000|$|While Fig.  2 {{suggests}} {{that the ability to}} transfer occupational skills to a new job can reduce earnings losses following job displacement, the relationship may change when we control for observable characteristics.

30|$|As we have explained, it {{is likely}} that the weak {{governmental}} capacity to regulate immigrant inflows combined with the construction, tourism, and personal services growth experienced by Spanish economy in the last decade explains the over-representation of immigrants in low-qualified occupations (regardless of their educational level) and the lack of upward occupational mobility. In addition, the large informal sector, the striking segmentation of the Spanish labor market, the need for certification, the imperfect <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> acquired abroad, and discrimination are likely to be part of the story to a certain extent. Unfortunately, while a combination of the above explanations may apply, without further data, we cannot differentiate between these explanations and their relative importance.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a spatial analysis of unemployment rates in Germany. The {{goal of this}} analysis is to explain the stubbornly low labor productivity and high unemployment rates in Eastern Germany. We build a model of commuting to distinguish between worker and job characteristics as the main causes of the low labor productivity, and use the method of simulated moments to estimate the East-West ratios of worker and job characteristics. The “slope” of the unemployment rate across the former East-West border serves as the main identification of the model. The preliminary results suggest that East and West German skills are very similar, while job characteristics differ significantly between East and West. <b>Transferability</b> <b>of</b> Human <b>Capital,</b> Spatial Allocation <b>of</b> Labor...|$|R
40|$|This paper brings new {{evidence}} to the existing literature on earnings differentials and returns to human capital for immigrants and natives. It is the first paper analysing this topic using data drawn from the Italian Labour Force Survey, a large nationally representative dataset. We show that returns to human capital are considerably lower for immigrants as compared to natives {{and that there is}} no return to pre-immigration work experience, suggesting imperfect <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital.</b> In {{the second part of the}} paper we explore models of occupational attainment among immigrants and the native born.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the 2001 Australian Census of Population and Housing, on adult men in {{full-time}} employment, this paper augments a conventional human capital earnings function with information on occupations. It also estimates models of occupational attainment. The results from both the earnings function and model of occupational attainment indicate that the limited international <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> skills results in immigrants entering into relatively low status occupations when they first enter the Australian labour market. Comparison with similar research for the US suggests that the different immigrant selection regimes (primarily family reunion in the US, skill-based immigration in Australia) do not impact on the negative association between occupational status and pre-immigration labour market experience. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{cause of}} {{immigrant}} education mismatch {{in the host}} country labour market might not necessarily be discrimination or imperfect <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital,</b> as argued in previous studies. Immigrants who have gained professional experience in the home country in jobs below their education level might be assessed by host country employers as having lower abilities and skills than those expected from their educational qualifications. Using the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Australia we show that {{a significant part of}} the variation in the immigrants' probability to be over-/under-educated in the Australian labour market can be explained by having been over-/under-educated in the last job in the home country. immigrants, education-occupation mismatch, sample selection...|$|R
40|$|Labour market {{outcomes}} for immigrants {{in general is}} a well researched field, but the mechanisms behind labour market mismatches among immigrants post-migration is still in need of empirical research. Using a unique and newly compiled dataset on Swedish immigrants, also containing pre-migration occupational and educational information data, this study aims makes use of maximum likelihood models to measure the influence of an individual’s pre-migration history on the post-migration outcomes. The results show significant associations between pre- and post-migration mismatch status, and a persistence in the mismatched state over time. Possible explanations include individual ability, discrimination, imperfect <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital,</b> and changes in labour demand. The method used is not causal, and the associations shown should be researched further using a causal approach...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} life cycle career choices of law school {{graduates}} using unique data from the University of Michigan Law School. The model assumes that these graduates act according to the optimal solution of a dynamic optimization problem in which they sequentially choose among five employment sectors. The employment sectors are differentiated by pecuniary and nonpecuniary returns, promotion and dismissal probabilities, and the extent <b>of</b> <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital.</b> The estimation <b>of</b> the model reveals a self-selection mechanism, based on unobserved heterogeneity in abilities and expected future returns, which plays {{a critical role in}} reproducing the sector-specific nonmonotonic separation hazards observed in the data. The underlying self-selection mechanism also has implications for policy interventions in the market for lawyers, such as loan forgiveness programs...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{analysis}} <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> {{leads to}} a somewhat different question than that addressed by other management research on external succession: do differences between external successors in the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> their human <b>capital</b> affect firm performance, and if so, how? By comparing external successors that have within-industry and related-industry skills, we find that successors with less transferable (related-industry) skills have greater variance of firm performance.

30|$|There is {{not only}} a problem of low {{employment}} rates among non-Western immigrants but also a problem of underutilization of their skills once employed. Previous studies, both for Sweden and for other countries, find that the incidence of overeducation, i.e. the degree to which workers have an education that exceeds the one that is required for the job, is larger among immigrants than among natives (Dahlstedt 2011; Nielsen 2011; Wald and Fang 2008). It is often assumed that due to limited <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> an initial mismatch, or overeducation, among immigrants can be expected. However, if there is a higher degree of persistence and state dependence in overeducation among immigrants this would be a sign of a more severe problem. By state dependence we mean that overeducation in a previous period will have an independent effect on current overeducation.|$|R
30|$|I use {{a unique}} data set on Israeli {{manufacturing}} firms and investigate directly whether firms and industries {{with a higher}} concentration of immigrants experienced increases in productivity. The analysis is carried out by running conventional production function regressions, where the share of immigrants is treated as an additional right hand side variable. This econometric specification is obtained directly from microeconomic principles if one assumes a Cobb-Douglas production function, perfect substitutability between native and immigrant labor, and possible differences in the efficiency units of labor provided by native and immigrant workers. The coefficient on the share of immigrants will be positive if immigrant workers are more productive (because they are more educated, innovative, inherently more hard-working, or other reasons) and negative if immigrants are less productive (because of language barriers, low <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital,</b> or other reasons). Thus, the model directly nests the two competing theories {{about the effect of}} high-skill immigration on productivity.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} wage {{assimilation of}} ethnic German immigrants to Germany. We use unique administrative data {{that include a}} standardized measure of immigrants' pre-migration wage based on occupation, industry, tenure, qualification, and the German wage structure. We find that immigrants experience a substantial initial wage disadvantage compared to natives. During their first 15 years in the host country they manage to close a considerable part of this gap, though assimilation is only partial. A 10 % higher pre-migration wage translates into a 1. 6 % higher wage in Germany when also controlling for educational attainment, thus pointing at partial <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> acquired in the source country to the host country's labor market. We also find that wage assimilation is significantly accelerated for immigrants with a higher pre-migration wage. Our results {{are in line with}} strong complementarities between general skills and host country-specific human capital, in particular proficiency in the host country's language...|$|R
40|$|The {{perspectives}} of migrant {{children and young}} people have been largely omitted in youth studies. Existing literature focuses predominantly on young people born to migrant parents in the host country, while the problems of first generation of migrant youth have received limited attention. This paper focuses on first-generation Polish migrants and their experiences in relation to school transition, new language learning and the changing family relationships in the new social environment. It draws on ethnographic research, including in-depth interviews collected from 17 young people (aged 12 – 17) and their parents, as well as participant observation within homes and schools. Exploring the concept <b>of</b> family <b>capital,</b> the paper builds on Bourdieu's theory of cultural and social capital and Coleman's theory <b>of</b> social <b>capital.</b> It examines family support and cultural values, the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> family <b>capital</b> from one country to another in terms of educational success and social mobility and the capacity of young people to draw on their family capital and to develop their own social capital in a host country. The findings are discussed with reference to the existing literature and the possible ways of supporting young people through the development of policies and school practices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on the {{specificity}} or <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> by analyzing theuniqueeventofGermanReunification. We explore whether the comparatively low labor productivity in the East {{is caused by the}} depreciation <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> at reunification, or by unfavorable job characteristics. East German workers should have been hit harder by reunification the more specific human capital was. Treating both human capital and job characteristics as unobservables, we derive their relative importance in explaining the low labor productivity by estimating a spatial structural model and analyzing the commuting behavior across the former East-West border and the resulting regional unemployment rates. The identification of the model comes from the slope of the unemployment rate across the former border: the larger the human capital differences between East and West, the less commuting across the border takes place, and the sharper is the increase of the unemployment rate at the former border. The results indicate that East and West German skills are very similar, while job characteristics differ significantly between East and West. They hence suggest that asignificant part <b>of</b> the human <b>capital</b> accumulated in the East before 1990 was transferable...|$|R

30|$|However, {{the results}} of a study of the US high-skilled labour market by Chiswick and Miller (2009 b) show that overeducation is {{widespread}} among both migrants and native-born. In the USA, the extent of overeducation declines with job-tenure as high-skilled migrants obtain jobs commensurate with their educational level. Using the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Australia, Piracha et al. (2012) reveal that {{a significant part of the}} variation in the migrants' probability of being over- or undereducated in the Australian labour market can be explained by having been over- or undereducated in their last job in the home country. Home country mismatch was notably large in the case of undereducation. We could not find in the literature arguments relating migrant mismatch to the country of origin/destination combination. Nevertheless, we believe that this distinction could be the cause of different mismatch incidence since, firstly, the extent <b>of</b> the international <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> might vary according to this factor; secondly, it could reflect different levels of dissimilarities among labour markets; and thirdly, language and ethnic differences might vary consistently among different combinations.|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} above, {{the method}} <b>of</b> estimating the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> occupation-specific human <b>capital</b> between vocations {{is still in}} its nascent stages; its evolution is complicated by measurement issues and the presence of formal and informal barriers to occupational entry. However, a burgeoning research agenda on OSHC has demonstrated it to be the predominant human capital influence on worker earnings and, thus, worthy of additional study. At this point, researchers and policymakers interested in OSHC transferability have two options for its estimation: Shaw (1984) and Ormiston (2014). While the above section has outlined the primary theoretical conflicts between these two approaches, what follows will offer more detail on their empirical disparities and the implications that these differences have on the interpretation of OSHC’s effect on worker earnings.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on immigrant assimilation highlights the imperfect portability <b>of</b> the human <b>capital</b> acquired by immigrants {{in their country}} of origin, which accounts for their low levels of labor market integration upon arrival in the new country, {{as well as their}} initially wide earnings gap. Recent studies have examined this issue from the perspective of overeducation. This study analyzes the portability <b>of</b> immigrants' human <b>capital</b> into the Spanish job market according to their geographic origin. Spain's immigrants originate from a highly varied range of countries, with origins as diverse as Latin America, the Maghreb and Eastern Europe. Here, the use of public microdata files from the Spanish Census permits us to identify up to six regions of immigrant origin comprising developed countries and developing economies, distinguishing, furthermore, different regions of origin {{on the basis of their}} language and level of development. The results obtained indicate differing degrees <b>of</b> <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> human <b>capital</b> depending on geographic origin, with transferability being greater for immigrants from countries that are highly developed or which have a similar culture or language and lower for those from developing countries and with more distant cultures. As an immigrant's period of residence in Spain is prolonged, integration does take place but the pace is slow (between 7 and 9 years) ...|$|R
