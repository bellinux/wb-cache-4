5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{presents}} a <b>technical</b> <b>challenge</b> to riders, team personnel, and equipment. Special frames and wheels are often used. In the past, developments {{to cope with}} the demands of Paris–Roubaix have included the use of wider tires, cantilever brakes, and dual brake levers. More recently, manufacturers such as Specialized have developed new types of bike which are designed {{to cope with the}} demands on the cobbled classics: the best known being the Specialized Roubaix series, which has a longer wheelbase and is designed to offer the rider a more forgiving ride. Many teams disperse personnel along the course with spare wheels, equipment and bicycles to help in locations not accessible to the team car.|$|E
5|$|Soule was {{promptly}} given the task by Square to score Secret of Evermore. The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background sounds (like wind blowing and ocean waves) {{into the music}} and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound. Part {{of the reason for}} this was that the sound program used in Evermore was not up to the <b>technical</b> <b>challenge</b> of what Soule wanted to do with it, forcing him to work creatively within his limitations. When Ron Gilbert of LucasArts left to form his own company, Humongous Entertainment, and Square moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, Soule quit Square to score Gilbert's children's adventure game series, Putt-Putt; he was the company's third employee. Soule composed the soundtracks to 11 children's games over the next three years, with multiple titles in the Putt-Putt, Pajama Sam, Freddi Fish and Spy Fox series.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert was}} planned {{for several months}} prior to its public {{announcement}} while the band was on their 2016 tour of South America, titled América Latina Olé Tour 2016. The bands' manager, Joyce Smyth, and Concerts Westworked extensively with the Cuban government {{in order for the}} show to be approved, due to the Cuban government still having control over what its citizens listen to. The embargo on Cuba proved to be a <b>technical</b> <b>challenge</b> for the band and stage crews since they had to ship all of their equipment from Belgium and could not rely on local infrastructure to assist to the degree that they are used to in more developed areas.|$|E

5|$|What Lawrence {{needed to}} develop the idea was capable {{graduate}} students to do the work. Edlefsen left to take up an assistant professorship in September 1930, and Lawrence replaced him with David H. Sloan and M. Stanley Livingston, who he set to work on developing Widerøe's accelerator and Edlefsen's cyclotron, respectively. Both had their own financial support. Both designs proved practical, and by May 1931, Sloan's linear accelerator was able to accelerate ions to 1 MeV. Livingston had a greater <b>technical</b> <b>challenge,</b> but when he applied 1,800V to his 11-inch cyclotron on January 2, 1931, he got 80,000-electron volt protons spinning around. A week later, he had 1.22 MeV with 3,000 V, more than enough for his PhD thesis on its construction.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{primarily}} found {{fault with}} the game's length, as {{the bulk of}} the game's content can be completed in only a few hours. Will Tuttle of GameSpy questioned whether Harmonix limited the number of songs on release knowing {{that there would be a}} market for the game's downloadable content in the near future. The low number of songs, along with the new themed instrument controllers, were found to make the game an expensive proposition for those new to rhythm games. Due to the limited selection of songs on the disc, some critics questioned the specific inclusion of certain songs or the exclusion of more popular songs. Furthermore, critics claimed that the game's complete dedication to the Beatles, without the option for cross-compatibility with Rock Band or vice versa, can potentially lead to tedious play sessions with minimal variety, hampering the social nature of the game. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com considered that in attaching the Rock Band name to the game's title, there was a certain expectation on an expandable library of songs and interoperability with previous Rock Band titles, which The Beatles: Rock Band failed to meet. Some players coming from previous versions of Rock Band would consider the songs in The Beatles: Rock Band to lack <b>technical</b> <b>challenge.</b> However, the less difficult note tracks were seen to be a welcoming benefit for newcomers to the series as well as those attempting to sing along with the harmony portions of the game. For purist fans, some critics noted that the game purposely avoids certain aspects of the Beatles' history; former band members such as Pete Best or collaborators such as Billy Preston or Eric Clapton are never seen during gameplay. Concerning supplemental content, Hilary Goldstein of IGN felt the extra features could have been more substantial, especially in comparison to the additional material that accompanies the remastered CDs.|$|E

25|$|In 1944, Johnston {{followed}} Alvarez to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, where Robert Oppenheimer, who {{was also}} from the University of California, was the director. Johnston {{became involved in the}} development of the Fat Man plutonium bomb. Because of the high level of spontaneous fission in reactor plutonium, it was decided to use a nearly critical sphere of the metal and compress it quickly into a much smaller and denser core using explosives, a <b>technical</b> <b>challenge</b> at the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundations}} {{represented the}} biggest <b>technical</b> <b>challenge</b> {{to be overcome}} by the Mughal builders. In order to support the considerable load resulting from the mausoleum, the sands of the riverbank needed to be stabilised. To this end, wells were sunk and then cased in timber and finally filled with rubble, iron and mortar— essentially acting as augured piles. After construction of the terrace was completed, work began simultaneously {{on the rest of}} the complex. Trees were planted almost immediately to allow them to mature as work progressed.|$|E
25|$|Automobile brakes {{inherently}} rely on friction, slowing {{a vehicle}} by converting its kinetic energy into heat. Incidentally, dispersing this {{large amount of}} heat safely is one <b>technical</b> <b>challenge</b> in designing brake systems. Disk brakes rely on friction between a disc and brake pads that are squeezed transversely against the rotating disc. In Drum brakes, brake shoes or pads are pressed outwards against a rotating cylinder (brake drum) to create friction. Since braking discs can be more efficiently cooled than drums, disc brakes have better stopping performance.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time {{sculpture}} and statues were put to wider uses. The great temples of the Classical era such as the Parthenon in Athens, and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, required relief sculpture for decorative friezes, and sculpture in the round to fill the triangular fields of the pediments. The difficult aesthetic and <b>technical</b> <b>challenge</b> stimulated {{much in the way}} of sculptural innovation. Unfortunately these works survive only in fragments, the most famous of which are the Parthenon Marbles, half of which are in the British Museum.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{facing the}} Palast Hotel across the {{entrance}} to Leipziger Platz (the Potsdam Gate), was the 400-room Hotel Fürstenhof, by Richard Bielenberg (1871–1929) and Josef Moser (1872–1963), erected in 1906/07, also {{on the site of}} an earlier building. With its 200-metre-long main facade along Stresemannstraße, the Fürstenhof was less opulent than some of the other hotels mentioned, despite its size, but was still popular with business people. The new U-Bahn station was being built {{at the same time as}} the hotel and actually ran through the hotel's basement, cutting it in half, thus making the construction of both into something of a <b>technical</b> <b>challenge,</b> but unlike the Wertheim department store (and contrary to several sources), the hotel did not enjoy a separate entrance directly from the station.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper limit}} of the violin's range is largely {{determined}} by the skill of the player, who may easily play more than two octaves on a single string, and four octaves on the instrument as a whole. Position names are mostly used for the lower positions and in method books and etudes; for this reason, it is uncommon to hear references to anything higher than seventh position. The highest position, practically speaking, is 13th position. Very high positions are a particular <b>technical</b> <b>challenge,</b> for two reasons. Firstly, the difference in location of different notes becomes much narrower in high positions, making the notes more challenging to locate {{and in some cases}} to distinguish by ear. Secondly, the much shorter sounding length of the string in very high positions is a challenge for the right arm and bow in sounding the instrument effectively. The finer (and more expensive) an instrument, the better able it is to sustain good tone right {{to the top of the}} fingerboard, at the highest pitches on the E string.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to their}} light weight, PEMFCs are most suited for {{transportation}} applications. PEMFCs for buses, which use compressed hydrogen for fuel, can operate {{at up to}} 40% efficiency. Generally PEMFCs are implemented on buses over smaller cars because of the available volume to house the system and store the fuel. Technical issues for transportation involve incorporation of PEMs into current vehicle technology and updating energy systems. Full fuel cell vehicles are not advantageous if hydrogen is sourced from fossil fuels; however, they become beneficial when implemented as hybrids. There is potential for PEMFCs {{to be used for}} stationary power generation, where they provide 5kW at 30% efficiency; however, they run into competition with other types of fuel cells, mainly SOFCs and MCFCs. Whereas PEMFCs generally require high purity hydrogen for operation, other fuel cell types can run on methane and are thus more flexible systems. Therefore, PEMFCs are best for small scale systems until economically scalable pure hydrogen is available. Furthermore, PEMFCs have the possibility of replacing batteries for portable electronics, though integration of the hydrogen supply is a <b>technical</b> <b>challenge</b> particularly without a convenient location to store it within the device.|$|E
