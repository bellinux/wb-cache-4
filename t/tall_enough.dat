5|$|The volcano {{enters the}} subaerial subphase {{once it is}} <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to escape the water. Now the volcano puts on 95% of its above-water height over roughly 500,000 years. Thereafter eruptions become much less explosive. The lava {{released}} in this stage often includes both pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, and the currently active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea, are in this phase. Hawaiian lava is often runny, blocky, slow, and relatively easy to predict; the USGS tracks where it {{is most likely to}} run, and maintains a tourist site for viewing the lava.|$|E
5|$|Then-Lieutenant Alessandro Guidoni {{proposed}} in 1912 to convert Piemonte into {{an aircraft carrier}} capable of operating seaplanes and fixed-wheel aircraft. His projected reconstruction would have seen an inclined flight deck erected on the aft half of the ship, <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to clear the ships' funnels. The Regia Marina {{were not interested in}} operating wheeled aircraft at sea and so the idea was not pursued. In 1913, the last two of the ship's 6-inch guns were replaced with 4.7-inch guns in another attempt to lighten the ship.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 2001, the Nisqually {{earthquake}} {{rocked the}} 5th Avenue Theatre. At the time, actors were on stage rehearsing the musical 1776. The theatre suffered minimal damages with no structural {{damage from the}} quake. Earthquake repairs included removal and replacement of 72 plaster ceiling supports and the repair of numerous cracks and damaged decorative plaster pieces in the ceiling. Contractors had to install scaffolding <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to reach the highest interior crevice in the ceiling eight stories up—the first time that area had been reached in 75 years. The chandeliers had to be lowered for repair and maintenance. As part of the repair work, Turner Construction provided services for seismic upgrades to the Skinner Building.|$|E

25|$|Like some back pockets, some forward pockets {{are like}} {{medium-sized}} full forwards - <b>tall</b> and strong <b>enough</b> to contest marks, and mobile enough to crumb the ball. Some {{players in this}} mould, such as Russell Robertson, are capable of playing full forward outright.|$|R
50|$|The Paracas Candelabra, {{also called}} the Candelabra of the Andes, is a {{well-known}} prehistoric geoglyph found on the northern face of the Paracas Peninsula at Pisco Bay in Peru. Pottery found nearby has been radio carbon dated to 200 BCE, {{the time of the}} Paracas culture. The design is cut two feet into the soil, with stones possibly from a later date placed around it. The figure is 595 feet <b>tall,</b> large <b>enough</b> to be seen 12 miles at sea.|$|R
5|$|The female may {{be offered}} food by the male during {{courtship}}. He has a brief courtship display {{in which the}} neck is extended and the head held down, the tail is fanned, and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground. He will then attempt to approach the female from behind, and then leap on her back to copulate. The nest is typically in grassland, sometimes in safer sites along a hedge, or near an isolated tree or bush, or in overgrown vegetation. Where grass is not <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> {{at the start of}} the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill. The nest, well hidden in the grass, is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground. It is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants, and lined with finer grasses. Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female, a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest.|$|E
5|$|The first egg {{is often}} laid when the nest {{is little more}} than a pad of grass, and a further egg is laid on each {{subsequent}} day. Both sexes incubate the eggs, which start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to six weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood, but the corn crake usually does. Where grass is not <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> at the start of the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.|$|E

60|$|The youth on whom Shoveloff {{tried to}} turn the laugh of his own discomfiture was a splendid fellow, <b>tall</b> and broad-shouldered <b>enough</b> {{for a man of}} twenty-five, though his smooth and {{youthful}} face suggested sixteen. He had been staring at the fire, regardless {{of what was going on}} around.|$|R
2500|$|When {{alert to}} the {{presence}} of danger, the necks of these bovines are raised as high as possible. They move in a [...] "goatlike" [...] gait, as they move their neck in a pecking motion (moving the head backwards and forewards). As they spot the predator they immediately stop. The ultimate antipredator strategy is concealment in dense, <b>tall</b> bush, <b>enough</b> for the animal to perfectly camouflage in the vegetation. Sometimes they would raise one leg. If that fails they would sprint away in abrupt flight. They are not known to have high stamina for running, although they are known to jump incredibly high.|$|R
40|$|Summary of {{experiments}} {{for the investigation}} of a fire which caused an upward fire spread for over 12 floors through balconies in a high-rise apartment complex is reported. The experiments include indoor tests to obtain fire properties of vertical PMMA fences and outdoor tests with a full scale model of the balcony. The test results suggest significance of the increase of total flame height through merging of flames and cooperative effect of the burning of PMMA fences and combustibles on the balconies for the generation of a <b>tall</b> flame <b>enough</b> to cause ignition on the upper floor...|$|R
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} known examples of companion planting is the growing of rice with Azolla, the mosquito fern, which covers {{the top of a}} fresh rice paddy's water, blocking out any competing plants, as well as fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere for the rice to use. The rice is planted when it is <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to poke out above the azolla. This method has been used for at least a thousand years.|$|E
25|$|Elsie and her {{brothers}} established studios at their family home of Goddendene in Locksbottom, Farnborough after 1901. On the seven acre {{grounds of the}} estate were three large studios, including a metal foundry. In order to work in natural daylight, the siblings arranged for the studios to have walls that could be slid back. The walls were <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> {{that they could be}} utilised during wartime to hang up parachutes to dry.|$|E
25|$|Later on, {{wind tunnel}} study came into its own: the effects of wind on man made {{structures}} or objects needed to be studied when buildings became <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to present large surfaces to the wind, and the resulting forces had to be resisted by the building's internal structure. Determining such forces was required before building codes could specify the required strength of such buildings and such tests continue {{to be used for}} large or unusual buildings.|$|E
50|$|Anphans: The Next's {{original}} form, {{which is}} an analogous to Ultraman Type A and Nexus' Anphans. Because of his incomplete merging, The Next is only 10 meters <b>tall,</b> which was <b>enough</b> to face The One in Reputiria stage. The Next's fighting style {{involves the use of}} brute strength and normal physical attacks. His only ranged attack is , which launches energy blade projection.|$|R
50|$|A {{championship}} pro wrestler, Oshu is a massive, powerful man, {{over two}} meters <b>tall</b> and strong <b>enough</b> to twist I-beams {{out of shape}} with his bare hands. He is not a formal yakuza member, but has very {{close ties to the}} Hakushin Society, as Ryuji Hanada and Shudo Shimazaki looked after him and supported his wrestling career, respectively. He thus bears a grudge against Freeman for their assassinations.|$|R

25|$|In the United States {{most state}} and local laws {{regarding}} the required number and placement of smoke detectors are based upon standards established in NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code. Laws governing the installation of smoke detectors {{vary depending on the}} locality. However, some rules and guidelines for existing homes are relatively consistent throughout the developed world. For example, Canada and Australia require a building to have a working smoke detector on every level. The United States NFPA code cited in the previous paragraph requires smoke detectors on every habitable level and within the vicinity of all bedrooms. Habitable levels include attics that are <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to allow access. Many other countries have comparable requirements.|$|E
25|$|However, {{only certain}} types of {{structures}} are vulnerable to this resonance effect. Taller buildings have their own frequencies of vibration. Those that are six to fifteen stories tall also vibrate at the 2.5-second cycle, making them act like tuning forks {{in the event of}} an earthquake. The low-frequency waves of an earthquake are amplified by the mud of the lakebed, which in turn, is amplified by the building itself. This causes these buildings to shake more violently than the earthquake proper as the earthquake progresses. Many of the older colonial buildings have survived hundreds of years on the lakebed simply because they are not <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to be affected by the resonance effect.|$|E
25|$|Palms inhabit {{a variety}} of ecosystems. More than two-thirds of palm species live in humid moist forests, where some species grow <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to form part of the canopy and shorter ones form part of the understory. Some species form pure stands in areas with poor {{drainage}} or regular flooding, including Raphia hookeri which is common in coastal freshwater swamps in West Africa. Other palms live in tropical mountain habitats above 1000m, {{such as those in}} the genus Ceroxylon native to the Andes. Palms may also live in grasslands and scrublands, usually associated with a water source, and in desert oases such as the date palm. A few palms are adapted to extremely basic lime soils, while others are similarly adapted to extreme potassium deficiency and toxicity of heavy metals in serpentine soils.|$|E
60|$|When the gangway {{was laid}} to the leading ship {{the first man}} who descended to the shore was of {{striking}} appearance. It {{was not so much}} that he was <b>tall</b> and strong <b>enough</b> to have been a worthy foeman to the stoutest colonist in Ericsfiord, as that his demeanour was bland and courtly, while there was great intellectuality in his dark handsome countenance. Unlike most Norsemen, his hair and beard were black and close-curling, and his costume, though simple, was rich in quality.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} true that the queen {{did not live}} in a palace. Her house was nearly {{large enough to hold}} an old-fashioned four-posted bedstead, such as they have at my Aunt Sarah's. The little room that was cut off from the main {{apartment}} was really too small to count. The queen was hard at work, sitting on her door-stone by the side of her bits of sugar-cane and pepper-pods. There were no customers. She was a good-looking old body, about sixty, perhaps, but <b>tall</b> and straight <b>enough</b> for all queenly purposes.|$|R
50|$|Quart was {{a strong}} and <b>tall</b> player, {{powerful}} <b>enough</b> that he could throw the vaqueta ball easily to the galleries (it {{must be taken into}} account that those balls then weighed 32 gr. and were not so fliers as the actual ones). His opponents complained that it was very difficult to get a quinze against him due to his technique. His dau hit was so violent that he was forbidden to play the first dau ball of every quinze so that the rival team could, at least, send the ball back.|$|R
25|$|Unknown to Beast, Belle writes him {{a special}} book which he doesn't see until later on. She also meets Forte {{later on in}} a chance meeting. Forte tells her that Beast's {{favorite}} Christmas tradition was the Christmas tree. Belle becomes frustrated, for no tree she has seen on the grounds has been <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to hang ornaments. Forte lies to Belle, saying that a perfect tree {{can be found in}} the woods beyond the castle. Reluctant to go against Beast's orders that she never leave the castle, Belle leaves nonetheless in order to find the perfect tree. When Belle does not arrive to see Beast's Christmas present to her, he begins to suspect that she isn't there at all. When Cogsworth, having been ordered to retrieve Belle, explains that the household cannot find her, Beast becomes enraged. He goes to Forte to ask for advice, and Forte lies that Belle has abandoned him. Beast manages to find Belle and saves her in time from drowning after she fell through thin ice.|$|E
25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called miter gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A lower gate is taller than an upper gate, because the upper gate only has to be <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to close off the upper pound, while the lower gate {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The upper gate is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the lower gate's height equals the upper gate plus the lock's rise.|$|E
500|$|He {{was only}} [...] {{at the age}} of 14, but a late growth spurt took him to just under six feet, and was {{therefore}} <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to play centre-back as a professional footballer. He was offered an apprenticeship by Portsmouth, but turned it down as he wanted to sign for his local club Stoke City, who initially were not willing to take him on as an apprentice. They only allowed him to train with the 'A' team twice a week as an amateur whilst he initially worked as a plumber's mate, and later as a factory worker at Stone Lotus.|$|E
50|$|The first grenades {{were small}} iron spheres filled with {{gunpowder}} fused with {{a length of}} slow-match, {{roughly the size of}} a baseball. The grenadiers had to be <b>tall</b> and strong <b>enough</b> to hurl these heavy objects far enough so as not to harm themselves or their comrades, and disciplined enough to stand {{at the forefront of the}} fight, light the fuse and throw at the appropriate moment to minimize the ability of an enemy to throw the grenade back. Understandably, such requirements led to grenadiers being regarded as an elite fighting force.|$|R
500|$|Five C-47s of the 375th Troop Carrier Group {{carrying}} the gunners of the 2/4th Field Regiment {{took off from}} Ward's Airfield after the main force and landed at Tsili Tsili. After {{an hour on the}} ground, they set out for Nadzab. Most jumped from the first two aircraft. The next three aircraft dropped equipment, including the dismantled guns. The [...] "pushers out" [...] followed when the aircraft made a second pass over the drop. One Australian injured his shoulder in the drop. The gunners then had to locate and assemble their guns in the <b>tall</b> grass. <b>Enough</b> parts were found to assemble one gun and have it ready for firing within {{two and a half hours}} of dropping, although to maintain surprise they did not carry out registration fire until morning. It took three days to find the missing parts and assemble the other gun. At 1515, two B-17s dropped 192 boxes of ammunition. Their dropping was accurate, but some boxes of ammunition tore away from their parachutes.|$|R

He was not perceived by casting directors as <b>tall</b> or handsome <b>enough</b> for leading roles, but during the late 1950s, Adams had supporting roles in several successful television productions, including one episode of [...] (1958) starring Steve McQueen, and films such as Our Miss Brooks (1956), No Time for Sergeants (1958), Teacher's Pet (1958), and Pillow Talk (1959).|$|R
500|$|Mauna Loa is <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to have {{experienced}} glaciation during the last ice age, 25,000 to 15,000 years ago. Unlike Mauna Kea, on which extensive evidence of glaciation remains even today, Mauna Loa {{was at the time}} and has remained active, having grown an additional [...] in height since then and covering any glacial deposits beneath new flows; strata of that age doesn't occur until at least [...] down from the volcano's summit, too low for glacial growth. Mauna Loa also lacks its neighbor's summit permafrost region, although sporadic ice persists in places. It is speculated that extensive phreatomagmatic activity occurred during this time, contributing extensively to ash deposits on the summit.|$|E
500|$|She soon {{accepted}} {{a larger role}} and became a valet using the stage name Miss Hancock (some weeks spelled [...] "Handcock"), briefly serving as an associate for the tag team of Lenny Lane and Lodi dubbed Standards and Practices. Despite wearing business suits, her character was known to climb {{on top of the}} announcers' table and dance sensually. It was also during this period that she began using what would become her trademark ring entrance: slowly putting her forty-two inch legs through the second tier of ropes, pausing to let the crowd momentarily see her panties. At 5feet 11inches, Keibler was one of few women in professional wrestling <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> to step over the middle of the three ropes that surround the ring.|$|E
500|$|He {{builds a}} palm-leaf hut, which leaks badly until they {{increase}} {{the slope of}} the roof. He shoots a red bird-of-paradise. He supposes the people to be of mixed race.

He learns to live and work [...] "in a semi-horizontal position"; he is the first white man to come to the island. He trades goods for birds-of-paradise; the people do not shoot them with blunt arrows like Aru islanders, but set out fruit as bait on a forked stick, and catch the birds with a noose of cord that hangs from the stick down to the ground, pulling the cord when the bird arrives, sometimes after two or three days.|$|E
