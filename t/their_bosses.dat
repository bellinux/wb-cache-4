5|$|The strike action {{began on}} a local level after postal workers at Royal Mail offices in London and Edinburgh accused <b>their</b> <b>bosses</b> of cutting jobs and services, which they claimed broke the 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement, the {{agreement}} that was struck to end the 2007 strikes, and accused Royal Mail of threatening modernisation of the service. After a series of localised walkouts over the summer months, and after failing to reach an agreement, the CWU opened a national ballot for industrial action in September 2009.|$|E
5|$|Blaster Master has {{two modes}} of {{gameplay}} {{that depends on}} the situation and location of the player. The first mode is where the player controls SOPHIA in a two–dimensional platform mode; the second mode is where the player controls Jason while outside SOPHIA in either the same 2D platform mode or in a top-down perspective. Gameplay in the top-down perspective consists of a series of labyrinths in which players navigate and defeat enemies along the way. Gameplay is non-linear, and players must return to earlier levels in order to advance to later levels in the game. The objective is to complete all eight levels and destroy the mutants and <b>their</b> <b>bosses</b> with various weaponry such as guns, grenades, and special weapons.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the novel, the narrator, and by extension McGregor, treats disorganized workers with scorn; from the miners of Coal Creek, to the downtrodden laborers of Chicago who are shown mastered by <b>their</b> <b>bosses</b> (unlike McGregor, who does not follow this trend). It is when McGregor comes back to Coal Creek to bury his mother and sees the usually jumbled miners marching in step as part of the funeral procession does he have an epiphany that together the workers are a powerful force, to be organized specifically by him. Indeed, this realization is foreshadowed in Chapter 3 of Book I when as a young man he sees a troupe of marching soldiers disperse a rowdy mob of miner's (and, as a consequence, save his family's bakery) during a strike.|$|E
50|$|Outside in the hallway, Larry and Curly accidentally hit Moe {{with two}} long pieces of pipe, {{leading to an}} argument. <b>Their</b> <b>boss</b> {{intervenes}} and as he's yelling at them, he's accidentally struck with the same pipes. The Stooges flee into an adjoining recording room with <b>their</b> <b>boss</b> on <b>their</b> heels. The room is occupied by a bad-tempered Italian baritone singer/violinist (Gino Corrado) and piano player in a session. During the battle with <b>their</b> <b>boss,</b> they end up destroying the singer's glasses and violin.

Dale is a dental assistant being sexually harassed by his boss, Dr. Julia Harris (Aniston); she threatens to tell his fiancee Stacy (Lindsay Sloane) that he had sex with her unless he actually has sex with her. Nick and Dale's accountant friend Kurt Buckman (Sudeikis) enjoys working for Jack Pellitt (Donald Sutherland) at a chemical company, but after Jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack, the company is taken over by Jack's cocaine-addicted son Bobby (Farrell), whose apathy and incompetence threaten the future of the company.|$|E

25|$|The {{mobilisation}} {{of women}} in the war economy always remained limited: the number of women practising a professional activity in 1944 was virtually unchanged from 1939, being about 15million women, in contrast to Great Britain, so that the use of women did not progress and only 1,200,000 of them worked in the arms industry in 1943, in working conditions that were difficult and often poorly treated by <b>their</b> <b>bosses,</b> who deplored their lack of qualification.|$|E
25|$|In the Calcutta {{scene of}} {{the mid to late}} nineteenth century, Ramakrishna was opinionated on the subject of Chakri. Chakri can be {{described}} as a type of low-paying servitude done by educated men—typically government or commerce-related clerical positions. On a basic level, Ramakrishna saw this system as a corrupt form of European social organisation that forced educated men to be servants not only to <b>their</b> <b>bosses</b> at the office but also to their wives at home. What Ramakrishna saw as the primary detriment of Chakri, however, was that it forced workers into a rigid, impersonal clock-based time structure. He saw the imposition of strict adherence to each second on the watch as a roadblock to spirituality. Despite this, however, Ramakrishna demonstrated that Bhakti could be practised as an inner retreat to experience solace in the face of Western-style discipline and often discrimination in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{a report}} by {{journalist}} Natalia Antelava, doctors reported that the Ministry of Health told doctors they must perform surgical sterilizations on women. One doctor reported, “It's ruling number 1098 and it says that after two children, in some areas after three, a woman should be sterilized.”, {{in a loss of}} the former surface decency of Central Asian mores in regard of female chastity. In 2010, the Ministry of Health passed a decree stating all clinics in Uzbekistan should have sterilization equipment ready for use. The same report also states that sterilization is to be done on a voluntary basis with the informed consent of the patient. In the 2010 Human Rights Report of Uzbekistan, there were many reports of forced sterilization of women along with allegations of the government pressuring doctors to sterilize women in order to control the population. Doctors also reported to Antelava that there are quotas they must reach every month on how many women they need to sterilize. These orders are passed on to them through <b>their</b> <b>bosses</b> and, allegedly, from the government.|$|E

500|$|... 34,000 {{members of}} the Civil Guards and 17,000 Assault Guards {{enforced}} security on election day, many freed from their regular posts by the carabineros. Six people were killed during the elections, and perhaps another 30 injured. Ballots were generally fair and {{in accordance with the}} 1931 constitution, although three cases of electoral fraud occurred. The first was in Galicia, in north-west Spain, and orchestrated by the incumbent government; [...] there also, in A Coruña, by the political left. The voting in Granada was forcibly (and unfairly) dominated by the government. In some villages, the police stopped anyone not wearing a collar from voting. Wherever the Socialists were poorly organised, farm workers continued to vote how they were told by <b>their</b> <b>bosses</b> or caciques. Similarly, some right-wing voters were put off from voting in strongly socialist areas. However, such instances were comparatively rare. The first results to be released, in the evening of the 14, from urban areas, were encouraging for the Popular Front.|$|E

When the two men's wives arrive in London on a surprise shopping trip, the two men fear the game is up. They confess to <b>their</b> <b>boss</b> about the real nature of the potion, and the trials they have been conducting at Effingham. When the three men go to Effingham they discover the army are now demolishing the old huts, and the remaining potion is destroyed by accident. Coombes now threatens them with the sack, threatening to reveal to their wives what they have been doing, unless they can recreate the formula by endless testing of various chemicals to find the magic ingredient.|$|R

2500|$|In 2011 states faced {{a growing}} fiscal {{crisis and the}} Republicans had made major gains in the 2010 elections. Public sector unions came under heavy attack {{especially}} in Wisconsin, as well as Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio from conservative Republican legislatures. Conservative state legislatures tried to drastically reduce the abilities of unions to collectively bargain. [...] Conservatives argued that public unions were too powerful since they helped elect <b>their</b> <b>bosses,</b> and that overly generous pension systems were too heavy a drain on state budgets.|$|E

Luna did not follow the warnings and was reportedly turned in to the authorities by other members.
