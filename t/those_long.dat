25|$|Despite {{the great}} fanfare {{surrounding}} {{her return to}} the Met in early 1951, and her success in resuming her roles there, Flagstad decided {{that it would be}} her final year singing Wagner on the stage. She had gained quite a bit of weight since her pre-war years at the Met when she sang <b>those</b> <b>long</b> and physically demanding roles night after night. In 1950, when she accepted Bing's invitation, she felt she did not have the stamina she had had as a younger woman. She had also developed an arthritic hip in mid-1951 (and had to consult doctors in New York); this further made the operatic stage difficult for her, especially when singing Wagner. She gave her farewell operatic performance at the Met on 1 April 1952, not as Brünnhilde or Isolde but in the title role of Gluck's Alceste, a role she had learnt in the war years in Norway. In London she appeared as Dido (another recently learnt role) in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas at the Mermaid Theatre (in the 1951 Festival of Britain season): the portrayal was recorded (in studio), and issued by EMI in January 1953 (see: Recordings). Her last operatic appearance was as Dido in Oslo on June 5, 1953.|$|E

[...] IGN's Travis Fickett rated [...] "Beach Games" [...] 8.5/10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. Like West, he highlighted Stanley for praise, and also liked Helms being trapped on the lake. Fickett concluded that [...] "while this episode's closing scene doesn't have the impact of Jim telling Pam {{he was in love with}} her at the end of Season 2, it is one of <b>those</b> <b>long</b> awaited moments that we knew was coming. And Jenna Fischer, as Pam, handles it perfectly. Once again the Scranton branch is facing some big changes, and the show has us eagerly awaiting the season finale." ...|$|E

[...] Schmid continued, [...] "I thought Evans did a really good job. Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he {{did a very good job}} of stepping up to Pável. When you look at the 90 minutes, it was a rare occasion that he was able to hit a ball behind our defense." [...] Chicago midfielder Logan Pause commented on the game saying, [...] "It’s disappointing. We came here to win. We were under the gun all night. They’re a great team, one of the best in the league. It was a great atmosphere and home field advantage. The better team won tonight unfortunately." ...|$|E

Reviewer Jim Farber said that the lyrics [...] "provide a new blend of metal and remnants of alt-rock."

[...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said that, although Korn [...] "deny they're metal", they [...] "nevertheless demonstrate that the essence of metal ... is self-obliterating volume and self-aggrandizing display."

500|$|As {{neither side}} had {{established}} a winning lead in the series, the final match at The Oval was to be played to a finish, {{no matter how long}} it took. England scored a record team total of 903runs and Australia were heavily defeated. Verity, one of five Yorkshire players in the team, bowled 12overs in the game and took two wickets. He also played a part in the achievement of Len Hutton, who scored 364runs, breaking the record for the highest individual innings in a Test match. As Hutton's innings began to assume epic proportions, Verity stayed with him throughout the intervals, helping him to maintain concentration. On the Sunday of the match, when there was no play, Verity arranged for Hutton to have a break by the sea to relax away from cricket. Hutton commented: [...] "I owe [...] the kind of debt that one can never fully repay... His quiet, natural dignity was an immense source of strength to me throughout <b>those</b> <b>long</b> hours". The series was drawn; Verity took 14wickets at an average of 25.28, finishing second in the England bowling averages, behind Bowes. However, Charlie Barnett, who played in the series but disliked Hammond, believed that Hammond's poor tactical use of Verity cost England potential victories in the second and fourth Tests. Verity played no other representative cricket that season, but appeared once more against the Australians for H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's team which defeated the tourists by 10 wickets.|$|E

2500|$|Alexander Sliwinski from Joystiq {{gave the}} game a perfect score.

[...] He also described the game as [...] "the redemption song of the developer BioWare". Adam Beck from Hardcore Gamer also awarded Inquisition a perfect score, saying that while [...] "the artistic and visual fidelity help with immersion, it's the branching, player driven storyline and exquisitely layered combat system" [...] that make the game special. Philip Kollar from Polygon gave the game a 9.5/10. He praised the well-written characters, engrossing plot cliffhangers, tightly-connected story, {{as well as the}} combat system, as he described it as [...] "a smart blend of the combat systems from Origins and Dragon Age 2 which makes <b>those</b> <b>long</b> stretches exploring the wilderness fun." [...] Joe Juba from Game Informer also gave the game a 9.5/10. He praised the detailed environments, character models and spell effects, excellent voice acting and soundtracks, responsive combat and high replay value, but criticizing the disappointing center story arc, lack of a storage chest and multiple weapons sets, as well as some minor crashes and audio bugs. However, he still stated that [...] "With the mixture of open-world exploration, entertaining combat, and top-tier characters, the team at BioWare has found a winning formula that isn't shackled to either Dragon Age: Origins or Dragon Age II. Inquisition is not defined by the traditions it returns to, but by the new directions it forges for this magnificent fantasy universe." ...|$|E
