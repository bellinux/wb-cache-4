40|$|Some years ago(2) {{the cross}} between Oenothera Lamarckiana and Oe. rubricalyx (Afterglow) {{was used to}} {{demonstrate}} the mode of inheritance of a character linked to <b>the</b> balanced zygotic <b>lethals</b> of Oe.

5|$|There {{are three}} types of {{coloured}} insect, and {{three types of}} pesticide, which will either kill, stun, or {{have no effect on}} the insects. The player can only carry one type of pesticide at a time; during {{the early stages of the}} game <b>the</b> <b>lethal</b> pesticide can be carried at all times, but later stages have more than one type of insect on screen at once, making the choice of pesticide more tactical.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>lethal</b> {{second wave}} struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E

5|$|Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally undiluted. <b>The</b> <b>lethal</b> dose for {{an adult}} human is 30mg/kg, which is about 2.1–2.4grams for a human {{weighing}} 70 to 80kg (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic {{in the presence of}} selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. The toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, through which it denaturates proteins (including enzymes).|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than <b>the</b> <b>lethal</b> radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of vinylidene chloride (VDC) was studied in {{mice and rats}} exposed to various concentrations of the vapors for 23 hr/day. In addition, the ability of various treatments to alter parameters of toxicity was evaluated. Mice were more sensitive than rats both to <b>the</b> acute <b>lethal</b> and hepatotoxic effects of VDC. Disulfiram treatment reduced <b>the</b> acute <b>lethal</b> and hepatotoxic effects of inhaled VDC and reduced the levels of covalent bound radioactivity in the liver and kidney after the intraperitoneal administration of 14 C-VDC.

Sixty percent of <b>the</b> <b>lethals</b> studied can survive to adulthood in combination with normal tissue in mosaics, whereas the remainder cause the death of such mosaic animals. Some of <b>the</b> gynandromorph-viable <b>lethals</b> appeared to be locally active, in that they allowed the survival of only those mosaics in which the male tissue was present in the abdomen. The regions affected by these lethals were identified more precisely by analysis of the tissue distributions in the surviving gynandromorphs...|$|R
5|$|One night, a cargo {{aircraft}} {{from the}} kingdom of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley. Its sole passenger, Princess Lastelle of Pejite, pleads with Nausicaä to destroy the cargo and dies. The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior, one of <b>the</b> <b>lethal</b> humanoid bioweapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire. Tolmekia, a military state, seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was attacked by mutant insects and crashed.

5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g sodium fluoride, or 32–64mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} lethal dose for adults. One-fifth of <b>the</b> <b>lethal</b> dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excess consumption {{may lead to}} skeletal fluorosis, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Diệm regime in a coup on 1 November 1963, Đặng Sỹ faced a trial held under a {{government}} led by Nguyễn Khánh. Some of the accusations were that Sy's men had fired on the crowd and crushed the victims with armoured cars, or that the grenades had been launched at his orders and caused the deaths. Sy later reportedly revealed that Archbishop Thục had personally given him the order to shoot the Buddhists but refused to testify against Thục, who was by that time living in exile in Rome. Sy was sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to compensate the victims' families. His lawyer contended that the court had been unable to establish the nature and source of <b>the</b> <b>lethal</b> explosions. The Defense Minister, General Trần Thiện Khiêm, a Catholic who had helped Khánh in his January 1964 coup, later claimed Khánh had rigged the trial to gain Quang's support, and released Sy from prison; Sy later emigrated to the United States. In 1970, the Saigon-based Catholic newspaper, Hòa Bình ran a story claiming that CIA agents had used a secret new explosive to foment trouble for Diệm's regime whose relations with the United States were deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Lindemann {{may have}} left his combat {{position}} when the ship's controls were rendered inoperable, and prior to <b>the</b> <b>lethal</b> {{hit on the}} command position, {{in order to give}} the command to abandon the ship. The surviving Matrose Paul Hillen—who had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle, stated that he had seen a group of 20–30 people standing at the bow, among them a man with a white peaked cap. Normally on a German naval vessel at sea, a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer. In addition, the surviving Maschinengefreiter—Rudolf Römer, who at the time was already in the water—claimed that he had seen Lindemann standing on the bow, near Bismarcks forward 38cm turret, Anton. He was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going under with the ship.|$|E
5|$|In poor conditions, {{the weight}} of the adrenal gland may {{increase}} up to 200%, and rice rats are unable to conserve water well when dehydrated, and in water contaminated with oil, they swim less and their mortality increases. The median amount of radiation needed to kill a marsh rice rat is 5.25Gy and <b>the</b> <b>lethal</b> dose of potassium cyanide is 7.20mg/kg; both values are relatively low for cricetid rodents. In one study, wild rice rats in radioactively contaminated areas did not show signs of disease. Exposure to more daylight and higher food availability cause increased development of the gonads in both adult and juvenile rice rats. When the pineal gland is removed or melatonin is administered in male rice rats, the testes are reduced and tend to regress into the body.|$|E
