40|$|Attempts to {{optimize}} the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) obtained from spoiled gradient echo MRI {{have focused on the}} properties of the magnetization <b>transfer</b> <b>pulse.</b> In particular, continuous-wave models do not explicitly account for the effects of excitation and relaxation on the MTR. In this work, these were modeled by an approximation of free relaxation between the radiofrequency pulses and of an instantaneous saturation event describing the magnetization <b>transfer</b> <b>pulse.</b> An algebraic approximation of the signal equation can be obtained for short pulse repetition time and small flip angles. This greatly facilitated the mathematical treatment and understanding of the MTR. The influence of inhomogeneous radiofrequency fields could be readily incorporated. The model was verified on the human brain in vivo at 3 T by variation of flip angle and pulse repetition time. The corresponding range in MTR was similar to that observed by a 4 -fold increase of magnetization <b>transfer</b> <b>pulse</b> power. Choice of short pulse repetition time and larger flip angles improved the MTR contrast and reduced the influence of radiofrequency inhomogeneity. Optimal contrast is obtained around an MTR of 50 %, and noise progression is reduced when a high reference signal is obtained...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the {{progression}} of ischemia, pH is important and is essential in elucidating the association between metabolic disruption, lactate formation, acidosis and tissue damage. Chemical exchange-dependent saturation transfer (CEST) imaging {{can be used to}} detect tissue pH and, in particular, a specific form of CEST magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), termed amide proton transfer (APT) MRI, which is sensitive to pH and can detect ischemic lesions, even prior to diffusion abnormalities. The critical parameter governing the ability of CEST to detect pH is the sequence. In the present study, a novel strategy was used, based on the gradient echo sequence (GRE), which involved the insertion of a magnetization <b>transfer</b> <b>pulse</b> in each repetition time (TR) and minimizing the TR for in vivo APT imaging. The proposed GRE-APT MRI method was initially verified using a tissue‑like pH phantom and optimized MRI parameters for APT imaging. In order to assess the range of acute cerebral infarction, rats (n= 4) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and MRI scanning at 7 telsa (T). Hyperacute ischemic tissue damage was charac-terized using multiparametric imaging techniques, including diffusion, APT and T 2 -Weighted MRI. By using a magnetiza-tion <b>transfer</b> <b>pulse</b> and minimizing TR, GRE-APT provided high spatial resolution and a homogeneous signal, with clearly distinguished cerebral anatomy. The GRE-APT and diffusion MRI were significantly correlated with lactate content and the area of cerebral infarction in the APT and apparent diffu-sion coefficient (ADC) maps matched consistently during the hyperacute period. In addition, compared with the infarction area observed on the ADC MRI map, the APT map contained tissue, which had not yet been irreversibly damaged. Therefore, GRE-APT MRI waa able to detect ischemic lactic acidosis with sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution, suggesting the potential use of pH MRI as a surrogate imaging marker of impaired tissue metabolism for the diagnosis and prognosis of hyperacute stroke...|$|E

40|$|AbstractChinese hamster ovary (CHO) {{cells in}} {{suspension}} {{were subjected to}} pulsed electric fields suitable for electrically mediated gene <b>transfer</b> (<b>pulse</b> duration longer than 1 ms). Using the chemiluminescence probe lucigenin, we showed that a generation of reactive-oxygen species (oxidative jump) was present when the cells were electropermeabilised using millisecond pulses. The oxidative jump yield was controlled by the extent of alterations allowing permeabilisation within the electrically affected cell area, but showed a saturating dependence on the pulse duration over 1 ms. Cell electropulsation induced reversible and irreversible alterations of the membrane assembly. The oxidative stress was only present when the membrane permeabilisation was reversible. Irreversible electrical membrane disruption inhibited the oxidative jump. The oxidative jump was not a simple feedback effect of membrane electropermeabilisation. It strongly controlled long-term cell survival. This had {{to be associated with}} the cell-damaging action of reactive-oxygen species. However, for millisecond-cumulated pulse duration, an accumulation of a large number of short pulses (microsecond) was extremely lethal for cells, while no correlation with an increased oxidative jump was found.

By computer simulation of a stochastic version of Hodgkin-Huxley model with detailed description of ion channel random gating, and analytically solve a bistable neuron model that mimic the action potential generation with a particle crossing the barrier of a double well, we find optimal number of ion channels that maximize energy efficiency for a neuron. We also investigate the energy efficiency of neuron population in which input pulse signals are represented with synchronized spikes and read out with a downstream coincidence detector neuron. We find an optimal combination of the number of neurons in neuron population and the number of ion channels in each neuron that maximize the energy efficiency. The energy efficiency depends on the characters of the input signals, e. g., the pulse strength and the inter-pulse intervals. We argue that trade-off between reliability of signal transmission and energy cost may influence the size of the neural systems if energy use is constrained. Comment: 22 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
