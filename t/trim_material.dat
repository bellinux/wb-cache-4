40|$|This paper {{presents}} a rigid walled car cabin model {{to predict the}} acoustic effects of vehicle interior <b>trim</b> <b>materials.</b> The car cavity is made of a rigid walled enclosure system with one flexible wall on the front firewall position, where the interior <b>trim</b> <b>materials</b> are applied to the inner surface of the front firewall to modify the coupling between the flexible wall and the cabin air cavity. The car cabin is acoustically excited by using a single point source positioned at {{one corner of the}} inner air cavity to imitate the airborne noise. The propagated noise is measured by using pressure microphones at different locations inside the car cabin: one near the driver&# 039;s ear position and another one near the passenger&# 039;s ear position. An acoustic FE (Finite Element) model is also developed to investigate and predict the effects of interior <b>trim</b> <b>materials</b> on the car cabin noise level. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the experimentally acquired acoustic effects of the interior <b>trim</b> <b>materials.</b> The predicted acoustic response results show that the simulation agrees well with the experiment data, both with and without the interior <b>trim</b> <b>materials.</b> The noise propagating inside the car cabin is reduced by a similar ratio in both the experimental method and in the numerical analysis.

A V-shaped acoustic wave-guide with the two branches forming a 45 degree angle from the horizontal direction was designed to measure the sound absorption coefficient of installed <b>trim</b> <b>materials.</b> The device was also designed for the subjective evaluation and objective psychoacoustic metric target setting of a sound source. The 45 -degree incident angle sound absorption coefficient test device can also be applied to the design of the vehicle interior <b>trim</b> <b>materials</b> or sound package to minimize the negative effect of interior noise. The measurement principle of the 45 -degree incident angle SAC device will be introduced first, and the experiment procedure will be then illustrated.

40|$|September 2003. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 23 - 25) A nighttime {{field study}} was conducted to assess how several attributes of personal safety garments affect pedestrian conspicuity. Three types of ANSI/ISEA 107 - 1999 compliant Class 2 and Class 3 garments, like those frequently worn by road construction workers, were examined. Participants drove an instrumented research vehicle on a closed track, through simulated construction zones with naturalistic sight distances, and indicated when they first detected a pedestrian wearing one of the garments. The independent variables included trim intensity (RA), ANSI/ISEA garment classification/configuration, color of the trim, location of the pedestrian within the work zone, driver age, and driver gender. The distance at which each garment could first be detected served as the measure of garment conspicuity. The results show that garment classification/configuration, trim color, location of the pedestrian, and driver age all had significant effects on the distance at which garments could be detected. Over the ranges examined, neither the intensity nor the amount of <b>trim</b> <b>material</b> affected conspicuity. However, placement of the trim had a significant effect on conspicuity. Specifically, placing retroreflective trim on the arms of a Class 3 jacket, when compared with a Class 3 vest, significantly increased conspicuity of a pedestrian in motion. Nevertheless, any amount of retroreflective trim—regardless of its placement on the garment, color, or intensity—improved detection distance by as much as a factor of 7. 8 when compared with a darkly clad pedestrian...|$|E
40|$|Mitigating {{injury in}} side impact {{has been an}} {{important}} topic of research for decades. In the mid 1980 ’s the American government began a program intended to improve the crashworthiness of vehicles in side impact. This program ultimately led to the introduction of a dynamic side impact test (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 214), which new vehicles must pass, along with a very similar test aimed at consumer awareness (New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) side impact test). The work presented in this thesis involved the study and simulation of these tests to evaluate occupant response in side impact, with a focus on the thoracic response. In the first portion of the work presented here, an in-depth study of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test database was performed. In this study the results of the side impact crash tests of 72 vehicles were examined to understand the general trends seen in this type of testing with regards to vehicle velocity, side intrusion, and occupant injury prediction. A series of average velocity profile curves was created from accelerometer data at 18 measurement points on each vehicle crash tested. Additionally the injury criterion measured by the front seat occupant was plotted against several vehicle variables (such as mass and occupant arm to door distance) to study the effect these variable had on the injury predicted by the occupant. No single variable was shown to have a strong correlation to injury, although increasing door intrusion distance, peak lateral velocity, the Head Injury Criterion (HIC), and pelvic acceleration were found to positively correlate to thoracic injury. In addition, increasing vehicle model year, vehicle mass, and arm to door (AD) distance showed negative correlations with thoracic injury. Following the survey of the NHTSA database, a finite element model of the NHTSA side impact test was developed. This model included a full scale Ford Taurus model, a NHTSA barrier model and three side impact anthropometric test device (ATD) occupant models, each representing a different 50 th percentile male dummy. Validation of this model was carried out by comparing the simulated vehicle component velocity results to the corridors developed in the NHSTA crash test database study as well as comparing these velocities, the vehicle deformation profile, and the occupant velocity, acceleration and rib deflection to several Ford Taurus crash tests from a similar vintage to the finite element model. As this model was intended as a ‘baseline’ case to study side impact and occupant kinematics in side impact, side airbags were not included in this model. A lack of experimental data and a lack of consensuses within the automotive crash community on the proper method of modeling these devices and their effectiveness in real world impacts also led to their exclusion. Following model validation, a parametric study was carried out to assess the importance of the initial position of the occupant on the vehicle door velocity profile and the predicted occupant injury response. Additionally the effect of the door <b>trim</b> <b>material</b> properties, arm rest properties and the effect of seat belt use were studied. It was found that the lateral position of the occupant had an effect on the door velocity profile, while the vertical and longitudinal position did not. The use of seatbelts was shown to have no significant effect in these simulations, due to minimal interaction between the restraint system and occupant during side impact. Furthermore, there was a general decreasing trend in the injury predicted as the initial position of the occupant was moved further inboard, down and forward in the vehicle. Stiffer interior trim was found to improve the injury prediction of the occupant, while changing the material of the foam door inserts had no effect. It was found that in general the occupant remained in position, due to the inertia of the occupant, while the seat began moving towards the centerline of the vehicle. Future considerations could include more advanced restraint systems to couple the occupant more effectively to the seat, or to develop side interior trim that engages the occupant earlier to reduce the relative velocity between the occupant and intruding door. Overall, the model correlated well with experimental data and provided insight into several areas which could lead to improved occupant protection in side impact. Future work should include integrating side airbags into the model, widening the focus of the areas of injury to include other body regions and integrating more detailed human body models...|$|E

Alpha cabin and impedance tube were used to measure the random and normal sound absorption coefficients respectively. The computer model based on SEA method was then validated with the experiment in order to obtain correlation between simulation and measurement.

40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry indoor air quality or Vehicle Indoor Air Quality (VIAQ) are caused by various substances emitted from interior materials inside a vehicle. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are an example of emitted substances from the interior materials which is harmful to the human body. As stated by previous researches, {{there is a strong}} correlation between the total VOCs emission and interior temperature. This occurs due to the solar radiation through the back window glasses, windscreen and side window glasses.
