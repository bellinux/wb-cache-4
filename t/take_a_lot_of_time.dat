2500|$|Dale Sheets and Universal Studios. Patterson, Gimlin, and DeAtley {{screened}} {{the film}} for Dale Sheets, {{head of the}} Documentary Film Department, and unnamed technicians [...] "in the special effects department at Universal Studios in Hollywood ... Their conclusion was: 'We could try (faking it), but {{we would have to}} create a completely new system of artificial muscles and find an actor who could be trained to walk like that. It might be done, but we {{would have to say that}} it would be almost impossible.'" [...] A more moderate version of their opinion was, [...] "if it is , it's a very good one—a job that would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and money to produce." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{units and}} {{structures}} belong {{to one of}} four technology tiers, or [...] "Tech" [...] levels, each tier being stronger and/or more efficient than the previous. Certain lower-tier structures can be upgraded into higher ones without having to rebuild them. The first tier {{is available at the}} start of the game and consists of small, relatively weak units and structures. The second tier expands the player's abilities greatly, especially in terms of stationary weapons and shielding, and introduces upgraded versions of tier one units. The third tier level has very powerful assault units designed to overcome the fortifications of the most entrenched player. The fourth tier is a limited range of [...] "experimental" [...] technology. These are usually massive units which <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and energy to produce, but provide a significant tactical advantage.|$|E

2500|$|San Francisco {{responded with}} an 8-play, 72-yard drive to score on Brodie's 26-yard {{touchdown}} pass to tight end Dick Witcher and cut the score to 17–10 going into the fourth quarter, but they were shut out {{for the rest of}} the game. [...] They nearly got a big scoring chance when Thomas fumbled the ball, but receiver Reggie Rucker recovered it, allowing Dallas to keep possession and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> off the clock with a drive to the 49ers 17-yard line. [...] Clark missed a field goal attempt from there, giving San Francisco a chance to drive for the tying touchdown, but the farthest they could make it was to the Dallas 39, and after Renfro broke up a third down pass, Gossett missed a field goal from 47 yards out, and 49ers would not threaten to score again.|$|E

Because in practice, we focus on testing efficiency far higher than training efficiency. In fact, the convolution neural network {{that we want to}} learn later reaches the other extreme in this trade-off: although the training <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time, once the training is completed, the classification of new test data is very fast. Such a model is in line with the actual use of the requirements.|$|R

5000|$|The {{game was}} {{considered}} {{much more difficult}} than its prequel, relying on perfectly timed and aimed jumps (the player is able to choose five [...] "strengths" [...] of jump) in order to progress, and enjoyed much less commercial success.

5000|$|This {{method is}} mathematically correct {{and has the}} {{advantage}} that a small CPU may perform the multiplication by using the shift and add features of its arithmetic logic unit rather than a specialized circuit.
