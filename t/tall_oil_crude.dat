40|$|Development {{of new and}} {{innovative}} products through efficient technologies {{is essential for the}} implementation of sustainable developments in highly competitive chemical industries. Based on this context, raw materials originating from biomass have been widely used for the production of chemicals and materials. Steam cracking of bio-based or renewable feedstocks in a conventional steam cracking set-up is identified as a promising approach for the sustainable production of base-chemicals. In a two-step process for the production of base-chemicals, firstly, bio-derived feedstock is upgraded into a more suitable feedstock which comprises mainly paraffin range hydrocarbons with a lower oxygen content than the original feedstock; secondly, the upgraded feedstock is converted into base-chemicals by conventional steam cracking technology. This research work identifies wood-derived <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> as a potential feedstock for the production of base-chemicals by catalytic upgrading and steam cracking methods. The main aim of this work was to carry out the catalytic hydrotreating of <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> feedstocks such as <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> fatty acid (TOFA), distilled <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (DTO) and <b>crude</b> <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (CTO) on a commercial, sulfided NiMo catalyst at different process conditions.
