5|$|Habitat {{protection}} and management {{is seen as}} the most important element for the conservation of Triturus newts. This includes preservation of natural water bodies, reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use, control or eradication of introduced predatory fish, and the connection of habitats through sufficiently wide corridors of uncultivated land. A network of aquatic habitats in proximity is important to sustain populations, and the creation of new breeding ponds is in general very effective as they are rapidly colonised when other habitats are nearby. In some cases, entire populations have been moved when threatened by development projects, but such translocations need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> planned to be successful. Strict protection of the northern crested newt in the United Kingdom has created conflicts with local development projects; at the same time, the charismatic crested newts are seen as flagship species, whose conservation also benefits a range of other amphibians.|$|E
5|$|The {{disposal}} of military {{equipment and materials}} was also a key priority {{after the end of}} the war. Equipment with civilian uses such as motor vehicles, clothing and housing were urgently needed to counter shortages in the civilian economy. The timing of equipment release had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> planned, however, to avoid harming employment by creating surpluses of manufactured goods. Planning for the {{disposal of}} equipment began in 1943 and the Commonwealth Disposals Commission was established to oversee the sale or destruction of equipment on September 1944. Before the commission was established the Government decided that ex-military equipment would be offered to other government agencies before being made available to the public, that sales to the public were to be made on a 'as is, where is' basis and be processed through existing trade channels or public auction at 'fair market prices' and that payment was to be required in cash. Some special priorities were also established; farmers were to be given priority for motor vehicles, machine tools were to be allocated to ex-servicemen and training colleges and special consideration was to be given to the needs of the Red Cross and other overseas and domestic charitable associations.|$|E

5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|E

25|$|ABC methods {{bypass the}} {{evaluation}} of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered.

Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection.|$|E

30|$|The dual-frequency based RTK {{application}} is mainly limited typically to not longer than 20 Â km. The {{reason is that}} the fast and reliable AR becomes more and more difficult with increased inter-receiver distance due to the distance-dependent atmospheric effects. If the long baseline is involved, these effects have <b>to</b> <b>been</b> <b>carefully</b> modelled usually by setting up the relevant parameters. As a result, the model strength will be very weak and the AR performance degrades.|$|R

25|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxide forming processes {{take place}} when voltage in correct polarity is applied and generates an additional oxide when transients arise. This formation is accompanied with heat and hydrogen gas generation. This is tolerable if the energy {{content of the}} transient is low. However, when a transient peak voltage causes an electric field strength that is too high for the dielectric, it can directly cause a short circuit. An unambiguous and general specification of tolerable transients or peak voltages is not possible. In every case transients arise, the application has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> approved.|$|E

The implementation of cooling air has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> designed so it does not directly interact with the combustion air and process. In some cases, as much as 50% of the inlet air is used as cooling air.

25|$|In {{many cases}} the removal of {{introduced}} species is sufficient to allow {{a return to a}} pre-disturbance state, but generally active management, often in the form of replanting native flora and reintroduction of extirpated fauna is needed to achieve restoration goals. Planting of native species helps to replenish species that were either grazed or out competed. Species of animal can be translocated either from existing populations, or from captive bred populations. These reintroductions need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>carefully</b> managed, particularly in the case of endangered species, where the potential benefits need to be weighed against the possibility of failure. Not all translocations succeed, and {{it may be necessary to}} help the reintroduced animals along with supplementary feeding or other kinds of management.|$|E
