30|$|The {{results provide}} partial support for our {{hypothesis}} that increasing spreading activation in emotional memory networks {{would be associated}} with greater changes in heart rate and skin conductance due to the cumulative effect of an increasing number of somatic markers being activated. Both the number of emotional memory words and <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of <b>the</b> memories were significantly correlated with changes in heart rate and skin conductance. However, there were some differences between the happy and sad conditions as well as between the number of emotional memory words and <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of <b>the</b> memories. Specifically, there was a significant positive relationship between the number of happy word memories and heart rate but a significant negative relationship between the number of happy word memories and skin conductance. No significant relationships were found between the number of sad word memories and either heart rate or skin conductance. However, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of <b>the</b> sad word memories was significantly positively correlated with skin conductance, but not with heart rate. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of <b>the</b> happy word memories was not significantly correlated with either skin conductance or heart rate.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} cell age model forPenicillium chrysogenum fed-batch {{cultivation}} to supply a qualitative insight into morphology-associated dynamics. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> of <b>the</b> segregated cell populations, such as growing cells, non-growing cells and intact productive cells, were estimated by this model.

For simulations, no additional effort was needed for parameter identification since the cell age model has no internal parameters. Validation of the combined model was performed by 20 charges of industrial-scale penicillin cultivation. Meanwhile, only two charge-dependent parameters were required in the combined model among approximately 20 parameters in total. The model is thus easily transformed into an adaptive model for a further application in on-line state variables prediction and optimal schedulin...|$|R

5|$|Khitan {{marriage}} practices {{differed from}} those of the Han Chinese in several ways. Men from the elite classes tended to marry women from the generation their senior. While this did not necessarily mean {{that there would be a}} large gap in ages between husband and wife, it was often the case. Among the ruling Yelü clan, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> that boys married was sixteen, while <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> that girls married was between sixteen and twenty-two. Although rare, ages as young as twelve were recorded, for both boys and girls. A special variety of polygamy known as sororate, in which a man would marry two or more women who were sisters, was practiced among the Liao elite. Polygamy was not restricted only to sororate, with some men having three or more wives, only some of whom were sisters. Sororate continued throughout the length of the Liao dynasty, despite laws banning the practice. Over the course of the dynasty, the Liao elite moved away from polygamy and towards the Han Chinese system of having one wife and one or more concubines. This was done largely to smooth over the process of inheritance.|$|E
