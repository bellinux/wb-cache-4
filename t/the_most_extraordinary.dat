25|$|Centered along Twentieth Street at Illinois Street, {{the site}} {{contains}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> {{example of an}} historic industrial village still extant in the West. The first locomotive, typewriter, printing press, cable car equipment, the famous battleship Oregon and steel for many of San Francisco's 19th century buildings came from the Potrero.|$|E
25|$|My object {{has been}} to dramatize like the Greeks (a modest phrase!) {{striking}} passages of history, as they did of history & mythology. You will find all this very unlike Shakespeare; and {{so much the better}} in one sense, for I look upon him to be the worst of models, though <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> of writers.|$|E

25|$|Outside Lisbon, {{the church}} and chapter house of the Convent of the Order of Christ at Tomar (designed by Diogo de Arruda) is a major Manueline monument. In particular, the large window of the chapter house, with its fantastic {{sculptured}} organic and twisted rope forms, is one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> achievements of the Manueline style.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his own experience on the whaling ship Acushnet, two actual events served as the genesis for Melville's tale. One was {{the sinking of the}} Nantucket ship Essex in 1820, after a sperm whale rammed her 2,000 miles (3,200km) from the western coast of South America. First mate Owen Chase, one of eight survivors, recorded the events in his 1821 Narrative of <b>the</b> <b>Most</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Pabst (June 11, 1826 – July 15, 1910) was a German-born American cabinetmaker of the Victorian Era. He is {{credited}} with some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> custom interiors and hand-crafted furniture in the United States. Sometimes working in collaboration with architect Frank Furness (1839–1912), he made pieces in the Renaissance Revival, Neo-Grec, Modern Gothic, and Colonial Revival styles. Examples of his work are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.|$|E

It {{was also a}} huge economic step for {{the interior of the}} Cape Colony. For example, by 1870, an eighth of the country's wool exports passed through the Meiringspoort.|$|R
25|$|In Müllerian mimicry an {{advantage}} is gained when unpalatable species resemble each other, {{especially when the}} predator has a good memory for colour (as birds, for instance, do have). Thus one trial may work to dissuade a bird from several species of butterfly which all fly the same 'flag'. Brazilian butterflies provide some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> examples of mimicry, and Müller, Bates and Wallace all had lengthy experience of this. All three traveller-naturalists believed firmly that such systems of mimicry could only come about by means of natural selection, {{and all of them}} wrote about it.|$|E
25|$|In 1802 {{she left}} Drury Lane and {{subsequently}} appeared {{from time to}} time on the stage of the rival establishment, Covent Garden. It was there, on 29 June 1812, that she gave perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> farewell performance in theatre history. She was playing her most famous role, Lady Macbeth, and the audience refused to allow the play to continue {{after the end of the}} sleepwalking scene. Eventually, after tumultuous applause from the pit, the curtain reopened and Siddons was discovered sitting in her own clothes and character — whereupon she made an emotional farewell speech to the audience lasting eight minutes.|$|E
25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as I entered, and they handed me my camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in}} the ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> {{claim by}} the VVS’s Il-2s is that, {{over a period}} of four hours, they {{destroyed}} 240 tanks and in the process virtually wiped out the 17th Panzer Division. On 1 July, the 17th Panzer Division had only one tank battalion (the II./Pz Rgt 39), with 67 tanks, 173 less than claimed destroyed by the VVS. The 17th Panzer Division was not even in the main attack sector, but further south with the 1st Panzer Army's 24th Panzer Corps. The 17th Panzer did not register any abnormal losses due to aircraft in the summer of 1943, and retreated westwards with Army Group South later in the year, still intact.|$|E
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> {{episodes in}} Survival’s history {{took place in}} 1982 {{on the island of}} South Georgia when {{film-maker}} Cindy Buxton (a daughter of Aubrey) and assistant Annie Price were caught up in the Falklands War. The women were filming penguins when the island was invaded, and although Argentine troops never reached their remote location in St Andrew’s Bay, the pair were cut off for almost a month until being rescued by a helicopter from HMS Endurance. Cindy and Annie, who had flown a union jack on a makeshift flagpole at their camp, found a heroes’ welcome awaiting them when they returned to the UK. Their adventures were featured alongside the wildlife in a one-hour film Stranded on South Georgia and they subsequently recounted their experiences in a book Survival: South Atlantic. The programme was re-titled King Penguin: Stranded Beyond the Falklands in the US where it was narrated by Orson Welles and received an Emmy Award nomination in 1983.|$|E
25|$|The Norman Hauteville family, {{who were}} {{descendants}} of Vikings, came to appreciate and admire {{the rich and}} layered culture in which they now found themselves. And they began implementing their own culture, customs, and politics in the region. Many Normans in Sicily also adopted some of the attributes of Muslim rulers and their Byzantine subjects in dress, language, literature, {{and even in the}} presence of palace eunuchs and, according to some accounts, a harem. The court of Roger II became the most luminous centre of culture in the Mediterranean, both from Europe and the Middle East, like the multi-ethnic Caliphate of Córdoba, then only just eclipsed. This attracted scholars, scientists, poets, artists, and artisans of all kinds. Laws were issued {{in the language of the}} community to whom they were addressed in Norman Sicily, still with heavy Arab and Greek influence. The governance was by the rule of law, so there was justice. Muslims, Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and Normans worked together to form a society that historians have said created some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> buildings that the world has ever seen.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, she {{was again}} {{selected}} by the World Economic Forum as a Young Global Leader (YGL). The Forum of Young Global Leaders is a newly formed, unique, multi-stakeholder community of <b>the</b> world’s <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> leaders who are 40 years old or younger and {{who are ready to}} dedicate their time and energy to jointly work towards a better future.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> thing <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> was to {{hear the}} culprit defend himself from the {{imputation}} of his virtues, {{as if they had}} been the blackest offences. He extenuated the superior cultivation of his country. He denied its population. He endeavored to prove that he had often sent back the poor peasant that sought shelter with him.--I can make no observation on this.|$|R

500|$|The {{historian}} Lizanne Henderson {{described the}} events surrounding {{the case of the}} Pittenweem witches as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> and truly horrific outbursts of witch persecution". It was the last significant spate of witch hunting in Fife.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective reviews {{have been}} favourable.

He finished by calling the episode [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> in Doctor Whos long history". Walker ranked the story as his fifth-favourite episode of the fourth series: between [...] "Silence in the Library" [...] and [...] "Midnight".|$|E

500|$|In December 2011 BART {{adopted a}} new [...] "Cell Service Interruption Policy" [...] that only allows {{shutdowns}} of cell phone services within BART facilities [...] "in <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> circumstances that threaten {{the safety of}} District passengers, employees {{and other members of}} public, the destruction of District property, or the substantial disruption of public transit service". According to a spokesperson for BART, under the new policy the wireless phone system would not be turned off under circumstances similar to those in August 2011. Instead police officers would arrest individuals who break the law.|$|E
500|$|Scholars, {{including}} Patrick F. Quinn and John J. McAleer, {{have noted}} parallels between Herman Melville's Moby-Dick and The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket and other Poe works. Quinn {{noted that there}} were enough similarities that Melville must have studied Poe's novel and, if not, it would be [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> accidents in literature". McAleer noted that Poe's short story [...] "The Fall of the House of Usher" [...] inspired [...] "Ahab's flawed character" [...] in Moby-Dick. Scholar Jack Scherting also noted similarities between Moby-Dick and Poe's [...] "MS. Found in a Bottle".|$|E
500|$|The [...] boat {{journey to}} South Georgia, {{described}} by polar historian Caroline Alexander {{as one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary</b> feats of seamanship and navigation in recorded history, took 17days through gales and snow squalls, in seas which the [...] navigator, Frank Worsley, described as a [...] "mountainous westerly swell". After setting off on 24 April 1916 [...] with just the barest navigational equipment, they reached South Georgia on 10 May 1916. Shackleton, in his later account of the journey, recalled Crean's tuneless singing at the tiller: [...] "He always sang when he was steering, and nobody ever discovered what the song was... but somehow it was cheerful".|$|E
5000|$|Anne Frank A Tale of Two Sisters This new {{compelling}} one-hour film {{explores the}} extraordinary tale of Anne Frank and Eva Schloss.

"I {{believe the}} {{friendship}} between the former Hungarian and German players {{can be called}} <b>the</b> world's <b>most</b> <b>extraordinary.</b> We met regularly over years and decades, alternately in Hungary and in Germany.
