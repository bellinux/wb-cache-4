5|$|According to Charles Collins, the {{significance}} of the Elephanta Caves is better understood by studying them in context of ancient and early medieval Hindu literature, {{as well as in the}} context of other Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples on the subcontinent. The historic Elephanta artwork were inspired by <b>the</b> <b>mythology,</b> concepts and spiritual ideas found in the Vedic texts on Rudra and later Shiva, the epics, the Puranas and the Pashupata Shaivism literature corpus of Hinduism composed by the 5th-century. The panels reflect the ideas and stories widely accepted and well known to the artists and cave architects of India by about 525 CE. <b>The</b> <b>mythology</b> varies significantly in these texts and has been much distorted by later interpolations, but the Elephanta Cave panels represent the narrative version most significant in the 6th century. The panels and artwork express through their eclecticism, flux and motion the influence of Vedic and post-Vedic religious thought on Hindu culture in mid 1st millennium CE.|$|E

The creative team kept Helen's true motivations a secret to Vaugier, which the actress enjoyed because it allowed her to play the character as if there were no ulterior motives.|$|E

5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} companies do send scientists {{all over the}} world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use. The appearance of The Smoking Man in a stand-alone episode is unusual, as Chris Carter did not like mixing <b>the</b> <b>mythology</b> and stand-alone episodes. Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode so close to the release of the similarly-themed movie Outbreak. In the end, however, they realized that the two entities were separate and stood on their own.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Ardhanarishvara {{images are}} dated to the Kushan period, {{starting from the}} first century CE. Its iconography evolved and was perfected in the Gupta era.

While Ardhanarishvara remains a popular iconographic form found in most Shiva temples throughout India, very few temples are dedicated to this deity.|$|E

A Creature of Light and a Creature of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, they have always been male.|$|E

Historians and commentators conclude that Rommel remains an ambiguous figure, not easily definable either inside or outside the myth.|$|E

5|$|In {{developing}} <b>the</b> <b>mythology</b> {{behind the}} film, the creators used many inspirations.

Viewers are told that the Blair Witch is, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman banished from the Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1785. The directors incorporated {{that part of the}} legend, along with allusions to the Salem witch trials and Arthur Miller's 1953 play The Crucible, to play on the themes of injustice done on those who were called witches.|$|E
