5|$|Attendees {{under the}} age of {{majority}} are commonly allowed to attend with a notarized parental permission slip or accompanied by an adult. Eurofurence is one exception, only admitting those above 18. Underage attendees are usually given a distinctive badge to allow staff and dealers to restrict access <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> content. Government-issued photo ID is usually required.|$|E
5|$|Females {{grow faster}} than males overall, {{and must be}} larger <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> sexually. In most populations males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 2–4years old, and females at 6–10. Size and age at maturity increase with latitude; at {{the northern edge of}} their range, males reach sexual maturity at 7–9years of age and females at 11–16.|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} maturing theory opens {{an important}} macro perspective within the {{new paradigm of}} work-integrated learning. Especially wikis are interesting socio-technical systems <b>to</b> foster <b>maturing</b> activities by overcoming typical barriers. But so far, the theory has been mainly based on anecdotal evidence collected from various projects and observations. In this paper, we want to present {{the results of a}} qualitative and quantitative study of Wikipedia with respect <b>to</b> <b>maturing</b> phenomena, identifying instruments and measures indicating maturity. The findings, generalized to enterprise wikis, open the perspective on what promotes maturing on a method level and what can be used <b>to</b> spot <b>maturing</b> processes on a technology level...|$|R
5|$|Flea larvae {{emerge from}} the eggs to feed on any {{available}} organic material such as dead insects, faeces, conspecific eggs, and vegetable matter. In laboratory studies, some dietary diversity seems necessary for proper larval development. Blood-only diets allow only 12% of larvae <b>to</b> <b>mature,</b> whereas blood and yeast or dog chow diets allow almost all larvae <b>to</b> <b>mature.</b> Another study also showed that 90% of larvae matured into adults when the diet included nonviable eggs. They are blind and avoid sunlight, keeping to dark, humid places such as sand or soil, cracks and crevices, under carpets and in bedding.|$|E
5|$|Lipizzan horses tend <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> slowly. However, {{they live}} and are active longer than many other breeds, with horses {{performing}} the difficult exercises of the Spanish Riding School well into their 20s and living into their 30s.|$|E
5|$|The Finnhorse is slower <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> than lighter breeds, {{and thus}} usually enters harness racing {{competition}} {{at the age of}} four. However, its build withstands competition better than light trotters, and the breed's effective competition career can be very long. The Finnish harness racing bylaws allow Finnhorses to be raced from ages 3 to 16.|$|E
5000|$|Sagesse (literal trans. [...] "Wisdom") is {{a volume}} of French poetry by Paul Verlaine. First {{published}} in 1881 (see 1880), it was important in the symbolist and modernist movements. The subject matter of these poems deals with themes relating <b>to</b> <b>maturing.</b>|$|R

5|$|Additionally, onions may be bred {{and grown}} <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> at smaller sizes. Depending on the mature {{size and the}} purpose for which the onion is used, these may be {{referred}} to as pearl, boiler, or pickler onions, but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species. Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E
5|$|Coastal plants {{begin to}} flower at around {{five years from}} seed, but plants in the Stirling Range take much longer <b>to</b> <b>mature.</b> In one Stirling Range population, only 15% of plants had flowered after eight years. Flowering time is highly variable, but in general it occurs between March and August, with a peak around June. More flowers open during the day than at night.|$|E
5|$|Each canvas {{is mounted}} on two boards of equal width, which have been cut {{vertically}} and appear {{have come from the}} same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood suggests it was felled around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen, and underpainted in white paint. Whether Dürer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.|$|E

50|$|Between 1900 and 1940, {{the young}} forest grew and evolved from {{openings}} to young forest <b>to</b> <b>maturing</b> forest. Each stage in forest development brought different benefits for people, wildlife and plants. Like a community, a forest is healthiest and {{offers the most}} benefits if it contains a variety of ages and species of plants and animals.|$|R
5|$|Fruiting begins {{about six}} weeks after the initial {{inoculation}} on the agar plate, but only when portions of fruit bodies (spines or stem sections) are used as the inoculum to initiate growth; the use of mycelium as the inoculum precludes subsequent fruiting. Mature fruit bodies grow {{very close to the}} initial site of inoculation—within 3mm—and take about 60 days <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> after they first start to form.|$|E
5|$|If Stellenbosch marked Smuts's {{intellectual}} awakening, it {{also was}} where he came <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> socially. Here he began to cast off the shyness and reserve which afflicted him, joining the local militia, becoming {{a regular contributor to}} the college magazine, and becoming leader of the Victoria College debating society. For the first time, in both verbal and literary debate, Smuts began to grapple with the political and social issues facing South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 seeds, {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up {{to a maximum of}} 60. Seeds take five to six weeks <b>to</b> <b>mature.</b> The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. A gust of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E

50|$|Several {{morphological}} features {{distinguish the}} American eel from other eel species. Tesch (1977) described three morphological characteristics which persist through all stages from larvae <b>to</b> <b>maturing</b> eels: {{the total number}} of vertebrae (mean 107.2), the number of myomeres (mean 108.2), and the distance between the origin of the dorsal fin to the anus (mean 9.1% of total length).|$|R

5|$|Occasionally, {{groups may}} split {{up when they}} become so large that {{competition}} for resources is problematic, but even then, members of matrilines tend to stick together. Dominant females procure more food, matings, and supporters. Among olive baboons in Tanzania, high-ranking females give birth at shorter intervals to infants with a higher survival rate, and their daughters tend <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> faster than low-ranking females. However, these high-ranking females also {{appear to have a}} higher probability of miscarriages and some high-ranking matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due to stress on the high-ranking females, although this theory is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses are gonochoric {{and have}} a single, posteriorly-located gonad which is {{associated}} with the coelom. The testis in males and the ovary in females bulges into the gonocoel and the gametes are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the gonoduct to the mantle cavity, which it enters at the gonopore. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> and age and stimulate gamete production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a bottle}} {{conditioned}} beer, FES has been pasteurised to ensure quality consistency since 1948. Since 1950, {{in an attempt}} to recreate the flavour profile of bottle conditioned FES, the beer has been produced by blending fresh FES with 2 per cent FES that has been aged for up to 100 days, which has developed a high lactic acid content. Finally, the beer is allowed <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> in the bottle for 28 days before being sent out for distribution.|$|E

40|$|Hermansky-Pudlak {{syndrome}} (HPS) is a {{group of}} disorders characterized by the malformation of lysosome-related organelles, such as pigment cell melanosomes. Three of nine characterized HPS subtypes result from mutations in subunits of BLOC- 2, a protein complex with no known molecular function. In this paper, we exploit melanocytes from mouse HPS models to place BLOC- 2 within a cargo transport pathway from recycling endosomal domains <b>to</b> <b>maturing</b> melanosomes. In BLOC- 2 -deficient melanocytes, the melanosomal protein TYRP 1 was largely depleted from pigment granules and underwent accelerated recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane and to the Golgi. By live-cell imaging, recycling endosomal tubules of wild-type melanocytes made frequent and prolonged contacts with maturing melanosomes; in contrast, tubules from BLOC- 2 -deficient cells were shorter in length and made fewer, more transient contacts with melanosomes. These results support a model in which BLOC- 2 functions to direct recycling endosomal tubular transport intermediates <b>to</b> <b>maturing</b> melanosomes and thereby promote cargo delivery and optimal pigmentation...|$|R

5|$|Persoonia terminalis {{grows in}} a bushfire-prone habitat, where fire is {{essential}} for many species to regenerate. P.t.terminalis is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed, which lies dormant in the soil. Large numbers of Persoonia seedlings appear after fire. However, rocky outcrop habitat is vulnerable to fires occurring at too-frequent intervals of less than five years, which puts many species that regenerate by seed at risk of local extinction as plants are unable <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> to set seed before the next fire.|$|E

Nausicaä kills several Tolmekian {{soldiers}} in combat, but {{is about to}} be overwhelmed when the Valley's swordsmaster, Lord Yupa, soothes the belligerents. Kushana plans <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> the Giant Warrior and use it to burn the Toxic Jungle. Yupa, however, discovers a secret garden of jungle plants reared by Nausicaä; according to Nausicaä's findings, plants that grow in clean soil and water are not toxic, but the jungle's soil has been tainted by humankind.|$|E

The young bird took {{only two or three}} weeks <b>to</b> <b>mature</b> enough to abandon the nest and land for the water, {{typically}} around the middle of July. The parents cared for their young after they fledged, and adults would be seen swimming with their young perched on their backs. Great auks matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.|$|E
