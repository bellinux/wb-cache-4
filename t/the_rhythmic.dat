5|$|Kathak, a {{classical}} dance form, owes its origin {{to the state}} of Uttar Pradesh. The dance form is connected to classical Hindustani music where <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> nimbleness of the feet is accompanied by either Tabla or Pakhawaj. Four of the six schools of this dance form, Lucknow gharana, Ajrara gharana, Farukhabad gharana and Benares gharana, are situated in Uttar Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The larger, lower pitched gong {{of the two}} {{is called}} the pangandungan by the Maguindanao and the p'nanggisa-an by the Maranao. Played on the musician's right, it {{provides}} the main part, which it predominantly played on the accents of <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> structure.|$|E
5|$|The smaller, higher pitched gong, the thicker of the two, {{is called}} the panentekan by the Maguindanao and the p'malsan or pumalsan by the Maranao. Found on the player’s left, it is mainly played on the weaker double and triple beats of <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> structure, in {{counterpoint}} to the pangandungan's part.|$|E

5|$|During his youth, Lutosławski studied {{piano and}} {{composition}} in Warsaw. His early works {{were influenced by}} Polish folk music. His style demonstrates {{a wide range of}} rich atmospheric textures. He began developing his own characteristic composition techniques in the late 1950s. His music from this period onwards incorporates his own methods of building harmonies from small groups of musical intervals. It also uses aleatoric processes, in which <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> coordination of parts is subject to an element of chance.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{music has}} no set {{compositions}} {{due to its}} concept of rhythmic modes. A rhythmic mode (or designation or genre or pattern) {{is defined as a}} musical unit that binds together the entire five instrument ensemble. By adding together the various rhythms of each instrument, one could create music and by changing one of the rhythms, one could create different music. This is the basis of <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> mode.|$|E
40|$|An often {{neglected}} small treatise, conventionally entitled The Ptolemaean ‘Musica’ (apparently {{dated to}} the Late Antiquity), is translated into the Russian {{for the first}} time. The work is a compilation of various sources, which include <b>the</b> Aristoxenian <b>rhythmics,</b> <b>the</b> Neopythagorean numerology and harmonics {{as well as the}} Ptolemaean geocentric astrology. According to its author the planetary cycles in their unity are closely related to the musical proportions. This approach further allows correlating the planetary rhythms with <b>the</b> musical <b>rhythmics...</b>|$|R

5|$|Magia is a {{collection}} of songs written by Shakira between the ages of 8 and 12, and mainly consists of pop ballads. It was produced by Miguel E. Cubillos and Pablo Tedeschi, and recorded at Aga Studios in Bogotá, when Shakira was 13. A Sony Music Columbia representative said that the recording process was simple and went perfectly fine. But for Shakira, the process was problematic, as she had no ability to decide which tracks would be included and no input into <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> structure or artistic production of the songs.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{performance}} is generally taught orally and through demonstration. Historically, general patterns for taiko were written down, {{such as in}} the 1512 encyclopedia called the Taigensho, but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition is that, from group to group, <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> patterns in a given piece are often performed differently. Furthermore, ethnomusicologist WilliamP. Malm observed that Japanese players within a group could not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening. In Japan, printed parts are not used during lessons.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of the minuet (in F-sharp major) and the trio (in F-sharp minor) continues the overall tension between major and minor. The minuet features a startling harmonic shift: its second half is suddenly interrupted by a fortissimo D-major chord, far remote from the home key, before a chromatic passage leads back to the dominant of C-sharp major. The trio {{is linked to the}} minuet by <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> similarities of their opening motifs.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rhythmic</b> and lyrical {{styles of}} African-American music have deeply {{influenced}} American music at large, distinguishing it from European traditions. Elements from folk idioms {{such as the}} blues and what {{is now known as}} old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Though {{allowing}} such {{a variety}} of rhythms would lead to innumerable patterns, generally one could categorize these rhythmic modes on the basis on various criteria such {{as the number of}} beats in a recurring musical phrase, differences in the melodic and rhythmic groups with the musical phrase, differences in <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> emphasis, and differences in the opening formulas and cadential patterns. For the Maguindanao, three to five typical genres can be distinguished: Duyug, Sinulog, Tidtu, Binalig and Tagonggo. The Maranao on the other hand have only three typical genres—Kapromayas/Romayas, Kapagonor/Onor, and Katitik Pandai/Kapaginandang.|$|E
5|$|Hip hop is a {{cultural}} movement, of which music is a part, along with graffiti and breakdancing. The music is composed of two parts, rapping, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals, and DJing, the production of instrumentation either through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism or beatboxing. Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York City. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc {{is widely regarded as}} the progenitor of hip hop; he brought with him the practice of toasting over the rhythms of popular songs. In New York, DJs like Kool Herc played records of popular funk, disco and rock songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce the songs and keep the crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion breaks (<b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> climax of songs), thus producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over.|$|E

5|$|Such issues made {{attempts}} to codify the compositions {{in a uniform}} manner impossible. An example of this could be found among the Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name for one of <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> modes associated with kangungudan but it has also been used as a term designating a “new” style. Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades ago are now considered “old” even though this is considered a tradition spanning many centuries. These differences could sometimes make discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within it a bit confounding.|$|E
5|$|The lungs possess several {{characteristics}} which {{protect against}} infection. The lung tract is lined by epithelia with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry mucus. This mucociliary clearance {{is an important}} defence system against air-borne infection. The dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air {{are caught in the}} mucosal surface of respiratory passages and are moved up towards the pharynx by <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> upward beating action of the cilia. The lining of the lung also secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete mucus which also contains several antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidates. In addition, the lining of the lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system such as T-cells and B-cells.|$|E
5|$|The main {{use for the}} agung in Maguindanao and Maranao {{society is}} as a supportive/accompanying {{instrument}} of an orthodox kulintang ensemble. Using basic patterns and interlocking rhythms, a player would use the agung to complement the melody played by the kulintang. The patterns players use are normally considered freer than either the babendil or the dabakan; players could manipulate the patterns freely {{as long as they}} conform, reaffirm, reinforce and even generate <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> mode of the piece. The length of the patterns themselves may vary depending on how they fit into the melodic improvisation. Rapid style is useful especially during exhibition of playing skills.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} a {{secondary}} motive for men, especially young males, for learning the agung: the ability to interact with young, unmarried women. Both Maranao and Maguindanao cultures traditionally adhere to Islamic customs which prohibit dating or causal conversation between the opposite sexes (unless married to or related to by blood) and therefore performances such as kulintang music provided the opportunity for such a connection. Among the Maguindanao, <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> modes of duyog and sinulog a kamamatuan allowed agung players to serenade the young, unmarried women on the kulintang. Tidto, the other rhythmic mode, {{could also be used}} but players rarely use this for serenading since the kulintang player is usually an older woman.|$|E
5|$|Many {{classical}} dance {{forms and}} folk art are practised in the city. The Yakshagana, a night-long dance and drama performance, {{is held in}} Mangalore, while Pilivesha (literally, tiger dance), a folk dance unique to the city, is performed during Dasara and Krishna Janmashtami. Karadi Vesha (literally, bear dance) is another well known dance performed during Dasara. Paddanas (Ballad-like epics passed on through generations by word of mouth) are sung by a community of impersonators in Tulu and are usually accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> drum beats. The Bearys' unique traditions are reflected in such folk songs as kolkai (sung during kolata, a valour folk-dance during which sticks used as props), unjal pat (traditional lullaby), moilanji pat, and oppune pat (sung at weddings). The Evkaristik Purshanv (Konkani: Eucharistic procession) is an annual Catholic religious procession led on the first Sunday of each year. The Shreemanti Bai Memorial Government Museum in Bejai is the only museum in Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|Salma El-Said and Sherine El-Zeiny {{qualified}} for the Olympics as the second and third-ranked Africans at the 2011 World Championships, with El-Zeiny having been offered a spot after the highest-placed African, Nicole Szabo of South Africa, turned down the invitation due to injury. El-Said had taken a break from active competition while recovering from an injury of her own and came back shortly before the World Championships. Since then she had taken the individual all-around title at the 2011 Arab Games and the 2012 African Championships. El-Zeiny was {{a veteran of the}} 2008 tournament and both had been a part of Egypt's victorious all-around team at the 2012 African Championships. In London, El-Said's best event was the balance beam, in which she placed 42nd. She was also 63rd in the uneven bars, 69th in the floor exercise, and was ranked 41st overall in the individual all-around. El-Zeiny was 53rd on the balance beam, but finished 82nd and last in the floor exercise after suffering an injury. Yasmine Rostom, <b>the</b> <b>rhythmic</b> gymnast, qualified by being the top performer from Africa at the 2011 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships.
