5|$|Construction was financed {{through a}} loan of NOK218 million from Handelsbanken, which was secured on the revenue {{which would be}} {{generated}} {{from the sale of}} Hamar stadion and Fuglsetmyra. However, <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>was</b> not willing to lend money secured on the basis of sales price of Hamar stadion being based on the re-regulation of the lot.

Both HEH and BE1 had as chair Hans Kolstad, who proposed that HEH could issue a guarantee of NOK75 million for BG and BE1—which was issued in September 2007. This allowed construction to start, but the project was still under-financed by NOK50 million. HEH therefore issued another guarantee the same month, for NOK58.75 million.

5|$|Hamilton {{suggested}} that Congress should charter the National Bank with a capitalization of $10million, one-fifth {{of which would}} be handled by the Government. Since the Government did not have the money, it would borrow the money from the bank itself, and repay the loan in ten even annual installments.

Hamilton's bank model had many similarities to that of the Bank of England, except Hamilton wanted to exclude the Government from being involved in public debt, but provide a large, firm, and elastic money supply for the functioning of normal businesses and usual economic development, among other differences. For tax revenue to ignite the bank, it was the same as he had previously proposed; increases on imported spirits: rum, liquor, and whiskey.|$|E

5|$|The {{bill passed}} through the Senate {{practically}} without a problem, but objections of the proposal increased {{by the time it}} reached the House of Representatives. It was generally held by critics that Hamilton was serving the interests of the Northeast by means of the bank, and those of the agrarian lifestyle would not benefit from it. Among those critics was James Jackson of Georgia, who also attempted to refute the report by quoting from The Federalist Papers. Madison and Jefferson also opposed the bank bill. The potential of the capital not being moved to the Potomac if <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>was</b> to have a firm establishment in Philadelphia (the current capital of the United States) was a more significant reason, and actions that Pennsylvania members of Congress took to keep the capital there made both men anxious.|$|E

5|$|UBS, through Swiss Bank Corporation, traces {{its history}} to 1854 when six private banking firms in Basel, Switzerland pooled their {{resources}} {{to form the}} Bankverein, a consortium that acted as an underwriting syndicate for its member banks. In 1871, the Bankverein coordinated with the German Frankfurter Bankverein to form the Basler Bankverein, a joint-stock company replacing the original Bankverein consortium. After the new bank started with an initial commitment of CHF 30million and CHF 6million of share capital, it soon experienced growing pains when heavy losses in Germany caused it to suspend its dividend until 1879. Following the years 1885 and 1886, when the bank merged with the Zürcher Bankverein and acquired the Basler Depositenbank and the Schweizerische Unionbank, it {{changed its name to}} Schweizerischer Bankverein.

Shortly before <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>was</b> to begin an auction on the property, Wright's former client Darwin Martin conceived a scheme to save the property.

5|$|Banking {{operations}} in Hampshire County ceased throughout {{the duration of}} the American Civil War, and a new banking institution was not established in Romney until 1888. By September of that year, a coordinated effort by Romney's leading citizens amassed subscriptions for the entirety of the initial offering of 300 shares of stock for the establishment of the Bank of Romney. The shareholders of the Bank of Romney petitioned the Secretary of State of West Virginia for a charter with capital stock totaling 30,000 USD. Following the state's approval of its charter, the Bank of Romney commenced its {{operations in}} the Wirgman Building on December 20, 1888. The bank occupied two rented rooms on the Wirgman Building's first floor, which it shared with a pharmacy. The bank initially used a safe as its bank vault and security for <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>was</b> provided by a nightwatchman who slept in one of the bank office's two rooms.
