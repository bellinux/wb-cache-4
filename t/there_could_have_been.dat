5|$|At the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, the Brazilian {{started by}} winning a {{gold in the}} 50-metre butterfly, beating the {{championship}} record. He hoped to also win gold in the 50-metre and 100-metre freestyle, but settled for silver in the 50-metre freestyle, and bronze in the 100-metre freestyle. When interviewed after the contest, Cielo said <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> some flaw in his training program, resulting in a lack of stamina.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man and LindowIII {{were found}} to have {{elevated}} levels of copper on their skin. The cause for this was uncertain as <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al. proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment. To test this, skin samples were taken from places likely to be painted and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al. may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors. Similarly, green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found {{to be the result of}} a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the acid of the peat bog.|$|E
5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is certainly no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. <b>There</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E

5|$|Tapp {{is forced}} to move further into the asylum, where he is {{captured}} by Pighead and {{is placed in the}} Shotgun Collar, which is later used in Saw III. Still in the trap, Tapp finds a second victim who is being held by Jigsaw. The victim, Jennings Foster, blames Tapp for being in his trap and thus harbors hatred for him. Tapp finds Jennings in a Pendulum Trap similar to the one used in Saw V. Tapp releases Jennings, who quickly runs away, believing that Tapp would get him killed if he stayed with him. Tapp moves on to find the next victim left behind by Jigsaw. He traverses the asylum and is led to the grave of his former partner Detective Steven Sing. It is there that Tapp discovers that Jigsaw has captured Melissa Sing, Detective Sing's widow. She has become a neglectful parent and is convinced that it is Tapp's fault that her husband was killed. Melissa is found in an Iron Maiden-esque Trap with spinning blades that will mangle her body should the device close on her. Jigsaw informs her that Tapp did not call for backup when searching Jigsaw's lair and that every one of the traps <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> easily avoided by using standard police procedure, which makes Tapp responsible for his partner's death. Tapp saves Melissa. She says Jigsaw gave her the option to leave Tapp, so she quickly runs away.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} of the terrain, the slope and the incline indicates that even if <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a very specific avalanche that circumvents the other criticisms, its trajectory would have bypassed the tent. It had collapsed laterally but not horizontally.|$|E
25|$|Cinnioglu sees {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} an Anatolian refuge, which also harboured Hg R1b1b2.

25|$|An anti-Soviet guerrilla {{movement}} {{known as}} the Metsavennad ("Forest Brothers") developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946–48.

25|$|To clarify, {{writing down}} further laws of Boolean algebra cannot {{give rise to}} any new {{consequences}} of these axioms, nor can it rule out any model of them. In contrast, in a list of some {{but not all of}} the same laws, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Boolean laws that did not follow from those on the list, and moreover there would have been models of the listed laws that were not Boolean algebras.|$|E

25|$|It is {{believed}} that the Doodler killed up to fourteen people. A consistent method used {{in several of the}} killings was stabbing the victims in the front and back of their bodies. Police theorized that the victims had all died after meeting with the suspect near the locations where their bodies were recovered. Police initially believed <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> as many as three different perpetrators during early stages of the investigation.|$|E
25|$|In Grenville's opinion, had Beneš {{held his}} line, the Communists {{would not have}} been able to form a government. The {{historian}} believed <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> only two non-violent means of resolving the crisis—give way to the non-Communists or risk defeat in early elections which the KSČ would not have had time to rig. The non-Communists saw this as a moment of opportunity, needing to act quickly before the Communists had total control over the police and threatened the electoral process.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} {{believes that}} {{the target of the}} first plane was either the Sri Lanka Air Force Headquarters, which was adjacent to the Inland Revenue Department building, or the President's House or Army Headquarters, which were also in the area. However, after the aircraft was hit, the pilot lost control and crashed into the IRD building. The second aircraft is believed to have targeted aircraft hangars at the Air Force base at Katunayake. Given the amount of explosives packed inside the aircraft, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> severe devastation if they had hit their targets.|$|E

25|$|The {{leader of}} the group was called Grandpa. The other koledari {{gathered}} at his house {{on the eve of}} koleda, and at midnight they all went out and started their activities. Walking through the streets of the village they shouted and made noise with their bells and ratchets. Most were armed with sabers or clubs. One of them, called Bride, was masked and costumed as a pregnant woman. He held a distaff in his hand and spun hemp fibers. The koledari teased and joked with Bride, which gave a comic note to the koleda. Some of them were called alosniks, the men possessed by the demon ala. <b>There</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> other named characters in the group.|$|E
25|$|Lebanon cedar {{was used}} for the poles and beams of the Umm el-Qa'ab tombs and had already been {{imported}} earlier; pigment residues hinted at bright colors. The wood planks were painted yellow on their outside and traces of white pigment have also been found. “A part of the mud brick casing suggests that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a support for poles/pennants on top of the boats, as in the boats depicted on pottery or atop the archaic shrines onto some mace heads/palettes and in the HK loc. 29A cultural center.” This technology for ship construction persisted in Egypt for more than one thousand years and the standardization of this earliest phase of plank boat construction in Egypt is striking.|$|E
25|$|A species {{could benefit}} greatly from better {{abilities}} to reason about, predict {{and understand the}} world. French social and cognitive scientist Dan Sperber, with his colleague Hugo Mercier, describes the idea that <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> other forces driving the evolution of reason. Sperber points out that reasoning {{is very difficult for}} humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs. Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective - as demonstrated by the success of projects like science. Sperber says this could suggest that there are not just individual, but group selection pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their fitness. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. They also claim that reason may {{have more to do with}} winning arguments than with the search for the truth.|$|E

25|$|The {{decline in}} grave goods has {{sometimes}} been attributed to suppression of this practice by the ecclesiastical Christian authorities. However this explanation has often been challenged, in part {{because there are no}} surviving canons or laws from this period that condemn the practice of burying the dead with grave goods; rather, contemporary ecclesiastical documents display little interest in how the dead are buried. Moreover, there is no clear termination of the use of grave goods but rather a gradual decline in the practice, whereas any ecclesiastical prohibition might have been expected to result in an immediate end to the practice. An alternative explanation for the decline in grave goods is that the Middle Anglo-Saxon period could have witnessed a change in the structure of inheritance; for instance, whereas weapons were previously inhumed along with their owner, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an increasing emphasis on such items being inherited by the deceased's kin. A third explanation could be found in a growing desire to conserve limited resources and keep them within circulation, rather than removing them from social usage through burial with the dead. This could in turn be linked to the expansion of trade systems and the establishment of trading sites such as Ipswich at which items could be more easily exchanged.|$|E

500|$|The second {{change was}} a {{redrawing}} of the planetary definition {{in the case}} of a double planet system. [...] There had been a concern that, in extreme cases where a double body had its secondary component in a highly eccentric orbit, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a drift of the barycenter in and out of the primary body, leading to a shift in the classification of the secondary body between satellite and planet depending on where the system was in its orbit. [...] Thus the definition was reformulated so as to consider a double planet system in existence if its barycenter lay outside both bodies for a majority of the system's orbital period.|$|E
