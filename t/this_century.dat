5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more by the end of <b>this</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared {{in the latter part of}} <b>this</b> <b>century</b> and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.|$|E

The low-lying coast of the Bay of Bengal is {{particularly}} vulnerable to surges caused by tropical cyclones. The deadliest storm surge in the twenty-first century was caused by the Cyclone Nargis, which killed more than 138,000 people in Myanmar in May 2008. The next deadliest in <b>this</b> <b>century</b> was caused by the Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), which killed more than 6,000 people in the central Philippines in 2013 and resulted in economic losses estimated at $14 billion (USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Slavic settlers {{from the}} east reached southeastern Poland {{in the second half}} of the 5th century, specifically the San River basin, then the upper Vistula regions, including the Kraków area and Nowy Sącz Valley. Single early sites are also known around Sandomierz and Lublin in Masovia and Upper Silesia. Somewhat younger settlement concentrations were discovered in Lower Silesia. In the 6th century, the above areas were settled. At the end of <b>this</b> <b>century,</b> or in the early 7th century, the Slavic newcomers reached Western Pomerania. According to the Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta, the Slavs captured in Constantinople in 592 named the Baltic Sea coastal area as the place from which they originated.|$|E

5|$|The {{eventual}} {{position of}} Narcissus within the Amaryllidaceae family only became settled in <b>this</b> <b>century</b> {{with the advent}} of phylogenetic analysis and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system. Within Amaryllidaceae the genus Narcissus belongs to the Narcisseae tribe, one of 13 within the Amaryllidoideae subfamily. It is one of two sister clades corresponding to genera in the Narcisseae, being distinguished from Sternbergia by the presence of a paraperigonium, and is monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, {{there was}} an {{explosion}} of new lemur descriptions and names, which later took decades to sort out. During this time, professional collectors gathered specimens for museums, menageries, and cabinets. Some of the major collectors were Johann Maria Hildebrandt and Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major. From these collections, as well as increasing observations of lemurs in their natural habitats, museum systematists including Albert Günther and John Edward Gray continued to contribute new names for new lemur species. However, the most notable contributions from <b>this</b> <b>century</b> includes the work of Alfred Grandidier, a naturalist and explorer who devoted himself to the study of Madagascar's natural history and local people. With the help of Alphonse Milne-Edwards, most of the diurnal lemurs were illustrated at this time. However, lemur taxonomic nomenclature took its modern form in the 1920s and 1930s, being standardized by Ernst Schwarz in 1931.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, Cluj {{suffered}} from great calamities, suffering from epidemics of the plague and devastating fires. The end of <b>this</b> <b>century</b> brought {{the end of}} Turkish sovereignty, but found the city bereft of much of its wealth, municipal freedom, cultural centrality, political significance and even population. It gradually regained its important position within Transylvania as {{the headquarters of the}} Gubernium and the Diets between 1719 and 1732, and again from 1790 until the revolution of 1848, when the Gubernium moved to Nagyszeben (Hermannstadt), present-day Sibiu). In 1791, a group of Romanian intellectuals drew up a petition, known as Supplex Libellus Valachorum, which was sent to the Emperor in Vienna. The petition demanded the equality of the Romanian nation in Transylvania in respect to the other nations (Saxon, Szekler and Hungarian) governed by the Unio Trium Nationum, but it was rejected by the Diet of Cluj.|$|E

5|$|The lowest ranking Century in the Centuriate Assembly was {{the fifth}} Century (called the proletarii) of the unarmed adjunct class. <b>This</b> <b>Century</b> was the only Century {{composed}} of soldiers who had no property, and since {{it was always the}} last Century to vote, it never had any real influence on elections. In 107 BC, in response to high unemployment and a severe manpower shortage in the army, the general and Consul Gaius Marius reformed the organization of the army, and allowed individuals with no property to enlist. As a consequence of these reforms, this fifth unarmed Century came to encompass almost the entire Roman army. This mass disenfranchisement of most of the soldiers in the army {{played an important role in}} the chaos that led to the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the college were built using rubble from Oxfordshire dressed with local stone. The {{remaining}} parts of the 17th-century walls are dressed with Headington stone, which was a common building material in Oxford at that time: the geologist W. J. Arkell wrote that it was used for every building in Oxford constructed during <b>this</b> <b>century</b> for which records exist. Areas of Headington stone {{can be seen in}} the first quadrangle on the wall of the hall. It was only discovered towards the end of the 18th century that it did not weather well: the surface of the stone develops a hard crust, which blisters, bursts and comes off. Much of it has subsequently been replaced with other materials as a result.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} 4th century, the Christian {{community}} was small, poor, and carried no influence in the city. The church was insignificant and its members {{were not allowed to}} hold political office. However, conversion to Christianity in Gaza was spearheaded under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420. In 402, after obtaining a decree from the emperor, he ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed and idol worship was forbidden by the Byzantine government. Paganism continued and Christians were still persecuted in the city, forcing St. Porphyrius to undertake more measures. As a result of his persuasion, Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas in 406. (Note that according to MacMullen it is likely that Porphyrius did not even exist.) Persecution against Christians did not cease, but it was less harsh and frequent than previously. A large 6th century synagogue with a mosaic tile floor depicting King David was discovered in Gaza. An inscription states that the floor was donated in 508–509 CE by two merchant brothers. Around 540, Gaza became the starting point for pilgrimages to the Sinai Peninsula. It was an important city in the early Christian world and many famous scholars taught at its academy of rhetoric, including 6th-century scholar Procopius of Gaza. The celebrated Church of Saint Sergius was built in <b>this</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

Messi's first goal marked his 350th in the fixture, {{becoming}} the first player ever to achieve this milestone. On 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017–18 league campaign, against Espanyol in derbi barceloní, thus helping to secure a 5–0 home victory for Blaugrana over local rivals. Messi netted twice against Gianluigi Buffon, on 12 September, as Barça defeated the last season's Italian champions Juventus 3–0 {{at home in the}} UEFA Champions League. On 19 September, Messi found the net four times in a 6–1 trashing of Eibar at the Camp Nou in La Liga. Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped Barça defeat Las Palmas 3–0 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum. On 18 October, in his 122nd European club appearance, Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal, and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions, in a 3–1 home victory over Olympiakos; he also set up Lucas Digne's goal during the same match. Messi became only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach <b>this</b> <b>century</b> milestone, but accomplished it in 21 fewer appearances than the Portuguese counterpart. On 23 October, Messi finished as the runner-up behind Cristiano Ronaldo in 2017 Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year. On 4 November, he made his 600th appearance for Barcelona in a 2–1 home win over Sevilla in La Liga.|$|E
