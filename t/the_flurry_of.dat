Fabio Fontanelli won the stage {{as a member of}} the lead group, but tenth-place {{finisher}} Bruno Leali gained a six-second race lead by finishing more than three minutes in front of overall leader Miguel Indurain. The Giro's twelfth stage began with a large climb which led to many attacks.

5|$|Balakirev's despotism {{strained}} {{the relationship}} between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with <b>the</b> <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.|$|E

25|$|Background texts: The {{following}} {{bibliography of}} source papers includes {{a number of}} texts {{to be used as}} background. The mathematics that led to <b>the</b> <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> papers about abstract machines in the 1950s and 1960s can be found in van Heijenoort (1967)—an assemblage of original papers spanning the 50 years from Frege (1879) to Gödel (1931). Davis (ed.) The Undecidable (1965) carries the torch onward beginning with Gödel (1931) through Gödel's (1964) postscriptum (p.71); the original papers of Alan Turing (1936-7) and Emil Post (1936) are included in The Undecidable. The mathematics of Church, Rosser and Kleene that appear as reprints of original papers in The Undecidable is carried further in Kleene (1952), a mandatory text for anyone pursuing {{a deeper understanding of the}} mathematics behind the machines. Both Kleene (1952) and Davis (1958) are referenced by a number of the papers.|$|E
25|$|Young Roy Radabaugh, as he {{was then}} known, had just two days in film extra work on the side, and {{can be seen in}} King of Jazz (1930), along with the film's star, Paul Whiteman and his orchestra. On a whim, friends {{encouraged}} Roy to audition in 1930 for the remake of the Richard Barthelmess silent: Tol'able David (1930). Radabaugh won the role over thousands of hopefuls, and in storybook fashion, Harry Cohn gave him his screen name and launched his career. Cromwell earned $75 per week for his work on Tol'able David. Noah Beery Sr. and John Carradine co-starred in the film. Later, Cohn signed Cromwell to a multi-year contract based on the strength of his performance and success in his first venture at the box-office. Amidst <b>the</b> <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> publicity during this period, Cromwell toured the country, even meeting President Herbert Hoover in Washington, D.C.|$|E

Raised to consider themselves 'part of the same litter', Zaki and Samar watched American television together, memorized dialogues from Bollywood movies and attended dangerous protests with Zaki's campaigning, political journalist mother.

500|$|At 09:00, Duncan {{made the}} signal to prepare for battle while De Winter {{organised}} his ships into a line of battle to meet the British attack in a solid defensive formation, sailing on the port tack in a northeasterly heading. As they manoeuvred into their assigned stations, the Dutch fleet drew closer to the shore. Duncan intended to follow Lord Howe's manoeuvres at the Glorious First of June three years earlier and bring each ship through the Dutch line between two opponents, but the Dutch formation and proximity to the shore rendered this plan impractical. To compensate, Duncan signalled for his ships to form line and sail southeast on the port tack so {{that they had the}} wind directly behind them. Shortly afterwards, concerned that the Dutch might make the shoreline before he could bring them to battle despite his wry insistence that [...] "I am determined to fight the ships on land if I cannot by sea", Duncan ordered his fleet to turn southwards and advance on the enemy and [...] "bear up and sail large". He fired signal guns to alert his captains and then ordered them to [...] "engage the enemy as arriving up" [...] and for his [...] to attack the Dutch rear. At 11:00, Duncan sought to remedy increasing gaps between his vessels by ordering the faster ships to slow down and wait for their compatriots. He then made an effort to re-establish the line on the starboard tack before realising that the Dutch fleet was still in order awaiting the British attack and continually drawing closer to the dangerous coastline. Abandoning his previous signals, Duncan ordered the entire fleet to turn towards the Dutch and attack directly, each ship to [...] "steer for and engage her opponent". Many of these signals were poorly executed and incorrect, visibility was low and Trollope's squadron was still using obsolete signal codes, so a number of vessels failed to comprehend Duncan's intentions, turning the advancing line into a ragged pattern of scattered vessels clustered into two loose groups. <b>The</b> <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> orders was so quick and contradictory that at least one captain gave up entirely: the Scottish captain, John Inglis, of HMS Belliqueux threw his signal book to the deck in frustration and shouted [...] "Up wi' the hel'lem and gang into the middle o't." ...|$|E

2500|$|In boosted-fission {{nuclear weapons}} {{a mixture of}} {{deuterium}} and tritium are heated until there is thermonuclear fission to produce helium and release free neutrons. <b>The</b> <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> fast neutron particles would then excite further fission reactions with uranium, creating a [...] "boosted" [...] nuclear bomb. In 1951, during Operation Greenhouse, a prototype named George, successfully validated the proof of concept for such a weapon.

The United States stopped producing tritium in nuclear reactors in 1988, but nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s added large spikes of radioactive elements to the atmosphere, especially radiocarbon and tritium.

However, some oceanographers benefited from the tritium increase, utilizing the signal in the water to trace physical mixing of water masses.|$|E
