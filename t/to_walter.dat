5|$|Irving appealed <b>to</b> <b>Walter</b> Scott {{for help}} {{procuring}} a more reputable publisher {{for the remainder}} of the book. Scott referred Irving to his own publisher, London powerhouse John Murray, who agreed to take on The Sketch Book. From then on, Irving would publish concurrently in the United States and Britain to protect his copyright, with Murray as his English publisher of choice.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe team {{is brought}} to a nursing home, where Roscoe Joyce (Christopher Lloyd), the former keyboardist of the band Violet Sedan Chair, was seen talking to his son Bobby (Nick Ouellette) {{who had died in}} 1985, as well as {{evidence}} of an Observer. Walter Bishop (John Noble), meeting his musical hero, requests to take Roscoe back to his lab to help Roscoe remember what his son said. Walter is able to help Roscoe remember much of his past since the loss of his son through therapy that includes helping Roscoe to recall his piano-playing skills. Roscoe shortly recalls the conversation with his son, which was actually a message from the Observer September <b>to</b> <b>Walter.</b> September (Michael Cerveris) soon appears at the lab and requests to speak <b>to</b> <b>Walter.</b>|$|E
5|$|A 65-yard screen {{pass from}} Vince Evans <b>to</b> <b>Walter</b> Payton gave the Bears a 13–10 lead. The Buccaneers {{answered}} {{that with a}} drive that ended with an eight-yard touchdown reception by Isaac Hagins. This score, with 5:08 left in the game, put the Buccaneers ahead of the Bears and left them as the only remaining undefeated team in the league. It was the third consecutive loss for the Bears. Jerry Eckwood also contributed a 61-yard touchdown run, the longest running play in Buccaneers history to that point. A broken wrist suffered in this game would contribute to Eckwood's diminished performance later in the season.|$|E

5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Walter</b> Bolliger, {{development}} of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996. In 1999, the world's first Floorless Coaster opened at Six Flags Great Adventure as Medusa. In 2009, the coaster was renamed Bizarro and re-themed. After the success of Bolliger & Mabillard's prototype Floorless Coaster, SeaWorld, Cedar Fair, Six Flags, and independent parks, Janfusun Fancyworld, Parque Warner Madrid, Tivoli Gardens, and Ocean Park Hong Kong have built other coasters of this model at their parks. There are currently 14 Floorless Coasters in operation with Dominator being the only one relocated to another park.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Walter</b> Bolliger, {{development}} of the Wing Coaster began between 2007 and 2008. In 2010, Bolliger & Mabillard announced a prototype Wing Coaster design that would be built at Merlin Entertainments' Gardaland. It became known as Raptor, which opened on 1 April 2011. A year later, Merlin Entertainments opened a second Wing Coaster on 15 March 2012, called The Swarm at Thorpe Park.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Walter</b> Breen, Snowden {{most likely}} chose the {{combination}} of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest relief of any of the options, and could be expected to strike well. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design, and two days later wrote to Longacre, informing him that it was approved. Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production, which was to begin on January 1, 1859.|$|E

5|$|During the episode, Walter {{is shown}} to be agoraphobic and unwilling to leave his lab after Olivia {{arranged}} his release from a mental asylum. He becomes panicked when he briefly sees images of a man, Peter, in the lab; Olivia attributes this <b>to</b> <b>Walter</b> lacking any foothold in reality. That evening, Walter is preparing for bed while September, outside, readies a device he has assembled {{to wipe out the}} remains of Peter's existence. But at the last moment September disarms the device and walks away. Later Walter sees yet another image of Peter on his television and is terrified.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, Olivia {{finds that}} the {{memories}} she is gaining from Peter Bishop's (Joshua Jackson) original timeline are overriding her original memories. Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) becomes concerned and suggests that Olivia talk <b>to</b> <b>Walter</b> to help reverse the memory loss. During the case, in talking with the latest victim's wife, Olivia realizes that she is truly in love with Peter. After {{the conclusion of the}} case, she admits to Nina that she will let the memory alterations continue, even if this means she will forget the times she spent with Nina during her childhood.|$|E

5000|$|The episode [...] "The Firefly" [...] {{involves}} {{a series of}} events temporally engineered by September <b>to</b> force <b>Walter</b> <b>to</b> make a choice regarding Peter's safety as to prepare him for a future event.

5|$|Heraclius offered {{peace to}} Khosrow, presumably in 624, {{threatening}} otherwise to invade Persia, but Khosrow rejected the offer. On March 25, 624, Heraclius left Constantinople {{to attack the}} Persian heartland. He willingly abandoned any attempt to secure his rear or his communications with the sea, marching through Armenia and modern Azerbaijan to assault the core Persian lands directly. According <b>to</b> <b>Walter</b> Kaegi, Heraclius led an army {{of no more than}} 40,000, and most likely between 20,00024,000. Before journeying to the Caucasus, he recovered Caesarea, in defiance of the earlier letter that Khosrow had sent him.|$|E
5|$|I. anglicus was the {{original}} type species, but the holotype {{was based on a}} single tooth and only partial remains of the species have been recovered since. In March 2000, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature changed the type species to the much better known I. bernissartensis, with the new holotype being IRSNB 1534. The original Iguanodon tooth is held at Te Papa Tongarewa, the national museum of New Zealand in Wellington, although it is not on display. The fossil arrived in New Zealand following the move of Gideon Mantell's son Walter there; after the elder Mantell's death, his fossils went <b>to</b> <b>Walter.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1974 Weizsäcker was the Presidential {{candidate}} {{of his party}} for the first time, but he lost <b>to</b> <b>Walter</b> Scheel of the FDP, who {{was supported by the}} ruling center-left coalition. Ahead of the 1976 elections, CDU chairman Helmut Kohl included him in his shadow cabinet for the party’s campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Schmidt as chancellor. Between 1979 and 1981, Weizsäcker served as Vice President of the Bundestag.|$|E

5|$|In the present, {{the events}} of the episode never occurred, and Walter, having time to {{contemplate}} the letter to Peter instead of being called to the case, tosses it into the fireplace. Later, he receives an envelope in the mail—the one Alistair had prepared and instructed to be delivered <b>to</b> <b>Walter</b> on this specific date. Inside, Walter finds a drawing of a white tulip.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of Pierre Riché, the {{disappearance}} of 220 bishops' seats indicates that the Lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the Church. Yet according <b>to</b> <b>Walter</b> Pohl the regions directly occupied by Alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns, whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe impact, with the bishoprics in such places rarely surviving.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the crash}} of a small {{commuter}} aircraft is attributed to a similar signal from a numbers station, and when Fringe division identifies the source, they find a second box. Taking the box <b>to</b> <b>Walter,</b> Peter identifies one of the electronic components as rare, and engages his contacts to find Feller's address from its purchase. Fauxlivia feigns returning to headquarters to instead travel to Feller's apartment, warning him that Fringe is onto him, but he insists on continuing his job. She throws him {{out the window as}} the Fringe team arrives, killing him and revealing him to be a shapeshifter. Fauxlivia claims she killed the man in self-defense.|$|E

Ray collects the dog and leaves a note for Walter, explaining the situation. The following night, Ray and Art have a meeting in the Petersons' basement and theorize about Walter's mysterious disappearance.|$|R
