It is sensitive to oxidation and photodegradation. In this work, the photolysis and photocatalytic degradations of IBP under solar irradiation were studied. In the heterogeneous photocatalysts experiments two methods were used (i) the catalyst titanium dioxide (TiO 2) was dispersed as powder in pollutant solution; (ii) blue glass slabs with TiO 2 immobilized on the surface were submerged into the reactor containing <b>the</b> <b>pollutant</b> <b>solution.</b> The efficiency of photolysis and photocatalytic processes towards the removal of IBP was investigated, and the performance of different reaction methods was evaluated. Results varied from no removal as in photolysis case to the complete mineralization for the IBP in photocatalytic degradations processes. Approximately complete degradation of IBP occurred after 2. 5 hours by using TiO 2 particles and 24 hours were needed to get the same result with the synthesized TiO 2 blue glasses (Fig. 1), which indicate that the TiO 2 powder was more effective than the semiconductor immobilized in the blue glasses. Kinetic studies for each experiment were accomplished (Table 1), and then the identification of the photoproducts was performed using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Many photoproducts were detected and identified. The overall results suggest that the use of TiO 2 heterogeneous photo-catalysis either in powder or blue glass form may be promising in the protection of environmental system from these emerging contaminants...|$|E

Five series of contaminated illite soils were prepared through adsorption tests using four single-specie 5000 ppm heavy metal solutions of Pb, Cu, Zn, or Cd and one multi-species solution containing 1250 ppm of each heavy metal. The five contaminated illite soils that were prepared contained the following levels of heavy metals per kilogram of soil: (i) 5000 mg Pb, (ii) 3490 mg Cu, (iii) 1566 mg Zn, (iv) 700 mg Cd, (v) 1186 mg Pb; 379 mg Cu; 151 mg Zn; and 125 mg Cd.

As <b>the</b> <b>pollutant</b> stock <b>solutions</b> were prepared in methanol or acetone, the reaction mixture contained at the end 4 % (v/v) of methanol and 2 % of acetone, which did not significantly influence laccase activity. Batch reactions were conducted in 2 -ml glass vials containing 1  ml of oxygen-saturated reaction mixture. Reactions were initiated by adding laccase preparation to obtain an initial activity of 210 – 220 U l- 1. For T. versicolor laccase, a stock solution of commercial enzyme (1  g l- 1 in pure water) was used. For S. cyaneus laccase, concentrated crude enzyme preparation (laccase activity of 2000 U l- 1) was added. The vials were incubated in the dark at 25 °C under static conditions for 12 d. As shown in a previous study (Margot et al. 2013 b), diffusion of oxygen from the air space was sufficient to maintain a high level of dissolved oxygen during the reaction. After defined reaction times, aliquots (50  μl) were withdrawn from each vial and directly injected into the HPLC column to analyse micropollutant concentrations. Controls without laccase were performed at the three pH values to assess chemical degradation. Duplicate experiments were conducted.

40|$|A {{procedure}} is presented that expresses pollutant movement in groundwater as a probability distribution. Probability is introduced into <b>the</b> <b>pollutant</b> movement <b>solution</b> process {{by using the}} Turning Bands Method (TBM), a spectral analysis model. The TBM generates a selected number of spatially-varying, correlated hydraulic conductivity fields, {{all of which have}} the same descriptive statistics, i. e., mean, standard deviation and correlation function. A groundwater flow-mass transport model developed by the Illinois State Water Survey is used to predict pollution concentration as a function of space and time for a specified groundwater contamination event. The groundwater flow-mass transport model develops a set of pollution movement estimates, one for each hydraulic conductivity field generated by the TBM. These realizations of pollutant movement are described first as frequency distributions and eventually as cumulative exceedance probability distributions;This {{procedure is}} applied to a documented field situation at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). Disposal of tritium in low-level radioactive and chemical wastes from the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) into the Snake River Plain aquifer through a deep injection well was recorded from 1976 through 1982. The movement of the tritium plume has been observed at several monitoring sites. TBM and groundwater flow-mass transport model parameters are determined in a calibration process with the recorded INEL data. One hundred realizations of a tritium disposal event during 1979 and 1980 at the INEL are used to generate cumulative exceedance probabilities of time of arrival and tritium concentration versus duration of exposure at an observation well downstream of the ICPP injection well;The observed cumulative exceedance probability distributions of time of arrival and conditional and marginal cumulative exceedance probability distributions of each tritium concentration and duration of exposure are fitted to the Pearson Type III distribution. A logit transformation is used to obtain a simple mathematical equation representing the joint cumulative exceedance probability distribution of tritium concentration and duration of exposure. Finally, the pertinence of these types of probability results to toxicity studies and benefit-cost analysis is discussed...|$|R

The solvents ethanol, xylene and petroleum did not show any toxic effects up to concentrations of 1000 mg/kg soil. While the formulation additive Soprophor and the cationic surfactant DSDMAC were only toxic at very high concentrations (1000 mg/kg soil), concentrations as low as 50 mg/kg for nonylphenol and LAS caused an observable damage of the microflora.

To assess {{the use of}} activated carbon to remove <b>the</b> <b>pollutants</b> from aqueous <b>solution,</b> <b>the</b> effect of <b>pollutants</b> initial concentration and adsorbent dose have been evaluated. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm model were also investigated. From {{the analysis of the}} results, it was observed that, there was progressive decrease in the concentrations of the adsorbates, thus corresponding decrease in the quantities of adsorbates per specific weights of the adsorbent. For instant, 0. 1 g of activated carbon adsorbed 1. 08, 0. 96, 1. 08 and 1. 0 concentrations (g/l) of phenol, butanol, butan- 2 -ol and 2 -methylbuatan- 2 -ol respectively. It was also observed that quantity of adsorbates per specific weight of the adsorbent is higher in butanol (qe = 23. 95); followed by 2 -methyl butan- 2 -ol (qe = 15. 10) compared to others. This follows the same decreasing trends to butan- 2 -ol and phenol respectively. The regression value obtained for each of the components especially butanol which is 0. 904 and 2 -methylbutan- 2 -ol which is 0. 916 shows that the Freundlich isotherm is a good fit for adsorption experimental data of butanol and 2 -methylbutan- 2 -ol because of their regression values which is very close to 1 unlike phenol and butan- 2 -ol. The regression coefficient obtained for phenol is 0. 904, butan- 2 -ol is 0. 919, butanol is 0. 979 and 2 -methylbutan- 2 -ol is 0. 974. This shows that Langmuir isotherm is a good fit for adsorption experimental data for phenol, butanol, butan- 2 -ol and 2 -methylbutan- 2 -ol. It was concluded that activated carbon has a high adsorptive capacity to remove phenol, butanol, butan- 2 -ol and 2 -methyl butan- 2 -ol from the liquid system...|$|R
