5|$|The Second Sino-Japanese War {{caused a}} pause in the {{conflict}} between the CPC and <b>the</b> <b>KMT.</b> The Second United Front was established between the CPC and <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> to tackle the invasion. While the front formally existed until 1945, all collaboration between the two parties had ended by 1940. Despite their formal alliance, the CPC used the opportunity to expand and carve out independent bases of operations to prepare for the coming war with <b>the</b> <b>KMT.</b> In 1939 <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> began to restrict CPC expansion within China. This led to frequent clashes between CPC and KMT forces but which subsided rapidly on the realisation on both sides that civil war was not an option. Yet, by 1943, the CPC was again actively expanding its territory at the expense of <b>the</b> <b>KMT.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 1935, {{following}} {{the last major}} battle between <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> and the Red Army, Mao wrote and dedicated a poem to Peng. (The poem was not published until 1947).|$|E
5|$|Late in 1937, {{she brought}} her corps to Nanchang, where she reunited with her old friend Chen Yi, who was by then a top {{commander}} of the Communist New Fourth Army. According to Hu's own account, {{they fell in love}} and became engaged. She wanted her women's corps to join the Communist rather than <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> army, but the idea was rejected by the New Fourth Army commander Xiang Ying, who feared it might cause trouble with <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> leadership.|$|E
50|$|Funds {{were mainly}} raised by Deng, who ran <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> Party Book Shop, a {{publishing}} house for party-political propaganda. Furthermore, to avoid arrest under <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> political organization ban, members {{decided not to}} tell Chiang Kai-shek of their plan, even while regarding him as their spiritual mentor and leader.|$|R
50|$|In July, 1921, He Shuheng {{attended}} the first National Congress of the CPC in Shanghai. After the congress, He Shuheng {{became a member}} of the CPC’s Hunan committee. During the first cooperation between Kuomintang (KMT) and CPC, He Shuheng was a member of <b>the</b> <b>KMT’s</b> executive committee and supervision committee of <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> local party in Hunan. In 1927, He Shuheng went to Shanghai. After the April 12 Incident, He Shuheng established a print factory, secretly, for the CPC in Changsha.|$|R
25|$|In 1980, she met Song Shi-xuan, head of <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> Taiwan Provincial Branch, who enlisted her as {{a leader}} of the branch's women's {{division}} of Taipei County until 1986. She also served three years at the party headquarters in Taipei and as editor for KMT Taiwan Province Department in 1986-1990. With many years of party experience under her belt, Hung began to seek the party's nomination for the National Assembly, but <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> Deputy Secretary-General, Guan Zhong, encouraged her to run for the Legislative Yuan instead.|$|R
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Pan {{organized}} and led the Communist guerrillas in Shandong, and later became {{a leader of the}} Hebei–Shandong–Henan (Ji–Lu–Yu) Communist base. He participated in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the subsequent Chinese Civil War against <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> government.|$|E
5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. <b>The</b> <b>KMT</b> continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|General Tuan Shi-wen died in 1980, and {{was buried}} in a pagoda-like tomb on a hilltop reached via a 300-metre (984ft) climb. From the top, there is a {{panoramic}} view of the village. There is also a memorial to <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> soldiers who died in their fight against communism, The Martyrs' Memorial, a museum whose wooden panels bear the names of the dead, set on an altar in the main building. It was constructed in the style of a large Chinese shrine like the National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine in Taipei. The museum also features exhibits describing the struggles of <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> soldiers and the development of the Doi Mae Salong valley.|$|E
2500|$|The National Revolutionary Army (NRA) (...) , pre-1928 {{sometimes}} shortened to [...] or Revolutionary Army {{and between}} 1928 and 1947 as [...] or National Army was the Military Arm of <b>the</b> Kuomintang (<b>KMT)</b> from 1925 until 1947, {{as well as}} the national army of the Republic of China during <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> period of party rule beginning in 1928.|$|R
50|$|This story, {{written about}} 7 {{years before the}} death of Chiang Kai-shek seems to foretell the {{inevitable}} consequences of the natural death of <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> military leaders.|$|R
50|$|Yinxiang {{abruptly}} ceased {{operations in}} September 1979. Pressure exerted by the censors of <b>the</b> <b>KMT’s</b> censorship and propaganda office, the G.I.O., or the voiding of its licence is a likely cause.|$|R
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1926, Hu Lanqi left home for Guangzhou to work for He Xiangning, Minister of Women's Affairs of the Kuomintang (KMT) government. The {{following}} year, she became a cadet of the Whampoa Military Academy in Wuhan and enlisted in the KMT's National Revolutionary Army, which was then waging the Northern Expedition against the warlords. She {{was one of a}} small number of women recruits, which included Xie Bingying and Zhao Yiman. After initial success, <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> leader Chiang Kai-shek turned against the Communists, who had been until then allied with <b>the</b> <b>KMT,</b> and committed the Shanghai massacre in April 1927. The Wuhan-based left wing of <b>the</b> <b>KMT,</b> who were sympathetic to the Communists, capitulated to Chiang's right wing. Hu Lanqi was discharged from the army when the military academy was dissolved in July 1927. Instead of returning home, she continued to work for the left-wing KMT leader He Xiangning, helping her unionize female workers. She broke up with her second husband whose political views differed from hers.|$|E
5|$|The deep-rooted hostility between Aboriginals and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the Aboriginal {{communities}} effective KMT networks, {{contribute to}} Aboriginal skepticism against the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Aboriginals tendency {{to vote for}} <b>the</b> <b>KMT.</b>|$|E
5|$|After a brief stay in Hong Kong, {{where she}} met the disaffected KMT leader Li Jishen, Hu was in Shanghai when the Japanese {{launched}} an all-out attack on the city in August 1937, {{at the beginning of}} the eight-year-long Second Sino-Japanese War. In September, she organized the Shanghai Labor Women's War Service Corps to support the 18th Army of <b>the</b> <b>KMT.</b> The women tended wounded soldiers and helped harvest rice near the battlefront at night.|$|E
50|$|With the {{unification}} of <b>the</b> south, <b>The</b> <b>KMT’s</b> Republic of China was established on July 1, 1925 in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, four months after Sun Yat-Sen’s death, in March of that same year.|$|R
5000|$|Lin Yang-kang ( [...] ; June 10, 1928 - April 13, 2013) was a Taiwanese politiican. He {{was born}} at Sun Moon Lake during the Japanese rule of Taiwan. Some {{thought he might be}} Chiang Ching-kuo's {{successor}} as head of <b>the</b> Kuomintang (<b>KMT),</b> but after failing to win <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> nomination for president in 1996, he became an independent. Lin rejoined the party in 2005, and died in 2013.|$|R
25|$|When Lim Bo Seng {{and other}} agents from Force 136 {{attempted}} {{to make contact with}} Kuomintang networks in Ipoh as part of Operation Gustavus, they found that <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> underground actions there were tainted by corruption or private feuding.|$|R
5|$|Japanese rule of Taiwan {{ended in}} 1945, {{following}} the armistice with the allies on September 2 {{and the subsequent}} appropriation of the island by the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, or KMT) on October 25. In 1949, on losing the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party of China, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek led the Kuomintang in a retreat from Mainland China, withdrawing its government and 1.3 million refugees to Taiwan. <b>The</b> <b>KMT</b> installed an authoritarian form of government and shortly thereafter inaugurated a number of political socialization programs aimed at nationalizing Taiwanese people as citizens of a Chinese nation and eradicating Japanese influence. <b>The</b> <b>KMT</b> pursued highly centralized political and cultural policies rooted in the party's decades-long history of fighting warlordism in China and opposing competing concepts of a loose federation following {{the demise of the}} imperial Qing. The project was designed to create a strong national Chinese cultural identity (as defined by the state) at the expense of local cultures. Following the February 28 Incident, the Kuomintang placed Taiwan under martial law, which was to last for nearly four decades.|$|E
5|$|The CPC has, since Jiang Zemin's time, made {{friendly}} overtures to its erstwhile foe, the Kuomintang. The CPC emphasizes strong party-to-party {{relations with}} <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> {{so as to}} strengthen the probability of the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China. However, several studies have been written on the KMT's loss of power in 2000, after having ruled Taiwan since 1949 (<b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> officially ruled mainland China from 1928 to 1949). In general, one-party states or dominant-party states are of special interest to the party, and party-to-party relations are formed so that the CPC can study them. For instance, the longevity of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party is attributed to the personalization {{of power in the}} al-Assad family, the strong presidential system, the inheritance of power, which passed from Hafez al-Assad to his son Bashar al-Assad, and the role given to the Syrian military in politics.|$|E
5|$|After being blacklisted by <b>the</b> <b>KMT,</b> Hu left China for Europe in 1928. She briefly {{shared an}} {{apartment}} with He Xiangning in Berlin, and through the introduction of He's son Liao Chengzhi and Cheng Fangwu, she joined the Chinese-speaking group of the Communist Party of Germany. He Xiangning also introduced Hu to Soong Ching-ling, the widow of President Sun Yat-sen. When Soong's mother died, Hu accompanied Soong back to China to attend her funeral in July 1931, before returning to Germany. In 1932, her image appeared on the popular magazine Liangyou (The Young Companion).|$|E

5000|$|The major {{function}} of mitosis is to separate replicated sister chromatids, {{and this is}} accomplished in part during anaphase A when [...] "kinetochore microtubules (or kMTs)" [...] that link the sister chromatids to opposite spindle poles shorten by depolymerization, exerting forces on the chromatids that pull them to the poles. In Drosophila {{there is evidence that}} sister chromatids are moved to opposite spindle poles by a [...] "kinesin-13 dependent pacman-flux mechanism" [...] in which one kinesin-13 isoform, KLP59c, localized to kinetochores facilitates the depolymerization of the end of <b>the</b> <b>kMTs</b> facing <b>the</b> chromatid (pacman), whereas a second kinesin-13 isoform, KLP10A, localized on the spindle poles facilitates the depolymerization of the opposite end of <b>the</b> <b>kMTs</b> facing <b>the</b> poles (flux) ...|$|R
50|$|The idea of counterattacking the Mainland {{started out}} as a slogan in 1950, after <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> {{expulsion}} to Taiwan. It was a bid to bolster morale on the island, which now consisted of homesick soldiers and refugees, along with the native Taiwanese.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Japanese surrender, the Second United Front between <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> and the Communists broke apart and the Chinese Civil War resumed. Hu Lanqi again worked under Li Jishen, persuading various KMT commanders to defect to the Communist side. At that time, the Sichuan general Yang Sen was serving as Governor of Guizhou Province, who hired her as Chief Editor of the Guizhou Daily. She urged Yang Sen {{to abandon his}} support for Chiang Kai-shek, but Yang had {{commanded}} attacks against the Communists {{in the past and}} did not believe they would forgive him. He eventually retreated to Taiwan with Chiang in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} for indigenous {{cultural and political}} resurgence in Taiwan traces its roots to the ideals outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Although the Republic of China was a UN member and signatory to the original UN Charter, four decades of martial law controlled the discourse of culture and politics on Taiwan. The political liberalization Taiwan experienced {{leading up to the}} official end of martial law on July 15, 1987, opened a new public arena for dissenting voices and political movements against the centralized policy of <b>the</b> <b>KMT.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives. Modern studies show {{a high degree of}} genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling to entertain the idea of having an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E
25|$|The National Revolutionary Army (NRA), {{sometimes}} shortened to Revolutionary Army (革命軍) before 1928, and as National Army (國軍) after 1928, was {{the military}} arm of <b>the</b> Kuomintang (<b>KMT,</b> or <b>the</b> Chinese Nationalist Party) from 1925 until 1947 in the Republic of China. It also became the regular {{army of the}} ROC during <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> period of party rule beginning in 1928. It was renamed the Republic of China Armed Forces after the 1947 Constitution, which instituted civilian control of the military.|$|R
50|$|A {{division}} of <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> forces entered India {{around this time}} as the Chinese Army in India in their struggle against Japanese expansion in Southeast Asia. Dwarkanath Kotnis and four other Indian physicians traveled to a war-torn China to provide medical assistance against Japanese forces.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) {{was elected}} president, marking the first {{peaceful}} democratic transition {{of power to}} an opposition party in ROC history and a decisive end to <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> monopoly in administration of the central government.|$|R
5|$|Ho {{scheduled}} {{elections for}} December 23, {{but he made}} a deal with the VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi, which assured them of 50 and 20seats in the new national assembly respectively, regardless of the poll results. This only temporarily placated the VNQDD, which continued its skirmishes against the Vietminh. Eventually, Chinese pressure on the VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi saw them accept a coalition government, in which Tam served as foreign minister. For the communists' part, they accused <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> of intimidating them into sharing power with the VNQDD, and claimed that VNQDD soldiers had tried to attack polling stations. The VNQDD claimed that the communists had engaged in vote fraud and intimidation, citing Vietminh claims that they had received tallies in excess of 80% in areas controlled by French troops.|$|E
5|$|In many districts Taiwanese aborigines tend to {{vote for}} the Kuomintang, {{to the point that the}} {{legislative}} seats allocated to the aborigines are popularly described as iron votes for the pan-blue coalition. This may seem surprising in light of the focus of the pan-green coalition on promoting aboriginal culture as part of the Taiwanese nationalist discourse against <b>the</b> <b>KMT.</b> However, this voting pattern can be explained on economic grounds, and as part of an inter-ethnic power struggle waged in the electorate. Some aborigines see the rhetoric of Taiwan nationalism as favoring the majority Hoklo speakers rather than themselves. Aboriginal areas also tend to be poor and their economic vitality tied to the entrenched patronage networks established by the Kuomintang over the course of its fifty-five year reign.|$|E
5|$|The Dixie Mission had {{consequences}} for individuals, {{and for the}} nation. Many participants were accused of being communists, such as John Davies and John Service. Both were subjected to multiple Congressional investigations that consistently found {{that they were not}} Communist Party members, agents of foreign powers, or disloyal to the United States. This did not spare Service from termination at the State Department. He appealed this decision and ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in his favor. Davies was exiled from China, his field of expertise, by Hurley. Then he was hounded from a position in Russia to an inconsequential post in South America. Davies resigned that position and began manufacturing furniture. Hurley accused Colonel David Barrett of sabotaging his diplomacy with <b>the</b> <b>KMT</b> and the CPC. He succeeded in preventing Barrett from promotion to brigadier general, even though Barrett's promotion was endorsed by the theater commander, General Albert C. Wedemeyer. Barrett was retained in the China Theater, but placed in an inferior position.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Li and Chen, the CPC developed {{a close relationship with}} the Soviet controlled Comintern. At the direction of the Comintern, Li and Chen were inducted into the Kuomintang in 1922. Li was elected to <b>the</b> <b>KMT's</b> Central Executive Committee in 1924.|$|R
25|$|Generally it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that <b>the</b> <b>kMTs</b> fiber (<b>the</b> bundle of microtubules bound to the kinetochore) is originated by the capture of MTs polymerized at the centrosomes and spindle poles in mammalian cultured cells. However, MTs directly polymerized at kinetochores might also contribute significantly. The {{manner in which the}} centromeric region or kinetochore initiates <b>the</b> formation of <b>kMTs</b> and <b>the</b> frequency at which this happens are important questions, because this mechanism may contribute not only to the initial formation of kMTs, but also {{to the way in which}} kinetochores correct defective anchoring of MTs and regulate <b>the</b> movement along <b>kMTs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>KMT's</b> [...] "Second Revolution" [...] {{ended in}} failure as Yuan's troops {{achieved}} complete victory over revolutionary uprisings.
