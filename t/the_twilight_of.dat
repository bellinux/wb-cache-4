5|$|Gallaher's {{brother-in-law}} Bolla Francis {{played for}} Ponsonby, Auckland and New Zealand sides {{for a number}} of years, including when Gallaher was a selector. In 1911, at age 29, and in <b>the</b> <b>twilight</b> <b>of</b> his All Blacks' career, he decided to switch to the professional sport of rugby league. Francis went on to represent New Zealand in rugby league, making him a dual-code international. It is unlikely his switch to rugby league was done without Gallaher's knowledge. Francis did eventually return to rugby union as a coach.|$|E
5|$|The radar {{contacts}} were, in fact, {{the approaching}} 31 Japanese torpedo bombers, who circled {{around to the}} south of TF18 so that they could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them. From this direction, the Japanese bombers were hidden by the night sky, but Giffen's ships were silhouetted against <b>the</b> <b>twilight</b> <b>of</b> the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships.|$|E
5|$|This {{ambiguity}} of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, {{and as he}} grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing. Indeed, {{by the age of}} eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had died by war or disease. Having spent the greater part of his early life in <b>the</b> <b>twilight</b> <b>of</b> Nero's reign, his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the political turmoil of the 60s, culminating with the civil war of 69, which brought his family to power.|$|E

5|$|Wes Gephart, {{though his}} {{personal}} brilliance {{and ability to}} attract investment, was able to cover the decline to some extent. By his death in 1905, he had assembled a seemingly puissant empire of two iron furnaces, extensive ore mines, and two railroads. But even during his lifetime, Bellefonte had seen {{the end of its}} glory: after 1890, its population, heretofore steadily growing, would decline for the next thirty years. Nor did Gephart's empire long survive him; little more than a decade after his death, the furnaces were demolished, the mines shut down, and one railroad scrapped. Only the Central Railroad remained, staggering to a pauper's grave in 1918, sold for the wartime price its scrap could bring. The era of Nittany Furnace was <b>the</b> <b>twilight</b> <b>of</b> ironmaking in Bellefonte. Though not fully apparent at the time, neither the rising lime industry nor any other would replace ironmaking as the guarantor of the town's prosperity. The fall of the furnaces marked the beginning of a long decline which would see Bellefonte supplanted by State College as the nexus of activity in Centre County.|$|E

The coordination turned out to be poor and the large force gathered by John III for a Danube offensive conducted no significant military operations.

Each new season required that Petipa create a new Grand ballet, to stage the dance sections for various operas, and to prepare galas and divertissements for court performances, royal nuptials, etc.|$|E

25|$|But {{during her}} mature prime in the 1870s and '80s, Patti {{had been a}} more enterprising singer, proving to be an {{effective}} actress in those lyric roles that required the summoning forth of deep emotions, such as Gilda in Rigoletto, Leonora in Il trovatore, the title part in Semiramide, Zerlina in Don Giovanni and Violetta in La traviata. She also had been prepared to tackle quite dramatic parts in operas like L'Africaine, Les Huguenots and even Aida. She never attempted to sing any verismo parts, however, because these became popular only in <b>the</b> <b>twilight</b> <b>of</b> her career, during the final decade of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Dionysus has {{remained}} {{an inspiration to}} artists, philosophers and writers into the modern era. In The Birth of Tragedy (1872), the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proposed that a tension between Apollonian and Dionysian aesthetic principles underlay the development of Greek tragedy; Dionysus represented what was unrestrained chaotic and irrational, while Apollo represented the rational and ordered. Nietzsche claimed that the oldest forms of Greek Tragedy were entirely based on suffering of Dionysus. In Nietzsche's 1886 work Beyond Good and Evil, and later works <b>The</b> <b>Twilight</b> <b>of</b> the Idols, The Antichrist and Ecce Homo, Dionysus is conceived {{as the embodiment of}} the unrestrained will to power.|$|E
25|$|Misotheistic and/or dystheistic {{expression}} has a {{long history}} in the arts and in literature. Bernard Schweizer’s book Hating God: The Untold Story of Misotheism is devoted to this topic. He traces the history of ideas behind misotheism from the Book of Job, via Epicureanism and <b>the</b> <b>twilight</b> <b>of</b> Roman paganism, to deism, anarchism, Nietzschean philosophy, feminism, and radical humanism. The main literary figures in his study are Percy Bysshe Shelley, Algernon Swinburne, Zora Neale Hurston, Rebecca West, Elie Wiesel, Peter Shaffer, and Philip Pullman. Schweizer argues that literature is the preferred medium for the expression of God-hatred because the creative possibilities of literature allow writers to simultaneously unburden themselves of their misotheism, while ingeneously veiling their blasphemy.|$|E
