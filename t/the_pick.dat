40|$|<b>The</b> <b>picking</b> {{system and}} <b>the</b> layout of <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> area are <b>the</b> key drivers for the {{evaluation}} of a warehouse picking cost. There are five variants for organizing <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> process of orders in a warehouse. The choice of a specific variant depends on the total cost of <b>picking.</b> <b>The</b> <b>picking</b> cost is evaluated within an uninterrupted picking process. It means that no stock out occurs in the time period of <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> process. <b>The</b> storing area and <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> area are created as two separate zones for <b>picking</b> quantities of <b>the</b> customer’s orders; the principle of division of orders is observed strictly. Referring to the locations of stock keeping units (SKU), two approaches of the layout of SKU in <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> area can be estimated. The first one is <b>the</b> single <b>picking</b> location for each single SKU, where replenishment is realized in <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> process. <b>The</b> second one - various picking locations for each single SKU, and the replenishment here is realized just only prior to a picking process or after it. The main benefits of the economy of <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> cost as far as these two approaches are concerned are <b>the</b> shortest <b>picking</b> route in <b>the</b> first case and one common replenishment option in the second case...|$|R

5|$|Davis was {{selected}} by the Philadelphia Eagles as the eighth overall selection in the 1991 NFL Draft, one pick after former Tennessee teammate Charles McRae {{was selected}} by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It {{was the first time}} in NFL history that two former college teammates who played the same position were drafted back-to-back. Davis was the first draft pick by new Eagles head coach Rich Kotite. The Eagles traded up from the 19th pick with the Green Bay Packers to select Davis, giving Green Bay the 19th selection (which was used on cornerback Vinnie Clark) and a first-round pick in the 1992 NFL Draft. <b>The</b> <b>pick</b> in 1992 ended up being the 17th selection, and the Packers traded it to the Atlanta Falcons for quarterback Brett Favre on February 10, 1992.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Picking</b> peanuts is <b>the</b> key {{operational}} link and {{the core}} technology of peanut combine harvester. On the basis the theoretical analysis of picking mechanism and structural parameters of <b>the</b> half-feed <b>picking</b> roller, and combined with <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> performance experimental, <b>the</b> structural parameters of <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> blades and blades quantity of picking roller were studied. The results show that: when the straight-shaped blade is <b>picking,</b> <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> force is strong, the broken branch and seedling phenomenon is serious, peanut broken rate and peanut with handle rate are higher; the arc-shaped blade reduced peanut damage, and effectively reduced {{the rate of}} the peanut with handle. <b>The</b> <b>picking</b> blade radian has a large impact to the peanut broken and loss rate. When the blade radian is 70 ° and the blade radius is 35 mm, total loss rate is the lowest on <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> segment of <b>the</b> blade. The blade quantity has significant influence to the peanut broken and loss rate. The peanut broken rate of the 8 blades is 2 to 3 times of the 4 and 6 blades; <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> net rate of the 4 blades is much lower than 6 and 8 blades. <b>The</b> self-design <b>the</b> <b>picking</b> roller is 6 arc-shaped blades, the blade radius is 35 mm, and the blade radian is 70 °.

5|$|The Smokers {{began their}} innings {{late on the}} first day. By that stage, the pitch had {{deteriorated}} and light was poor, making batting more difficult. By {{the end of the}} day's play forty minutes later, they had lost four wickets and only scored 25 runs. They fared better the following morning, but only three batsmen reached double figures—Billy Gunn, 18, Monty Bowden, 29, and Charles Clarke, 20 not out—as they were bowled out for 111 just before the lunch break. W. G. Grace was <b>the</b> <b>pick</b> of the bowlers, taking five wickets for 29 runs. A first-innings deficit of 139 runs meant that the Smokers were forced to follow on.|$|E
5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes during the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 365/8, with Evans unbeaten on 47. Johnston had <b>the</b> <b>pick</b> of the bowling figures, with 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller {{at the start of}} the morning, which would help break up the wicket and make it more likely to spin. Bradman had done a similar thing during the previous Ashes series in Australia before setting England a target. The hosts needed to beat Australia to avoid a series defeat. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his opinion that such a device would make the surface less favourable for batting.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, Auerbach relinquished {{his general}} {{managing}} duties and became president and later vice-chairman of the Boston Celtics. In a surprising move after winning their 15th title, he traded popular guard Gerald Henderson, the game 2 {{hero in the}} finals against the Lakers, for Seattle's first round draft pick in 1986. Two years later, after the Celtics defeated Houston in the finals for their 16th championship, he used the second overall pick in the 1986 draft, <b>the</b> <b>pick</b> acquired from Seattle, to take college prodigy Len Bias from Maryland, arguably the most brilliant coup in Auerbach's stellar career. With the team's star players still in their prime, the defending champions appeared set to compete at the top for years. However, tragedy struck just two days later, when Bias died of a cocaine overdose. Several years later, Celtics star player Reggie Lewis died suddenly in 1993, and without any league compensation for either loss, the team fell into decline, not seeing another Finals in Auerbach's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Urlacher {{was awarded}} the Ed Block Courage Award, given to those who showed a {{commitment}} to sportsmanship and courage. During his award acceptance speech, Urlacher thanked the Bears for their support after his mother Lavoyda Lenard died. Against the Tennessee Titans in Week 9, Urlacher intercepted Matt Hasselbeck, and returned <b>the</b> <b>pick</b> 46 yards for a touchdown. Urlacher led the Bears in tackles until Week 13 against the Seahawks, in which he sustained a hamstring injury that sidelined him {{for the remainder of}} the season. Urlacher became an unrestricted free agent on March 12, 2013. On March 20, the Bears announced that Urlacher will not return in 2013 after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a new contract. Urlacher later belittled Phil Emery's contract negotiations with him as 'lip service', and stated the Bears had little intention to re-sign him. In 2015, Urlacher told ESPN that he still respected the Bears organization and front office, but has yet to speak to Emery, who was fired in 2014.|$|E
