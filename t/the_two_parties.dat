5|$|Fransen {{failed to}} explain to the Bradleys that he was not the owner of the concept, and Chamberlin was unhappy with the fact that someone {{overseas}} was copying his idea. After some acrimony between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties,</b> a deal was struck between them in 1966, whereby they would both continue to manufacture instruments independently. Bradmatic renamed themselves Streetly Electronics in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Other historians regard {{politics}} as a stronger factor within the conclave than pure simony, with the personal rivalvry between Giuliano della Rovere and Ascanio Sforza (who had met to discuss the upcoming conclave in Castel Gandolfo even before Innocent VII had died) substituting for the ancient struggle between Naples and Milan, with the intractability between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> making Borja a viable candidate.|$|E

5|$|After his release, Kenyatta {{set about}} trying to ensure {{that he was the}} only {{realistic}} option as Kenya's future leader. In August he met with the Governor of Kenya, Patrick Muir Renison, at Kiambu, and he was interviewed by the BBC's Face to Face program. In August he also attended a KANU-KADU meeting, where <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> disagreed on the question of federalism: KANU wanted a centralised state while KADU feared that this would result in Kikuyu dominance of an independent Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Alexander fled Macedon {{with his}} mother, {{dropping}} her {{off with her}} brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and {{was treated as a}} guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties.</b>|$|E

The feasibility study was conducted between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> and {{the decision was made}} to proceed with free trade negotiations, which are expected to start before the end of 2016. Experts believe the negotiations will take around 2 to 3 years to finish.|$|E
5|$|By enfranchising racial minorities, the Act {{facilitated}} {{a political}} realignment of the Democratic and Republican parties. Between 1890 and 1965, minority disenfranchisement allowed conservative Southern Democrats to dominate Southern politics. After Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Act into law, newly enfranchised racial minorities began {{to vote for}} liberal Democratic candidates throughout the South, and Southern white conservatives began to switch their party registration from Democrat to Republican en masse. These dual trends caused <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> to ideologically polarize, with the Democratic Party becoming more liberal and the Republican Party becoming more conservative. The trends also created competition between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties,</b> which Republicans capitalized on by implementing the Southern strategy. Over the subsequent decades, the creation of majority-minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments. By packing liberal-leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority-minority districts, large numbers of surrounding districts became more solidly white, conservative, and Republican. While this increased the elected representation of racial minorities as intended, it also decreased white Democratic representation and increased the representation of Republicans overall. By the mid-1990s, these trends culminated in a political realignment: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party became more ideologically polarized and defined as liberal and conservative parties, respectively; and both parties came to compete for electoral success in the South, with the Republican Party controlling most of Southern politics.|$|E
5|$|CDTM is an {{expansion}} of the traditional pharmacist scope of practice, allowing for pharmacist-lead management of drug related problems (DRPs) with an emphasis on a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to pharmacy practice in the healthcare setting. The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist and physician, though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific to a patient population of interest to <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties,</b> a specific clinical situation or disease state, and/or may outline an evidence-based protocol for managing the drug regimen of patients under the CPA. CPAs have become the subject of intense debate within the pharmacy and medical professions.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>party</b> {{setting is}} {{particularly}} interesting, {{not only from}} an applications perspective but also because special techniques can be applied in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>party</b> setting which do not apply in the multi-party case. Indeed, secure multi-party computation (in fact the restricted case of secure function evaluation, where only a single function is evaluated) was first presented in the two-party setting. The original work is often cited as being from one of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> papers of Yao; although the papers do not actually contain what {{is now known as}} Yao's garbled circuit protocol.|$|R

5|$|During {{its early}} years, the Centre Democrats {{received}} extensive media attention on two occasions.

A group of anti-fascist activists believed that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> were planning to merge, and firebombed the hotel where the meeting was held. The venue was severely damaged, Janmaat narrowly escaped death and the party secretary Wil Schuurman had one leg amputated after jumping from a window to escape the conflagration.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the Maryland Agricultural College hired Byrd as an {{instructor}} in English and history, {{and he was}} named the {{head coach of the}} track and baseball teams, the latter of which he coached through 1923. According to author David Ungrady in Tales from the Maryland Terrapins, the university initially offered Byrd $300 to coach football, but he demanded $1,200. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> came to agree upon that salary for all of his coaching and teaching duties which spanned nine months of the year. Byrd also worked as a sportswriter for The Washington Star, a job he held until 1932.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Google {{entered into}} {{negotiations}} with Yelp {{to acquire the}} company, but <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> failed to reach an agreement. According to The New York Times, Google offered more than $500 million, but the deal fell through after Yahoo offered $1 billion. Tech Crunch reported that Google refused to match Yahoo's offer. Both offers were later abandoned following a disagreement between Yelp's management and board of directors about the offers. In June 2015, Yelp published a study alleging Google was altering search results to benefit its own online services.|$|E

2500|$|There were renewed {{calls for}} <b>the</b> <b>two</b> rural <b>parties</b> to reunify.

However <b>the</b> <b>two</b> parliamentary <b>parties</b> remained as separate entities because the three sitting National Country Party MLAs (Dick Old, Bert Crane and Peter Jones) refused to work with Cowan and Stephens. On 29 January 1985 the parliamentary National Country Party was formally dissolved. The sitting MLCs joined the National party, however all three sitting MLAs {{refused to accept the}} merger and instead joined the Liberal Party.|$|R

5|$|Incumbent Prime Minister Kiviniemi {{said that}} she was ready to work with any party in Finland. When pressed by the media she {{said that she}} would not rule out working with the True Finns pending {{cooperation}} on negotiating a government platform. The True Finns and the Green League have both confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> are ideologically too far from each other to sit in the same coalition. The True Finns' main campaign issues—lowering refugee quotas and cutting foreign aid and Finland's financial contribution to the EU—were seen as a possible hindrance to coalition talks.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{troops of}} the {{competing}} Archbishops of Cologne fought {{for control of the}} Electorate; within a few months, the local feud between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> expanded to include supporters from the Electorate of the Palatinate on the Protestant side, and the Duchy of Bavaria on the Catholic side. Italian mercenaries hired with papal gold augmented the Catholic force. In 1586, the conflict expanded further, with direct involvement of the Spanish Netherlands for the Catholic side, and tertiary involvement from Henry III of France and Elizabeth I of England on the Protestant side.|$|E
5|$|John then {{travelled}} to France for diplomatic negotiations, {{before returning}} to England. Gaveston was exiled by the Ordainers but later made an irregular return. Gaveston was killed in June 1312 by Thomas of Lancaster and other nobles. It fell upon John, together with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, to reconcile <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> after this event. In 1313 he followed Edward II on a state visit to France, and thereafter generally remained a trusted subject. In 1318 he witnessed the Treaty of Leake, which restored Edward to full power.|$|E
50|$|A {{so-called}} {{third party}} in the United Kingdom are the Liberal Democrats. In the 2010 election, the Liberal Democrats received 23% of the votes but only 9% of {{the seats in the}} House of Commons. While electoral results do not necessarily translate into legislative seats, the Liberal Democrats can exert influence if there is a situation such as a hung parliament. In this instance, neither of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> main <b>parties</b> (at present, the Conservative Party and the Labour Party) have sufficient authority to run the government. Accordingly, the Liberal Democrats can in theory exert tremendous influence in such a situation since they can ally with one of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> main <b>parties</b> to form a coalition. This happened in the Coalition government of 2010. Yet in that more than 13% of the seats in the British House of Commons are held in 2011 by representatives of political <b>parties</b> other than <b>the</b> <b>two</b> leading political <b>parties</b> of that nation, contemporary Britain is considered by some to be a multi-party system, and not a two-party system. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>party</b> system in <b>the</b> United Kingdom allows for other parties to exist, although <b>the</b> main <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> tend to dominate politics; in this arrangement, other parties are not excluded and can win seats in Parliament. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>party</b> system in <b>the</b> United States {{has been described as a}} duopoly or an enforced two-party system, such that politics is almost entirely dominated by either the Republicans or Democrats, and third parties rarely win seats in Congress.|$|R

5|$|Miller's form {{mirrored}} {{the rest of}} the Hibs team as it went into a slump in 2010, leading to the departure of Hughes. New manager Colin Calderwood signed three new midfielders in January 2011 and left Miller out of the starting lineup for two games soon afterwards. Calderwood expressed hope that improved results would bring better form out of Miller, who he described as a top-level player. Miller expressed a desire to stay at Hibs in March 2011, but <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>parties</b> did not agree a new contract, which allowed him to leave the club.|$|E
