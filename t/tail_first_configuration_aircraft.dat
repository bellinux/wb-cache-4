2500|$|The Halberstadt D.II was a biplane fighter {{aircraft}} of the [...] Luftstreitkräfte (Imperial German Army Air Service) {{that served}} through {{the period of}} Allied air superiority in early 1916. As the <b>first</b> biplane <b>configuration</b> fighter <b>aircraft</b> to serve in combat for the German Empire, it had begun to be superseded in the Jagdstaffeln and other early German fighter units by the superior Albatros fighters {{in the second half}} of the year, although small numbers of Halberstadts continued in use well into 1917.|$|R

25|$|O'Gorman {{devised a}} system of categorising {{aircraft}} according to their layout. Pusher <b>configuration</b> <b>aircraft</b> with a forward elevator {{in addition to a}} rear-mounted tailplane and rudder carried on booms were designated as Farman Type, after the highly successful and widely imitated Farman III. Canard <b>configuration</b> <b>aircraft</b> became Santos Type, after Alberto Santos Dumont's 14-bis <b>aircraft,</b> and tractor <b>configuration</b> <b>aircraft</b> were designated Blériot Type after Louis Blériot's Type XI, a system set forth in an article entitled Some Problems in Aircraft Design published in Flight in 1911. Accordingly De Havilland's aircraft was renamed the Farman Experimental I, or F.E.1.|$|R

50|$|The Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.6 was a two-seat biplane {{floatplane}} {{built by}} the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service aircraft factory Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk in 1921. The M.F.6 was designed and employed as a trainer aircraft. The type was the last pusher <b>configuration</b> <b>aircraft</b> in service with the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service. The M.F.6 functioned as a makeshift solution until a more modern tractor <b>configuration</b> <b>aircraft</b> could be built. The type was retired once a more permanent solution to the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service's training needs was found in mid-1920s.|$|R

50|$|There is no carburated {{version of}} the engine, {{which would have been}} {{designated}} O-720 and therefore the base model is the IO-720. The IO-720 and the Jabiru 5100 are the only flat-eight <b>configuration</b> <b>aircraft</b> engines currently in production.|$|R

25|$|The {{period of}} service of the Bristol Scout (1914–1916) marked {{the genesis of the}} fighter {{aircraft}} as a distinct type and many of the earliest attempts to arm British tractor <b>configuration</b> <b>aircraft</b> with forward-firing guns were tested in action using Bristol Scouts. These began with the arming of the second Scout B, RFC number 648, with two rifles, one each side, aimed outwards and forwards to clear the propeller arc.|$|R
50|$|The Napier Lion was a 12-cylinder 'broad arrow' W12 <b>configuration</b> <b>aircraft</b> engine {{built by}} D. Napier & Son from 1917 until the 1930s.
