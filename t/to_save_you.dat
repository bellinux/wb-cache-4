500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Savior" [...] {{deviates}} {{from the}} social and political topics normally discussed in Rise Against songs, and is instead about forgiveness and broken relationships. It {{tells the story of a}} couple who have recently split up. The two attempt to reconcile their differences, with lines such as [...] "I don't hate you, boy / I just want <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>you</b> while there's still something left to save." [...] Hanson and Liz Ramanand of Loudwire have characterized the lyrics as [...] "poignant", and [...] "poetic".|$|E
500|$|Lukather's {{approach}} to engineering his {{sound in the}} studio is usually simple. He is not known for doing {{a large number of}} takes or for incorporating much overdubbing—rather, he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts. He has said about this approach: [...] "If a solo didn't work—either because I didn't have the right sound, or because I wasn't inspired at that moment—I'd just move on. A part either works or it doesn't. You can't batter it into submission, or force inspiration <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>you.</b> It's always better to just surrender, and then come back later to give it a go with fresh ears." [...] Although he enjoys the technical mastery that is possible in the studio, Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage. He has stated that dynamics are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality.|$|E
500|$|Still, Achebe {{seeks to}} portray neither moral absolutes nor a fatalistic inevitability. In 1972, he said: [...] "I never {{will take the}} stand that the Old must win or that the New must win. The point is that no single truth {{satisfied}} me—and this is well founded in the Ibo world view. No single man can be correct all the time, no single idea can be totally correct." [...] His perspective {{is reflected in the}} words of Ikem, a character in Anthills of the Savannah: [...] "whatever you are is never enough; you {{must find a way to}} accept something, however small, from the other to make you whole and <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>you</b> from the mortal sin of righteousness and extremism." [...] And in a 1996 interview, Achebe said: [...] "Belief in either radicalism or orthodoxy is too simplified a way of viewing things... Evil is never all evil; goodness on the other hand is often tainted with selfishness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Williams {{developed}} {{the concept of}} co-inherence and gave rare consideration to the theology of romantic love. Falling in love for Williams {{was a form of}} mystical envisioning in which one saw the beloved as he or she was seen through the eyes of God. Co-inherence was a term used in Patristics theology to describe the relationship between the human and divine natures of Jesus Christ, and the relationship between the persons of the blessed Trinity. Williams extended the term to include the ideal relationship between the individual parts of God's creation, including human beings. It is our mutual indwelling: Christ in us and we in Christ, interdependent. [...] It is also the web of interrelationships, social and economic and ecological, by which the social fabric and the natural world function. But especially for Williams, co-inherence is a way of talking about the Body of Christ and the communion of saints. For Williams, salvation was not a solitary affair: [...] "The thread of the love of God was strong enough <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>you</b> and all the others, but not strong enough <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>you</b> alone." [...] He proposed an order, the Companions of the Co-inherence, who would practice substitution and exchange, living in love-in-God, truly bearing one another's burdens, being willing to sacrifice and to forgive, living from and for one another in Christ. According to Gunnar Urang, co-inherence is the focus of all Williams's novels.|$|E
2500|$|Just after 3pm on Sunday, 4 December 2005, {{police were}} called to North Cronulla Beach {{following}} a report of an assault on two off-duty surf lifesavers by four {{members of a group}} of eight Middle Eastern men. A verbal exchange had taken place after three lifesavers approached a group of four young Lebanese men on Cronulla Beach with both groups accusing the other of staring at them. One of the Lebanese men reportedly responded to the accusations, [...] "I'm allowed to; now fuck off and leave our beach", to which a lifesaver responded, [...] "I come down here out of my own spare time <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>you</b> dumb cunts from drowning; now piss off, you scum".|$|E
2500|$|Pete Vonder Haar of the Film Threat {{gave the}} film a mixed review, stating: [...] "It's a {{reasonably}} entertaining actioner, and Zwick doesn't {{shy away from}} depicting violence or the horrors of war, but as a social statement it falls a little short. And emeralds are prettier anyway." [...] Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle also gave the film a mixed review, he stated: [...] "While the film never quite reaches the emotional peaks it so obviously seeks to scale, Zwick's film is still potent enough <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>you</b> three months salary." [...] Nathan Lee of the Village Voice, like Vonder Haar and Savlov, also gave the film a mixed review, stating that [...] "De Beers can relax; the only indignation stirred up by Blood Diamond won't be among those who worry about where their jewelry came from, but with audiences incensed by facile politics and bad storytelling." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film [...] "C", he stated: [...] "Much like Zwick's Glory and The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond strives to be an [...] "important" [...] film while stopping well short of being genuinely provocative and artistically chancy." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a negative review, stating that [...] "director Edward Zwick {{tried to make a}} great movie, but somewhere in the process he forgot to make a good one." ...|$|E
