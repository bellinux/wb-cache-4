[...] On Queen for an Hour 1989 Interview on BBC Radio1, May listed Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton as his guitar heroes. In a 1991 interview for Guitar World magazine, May referred to the Who as [...] "my inspiration", and on seeing Led Zeppelin stated, [...] "We used <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> guys and think, [...] "That's the way it should be done." [...] May told Guitarist in 2004: [...] "I don't think anyone has epitomised riff writing better than Jimmy Page – he's one of the great brains of rock music". May was also influenced by Steve Hackett, guitarist of progressive rock band Genesis, in particular his harmony guitar solo at the end of the band's epic 1971 song [...] "The Musical Box".|$|E

50|$|After Idrimi's {{success in}} {{establishing}} a peaceful agreement with King Barattarna of Mitanni sometime around 1490 BC, most of his actions as king are vaguely written and are limited to only smaller sources. Tablets 1 and 2 at the British Museum are great primary sources about Idrimi's actions during his rule, but it's not enough <b>to</b> just <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>those</b> two tablets as a whole description of Idrimi's rule. Strong scholarly consensus argued by ancient Syro-Palestine scholars Dominique Collon and Gary Oller also suggested that Idrimi led cross-border raids into Hittite territory during his rule. According to Collon, he raided Hittite territory and used the booty from that raid to build his massive palace.|$|R

In this paper we present a number of techniques for correlating performance metrics, which could be sampled at different rates, at different lengths and overlapping intervals, and with different response times to a common system event. We also discuss how to assess {{the reliability of the}} correlations we compute and how to efficiently find relationships of interest. 1...|$|R

40|$|In Tussen salon en souterrain (Between Upstairs and Downstairs) the {{presence}} of governesses in the Netherlands between 1800 and 1940 is discussed {{for the first time}} at greath length. Reliable sources for the story of this 'teacher in the margin' are not readily available and are often of a patchy nature. Nevertheless, the existence of the governess in Amsterdam canal houses, country seats on the River Vecht, castles of the provinces of Overijssel and Gelderland, Frision estates and residence in The Hague was noticed, described and narrated in confined levels of society. As a result, governesses are still remembered in the Netherlands to this day.
