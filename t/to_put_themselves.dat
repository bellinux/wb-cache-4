25|$|Late in {{the tackle}} count the attacking side {{will start to}} think defensively in {{anticipation}} of a handover, also known as a changeover or turnover. That is, whilst most kicks performed at this time will be primarily for attacking purposes, there is always a defensive element to consider. The attacking team uses these tactics <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>themselves</b> in the better defensive position when their set of six ends at the 'change over'.|$|E

25|$|When {{the parties}} express a clear {{intention}} in a choice-of-law clause, {{there is a}} rebuttable presumption {{that this is the}} proper law because it reflects the parties' freedom of contract and it produces certainty of outcome. It can only be rebutted when the choice is not bona fide, it produces illegality, or it breaches public policy. For example, the parties may have selected the particular law to evade the operation of otherwise mandatory provisions of the law which has the closest connection with the contract. The parties are not free <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>themselves</b> above the law and, in such cases, it will be for the parties to prove that there is a valid reason for selecting that law other than evasion.|$|E

The Brumbies {{defeated the}} Western Force in an all-Australian derby by just two points and the Reds won their second {{game of the}} season defeating the Cheetahs. Ben Tune (who is leaving the club after the season) scored the winning try in that match, but the match of the round saw the Chiefs defeat the Sharks <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>themselves</b> in contention for a semi-final spot. The Waratahs lost to the Highlanders by a point after Peter Hewat missed another conversion, and in a South African derby, the Bulls thrashed the Lions 31–7. Finally, the Blues lost their away match to the Stormers, but they remain second in the table nonetheless.|$|E
25|$|Although the Admiralty had {{instructed}} Parker to frustrate the League, by force if necessary, {{he was a}} naturally cautious person and moved slowly. He wanted to blockade the Baltic despite {{the danger of the}} combination of fleets; Nelson wanted to ignore Denmark and Sweden, who were both reluctant partners in the alliance, and instead sail to the Baltic to fight the Russians. In the end Nelson was able to persuade Sir Hyde to attack the Danish fleet currently concentrated off Copenhagen. Promised naval support for the Danes from Karlskrona, in Sweden, did not arrive perhaps because of adverse winds. The Prussians had only minimal naval forces and also could not assist. On 30 March, the British force passed through the narrows between Denmark and Sweden, sailing close to the Swedish coast <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>themselves</b> as far from the Danish guns as possible; fortunately for the British, the Swedish batteries remained silent.|$|E

60|$|I {{should have}} said that, principally with a view <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> <b>themselves</b> in a {{position}} to confute each other, ever since we had started from Marseilles both Bastin and Bickley spent a number of hours each day in assiduous study of the language of the South Sea Islands. It became a kind of competition between them as to which could learn the most. Now Bastin, although simple and even stupid in some ways, was a good scholar, and as I knew at college, had quite a faculty for acquiring languages in which he had taken high marks at examinations. Bickley, too, was an extraordinarily able person with an excellent memory, especially when he was on his mettle. The result was that before we ever reached a South Sea island they had a good working knowledge of the local tongues.|$|R
25|$|A forced fumble with 22 {{seconds left}} in the game gave the Mountaineers a 28–27 win over James Madison. The Dukes {{controlled}} the game in practically every statistical category, most notably the time of possession, which was over 40 minutes. James Madison's quarterback, Rodney Landers, led the dukes with 253 yards of total offense. Armanti Edwards accounted for 258 total yards of offense for the Mountaineers. The Mountaineers were down 27–22 with less than two minutes remaining in the game and facing fourth down. Edwards found the end zone after completing a pass to Devon Moore to put the Mountaineers ahead 28–27. On the ensuing possession, the Dukes drove 62 yards down the field <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>themselves</b> within easy field goal range. James Madison head coach Mickey Matthews made the decision to run one more play which resulted in a fumble. Defensive end Gary Tharrington knocked the ball from the grasp of the Dukes' running back, Jamal Sullivan, and it was recovered by linebacker Pierre Banks to give the Mountaineers an improbable win in front of 14,040 fans at Kidd Brewer Stadium.|$|E
25|$|The {{threat of}} his nephew staging another coup against him greatly worried Hattušiliš {{during a time}} when he faced a {{considerable}} threat from the Assyrians in the east. During the reign of his predecessor the Assyrian king had taken Hanigalbat which had been a vassal territory under Hittite control. This aggression strained {{the relationship between the two}} countries however more importantly the Assyrians appeared <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>themselves</b> in the position to launch further attacks across the Euphrates River. The recognized threat of Assyrian invasion proved a strong motivator for the Hittites to open up negotiations with Egypt. It was this certainty about the 'Assyrian danger' that pushed the Hatti into a relationship with Egypt. Under the terms of the treaty the Egyptians would be obligated to join with their Hatti allies if Assyria invaded Hittite territory. Besides this threat to the east, Hattušiliš recognized the need to strengthen his relationship with his Egyptian neighbors. The competition that had existed between Hatti and Egypt over the Syrian lands was no longer an interest to Hattušiliš. In fact, Trevor Bryce argues that Hattušiliš was satisfied with his current holdings in Syria, and any further expansion of Hittite territory southward was both unjustifiable and undesirable.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} game, Karachi Kings lost to Peshawar Zalmi by 7 wickets in one-sided affair that saw them post {{a target of}} just 118 in their 20 overs. In the {{following}} game, against the Quetta Gladiators, the Kings failed to defend 160 and lost by 7 wickets yet again. Even as the tournament progressed to Sharjah, the Kings continued their losing streak. Facing a loss this time to arch-rivals, Lahore Qalandars. The match was closely fought and a partnership of 101 runs between veterans Kumar Sangakkara and Shoaib Malik almost won it for the Kings. But {{in the end they}} fell short of the target of 180 by 7 runs. But in the next game, against defending champions Islamabad United. the team finally managed <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>themselves</b> on the points table. The win came through the Duckworth-Lewis method as the Kings were ahead of the par score by 8 runs when returning rain forced to abandon the already 13-over match. In their final game of the Sharjah leg, the Kings continued their winning streak to get past Peshawar Zalmi in a thrilling contest. Setting up a target of 175, the Kings had the Zalmis reduced to 69-6 before Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy combined in a 70-run partnership that almost won the game for the Zalmis. However, the King's bowling prevailed in the end to give their team a 9-run victory.|$|E

The professor insisted that more appropriate rehabilitation programs, like substance abuse or family reunification programs, should be implemented with as much coordination and vigor. The detention workers disagreed with the assessment, deeming the activities to {{be an integral part of}} rehabilitation.

Beaver noted, [...] "Bobby is old enough that he's fairly clear-headed about what the priorities ought to be.
