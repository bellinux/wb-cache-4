40|$|The idea of {{approximating}} {{a distribution}} is a prominent problem in statistics. This dissertation explores {{the theory of}} <b>principal</b> <b>points</b> and <b>principal</b> curves as approximation methods to a distribution. <b>Principal</b> <b>points</b> of a distribution have been initially introduced by Flury (1990) who tackled the problem of optimal grouping in multivariate data.

First, we show theoretically that the calibration is unique up to an orthogonal transformation under the assumption that the skew of the camera is zero. Auto-calibration is possible by analyzing inter-image homographies computed from the matches in images of the same scene. In general, at least four homographies are needed for auto-calibration. When we further assume that the aspect ratio is known and the <b>principal</b> <b>point</b> is fixed during the sequence then one homography yields camera parameters, and when the aspect ratio is assumed to be unknown with fixed <b>principal</b> <b>point</b> then two homographies are enough.

It provides an optimal n-point-approximation of the distribution. However, it is in general difficult to find a set of <b>principal</b> <b>points</b> of a multivariate distribution. Tarpey et al. [T. Tarpey, L. Li, B. Flury, <b>Principal</b> <b>points</b> and self-consistent points of elliptical distributions, Ann.

The <b>principal</b> <b>point</b> can be approximated well by {{the center of the}} imaged mirror contour in practice or can be accurately estimated by quadric equations.
