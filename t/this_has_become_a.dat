25|$|One of {{the most}} direct ways humans are {{interacting}} with monarchs is by rearing them in captivity, which has become increasingly popular, although there are risks to this activity, and <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> controversial topic. On the one hand there are many positive aspects of captive rearing. Monarchs are bred in schools and used for butterfly releases at hospices, memorial events and weddings. Memorial services for the September 11 attacks include the release of captive-bred monarchs. Monarchs are used in schools and nature centers for educational purposes. Many homeowners raise monarchs in captivity as a hobby and for educational purposes.|$|E
25|$|Land use {{change is}} {{fundamental}} to {{the operations of the}} biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles. Management of the Earth's atmosphere involves assessment of all aspects of the carbon cycle to identify opportunities to address human-induced climate change and <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on biodiversity and human communities. Ocean circulation patterns have a strong influence on climate and weather and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms.|$|E

25|$|Managers – Many {{nurses who}} have worked in {{clinical}} settings {{for a long time}} choose to leave clinical nursing and join the ranks of the NHS and independent care sector management.

Nonetheless, many nurses fill positions in the senior management structure of NHS organisations and independent healthcare organisations, some even as board members or directors. Others choose to stay a little closer to their clinical roots by becoming regional managers, service managers, clinical nurse managers or Modern Matrons.|$|E
25|$|Plasmodium vivax {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} in tropical countries, but is absent or rare in a large region in West and Central Africa, as recently confirmed by PCR species typing. This gap in distribution {{has been attributed to}} the lack of expression of the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) on the red cells of many sub-Saharan Africans. Duffy negative individuals are homozygous for a DARC allele, carrying a single nucleotide mutation (DARC 46 T → C), which impairs promoter activity by disrupting a binding site for the hGATA1 erythroid lineage transcription factor. In widely cited in vitro and in vivo studies, Miller et al. reported that the Duffy blood group is the receptor for P. vivax and that the absence of the Duffy blood group on red cells is the resistance factor to P. vivax in persons of African descent. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> well-known example of innate resistance to an infectious agent because of the absence of a receptor for the agent on target cells.|$|E

500|$|The Latin name cucullatus ("hooded") {{was first}} used by Juan Eusebio Nieremberg in 1635 as Cygnus cucullatus, in {{reference}} to Carolus Clusius's 1605 depiction of a dodo. In his 18th-century classic work Systema Naturae, Carl Linnaeus used cucullatus as the specific name, but combined it with the genus name Struthio (ostrich). Mathurin Jacques Brisson coined the genus name Raphus (referring to the bustards) in 1760, resulting in the current name Raphus cucullatus. In 1766, Linnaeus coined the new binomial Didus ineptus (meaning [...] "inept dodo"). <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> synonym of the earlier name because of nomenclatural priority.|$|E
