Why did you speak calumny of me to Dr. Grantly behind my back?" ...|$|R
50|$|George Augustine Hyde (July 2, 1923 - May 4, 2010) was an American bishop.

5|$|After much {{lobbying}} {{of local}} officials by Rickey himself, the Royals {{were allowed to}} host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach. Robinson made his Royals debut at Daytona Beach's City Island Ballpark on March 17, 1946, in an exhibition game against the team's parent club, the Dodgers. Robinson thus {{became the first black}} player <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> play for a minor league team against a major league team since the de facto baseball color line had been implemented in the 1880s.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's {{political}} polarity {{continued to}} worsen after the Emancipation Proclamation (1863) made freeing the slaves a war goal. Many of the formerly pro-war Democrats moved <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> oppose the war, and Governor Morton began {{a crackdown on}} dissidents. During one notorious incident in May 1863, the governor had soldiers disrupt a Democratic state convention in Indianapolis, causing what would latter {{be referred to as}} the Battle of Pogue's Run. No regular session of the Indiana General Assembly was convened until June 1865.|$|E

5|$|Muhammad sent three leading Muslims {{to bring}} him details of the recent developments. He advised the men <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be loyal, so as to {{increase}} {{the morale of the}} Muslim fighters. However, he warned against spreading the news of a possible breach of the pact on the Qurayza's part, so as to avoid any panic within Muslim ranks.|$|E
5|$|Siregar {{described}} Kartodikromo as {{the first}} Indonesian writer <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> criticise the Dutch colonial government and the traditional form of feudalism practised in the country; he also notes that the writer w{{as the first}} Indonesian to consciously depict class struggles in his works. As Siregar considered Indonesian literature {{to have been born}} from a nationalist understanding, he considered Marco one of the first truly Indonesian writers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans {{were known to}} {{dominate}} the conversation amongst elite men, and were not afraid <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked {{too much or too}} loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her). When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.|$|E

5|$|Chapman {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{football}} managers in the modern sense of the word, taking full charge of the team, rather than letting board members pick the side. As well as his tactical innovations, he was also a strong believer in physical fitness in football – he instituted a strict training regime and the use of physiotherapists and masseurs. He encouraged his players <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> discuss tactics and the game, instituting weekly team meetings at his clubs, and encouraged them to socialise in extra-curricular activities such as golf. He wrote regularly on football for the Sunday Express newspaper, and a collection of his writings was published after his death in a book, entitled Herbert Chapman on Football.|$|E
5|$|González and Olid {{had arrived}} at an uneasy accord, neither wishing <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> clash with the other. However, Olid's men outnumbered those of his rival, and González had {{made the mistake of}} {{dividing}} his forces when he had left most of his companions {{on the banks of the}} Dulce river; Olid sent one of his captains, Pedro de Briones, to attack one portion of González' forces, while Olid made ready his ships to sail along the coast and attack other detachments. Briones swiftly weakened González' position and captured about half of his men. At this point, Las Casas' fleet appeared off the coast.|$|E
5|$|Justinian now had his pretext, {{and with}} peace {{restored}} on his eastern frontier with Sassanid Persia in 532, he started assembling an invasion force. According to Procopius (The Vandalic War, I.10), {{the news of}} Justinian's {{decision to go to}} war with the Vandals caused great consternation among the capital's elites, in whose minds the disaster of 468 was still fresh. The financial officials resented the expenditure involved, while the military was weary from the Persian war and feared the Vandals' sea-power. The emperor's scheme received support mostly from the Church, reinforced by the arrival of victims of renewed persecutions from Africa. Only the powerful minister John the Cappadocian dared <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> voice his opposition to the expedition, however, and Justinian disregarded it and pressed on with his preparations.|$|E

5|$|Pope John XXII, {{elected in}} 1316, sought Edward's {{support for a}} new crusade, and was also {{inclined}} to support him politically. In 1317, in exchange for papal support in his war with Scotland, Edward agreed to recommence paying the annual Papal tribute, which had been first agreed by King John in 1213; Edward soon ceased the payments, however, and the King never offered his homage, {{another part of the}} 1213 agreement. In 1325 Edward asked Pope John to instruct the Irish Church <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> preach in favour of his right to rule the island, and to threaten to excommunicate any contrary voices.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{returned}} to Normandy, expecting {{to have been}} given both the Duchy and England, to find that William Rufus had crossed the Channel and been crowned king, as William II. The two brothers disagreed fundamentally over the inheritance, and Robert soon began to plan an invasion of England to seize the kingdom, helped by a rebellion {{by some of the}} leading nobles against William Rufus. Henry remained in Normandy and took up a role within Robert's court, possibly either because he was unwilling <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> side with William Rufus, or because Robert might have taken the opportunity to confiscate Henry's inherited money if he had tried to leave. William Rufus sequestered Henry's new estates in England, leaving Henry landless.|$|E
5|$|Supporters {{said that}} the {{publication}} of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of free speech regardless of the validity of the expression, that it was important <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E

5|$|The King and the Queens {{also started}} <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> {{challenge}} Bhimsen's authority. By this time, Rajendra and his wives {{had heard the}} widespread rumor that Bhimsen, {{in order to remain}} in power, had killed the late King Girvan and his wives by administering poison a few days after Girvan's coming off age. So when Rajendra was afflicted by an ordinary illness, the Queens cautioned the King and prohibited him to take the medicine offered by the royal physician, Sardar Ekdev Upadhyay, who was loyal to Bhimsen. Similarly, during the annual muster of 1833, during which the civil and military officers were promoted, renewed, retained, or retired, everything was conducted according to Bhimsen's plan, but Rajendra delayed the retainment of Bhimsen's own position as the mukhtiyar.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{six days}} {{before the start of}} the 1947 season, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues. With Eddie Stanky entrenched at second base for the Dodgers, Robinson played his initial major league season as a first baseman. On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 28 at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, more than 14,000 of whom were black. Although he failed to get a base hit, he walked and scored a run in the Dodgers' 5–3 victory. Robinson became the first player since 1880 <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> break the major league baseball color line. Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams.|$|E
5|$|The rebel barons {{responded by}} {{inviting}} the French prince Louis to lead them: Louis had {{a claim to}} the English throne {{by virtue of his}} marriage to Blanche of Castile, a granddaughter of Henry II. Philip may have provided him with private support but refused <b>to</b> <b>openly</b> support Louis, who was excommunicated by Innocent for taking part in the war against John. Louis' planned arrival in England presented a significant problem for John, as the prince would bring with him naval vessels and siege engines essential to the rebel cause. Once John contained Alexander in Scotland, he marched south to deal with the challenge of the coming invasion.|$|E
