25|$|The Labour Party {{for many}} years lacked an organ in the region Østerdalen. The region was {{to a certain degree}} covered by Hedemarkens Amts Socialdemokrat (Solungen) from 1908, and by Demokraten from September 1909.

In April 1913 the board of the party chapter in Southern Østerdalen (a constituency for general elections) decided <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>working</b> for their own newspaper. They first tried to negotiate with Solungen, but to no avail, and Solungen also went defunct. In May 1915 the party chapter definitely decided to print their own newspaper.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 1890, {{hundreds}} of Yemeni people from Hajz, Al-Baetha, and Taiz migrated to Aden {{to work at}} ports and as laborers.

During World War II, Aden had increasing economic growth and became the second-busiest port in the world after New York City. After the rise of labour unions, a rift was apparent between the sectors of workers and {{the first signs of}} resistance to the occupation started in 1943. Muhammed Ali Luqman founded the first Arabic club and first Arabic school in Aden and was the first <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>working</b> towards a union.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} mentioned, however, {{that there are}} also {{critical}} voices from environmental organisations for example.

Whereas organic farming and the “Bio-Siegel” in Germany for example are legally protected, EU Commission has not yet considered <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>working</b> on a comparable framework or blueprint for Integrated Farming. When products are marketed as “Controlled Integrated Produce”, according control mechanisms and quality-labels are not based on national or European directives but are established and handled by private organisations and quality schemes such as LEAF Marque.|$|E
