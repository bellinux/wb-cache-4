5|$|The first {{large-scale}} organized sit-in was on Saturday, February 13, 1960. At about 12:30 pm, 124 students, {{most of them}} black, {{walked into}} the downtown Woolworths, S. H. Kress, and McClellan stores and asked to be served at the lunch counters. After the staff refused to serve them, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> in the stores for two hours and then left without incident.|$|E
5|$|Calgary {{struggled}} to a 4–7–2 record in November, losing six {{of their last}} seven road games during the month. However, the team ended the month with its star players playing their best games of the season. Kiprusoff recorded his third shutout {{of the season in}} a 3–0 win against the Minnesota Wild while Iginla scored eight goals and 12 points in the final nine games of the month. Though <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> in 14th place in the 15-team Western Conference, the Flames ended November only five points out of a playoff spot. The organization reached a milestone during the month, as Curtis Glencross scored the 10,000th goal {{in the history of the}} Flames franchise during a 3–2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on November 26.|$|E
5|$|The Christian Scientists came in. Before <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down, {{they stood}} on chairs {{and closed the}} transoms over the two doors to the rooms. Then they made their demand: the series must not be published. S.S. scowled at them and said nothing. To fill the silence, Brynner began rather nervously to assure the Scientists that the {{articles}} were not sensational, not offensive; {{that there was no}} cause for apprehension; that all the facts had been most carefully verified.One of the Scientists cut in to suggest that perhaps there would be no objection to publication of the material if the Scientists were permitted to edit it as they might please.|$|E

60|$|Her mother came, and <b>they</b> all <b>sat</b> down to tea, talking casually.|$|R
60|$|After that, <b>they</b> all <b>sat</b> silent; {{the silence}} of Mr. Bazzard being occasioned by slumber.|$|R
5|$|The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions {{encouraged}} its 800,000 {{members to}} not fly with Braathens {{due to the}} introduction of a segregated classes. SAS did not follow the same policy, and offered its discounted customers to travel in the same class as Braathens', including complimentary service. After introduction, the concept increased the work load on handing employees, who needed to check the passengers' tickets to ensure <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> in the right class. There were also complaints from Best-passengers who felt that they were receiving worse service after the scheme was introduced.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{noticing that}} his bar was empty, the present-day Moe {{arrives at the}} Simpsons' home and begins to recall {{the events of that}} day. He remembers that while <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> by a fire that night, they saw a near-meltdown at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The next day, they go to the old quarry for a swim, and Homer jumps in, only to find that there was no water but only mud. However, Homer recalls that there was no water in the quarry because {{something}} was blocking the inlet pipe. When Homer unblocks it, he finds a rotting corpse in it, causing him to scream.|$|E
5|$|While at the discothèque, De Simone and Savage were {{together}} throughout the evening, and DeSimone did not consume any alcoholic drinks. They left the night club together, and Savage drove DeSimone {{back to the}} Tom Tackle car park, arriving sometime between 00:30 and 01:00 (12:30 and 1:00a.m.) on 5December. Savage testified that she drove into the covered parking area and that <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> chatting {{for a while before}} DeSimone made the short walk to her car, at which point Savage reversed out and drove away from the scene. Savage was the last witness to see DeSimone before she was killed.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> had <b>sat</b> thus, some time, when {{suddenly}} was heard a hurried {{knocking at the}} door below.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>they</b> all <b>sat</b> down {{together}} and watched Little Joe Otter turn a somersault down the slippery slide.|$|R
60|$|Stephen {{took his}} brother's hand {{and gave it}} a good grip; and, Cecilia coming in, <b>they</b> all <b>sat</b> down.|$|R
5|$|Simultaneously, an {{unrelated}} movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds {{to symbolize the}} basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound {{was accompanied by a}} specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a Calvinistic sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung a cappella.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{determined}} the Tug Argan gap {{the best possible}} place to make a stand out of the three roadways, and also the most likely invasion route, and thus positioned {{the bulk of the}} army around it. On the British right, to the north of Tug Argan, were three companies of the 3/15 Punjab Regiment, set upon a group of west-facing strongpoints overlooking the rough wilderness that lay beside the road. South of them lay the gap itself, manned by a contingent of Rhodesian troops. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> upon a line of small hills, named from north to south Black, Knobbly, Mill, Observation, and Castle Hills. These hills, positioned in a row with 2,000–2,500 yard gaps in between, housed machine-gun nests surrounded with light rings of barbed wire and served as the Rhodesians' defensive strongholds and the main defense for the British of the pass. On the British left were another group of Indian troops, located upon the aptly named 'Punjab Ridge' facing directly to the south. Unfortunately for the British, the front was too wide for the troops available, and the gaps between hills too large, leaving the defenses prone to infiltration. Also, due to the hills being in a single line, the position lacked depth. Meanwhile, De Simone, arriving {{at the site of the}} impending battle on 10 August, set his forces directly opposite the British positions. On the left, II Brigade prepared to advance through the wilderness towards the Punjab troops in the north. In the Italian center, XIV Brigade faced the Rhodesian hilltop positions within the pass, and XV Brigade looked north towards Punjab Ridge on the Italian right. Behind them were XIII Brigade and the armored vehicles.|$|E

60|$|<b>They</b> now <b>sat</b> down to supper. After it was over, Sir Edmund took Oswald {{with him}} to his wife's bower.|$|R

25|$|The Grand Salon on {{the first}} floor is the most ornate room in the building. The Knights used it for {{business}} discussions, and as a refectory and banqueting hall, where <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> at long tables according to seniority.|$|E
25|$|On August 13, 1997, 50 protesters staged at {{a sit-in}} at Guam Airport, {{saying that the}} {{recovery}} of the dead was taking too long; <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> on blankets and sheets of paper at the Korean Air counter.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking her}} to dinner on December 10, Kosova said Acremant pulled out a gun and a stun gun as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> in her truck and {{told her he had}} killed three people; two just that week. He {{unscrewed}} the silencer on the gun and showed her the blood inside.|$|E
60|$|He {{laid his}} hand affectionately on Willems' shoulder, and <b>they</b> both <b>sat</b> silent till the boat came {{alongside}} the ship's ladder.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>they</b> all <b>sat</b> {{down again}} in a large ring on the bank, and begged the mouse to begin his story.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> both <b>sat</b> {{for some}} minutes {{staring at the}} land, while the canoe drifted slowly. Then Evans looked towards the paddle.|$|R
25|$|Meshuchrarim, a {{group of}} freed slaves and their {{descendants}} brought by the Sepahardim, they had no communal rights and no synagogue of their own. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> on the floor or on the steps outside. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, Abraham Barak Salem, a meshuchrar, successfully campaigned against this discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Anzhel Vagenshtain {{was their}} {{discoverer}} for the cinema. After reading their feuilletons in Starshel, {{he told them}} that they should write a comedy. As a joke, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down and wrote the screenplay for The Ancient Coin. This led to the first Bulgarian musical film, a 1965 co-production with East Germany. The then-fashionable Bulgarian singer Liana Antonova and the East German film star Manfred Krug appeared in the film. The music was by Bulgarian composer Petar Stupel.|$|E
25|$|After the trip, the 700, 701, 702, Challengers {{and other}} SP {{locomotives}} {{were sent to}} the scrap line. At the same time, however, Union Pacific Railroad was offering to donate a steam locomotive to the city of Portland, Oregon, and not to be outdone, the SP offered the 700. The two locomotives (SP 700 and OR 197) were moved into Oaks Park along the Willamette River in 1958 and were soon joined by SP 4449 where <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> for nearly 20 years.|$|E
60|$|Rachel {{had listened}} to all this with attention, but {{with a certain amount}} of bewilderment. <b>They</b> both <b>sat</b> {{thinking}} their own thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is a}} jaw-breaker!" [...] exclaimed Hockins, with a laugh, as <b>they</b> all <b>sat</b> down to breakfast. [...] "Ra-vo--what did 'ee say?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> all <b>sat</b> like wax figures, {{some with}} their glasses arrested halfway to their lips. Three loud knocks had sounded at the door.|$|R
25|$|On {{completing}} the disbandment of 75th Division, Palin became commander of 3rd (Lahore) Division, a Regular Indian Army {{formation in the}} Palestine occupation force. Shortly after taking up this command, he was appointed to chair a Commission of Inquiry into the Jerusalem riots that had occurred on 4–7 April 1920. The {{other members of the}} Commission were Brig-Gen E.H. Wildblood (one of his former brigadiers in 75th Division) and Lt-Col C. Vaughan Edwards. Assisted by a legal adviser, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> for 50 days and examined 152 witnesses in eight languages.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of using}} furniture, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> on the floor, which {{was covered with}} two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves (Iris pseudacorus); and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and {{employing}} skins for coverlets. The men used chopsticks when eating; the women had wooden spoons. Ainu cuisine is not commonly eaten outside Ainu communities; {{there are only a}} few Ainu-run restaurants in Japan, all located in Tokyo or Hokkaido, serving primarily Japanese fare.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Phineas {{taught that}} the land of Babel had no stones with which to build {{the city and the}} tower. So they baked bricks until they built the tower seven miles high. The tower had ramps on its east and its west. Laborers took up the bricks on the eastern ramp, and people descended on the western ramp. If a man fell and died, the laborers paid him no heed, but if a brick fell, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> and wept, asking when another brick would come in its stead.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{plotting}} {{rooms were}} located hundreds of {{yards from the}} batteries they controlled. <b>They</b> often <b>sat</b> on top of nearby hills or ridge lines.|$|R
