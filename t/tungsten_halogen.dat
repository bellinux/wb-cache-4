5000|$|In {{ordinary}} incandescent lamps, evaporated tungsten mostly deposits {{onto the}} inner {{surface of the}} bulb, causing the bulb to blacken and the filament to grow increasingly weak until it eventually breaks. The presence of the halogen, however, sets up a reversible chemical reaction cycle with this evaporated <b>tungsten.</b> The <b>halogen</b> cycle keeps the bulb clean and causes the light output to remain almost constant throughout the bulb's life. At moderate temperatures the halogen reacts with the evaporating tungsten, the halide formed being moved around in the inert gas filling. At some point, however, it will reach higher temperature regions within the bulb where it then dissociates, releasing tungsten back onto the filament and freeing the halogen to repeat the process. The overall bulb envelope temperature must be significantly higher than in conventional incandescent lamps for this reaction to succeed, however: it is only at temperatures of above 250 C {{on the inside of}} the glass envelope that the halogen vapor can combine with the tungsten and return it to the filament rather than the tungsten becoming deposited on the glass.

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors William Beckman, Sanford Klein, and Douglas Reindl. The TRNSYS (TRaNsient SYstems Simulations) Hybrid Lighting Model was revised so that two colorimetric indices pertinent to indoor illumination, the correlated color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI), could be predicted by the model. For calculation of the CCT and CRI relevant to the hybrid lighting system, the spectral power density (SPD) of beam normal radiation was needed. Though TRNSYS provides algorithms to calculate the magnitude of beam normal radiation on any surface, no methods were provided in TRNSYS to determine the SPD of solar radiation. This thesis describes {{the inclusion of a}} spectral model in TRNSYS: Gueymard's SMARTS 2 (Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine) algorithm. This algorithm was used to calculate the SPD of beam normal radiation as a function of solar position, atmospheric turbidity, moisture content, and other atmospheric parameters. The TRNSYS hybrid lighting model, augmented by SMARTS 2, was used to analyze building illumination and energy loads for a 2500 m 2 office building equipped with a hybrid lighting system (HLS). The HLS uses two-axis tracking collectors to collect beam normal radiation that is later divided into visible and infrared components. The visible radiation is piped to luminaires inside the building using optical fibers, while the infrared radiation is focused on thermal photovoltaic arrays and used to generate electricity. The TRNSYS model calculated annual building energy loads (lighting, cooling, and heating) and energy savings in office buildings located in six U. S. cities: Honolulu, HI; Tucson, AZ; Reno, NV; Atlanta, GA; Seattle, WA; and Madison, WI; that were equipped with hybrid lighting systems. Using local utility rates and assuming 52 lm/W lamps efficacies (the commercial average in the U. S.), the annual energy savings per m 2 collector area in these cities were: $ 240 -Tucson, $ 140 -Reno, $ 320 -Honolulu, $ 40 - Atlanta, $ 50 -Madison, and $ 60 -Seattle. For the colorimetry analysis, four representative lamp SPDs - warm white fluorescent, full spectrum fluorescent, <b>tungsten</b> incandescent, and <b>halogen</b> incandescent - were defined as standard indoor light source spectrums. Two cities were chosen to perform the analyses in: Tucson, which represented a clear climate with consistent beam normal radiation values, and Seattle, a cloudier climate. The CCT and CRI were calculated each hour during office working hours. When cloudy, the CCT and CRI of the illumination inside took on the values of the lamp providing it, but when beam normal radiation was available these values were influenced by the 5000 - 5500 K CCT and 80 CRI of the beam normal radiation transmitted though the HLS.

40|$|Quality {{assessment}} and process monitoring {{are essential for}} today's fruit industry sector and the world's economy. From picking fruit in orchards, to transport and handling practices, to storage and packaging, each step will influence {{the quality of the}} end-product when presented to the consumers. The appearance, consisting of the shape, size, colour or absence of any damage are essential criteria relevant to consumers, and influence their will on buying. It is therefore essential to provide a fast, consistent quality assessment of each fruit to match the expectations of the market. To remain competitive to this demand at low cost, fast and efficiently, non-destructive automated quality sorting lines are needed. Among the different defects affecting fruit quality, bruises {{are one of the most}} problematic industrial losses. The detection of bruises in fruit such as apples during handling is therefore required. The browning process of bruises results in progressive apple tissue softening and colour changes. As this natural process takes time before it becomes visible, there is a gap of a few days between the mechanical damage causing the bruise and the consequent visible brown spots, which lower the price of apples. It is therefore important to detect bruises on each apple as early as possible after damaging to limit consequent economical losses. Light is the fastest known information carrier. In ambient conditions, it is also harmless for fruit or the surrounding workers, and a cheap technology. Among the different non-destructive and non-invasive techniques, the usage of light and the analysis of the information it can carry is therefore the most promising path. By shining light onto apples, and observing the absorbed, reflected and scattered light, bruises may be detected non-destructively at high speed. Among the most recent technologies reported, hyperspectral imaging (HSI), being the combination of the machine vision and spectroscopy fields, is showing promising paths. More particularly, the short-wave infra-red (SWIR) range has been demonstrated to promote successful detection of bruises in apples at early stages. However, there are still limiting factors when using SWIR HSI prior its success in industry. Among them, the most predominant are high noise levels arising from the detectors, non-uniform illumination, specular reflections and real-time HSI data handling. This research aims to tackle those problems be first describing and modelling the different components consisting of a SWIR HSI sorting system being the illumination and the imager, and further optimizes their configuration for better image quality. Those building blocks are further put together combined with improved data handling more robust and efficient usage of SWIR HSI in industry. This research is split into 10 chapters. Chapter 1 covers the current practices in image based fruit sorting, with a stronger emphasis on hyperspectral imaging. It further compares visible and near infra-red (Vis-NIR) to SWIR HSI and where are the additional challenges when using SWIR over Vis-NIR. The chapter then describes the relevance of apples in industry and why early bruise detection. The chapter ends with the outline of this thesis. Chapter 2 describes the state-of-the-art in light, its interaction with matter, with a focus on polarisation and vibrational spectroscopy. The browning bio-chemical process of apples is further described. The algorithms used to process light spectral information, also referred to multivariate data analysis which are applied within this research are then described. Chapter 3 is focused on characterising the noise and sensitivity of a SWIR hyperspectral imager, to quantify the signal to noise ratio (SNR). To quantify the pixel-to-pixel variation or the detector’s response, a radiometric calibration method is proposed which dynamically removes the detector noise. This approach removed 6 % further noise compared to conventional sequential noise sampling methods. The average detector noise or dark current evolution through time is then shown, which was noted to vary non-linearly, with a sub-linear trend one hour after start-up to stabilize after 3 hours, with up to 12 % of the imager’s dynamic range. Contrast of each spectral image is also described using a novel custom-made checkerboard calibration rig. The following showed a ratio per wavelength up to 15000 versus 1 raw values with 100 - 1700 nm. The checkerboard also enabled accurate spatial calibration using a thin lens model. Chapter 4 describes how to measure, model analytically and using non-sequential ray-tracing software the spectral and angular distribution of <b>halogen</b> <b>tungsten</b> (HT) spots, considered as the standard in SWIR HSI illumination. The far field angular distribution was modelled with a Gaussian distribution with an R² of 0. 99, while the spectra using a Plank based 5 th order polynomial with and R² of 0. 98. The modelled spectra enabled to convert photometric measurements into radiometric units, and estimate the energy contribution of the spots in the SWIR spectral range, with up to 63 % of the total spectral power. Further, near-field spot distribution is measured and modelled within the ray-tracing software, comparing irradiance distributions when using or not diffusers. It was shown that the irradiance patterns could be reproduced with a peak relative error of 12 % when using diffusers, while up to 30 % without. Conventional illumination distribution and light beam shaping are non-linear problems, which often are solved using iterative methods such as simplex or simulated annealing (SA) optimization algorithms, which can result in sub-optimal solutions or time consuming searches. Chapter 5 introduces novel constrained non-linear global optimization algorithms which can handle more efficiently such problems while simultaneously offering information on the sensitivity of a configuration near its optimum. A design is proposed using 4 HT spots placed around a flat target, using the source models from chapter 4. The two proposed optimization methods are referred to as Design of Computer Experiments with Design Augmentation (DACEDA) and Design of Computer Experiments with Simplex post-optimization (DACES). A 2 variables analytical version of the problem using isotropic source models enabled to compare DACES and DACEDA’s modelled design space with an overall average relative error of 2 %, with a peak up to 10 % at the corners of the design space. The SNR of ray-traced near-field sources modelled in chapter 4 is quantified using the Rose model, setting the stop criterion of the proposed optimization algorithms. The simulated irradiance distribution uniformity is then optimized for a 2 and 5 variables case studies with DACES, DACEDA, simplex and SA. In the 2 D case, it was shown that DACES performed best after 30 simulations while in the 5 D case, DACEDA performed best after 65 simulations. Both algorithms were further used in a case study with DACEDA for tolerance analysis, and DACES for optimization of a configuration for apples, which was used within the remaining of the thesis. Among the main challenges when using SWIR HSI for fruit quality inspection, are the glossy regions observed from their arbitrary deformed toroidal shape and waxy surface. Therefore, this research further aimed at reducing the influence of those specular reflections, both numerically and optically. In chapter 6, a first proposed approach is to use chemometrics tools combined with image analysis to reduce or remove those artefacts, using a multiclass classifier or a stepwise approach. The proposed method using iterative steps to remove progressively automatically unwanted regions resulted in 6 % higher prediction accuracy than a multi-class partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) classifier. Appropriate wavelength selection using interval PLS-DA enabled to improve further by 4 %. Furthermore, the stepwise algorithm enabled to detect for multiple cultivars up to 80 % six hours after bruising. Chapter 7 uses the multi-class PLS-DA classifier from chapter 6 on a real-time case study of one cultivar, and compare pixel based calibration models to conventionally used region based ones. Pixel based models, encountering for variations described in chapter 3, improved prediction accuracy at the pixel level up to 2 %. With a cultivar based model built for 2 hours after damage, using area normalization as spectral pre-processing and image post-processing, a pixel-based prediction of accuracy of 95. 6 % was obtained, while up to 98 % at the sample level. The following was demonstrated on a real-time SWIR HIS sorting system at a rate of 200 ms per apple at a scanning speed of 0. 3 m/s. To further improve those results, chapter 8 aims at quantifying the degree of glossiness for apples as a function of the light geometrical path, also referred to as surface scatter properties or bi-directional scatter distribution function (BSDF). It was shown that apples have a Gaussian gloss trend around the specular angle, and are Lambertian outside the glossy region. Moreover, polarization properties of apples are then investigated in chapter 9, in the aim to remove optically gloss arising from apples using a cross-polarized imaging system. It was shown that gloss could be removed for multiple cultivars using cross-polarization, and that the resulting scattered reflected light was Lambertian, thus improving the image uniformity and bruise-sound contrast region. Finally, the combination of the conclusions drawn from the different chapters and future research perspectives are given in chapter 10. It can be concluded that near-field ray-traced sources with diffusers are the best choice for SWIR illumination, which can be optimized using DACES or DACEDA for improved uniformity. It was shown in this research that real-time SWIR HSI is possible, and using broad spectral has significant added value. It was shown that using the knowledge of polarization and surface scatter properties of apples, linear cross-polarized imaging configuration is the most efficient solution to remove gloss of fruit in images. Alternatives are also possible, by numerically removing gloss using area-normalization and PLS-DA, with image post-processing, which are cheaper, but more time consuming. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|A dental curing {{light is}} a piece of dental {{equipment}} that is used for polymerization of light cure resin based composites. [...] It can be used on several different dental materials that are curable by light. The light used falls under the visible blue light spectrum. This light is delivered over a range of wavelengths and varies for each type of device. There are four basic types of dental curing lights; <b>Tungsten</b> <b>halogen,</b> light-emitting diode (LED), plasma arc curing (PAC), and laser. The two main dental curing lights are the halogen and LED.|$|E
5000|$|In 1937, {{the light}} was {{converted}} to 110 V DC electricity. The two distinctive red bands were painted in 1942. In 1967 the power source was replaced with 240 V AC power, being supplied by two diesel alternators, and a new lens, pedestal, bearing and optic drive may have been installed. The range of the 1967 light was [...] The light was modernised in July 1988, with the installation of a 120 V 1 Kw <b>tungsten</b> <b>halogen</b> lamp. In 1990, the handrails and stanchions of the balcony and external staircase were replaced and an access ladder to the dome was installed. On 8 December 1993, {{the light was}} converted to solar powered operation and a VRB-25 apparatus was installed.|$|E
50|$|A halogen lamp, {{also known}} as a <b>tungsten</b> <b>halogen,</b> quartz-halogen or quartz iodine lamp, is an {{incandescent}} lamp consisting of a tungsten filament sealed into a compact transparent envelope that is filled with a mixture of an inert gas and a small amount of a halogen such as iodine or bromine. The combination of the halogen gas and the tungsten filament produces a halogen cycle chemical reaction which redeposits evaporated tungsten to the filament, increasing its life and maintaining the clarity of the envelope. Because of this, a halogen lamp can be operated at a higher temperature than a standard gas-filled lamp of similar power and operating life, producing light of a higher luminous efficacy and color temperature. The small size of halogen lamps permits their use in compact optical systems for projectors and illumination.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Tungsten</b> <b>halogen</b> curing light, {{also known}} as simply “halogen curing light” is the most {{frequent}} polymerization source used in dental offices. [...] In order for the light to be produced, an electric current flows through a thin tungsten filament, which functions as a resistor. [...] This resistor is then “heated to temperatures of about 3,000 Kelvin, it becomes incandescent and emits infrared and electromagnetic radiation {{in the form of}} visible light”. [...] It provides a blue light of about 400 and 500 nm, with an intensity of 400- 600 mW cm^-2. [...] This type of curing light however has certain drawbacks, the first of which is the high temperatures that the filament generates. This requires that the curing light have a ventilating fan installed in order to “force airflow through slots in the casing”. [...] This requires the curing light to be larger, in order to house the fan. The fan generates a sound that may disturb some patients, and the wattage of the bulb is such (e.g. 80W) these curing lights must be plugged into a power source, that is, they are not cordless. Furthermore, this light requires frequent monitoring and replacement of the actual curing light bulb because of the high temperatures that are reached. (For example, one model uses a bulb with an estimated life of 50 hours which would require annual replacement, assuming 12 minutes' use per day, 250 days per year.) Also, the time needed to fully cure the material is much more than the LED curing light.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} novel energy {{efficient}} torchiere {{systems have been}} developed using compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). These systems were studied photometrically and compared {{with the performance of}} traditional commercially available <b>tungsten</b> <b>halogen</b> sources. Gonio-photometric data and power assessments indicate that significant lighting energy savings can be obtained by utilizing CFL sources instead of standard <b>tungsten</b> <b>halogen</b> sources. This energy savings is jointly due to the higher source efficacy of the CFLs and the surprisingly poor performance of the imported 300 Watt halogen lamps. Experimental data shows that a 50 to 60 Watt CFL will effectively lumen match a variety of 300 Watt <b>tungsten</b> <b>halogen</b> sources with 5 to 10 times the efficacy. CFL torchieres have additional benefits of higher power quality and cooler lamp operating temperature, making them safer fixtures...|$|E
