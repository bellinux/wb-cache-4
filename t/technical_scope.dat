Executive Summary When “serious ” {{project management}} is a critical business requirement, project managers need to integrate cost, schedule and <b>technical</b> <b>scope</b> of work across the project, and apply earned value management (EVM). Earned value is a method for project managers to objectively measure the amount of work accomplished on a project or contract, relative to the baseline plan, and to estimate total project costs and total duration of the project. But EVM is so much more than a financial tool! Managers need to make a cultural shift from viewing EVM as a mandatory financial reporting requirement to viewing it as a valuable and fundamental project management tool. To effectively use EVM as a management tool, it must be an integrated part of program and project management. But how can this integration occur, and what tools can be used to facilitate it?
