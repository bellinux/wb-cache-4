50|$|For {{several years}} now, at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), a {{pressure}} or high pressure (thermo)forming process {{is used to}} fabricate film microchips for capillary electrophoresis (CE) 3-5 and for three-dimensional cell cultivation 6-8. The process {{is derived from the}} macroscopic <b>trapped</b> <b>sheet</b> forming process 2. This is a simple variation of vacuum or pressure forming without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a female mould with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact heating plate inside the forming station. The forming air is supplied via through holes in the heating plate. Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100 µm are thermoformed. This is performed with gas pressures up to 5 MPa into mechanically micromachined cavities of plate shaped micromoulds from brass.|$|E

The work combines semiconductor and printing technologies to advance lightweight electronic and photonic devices having excellent potential for commercial and exploration applications. Device development involves three projects that relate to energy generation and consumption: (1) a low-mass efficient (low power, low heat emission) micro light-emitting diode (LED) area lighting device; (2) a low-mass omni-directional efficient photovoltaic (PV) device with significantly improved energy capture; and (3) a new approach to building super-capacitors. These three technologies, energy capture, storage, and usage (e. g., lighting), represent a systematic approach for building efficient local micro-grids that are commercially feasible; furthermore, these same technologies, appropriately replacing lighting with lightweight power generation, will be useful for enabling inner planetary missions using smaller launch vehicles and to facilitate surface operations during lunar and planetary surface missions. The PV device model is a two sphere, light <b>trapped</b> <b>sheet</b> approximately 2 -mm thick. The model suggests a significant improvement over current thin film systems. For lighting applications, all three technology components are printable in-line by printing sequential layers on a standard screen or flexographic direct impact press using the three-dimensional printing technique (3 DFM) patented by NthDegree. One primary contribution to this work in the near term by the MSFC is to test the robustness of prototype devices in the harsh environments that prevail in space and on the lunar surface. It is anticipated that this composite device, of which the lighting component has passed off-gassing testing, will function appropriately in such environments consistent with NASA s exploration missions. Advanced technologies such as this show promise for both space flight and terrestrial applications...|$|E

A field {{study was conducted to}} study the effectiveness of these potential pest management techniques along with the partially resistant (Cardinal) and susceptible (Desiree) potato cultivars, by using their different combinations for the management of Myzus persicae (Sulzer). Berseem, Trifolium alexandrinum (L.) (family: Leguminosae) was used for intercropping with potatoes. The different combinations (treatments) used in this study were: 1) Cardinal-berseem mixed cropping+yellow sticky plastic <b>sheet</b> <b>traps</b> 2) Cardinal-berseem mixed cropping 3) Cardinal+yellow sticky plastic <b>sheet</b> <b>traps</b> 4) Cardinal separately+berseem (as land area equivalents in relation to the mixed cropping treatments) 5) Cardinal (sole crop).

Under this circumstance, monetary-policy makers are uncertain about the presence and scale of potentially harmful effects that might appear because of balance sheet mismatches arising from high and unexpected depreciations of the domestic currency.

Whether the balance sheet mismatch problem exists or not, a Bayesian optimization procedure that assigns a positive probability to Model B, perpetuates model-indeterminacy.

The only area the air above the shock wave could escape would be out the back of the sheet where the fuselage ended. Since the air was <b>trapped</b> between this <b>sheet</b> and the fuselage, a large volume of air would be trapped, much more than the more basic approach he first developed.

40|$|Snake {{populations in}} the North American tallgrass prairie appear to be declining, yet data {{unavailability}} impedes the development of enhanced ecological understanding of snake species-habitat relationships and also hinders snake conservation efforts. This study addresses both issues for the snakes of Illinois in two steps. 	 In a two-year mark-recapture study at twenty-two sites within six northern Illinois prairie preserves, I investigated snake species-habitat relationships using habitat variables at three scales: microhabitat (10 km). A total of 120 snakes representing seven species was captured using drift fence arrays associated with funnel <b>traps</b> and <b>sheet</b> metal cover. The low numbers and diversity of snakes captured, when compared to historic evidence, indicate that Illinois snake populations have declined. At the microhabitat scale, non-metric multidimensional scaling and Mantel tests revealed a relationship between snake species composition and elevation. At the landscape-scale, snake species composition varied along an agricultural-urban cover gradient. Classification and regression trees and maximum entropy models (Maxent) were used to identify the scales at which snake species-habitat relationships were strongest. Six of seven regression trees for individual snakes species contained habitat variables at the landscape scale. Important landscape characteristics included patch size, isolation, and land cover, metrics that strongly covary with habitat loss. Microhabitat features only appeared in the regression trees of two species and in three Maxent models. This study indicates that habitat loss has shaped the current distribution of snake species in Illinois's remnant prairies and that snake conservation efforts should emphasize the landscape-scale. Finally, I developed a risk ranking system based on natural and life history characteristics to assess the conservation status of Illinois's 38 snake species. Cluster analysis identified eight groups of snakes, similar in terms of risk factors, with high risk species sharing characteristics such as large body size, long life span, limited habitat breadth, and a high anthropogenic threat ranking. Here, I emphasize the need for basic demographic studies on snakes and suggest that ranking systems be used with population data (when available) and expert opinion to identify snake species of conservation concern in other regions.

40|$|Boron nitride sheets, as the isoelectric {{analogue}} of graphene, {{have gradually}} attracted researchers’ attentions {{due to their}} excellent mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. Compared with graphene, the exploration of potential applications of boron nitride sheets for polymeric nanocomposites is limited {{due to the lack}} of practical and efficient preparation methods. Current methods like solvent sonication and chemical vapor deposition are not ideal and difficult to scale up for composites applications. The work described in this thesis focuses on the solution of two key problems of fabricating boron nitride/polymer nanocomposites. The first problem is the exfoliation of hexagonal boron nitride. In this work, two approaches are developed and can be used for the preparation of boron nitride nanosheets: chemical functionalization and direct exfoliation by interfacial trapping. By chemically modifying hexagonal boron nitride, hydroxylated boron nitride nanosheets are prepared. Not only are the van der Waals forces between sheets reduced, but functional groups are introduced on the sheets increasing their dispersibility in water and polymer matrices. Further modifications are also feasible based on the attached hydroxyl groups. Unfunctionalized pristine boron nitride sheets can be directly prepared by the second approach: an interfacial <b>trapping</b> technique. <b>Sheets</b> are formed at the interface of the phase-separated water/organic solvent mixture to minimize interfacial energy. When prepared in different conditions, sheets stabilize the interface in two different forms: thin, continuous films or emulsions. Mechanisms of the two exfoliation approaches are studied. The other problem is the preparation of BN sheets/polymer composites with improved properties. To fully take advantage of each exfoliation method, melt mixing is employed for the functionalized boron nitride nanosheets/polymer composites while several more complicated methods are used for the direct use of exfoliated sheets. Those methods include solution casting, heat processing and in-situ polymerization. Obtained nanocomposites show one or more improved properties, such as mechanical properties, thermal stabilities and electrical properties. Potentially, these nanocomposites may be used as fire resistant building materials, dielectric materials or mechanically strong/lightweight materials...|$|R

Of particular interest is why after 3 or 4 years the soil test K (STK) levels are less than or greater than expected based on prior STK levels and nutrient budgets for K additions (fertilizer and/or manure) and removals (crop removal of K).

The flight muscles {{of all the}} adults which were flying around the hibernation sites had fully developed and {{the width of the}} epipleural muscles was 156 - 216 μm. The ovaries were poorly developed and most of thexn had no mature eggs. After the adults immigrated into paddy fields and fed on rice leaves, their flight muscles began to degenerate, whereas their ovaries developed and had mature eggs. The newly emerged adults, had poorly developed flight muscles just after emergence, but the flight muscles soon developed during the adults stayed in the paddy fields. The fiight muscles of all the adults caugllt into vinyl <b>sheet</b> <b>traps</b> had fully developed and the widtll of the epipleural muscles was 156 - 216 μm. After the adults moved under fallen leaves at the hibernation sites, their flight muscles started to degenerate. Ovaries ofnewly emerged adults caught during late July to early August were poorly developed. It is considered that overwintering and newly emerged adults develop fLlll grown flight muscles and are able to show active flight behaviour only during the period of migration...|$|R
