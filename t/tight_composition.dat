We obtain a version of the bound for general input oracles, which are just arbitrary unitaries. We also generalise the bound to the problem of implementing arbitrary unitary transformations. Similarly to the bound by Lee et al., our bound is a lower bound for exact transformation and an upper bound for approximate transformation.

The objective of this dissertation is to study how to achieve optimal effectiveness when implementing this new technology. To the best of this researcher 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge, {{this is one of}} the earliest attempts to investigate Web Services from an economic perspective. ^ The first sub-topic of this study is about how to apply bundling strategy for SOA implementation in the context of On Demand Business. This study proves that, it does not matter whether tight (there is no limitation for non-core components 2 ̆ 7 internal price in a composition) or loose (there is limitation for non-core components 2 ̆ 7 internal price) bundling strategy, composing non-core components is superior to non-composing strategy. <b>Tight</b> <b>composition</b> is more profitable but less feasible in practice. Loose composition is less profitable but more acceptable to customers. This study also indicates that monopoly of core components is the precondition to achieve advantages of the composition strategy of non-core components. The concept of null space is adopted to prove related conclusions. ^ How to allocate resources to where they are needed is increasingly an important topic for academic society because the business/computing environment becomes even more dynamic. Traditional optimization methods can not provide satisfactory decisions in the dynamic environment. Market mechanisms may replace the dominance of hierarchy in resource allocation. In the second part of this study, previous research is reviewed and a new internal market mechanism is provided. The new mechanism is based on principle-agency theory and the auction approach. The proof of its advantage is based on a primal-dual algorithm. This mechanism is designed to make up some points not adequately considered in previous studies. This study shows that the designed mechanism will lead to an equilibrium and optimal solution. ...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Distillation as a separation technique is widely used in the chemical and petroleum industries. With the growth of these industries and the availability of cheap process computing, the interest in more accurate control of the distillation units has increased significantly. The aim of distillation control is to keep the product composition constant in spite of disturbances. Since distillation column is a complex, nonlinear, multivariable interacting system, accurate control is a rather difficult problem. Multivariable design techniques are used to control the column. Some of the different multivariable techniques which have been used in the distillation column control include decoupling control, optimal control and internal model control [5]. Advanced control techniques such as feedforward control are also used for distillation control. The above techniques have been tried in practice and have had varying degrees of success. However, they rely on a valid and accurate model of the process to be controlled. In many difficult process situations such as steelmaking furnaces [7], cement kilns [13], presses in the glass industry [4] and distillation columns [12], such models do not exist. While {{there are a variety of}} adaptive techniques which can partially compensate for this inadequacy [18], it is clear that if the process cannot be usefully modeled within the framework assumed by the theory, then satisfactory control cannot be achieved. In addition to the model deficiency, a "difficult" process may also be characterized as having a considerable amount of essential a priori information available only in a qualitative form. These features are a form of inexactness or imprecision which prevent the theory from being used [171. Langari and Tomizuka [8] propose a Fuzzy Linguistic Model(FLM) based feedforward control for improving the disturbance rejection characteristics of a system where an accurate model of the plant is unavailable. For example, in distillation columns, feedforward model and decoupler model are used for tightly controlling the composition in the presence of disturbances and interactions. If these models are not accurate, then feedback controller will be required to take control action. Since feedback controller will not take control action until much damage is done to the controlled variable, tight control of composition is not possible. Because of the changes in the dynamic parameters of the column such as the quality of steam and cooling water etc., a model which is performing well at one operating condition will not perform well at other operating conditions. In practice, the plant is different from the model and there is uncertainty in the plant gain [15]. it is clear that some form of supervisory control is required for dynamically adapting the models to achieve <b>tight</b> <b>composition</b> control. Simple control techniques do not exist for model adaptation in MIMO systems. This thesis will outline a fuzzy supervisory controller based on fuzzy logic and show that control performance can be greatly improved by using such a; fuzzy supervisor. In the proposed fuzzy logic supervisory controller, a set of linguistic control rules will be used to adapt the feedforward model and decoupling model based on the change in the feedflow(disturbance) and the response of the top tray temperature(controlled variable). This thesis will also outline a simulation software to characterize a benzene-toluene binary distillation column and an X-window based Graphical User Interface to run the simulation...|$|E

While tools to model the interior structure of transiting planets exist, inferences about the composition are fraught with ambiguities. We present a framework to quantify how much we can robustly infer about super-Earth and Neptune-size exoplanet interiors from radius and mass measurements. We introduce quaternary diagrams to illustrate the range of possible interior compositions for planets with four layers (iron core, silicate mantles, water layers, and H/He envelopes). We apply our model to CoRoT- 7 b, GJ 436 b, and HAT-P- 11 b. Interpretation of planets with H/He envelopes is limited by the model uncertainty in the interior temperature, while for CoRoT- 7 b observational uncertainties dominate. We further find that our planet interior model sharpens the observational constraints on CoRoT- 7 b's mass and radius, assuming the planet does not contain significant amounts of water or gas. We show that the strength of the limits that can be placed on a super-Earth's composition depends on the planet's density; for similar observational uncertainties, high-density super-Mercuries allow the <b>tightest</b> <b>composition</b> constraints. Finally, we describe how techniques from Bayesian statistics can be used to take into account in a formal way the combined contributions of both theoretical and observational uncertainties to ambiguities in a planet's interior composition. On the whole, with only a mass and radius measurement an exact interior composition cannot be inferred for an exoplanet because the problem is highly underconstrained. Detailed quantitative ranges of plausible compositions, however, can be found. Comment: 20 pages, 10 figures, published in Ap...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{integrity}} {{and functions of}} blood-brain barrier (BBB) are regulated by the expression and organization of tight junction proteins. OBJECTIVE: The present {{study was designed to}} explore whether plant-derived triterpenoid celastrol could regulate tight junction integrity in murine brain endothelial bEnd 3 cells. METHODS: We disrupted the tight junctions between endothelial bEnd 3 cells by oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). We investigated the effects of celastrol on the permeability of endothelial monolayers by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). To clarify the <b>tight</b> junction <b>composition,</b> we analyzed the expression of tight junction proteins by RT-PCR and Western blotting techniques. RESULTS: We found that celastrol recovered OGD-induced TEER loss in a concentration-dependent manner. Celastrol induced occludin, claudin- 5 and zonula occludens- 1 (ZO- 1) in endothelial cells. As a result, celastrol effectively maintained tight junction {{integrity and}} inhibited macrophage migration through endothelial monolayers against OGD challenge. Further mechanistic studies revealed that celastrol induced the expression of occludin and ZO- 1) via activating MAPKs and PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR pathway. We also observed that celastrol regulated claudin- 5 expression through different mechanisms. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that celastrol effectively protected tight junction integrity against OGD-induced damage. Thus, celastrol could be a drug candidate for the treatment of BBB dysfunction in various diseases...|$|R

Embryos that lack bark establish functional SJs, but due to rudimentary septae formation during subsequent embryonic development, these become non-functional. Furthermore, cell adhesion is impaired at the lateral cell membrane and the core protein complexes of SJs are mis-localised, but appear to form otherwise normally in such embryos. We propose a model in which Bark acts as a scaffold protein that mediates cell adhesion and mounting of SJ core complexes during cell rearrangement in tissue morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (PUFA) have {{been pointed out}} for their beneficial effects in inflammatory processes. The dietary fatty acids are absorbed by the intestinal epithelial cells. The intestinal mucosa {{is also an important}} selective barrier from which the permeability is modulated by tight junctions. The breakdown of the intestinal barrier and the increase of epithelial permeability are involved in inflammatory bowel diseases. This work was focused on PUFA from the n- 3 family, i. e. α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and from the n- 6 family, i. e. linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn- 6). It aimed at investigating their uptake and metabolism by the intestinal epithelium as well as their effects on <b>tight</b> junction <b>composition</b> and functionality in in vitro models of healthy or inflamed intestinal epithelium. In {{the first part of the}} work, we have shown that differentiated Caco- 2 cells are able to absorb, accumulate and metabolize n- 3 and n- 6 PUFA and probably to process DHA into EPA through a retro-conversion pathway. We also highlighted that different models of the intestinal epithelium present different behaviours in terms of PUFA uptake and processing. In the second experimental part, we have observed in healthy Caco- 2 cell monolayers (i) that the accumulation of ALA, EPA or DHA does not affect the presence of occludin in tight junctions while that of LA, ARA and DPAn- 6 decreased it, (ii) that high concentrations of DHA affect ZO- 1 intensity but not occludin and (iii) that PUFA does not disturb the barrier function. This work also underlined that DHA limits the effect of an inflammatory stimulus on occludin, ZO- 1 and the barrier function.

5000|$|Despite his {{influence}} on the course of Northern Chinese painting, few works produced by Jing Hao have survived to the present day, and those that have are in poor condition. The piece most frequently held as a template of his style is Mount Lu, an ink painting on silk scroll which gives a rather fantastical rendering of one of Jiangxi's natural landmarks. [...] The work is a <b>tight,</b> vertical <b>composition,</b> employing Jing's newly developed cun fa technique to compress the landscape into layers of jutting rock-pillars between chasms of mist. The enclosed space of the composition enhances the monumental characteristics of the mountain, which fills some 90% of the scroll. Humans and buildings, though drawn with remarkable realism {{in a manner that}} contrasts sharply against the atmospheric landscape surrounding, are reduced to an almost unnoticeable scale, clustered {{at the foot of the}} mountain at the very bottom of the scroll, further conveying the intimidating grandeur of the natural world over the transient activities of man. Scholars have noted, however, that the mist in Mount Lu plays only a minimal role compared with that seen in some of Jing's other works, being employed much more conservatively than is common for the artist—a fact which has led to some speculation among art historians that this particular work may represent a “reminiscence” during a later period in the artist's life.Aside from Mount Lu, only one other major surviving work bearing the signature of Jing Hao has survived into the present. Travellers in Snow-Covered Mountains was recovered during the excavation of a tomb, and is currently exhibited in the Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. However, although archaeological evidence suggests that the painting does indeed date from the mid-10th century—a period overlapping Jing's productive years—some scholars have thrown its authorship into question. Despite the signature, a number of art historians, including Jonathan Hay of New York University's Institute of Fine Arts, consider the painting too “primitive” to have been produced by an artist of Jing's reputation. Therefore, the attribution of this work to Jing Hao remains a subject of academic dispute.|$|R

Here, for the first time, we present a high-resolution reconstruction of the BUS highlighting the link between surface and benthic productivity and their response to climatic and oceanographic changes over the last 70 ka. The study is based on benthic foraminiferal faunal analysis together with analyses of diatom assemblages, grain size of the terrigenous fraction, and stable O and C isotopic and bulk biogenic components of core GeoB 3606 - 1.

Two of these severe hypoxic periods were during parts of MIS 4 and MIS 3 where we find an inverse relationship between diatom and benthic foraminifera accumulation, meaning that during times of extremely high phytodetritus export we note strongly suppressed benthic productivity. We also stress the importance of food source for the benthos throughout the record.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation of such microinclusions enables the detailed study of their size, external habit, internal morphology, and mineralogy, and yields information on the chemical composition and crystallography of the included phases. Here we present a detailed TEM examination of microinclusions in four Þ brous diamonds from Canada and Siberia, each with a distinctive inferred original ß uid composition. Most microinclusions contain multi-phase assemblages that include carbonate, halide, apatite, possible pyroxene, and high-silica mica (6. 8  7. 7 Si atoms per formula unit) whose composition lies along the phlogopiteAl-celadonite join. The TEM results, together with the <b>tight</b> range of <b>composition</b> detected by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and the volatiles detected by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, suggest that the microinclusions trapped a uniform, dense, supercritical ß uid and that the crystallized minerals grew as secondary phases during cooling. Carbonates appear in all assemblages, together with either halides or silicates, indicative of the importance of carbonatitic high-density ß uid during diamond growth and ß uid evolution. The presence of halide-carbonate or silicate-carbonate assemblages is in agreement with the bulk composition of the microinclusions as detected by EPMA. The high K content of some microinclusions detected by EPMA cannot be accounted for by the solid phases analyzed by TEM. This discrepancy suggests that K is concentrated in the residual ß uid that is lost during TEM sample preparation. In addition to microinclusions, large cavities containing amorphous phases were found in the inner parts of one Siberian and one Canadian diamond. An Al-rich phase is the most abundant, and it is accompanied by Ca-rich and Si-rich phases. These phases may be explained by amorphization of crystalline phases.

40|$|Abstract In {{multicellular}} organisms epithelial and endothelial cells form selective permeable interfaces between tissue compartments {{of different}} chemical <b>compositions.</b> <b>Tight</b> junctions which connect adjacent cells, control {{the passage of}} molecules across the barrier and, in addition, facilitate active transport processes. The cellular barriers are not static but can be deliberately modulated by exposure to specific external stimuli. In vitro models representing the essential absorption barriers of the body are nowadays available, thus allowing investigation of the parameters that control permeability as well as transport processes across those barriers. Independent {{of the origin of}} the barrier forming cells, techniques are needed to quantify their barrier integrity. One simple assay is to measure the permeability for given hydrophilic substrates possessing different molecular weights like sucrose or dextrans. However, this technique is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, radioactive or fluorescently-labeled substrates are needed to allow easy analytical detection. Finally, if transport processes are investigated, the standard permeant may interfere with the transport process under investigation or might even alter the barrier integrity by itself. Thus, independent, non-invasive techniques are needed to quantify the barrier integrity continuously during the experiment. Such techniques are available and are mainly based on the measurement of the transendothelial or transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of barrier forming cells grown on porous membranes. Simple devices using two sets of electrodes (so-called Voltohmeters) are widely used. In addition, an easy-to-use physical technique called impedance spectroscopy allows the continuous analysis of both the TEER and the electrical capacitance giving additional information about the barrier properties of cells grown on permeable membranes. This technique is useful as a quality control for barrier forming cells. Another impedance-based approach requires cells to be grown directly on solid, micro-structured electrodes. Here, we will discuss the physical background of the different techniques; advantages, disadvantages, and applications will be scrutinized. The aim is to give the reader a comprehensive understanding concerning the range and limits of the application, mainly focusing on endothelial cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|I {{have always}} had a {{narrative}} sensibility, drawing from memory, stories, and personal experience. Perhaps it was the abundance of story telling and gossip I absorbed growing up. The dominance of women in my family had a profound influence on how I created narratives in my earlier work. They remain core influences, and through them I have developed further, reaching out past linear narrative and specific story to focus on the psychology of internal and external experience. When I began my MFA {{it was the first time}} in two years I was getting intensive feedback on my work. What began was an extensive dialogue about why, over all other modes of expression, I paint. Not only do I paint but, like others, I take on the task of trying to be a relevant figurative painter at a time when, as everyone likes to say, it has all been done before. (Despite this argument I have chosen to continue making paintings and investigate the continued resurgence of narrative and figuration in art.) Not only has it been done before, it has also been done better. One of the least successful paintings I created during my flfst year of graduate school was a 22 ̆ 7 x 32 ̆ 7 canvas of a man with a rabbit mask climbing the stairs after two young girls. One girl looks coyly back at him while the other hides around the corner with a wine bottle in hand. You could see in one glance that the girl with the wine bottle was going to hit the rabbit man over the head. It was the most obvious oflinear narratives. There was nothing left for the r viewer and that was not what I wanted from the work. To make matters worse the physicality of paint was problematic. As unconvincing as this painting was, understanding its failures remains an important moment in my education. During this troubled time I was also making drawings. I pinned my drawings lovelessly in the comer of my studio or left them closed in a sketchbook. I regarded drawing as tool for the development of the paintings. But, now my paintings had their set of problems and the only option was to look toward the far comers of my studio. The drawings offered freedom not hindered or covered by layers of paint. It was time to listen to the responses of others and realize that, for the moment, the drawings had something to offer beyond a study. I took the uncomfortable steps toward leaving painting for drawing. Painting was abandoned for charcoal, graphite, erasers, and a dab of watercolor. The difference was an epiphany. Delicate shifts in line weight and subtle areas of tone were the first things allowed on the baby blue paper I had purchased. The surface was seductive and responsive. No canvas, no uncontrollable brushes covered in oil paint. I was equipped with the immediacy of drawing that could disappear with the rub of an eraser. The figures emerged from the middle-toned fields, not as components of spelled out narratives, but single entities conscious of the viewer with a subtle indication of space. There was room for invention and story beyond the surface, a lesson clarified after studying Vincent Desiderio 2 ̆ 7 s ideas on narrative. When my primary body of work switched from painting to drawings, I also began to respond to surfaces such as lithography stones and the wood grain of birch plywood. The wood grain inspired a less defined space, adding predetermined texture. Watercolor was allowed to soak in to the surfaces due to its transparency and inability to cover up line. Everything was pastel and soft. My figures loved being suspended in this open field of space. Their emotions became more intense (strong, confrontational, weak, whiney and vulnerable) as they existed alone with the viewer. My work evolved at a steady pace from painting to drawing and was still continuing to evolve by the end of my second year. What I didn 2 ̆ 7 t understand at the time was that my work was evolving right back to painting. The reason, in retrospect, was the richness of color and light. The catalyst for the return of paint was the news that I had received funding from the Hispanic Scholarship FundlMcNamara Creative Arts Project Grant. Suddenly there was no excuse for not taking risks. I had received funding for all the materials needed to make, process and document my work for a year. There is definitely something that happens when you know you can complete a body of work without fmancial setbacks. Scale became my new concern, moving away from the smaller intimate works. I created larger 52 ̆ 7 x 42 ̆ 7 images on panel, beginning by drawing the singular figures on the bare surface and then painting a color field around them. Areas of the figure, such as the clothing, became opaque while the body remained the natural wood surface. The color that surrounded the figure created an aura that emphasized the character 2 ̆ 7 s demand for attention. The larger scale enabled me to bring the viewer into the space of the figure. The expansive surface demanded a more physical response to the work. What began to change was ·the idea that I couldn 2 ̆ 7 t continue to stay with the single figure on a pastel, empty background much longer. How was I going to evolve this time? r How could I continue to present new narratives? Slowly and subtly, I began allowing the paint to cover more of the surface. A friend walked into my studio at the end of my second year and shouted, 2 ̆ 2 You 2 ̆ 7 re painting again [...] . 2 ̆ 2 It was almost a statement of concern. I felt guilty, as if) was reverting back to a dangerous addiction that would inevitably lead to my demise. Addiction or not, color and paint became the answer to my questions. Perhaps it was the initial guilt of wanting to make a painting again that prompted me to shifted back to small panels. Whatever the initial motivation, heightened coloration began distorting the sense of comfort, echoing the psychological within the images. The intimacy of the small panels in relation to subject began to make sense. In addition to paint, I had made a choice not to depict the entire figure, or the figure at all. I discovered a simple object or a part of the body had the ability to reveal a complex and meaningful narrative. I was no longer trapping the singular figure in empty space. At this time touch has become an important addition to the work, particularly on an intimate scale. This work depicts intense moments of touching with <b>tight</b> <b>compositions</b> and minimal space. They imply a metaphorical and visually tactile approach to the intimate, delicate, and uncomfortable nature of touch. The smaller work sets up a dialogue with the larger work on canvas, which, in contrast, has the expanse of space and defined setting where the characters interact with others, their space, and the viewer. The elements of drawing, 2 ̆ 2 the possibilities of a narrative beyond the figure and the effects of scale on the reading of an image have all manifested itself in the creation of new narratives. All of the challenges and experiences over the last three years of art [...] making have only contributed to my ambition, experimentation, and the unwillingness to settle. The work has just begun...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining {{a healthy}} gut {{environment}} {{is a prerequisite}} for sustainable animal production. The gut {{plays a key role in}} the digestion and absorption of nutrients and constitutes an initial organ exposed to external factors influencing bird’s health. The intestinal epithelial barrier serves as the first line of defense between the host and the luminal environment. It consists of a continuous monolayer of intestinal epithelial cells connected by intercellular junctional complexes which shrink the space between adjacent cells. Consequently, free passing of solutes and water via the paracellular pathway is prevented. Tight junctions (TJs) are multi-protein complexes which are crucial for the integrity and function of the epithelial barrier as they not only link cells but also form channels allowing permeation between cells, resulting in epithelial surfaces of different tightness. <b>Tight</b> junction’s molecular <b>composition,</b> ultrastructure, and function are regulated differently with regard to physiological and pathological stimuli. Both in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that reduced tight junction integrity greatly results in a condition commonly known as “leaky gut”. A loss of barrier integrity allows the translocation of luminal antigens (microbes, toxins) via the mucosa to access the whole body which are normally excluded and subsequently destroys the gut mucosal homeostasis, coinciding with an increased susceptibility to systemic infection, chronic inflammation and malabsorption. There is considerable evidence that the intestinal barrier dysfunction is an important factor contributing to the pathogenicity of some enteric bacteria. It has been shown that some enteric pathogens can induce permeability defects in gut epithelia by altering tight junction proteins, mediated by their toxins. Resolving the strategies that microorganisms use to hijack the functions of tight junctions is important for our understanding of microbial pathogenesis, because some pathogens can utilize tight junction proteins as receptors for attachment and subsequent internalization, while others modify or destroy the tight junction proteins by different pathways and thereby provide a gateway to the underlying tissue. This review aims to deliver an overview of the tight junction structures and function, and its role in enteric bacterial pathogenesis with a special focus on chickens. A main conclusion will be that the molecular mechanisms used by enteric pathogens to disrupt epithelial barrier function in chickens needs a much better understanding, explicitly highlighted for Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica and Clostridium perfringens. This is a requirement in order to assist in discovering new strategies to avoid damages of the intestinal barrier or to minimize consequences from infections...|$|R
40|$|Pathological {{processes}} in the alveolar and facial bones can lead to bone loss that may not heal with complete regeneration. Biomaterials {{can be used to}} facilitate the healing process and/or as a bone substitute, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. Persistent leakage of bacteria/bacterial toxins, after root canal treatment, may lead to a residual bone defect. The healing is dependent on a placed dental biomaterial providing a <b>tight</b> seal. The <b>composition</b> of the filling material may also influence the healing process. The general aim {{of this study is to}} investigate surface properties and biological interactions of biomaterials used in dento-alveolar surgery. A dental biomaterial, a bonded compomer (DAP) containing a corroding glass filler, was used as a root end filling material, promoting a new operation technique. The healing (assessed according to Molven´s x-ray criteria) demonstrates a significant improvement in healing results for the compomer group, compared to a commonly used technique. The surface properties and biological interactions of DAP were analyzed. ICP-OES of DAP cell culture medium extract demonstrated a significant release of Sr, Si and F from the dental biomaterial. Human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells grew on and around DAP specimens without any sign of toxic reactions. DAP extract stimulated proliferation of PDL cells, but caused an inhibition of osteoblastic gene expression in mouse bone marrow cells. The surface properties of the glass containing compomer may contribute to improved healing of the periapical lesions. A bovine inorganic bone graft substitute (BO) is commonly used as a treatment option in dento-alveolar surgery with new bone formation in immediate close contact with BO material. ICP-OES dissolution analysis of cell culture media, after incubation with BO particles, demonstrated a dosedependent release of Si and a decrease of Ca and P. An uptake of Ca from the medium to the BO particle was demonstrated with calcium- 45 labeling. The Si dissolution varied between different batches, possibly reflecting a variation in food intake in the animals. Stimulated osteogenic response was seen in close contact to the BO particles in cell cultures. Furthermore, it was clearly demonstrated that the study design is a critical factor for correctly understanding biomaterials’ biological interactions. The surface properties of three bone graft substitutes reported to have good results in dento-alveolar surgery were investigated, in order to establish whether or not dissolution-precipitation reactions could contribute to the bone healing. Dissolution-precipitation extracts of BO, bioactive glass 45 S 5 (BG) and a marine algae hydroxyl apatite (AP) in cell culture media were analyzed. Dissolution of Si at significant levels was detected for BO and 45 S 5 over time. Significant uptake levels of Ca and P from the culture were seen for both 45 S 5, BO and AP but at different times. Surface analysis of the biomaterials with SEM/EDAX, before and after immersion in cell culture media, revealed a smoothing of the surface morphology for 45 S 5 over time. No obvious alterations for BO and AP were detected. Ca/P ratio decreased significantly for 45 S 5, but no major changes were detected by XPS for BO or AP. XPS further demonstrated a surface charge for BO, changing from negatively to positively charged when exposed to serum. 45 S 5 and AP had positive surface charges, both in the absence and the presence of serum. These demonstrated surface changes in biomaterials could contribute to adherence of cells and subsequently affect bone healing. Conclusion: Biomaterials used in dento-alveolar surgery interact with biological surroundings through surface and dissolution-precipitation reactions which may have implications for bone healing...|$|R
40|$|As a {{promising}} candidate for future microwave power devices, GaN-based high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have attracted much research interest. However, group III-nitride growth related issues – predominantly the high defect densities due to lacking lattice matched substrates – limit {{the quality and}} life time of the HEMTs. In the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure the GaN buffer layer is particularly important for that matter. Several requirements need to be satisfied, such as high buffer resistivity, low dislocation densities and smooth and defect free interfaces. Poor reproducibility and uniformity of the heterostructure is an additional challenge. Research aim of this work {{is to develop a}} MOVPE based growth process that allows the reliable and efficient deposition of high quality material for HEMT devices based on AlGaN/GaN heterojunctions on sapphire substrates. Usage and development of adequate growth control and monitoring instruments is essential to meet these premises. Direct wafer surface temperature determination is a must during growth, though it is challenging for transparent substrates. A new calibration method is demonstrated that uses the in-situ measured, temperature dependent band-gap shift of SiC. This technique allows adjusting any MOVPE system to identical run-by-run wafer temperatures. Using this new temperature determination approach the cause of irreproducibility in an horizontal reactor is investigated. The two major origins of irreproducibility are parasitic deposits that form on the cold reactor walls which allow for insufficient temperature control. Thus, a new deposition approach is introduced that reduces the formation of parasitic depositions, by injecting the metalorganics near the substrate unlike the conventional process. Experiment and modelling verify the suitability of the new growth approach for enhanced reproducibility. The new approach leads to a fourfold reactor uptime. The structural, morphological and electrical characteristics of the grown layers are comparable for both processes. It has been found that inversion of the precursor supply has a drawback when considering the thickness uniformity. In order to achieve a homogeneous distribution of growth species over the substrate, flow mechanical aspects in our reactor system are investigated. The gas velocity and the gas "nature" are therefore important optimization parameters. For that purpose the influence of different carrier gases – nitrogen and hydrogen – on growth is examined. Using the inverted inlet configuration, uniformity can only be improved by changing the nature of the carrier gas, thus, modifying the diffusive transport and decomposition of growth species. This way, in N 2 atmosphere a standard deviation in thickness of less than 3 % is achieved. Nitrogen is crucial for improved thickness homogeneity, but apparently nitrogen not only deteriorates the surface morphology but it affects the growth mode {{in the early stages of}} deposition. It is found that nitrogen enhances untimely start of 2 D growth, which leads to GaN layers with a larger number of edge type dislocations. Dislocations, in turn, influence the strain in the layer, leading to more relaxed GaN layers when grown in nitrogen ambient. Dislocation scattering is the very probable source of the decline in electrical data when nitrogen is used as carrier gas. As a result a larger "coalescence thickness" is preferred, since it reduces the density of dislocations. Therefore a strategy was developed with which good quality material can be obtained despite the nitrogen ambient needed for uniform layers. Uniform layers with smooth surfaces and state of the art electrical and structural quality material were achieved by using only small amounts of hydrogen during the coalescence phase in otherwise nitrogen ambient. We managed to increase the Hall mobility at room temperature up to 671 cm^ 2 /Vs with a carrier concentration of 9 x 10 ^ 16 cm^- 3 and a FWHM for the (002) and (102) reflections of 238 and 349 arcsec respectively. The inverted inlet combines the reproducibility of the growth process with a good growth control for AlGaN. Due to the high incorporation efficiency a minimal amount of adduct formation occurred. <b>Tight</b> alloy <b>composition</b> and thickness control was achieved with less than one percent deviation over the wafer for device relevant aluminum contents in either hydrogen or nitrogen as carrier gas. AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on the GaN template. Despite state of the art sheet conductivity values the heterojunctions exhibit additional conductivity due to residual donors in the layer. A strategy for growing semi-insulating GaN was introduced using nitrogen as the carrier gas. Thus, acceptor like edge type dislocations are systematically generated that compensate the background carrier concentration. One key factor for varying the density of these dislocations is the morphology development in coalescence. Decreasing the coalescence time by using nitrogen in combination with shorter annealing times is beneficial for obtaining high resistive layers with smooth and specular surfaces. Electron mobilities at room temperature of 1490 cm^ 2 /Vs at a sheet carrier concentrations of 9. 88 < 10 ^ 12 cm^- 2 demonstrate the suitability of HEMT structures grown on "nitrogen GaN". The DC and RF characteristics of the produced HEMT structures are comparable to state of the art HEMT results as published in literature. These findings finally prove the functionality and feasibility of our MOVPE growth process. Thus, new holistic approaches to III-nitride monitoring and growth are presented. High reliability, reproducibility and minimum downtimes of the equipment is proven, optimized AlGaN/GaN film deposition shown and transferability of process temperatures to any reactor demonstrated...|$|R
