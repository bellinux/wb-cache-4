A custom designed Reed-Solomon block code, was used with additional CRC characters for error correction. Interleaving of odd and even audio samples {{was performed to}} protect against burst errors. Just as in audio tape machines, transport problems with tension, guides, and supply and take-up reels could result in vertical or horizontal weave, and as bit sizes were only 14μm, precise timing and tracking was essential, thus the CDS system required installation of special projector modifications to smooth the film path <b>travel</b> and <b>steady</b> the take-up speed. It was found later, however, that modifications to the projectors were not needed and that the CDS systems sensitivity to improper film speed was due to a diode installed incorrectly in the CDS decoder module. Horizontal tracking was provided by a 76-MHz digital servo, while vertical timing was accomplished with an algorithm written into the data format itself. Rows of data were scanned horizontally, thus a self-clocking run-length-limited code was used for this error correction.

On one hand, our model is based on very basic conservation principles. On the other hand, the turbulent nature of the flow is also taken into account through the energy dissipation mechanism. Moreover, the mixing with the pure water along with sediments entrainment and deposition processes are considered, which makes the problem dynamically interesting. One of the main advantages of our model is that it requires the specification of only two modeling parameters - the rate of turbulent dissipation {{and the rate of}} the pure water entrainment. Consequently, the resulting model turns out to be very simple and self-consistent. This model is validated against several experimental data and several special classes of solutions (such as <b>travelling,</b> self-similar and <b>steady)</b> are constructed.

The basic flow {{is assumed to}} be confined between two critical layers, respectively located near the lower and upper rigid boundaries.

We derive a nonlinear evolution equation for the amplitude of a wave-like disturbance in this configuration, {{based on the assumption that}} the critical layers are replaced by thin recirculation zones attached to the lower and upper rigid boundaries, where the flow is very weak. The dispersive and time evolution terms in this equation are typical for Korteweg-de Vries theory, but the nonlinear term is more complicated. It comprises nonlinearity associated with the shear across the waveguide, and the nonlinearity due to the flow over the recirculation zones. The coefficient of the quadratic nonlinear term may change sign depending on the presence or otherwise of recirculation zones at the upper or lower boundary of the waveguide.

40|$|Abstract. A {{non-linear}} coupled-mode {{system of}} horizontal equations is derived {{with the aid}} of Luke’s [13] variational principle, which models the evolution of nonlinear water waves in intermediate depth and over a general bathymetry. The vertical structure of the wave field is exactly represented by means of a local-mode series expansion of the wave potential. This series contains the usual propagating and evanescent modes, plus two additional modes, the free-surface mode and the sloping-bottom mode, enabling to consistently treat the non-vertical end-conditions at the free-surface and the bottom boundaries. The system fully accounts for the effects of non-linearity and dispersion. The main features of this approach are the following: (i) various standard models of water-wave propagation are recovered by appropriate simplifications of the coupled-mode system, and (ii) a small number of modes (up to 5) are enough for the precise numerical solution, provided that the two new modes (the free-surface and the sloping-bottom ones) are included in the local-mode series.

A substantial range of the Rayleigh number R (R-c <= R <= O(100 R(c))), where R-c denotes the critical value {{at the onset of}} convection) is considered. It is found that the wall-localized convection mode, unaffected by the velocity boundary condition imposed on the sidewalls, is nonlinearly robust. Both directions of travelling waves, one propagating against the sense of rotation near the outer sidewall and the other propagating in the same sense as the rotation {{in the vicinity of the}} inner sidewall, are always present in the nonlinear solutions. In contrast to nonlinear convection in a rotating Benard layer, neither convection rolls nor the Kupper-Lortz instability can exist in a rotating annular channel because of the effect of the sidewalls. It is the nonlinear interaction between the wall-localized modes and the internal mode that plays an essential role in determining the nonlinear properties of convection in a rotating annular channel.

This variability has been investigated by numerous previous workers, in models ranging from simple energy balance constructions to full general circulation models. We present a numerical study in which periodic forcing is applied to a highly idealised, two-layer, quasi-geostrophic model on a ?-plane. The bifurcation structure and (unforced) behaviour of this particular model has been extensively examined by Lovegrove et al. (2001) and Lovegrove et al. (2002). We identify from their work three distinct regimes on which we perform our investigations: a <b>steady,</b> <b>travelling</b> wave regime, a quasi-periodic, modulated wave regime and a chaotic regime. In the travelling wave regime a nonlinear resonance is found. In the periodic regime, Arnol'd tongues, frequency locking and a Devil's staircase is seen for small amplitudes of forcing. As the forcing is increased the Arnol'd tongues undergo a period doubling route to chaos, and for larger forcings still, the parameter space we explored is dominated by either period 1 behaviour or chaotic behaviour. In the chaotic regime we extract unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) and add the periodic forcing at periods corresponding to integer multiples of the UPO periods. We find regions of synchronization, similar to Arnol'd tongue behaviour but more skewed and centred approximately on these periods. The regions where chaos suppression took place are smaller than the synchronization regions, and are contained within them...|$|R
40|$|Invasion is an {{important}} facet of malignant growth that enables tumour cells to colonise adjacent regions of normal tissue. Factors known to influence such invasion include {{the rate at which}} the tumour cells produce tissue-degrading molecules, or proteases, and the composition of the surrounding tissue matrix. A common feature of experimental studies is the biphasic dependence of the speed at which the tumour cells invade on properties such as protease production rates and the density of the normal tissue. For example, tumour cells may invade dense tissues at the same speed as they invade less dense tissue, with maximal invasion seen for intermediate tissue densities. In this paper, a theoretical model of malignant invasion is developed. The model consists of two coupled partial differential equations describing the behaviour of the tumour cells and the surrounding normal tissue. Numerical methods show that the model exhibits <b>steady</b> <b>travelling</b> wave solutions that are stable and may be smooth or discontinuous. Attention focuses on the more biologically relevant, discontinuous solutions which are characterised by a jump in the tumour cell concentration. The model also reproduces the biphasic dependence of the tumour cell invasion speed on the density of the surrounding normal tissue. We explain how this arises by seeking constant-form travelling wave solutions and applying non-standard phase plane methods to the resulting system of ordinary differential equations. In the phase plane, the system possesses a singular curve. Discontinuous solutions may be constructed by connecting trajectories that pass through particular points on the singular curve and recross it via a shock. For certain parameter values, there are two points at which trajectories may cross the singular curve and, as a result, two distinct discontinuous solutions may arise. © 2006 Oxford University Press...|$|R

Only 4. 7 % of the respondents had sexual contact with a new partner, and 63. 1 % of these new partners were from the country of destination. Of those who had casual travel sex, 52. 4 % did not expect this (women 75 %), 30. 9 % did not always use condoms, and 41 % were not protected against hepatitis B. Independent risk factors for casual travel sex were traveling without steady partner (OR 14. 4), expecting casual travel sex (OR 9. 2), having casual sexual contacts in the home country (OR 2. 4), non-tourist journeys (OR 2. 2), being male (OR 2. 1), the fact that the information on sexually transmitted infections (STI) had been read (OR 2. 0), and traveling to South and Central America (OR 2. 0). Taking condoms along (OR 5. 4) and reading the information on STI (OR 3. 3) were identified as independent predictors of protected sex. CONCLUSIONS. Travelers have substantial sexual risk behavior. Casual sex is usually not expected, and the most important predictor is traveling without a steady partner. We would advice every client of a travel clinic who will <b>travel</b> without a <b>steady</b> partner to read the STI information, to take condoms along, and to be vaccinated against hepatitis B...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{stability}} of ship is currently evaluated by empirical formula {{based largely on}} a static approach. Evidently stability is affected by speed that causes variation of pressure distribution on the wetted surface of a ship's hull, and generated waves {{on the surface of}} water by the vessel's motion. Forces and moments resulting from bottom pressures, as the speed of the ship changes, are significantly different for the ship at rest and in a seaway. The principal aim of the research is to investigate the effect of variations of forward speed on stability of a ship in calm water. The thesis presents theoretical and experimental approaches of the research. The novelty of the research results leads to the conclusion that although increasing speed may improve the stability of a ship in some cases, it also depends on heeling angle or on any asymmetry of the wetted area of a hull. Taking into account unbalanced pressure distribution acting on the wetted surface of the hull in some cases, hence, decrease of stability is also possible. On a moving, partially immersed body, hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces predominate. These forces arise owing to interaction between the body's motion and its weight with respect to the surrounding water. In order to calculate these forces, the panel method of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been applied to identify the velocity and pressure distribution on the wetted surface of a ship's hull. The mathematical model adopted is based on the source distribution on the ship's hull, known as the Kelvin source. The model for a body <b>travelling</b> with <b>steady</b> forward speed, where its motion does not disturb the free surface, is known as double body theory. For consideration of waves generated by the motion of the ship on the free surface, a three dimensional linearised potential flow solution has been utilised. Comprehensive tests conducted in the UCL towing tank have established {{a better understanding of the}} significance of variation of ship's stability associated with forward speed in calm water. It is shown that an accurate judgement regarding the ship's stability cannot be made if only the effect of forward speed, as a single parameter, is considered. The heeling angle is another important parameter that must also be taken into account. The effects of a combination of both variables have been investigated, and are reported on. The research is presented showing that the applied CFD method may be an alternative method to assess stability of a ship in seaway, but there is a long way for the CFD approach to replace towing tank testing. At present, CFD may be used for consideration as a precursor to improve ship's stability in a real sea during the design stage, for modification, and before operation. It is hoped that in future the novel findings of the experimental approach of this research could be used as additional guidance to be incorporated within the stability documentation for individual ships at the design stage, and ship trials.
