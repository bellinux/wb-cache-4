Elaine shares a cab ride with Kennedy, and she tells him that she lives Uptown near Jerry in order to extend the ride.

Eventually, the pressure becomes <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and she is the second person to be knocked out of the contest.|$|E
5|$|Rembrandt was foaled in 1977 by Herbert de Baey. His sire was Romadour II, {{a famous}} Westphalian {{stallion}} during the 1970s, and his dam was Adone, full sister to Ahlerich, a multiple Olympic medal winning dressage horse under German rider Reiner Klimke. Due to his Thoroughbred-like appearance, several riders passed over {{a chance to}} purchase the gelding as a youngster. In 1981, he was purchased by Nicole Uphoff's father, Jürgen Uphoff, as a mount for his then-14-year-old daughter. Rembrandt was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> however, and {{he was sent to}} train with Klaus Balkenhol, a noted trainer who saw his potential and advised the Uphoffs to keep the horse, despite his spookiness and sensitivity.|$|E
5|$|Anna is {{the younger}} {{child in the}} royal family of Arendelle, whose older sister, Elsa is born {{with the power to}} create and control ice and snow. As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. After they create a snowman named Olaf in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna unconscious with her magic. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain trolls for help. The troll king, Pabbie, erases Anna's memory of her sister's magic, nulling Elsa's power, only leaving memory of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers—a strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her new separate bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking for love and comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral.|$|E

50|$|Woldu was {{originally}} found in 1984 by a CBC documentary crew led by Brian Stewart and Tony Burman. Her family walked from their village in Tigray to Mek'ele {{in hopes of}} finding food or relief.

25|$|Since this theory, the 'closet scene' {{in which}} Hamlet confronts {{his mother in}} her private {{quarters}} has been portrayed in a sexual light in several performances. Hamlet is played as scolding his mother for having sex with Claudius while simultaneously wishing (unconsciously) that he could take Claudius' place; adultery and incest is what he simultaneously loves and hates about his mother. Ophelia's madness after her father's death may be read through the Freudian lens {{as a reaction to}} the death of her hoped-for lover, her father. Her unrequited love for him suddenly slain is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and she drifts into insanity.|$|E
25|$|When Anne-Thérèse was 15, tragedy {{struck the}} family {{when her father}} was killed by bandits as he {{traveled}} home to his family. The grief proved to be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> mother, who already had lost two children, and she {{fell into a deep}} and incapacitating depression. For many years, Anne-Thérèse accepted the responsibility of caring for her mother and sister, as well as the family's home and garden. At the age of 20, Anne-Thérèse asked her mother's blessing to join a religious order, but Isabelle — still unable to cope with her loss — refused. Five years later, Isabelle recognized the depth of Anne-Thérèse's devotion and permitted her to leave.|$|E
60|$|There was an {{accusation}} in this allusion {{to her brother}} which the mother felt,--as she was intended to feel it,--but to which she could make no reply.

Green was quiet in school, and developed an interest in Egyptology when she visited the Louvre at age seven. At age 14, after seeing Isabelle Adjani in The Story of Adele H., Green decided to become an actress. Her mother initially feared that an acting career would be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> sensitive daughter, but later came to support young Eva's ambitions. Green continued her studies at St. Paul Drama School in Paris, and took an acting course at Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Around this time, Green returned to Paris, where she performed in several plays. Green stated that in drama school, [...] "I always picked the really evil roles. It's {{a great way to}} deal with your everyday emotions." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-2009, {{producers}} {{decided to}} take Nicole's storyline into a [...] "u-turn", when she reverted to her [...] "wild ways". At the time Nicole had endured repetitive personal trauma including failed relationships, Roman being sent to prison {{and her best friend}} Belle was dying of cancer. James explained: [...] "It's all <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and she can't handle it, so she reverts to her wild ways." [...] Geoff notices Nicole's erratic behaviour and attempts to help her. She tried to [...] "lure him into bed" [...] after he comforted her, however he turned her down. James said she no longer had romantic feelings for Geoff, but was actually in a [...] "vulnerable state". She then started relying on alcohol more, and partied with fellow [...] "wild child" [...] Indigo Walker (Samara Weaving) at a [...] "rowdy" [...] venue. James explained that Nicole saw alcohol as an answer to her problems. The fact that [...] "she's trying to deal with too many things" [...] saw Nicole transform into a messed up and depressed person.|$|E
500|$|Lovato {{collaborated with}} Beckett on a song titled [...] "For the Love of a Daughter". Although not {{planning}} to write a personal song, a [...] "really long talk" [...] with Beckett resulted in the song being written. The song chronicles Lovato's relationship with her estranged birth father, who left the family when she was two years old. In the song, she pleads with her father to [...] "put the bottle down" [...] and questions him: [...] "How could you {{put your hands on}} the ones that you swore you loved?" [...] The song was set to appear on the album, but Lovato and her management felt of the song's subject would be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> young audience and later was removed from the album. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained: [...] "When I took a step back, I realized I wouldn't like those subjects being talked about in somebody else's home, with a seven-year-old and their mom." [...] Several other [...] "emotional" [...] songs were also put on hold. The song was later selected and included on her third studio album Unbroken released in September 2011, when Lovato had left Disney Channel.|$|E

500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. The next thing you know, Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson {{suffered}} {{for most of}} her life from bronchial asthma, which she aggravated over the years by heavy smoking and overwork. She had often been ill during the war, and had collapsed during a visit to Prague in 1946. On 25 January 1947 she attended the opening of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. [...] The winter of 1946–47 was exceptionally cold, and the ceremony was held out of doors. Shortly afterwards, Wilkinson developed pneumonia; on 3 February she was found in her London flat in a coma, and on 6 February 1947 she died in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. At the inquest the coroner gave the cause of death as [...] "heart failure following emphysema, with acute bronchitis and bronchial pneumonia, accelerated by barbiturate poisoning". Wilkinson had been taking a combination of drugs for several months, to combat both her asthma and insomnia; the coroner believed she had inadvertently taken an overdose of barbiturates. With no evidence to indicate that the overdose was deliberate, he recorded a verdict of accidental death. Despite this, speculation that Wilkinson had committed suicide has persisted, the reasons cited being the failure of her personal relationship with Herbert Morrison and her likely fate in a rumoured cabinet reshuffle. In their 1973 biography of Morrison, Bernard Donoughue and G. W. Jones suggest that, given Wilkinson's poor health, the burdens of her ministerial office became <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> However, the lack of conclusive evidence divides historians about Wilkinson's intention to take her own life.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{entering}} high school, Helen {{moved to}} Salt Lake City {{to live with}} her grandmother and aunt. She attended West High School and became involved in many school activities and organizations. She frequently worked on editing the school's yearbook and was elected student vice president of her senior class. Due to her father's influence, Helen planned on attending college at Stanford. But the cost of tuition was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> parents to consider. According to Helen, her parents believed that [...] "girls were not considered a good investment in higher education as they would only get married, while boys were worth it". However, Helen's father agreed to pay for her attendance at the University of Utah. She attended school for several years, but did not graduate.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a famous}} Swedish play called Sjung vackert om kärlek, written by Gottfried Grafström. The play focuses on Fröding's long visit to Uppsala Hospital. There {{are also some}} flashbacks of his life before being institutionalized. One of Grafströms reasons to write the play was to clear the name of Ida Bäckman, who he thinks has gotten way <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{criticism}} <b>for</b> <b>her</b> relationship with Fröding. The play was very popular during the 70's and had a revival in Värmland 2007. It was conducted by the Theater of Värmland at Alsters Herrgård, the very place where Fröding was born.|$|R
60|$|It {{was hardly}} an hour since Mrs. Proudie {{had left her}} husband's {{apartment}} victorious, and yet so indomitable was her courage that she now returned thither panting for another combat. She was greatly angry with {{what she thought was}} his duplicity. He had so clearly given her a promise on this matter of the hospital. He had been already so absolutely vanquished on that point. Mrs. Proudie began to feel that if every affair was to be thus discussed and battled about twice and even thrice, the work of the diocese would be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> even <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to the United States in 1957, Bates and her husband got an apartment in Beverly Hills. Later that year, Bates made her last film, Apache Territory, which was released in September 1958. She then appeared in two television commercials, one for floor wax and another endorsing a now unknown product with Buster Keaton. In 1960, Bates' husband Cecil Coan was diagnosed with cancer. [...] Bates put her career on hold {{to care for her}} ailing husband. The strain eventually became <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She attempted suicide by slashing her wrists and was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Hospital where she soon recovered. She made her final onscreen appearance in an episode of The Saint that aired in November 1962.|$|E
2500|$|By late 1932, Rădulescu was in {{correspondence}} with N. Crevedia, an admirer and like-minded humorist-writer, who visited {{her at her}} second home in Pitești. Crevedia may have also acted as her literary agent, arranging the text for print, and instructing her on how to polish her style. Reportedly, Rădulescu was taking courses at the literature and philosophy faculties of Bucharest University, but did not graduate. She began writing her self-styled [...] "fantasy reportage pieces", collectively grouped as Sunt studentă! ("I Am a Student!"). According to Pavel Dan, the pieces included here were too self-referential, even [...] "surfeited": [...] " [...] writes {{about the fact that}} she is now an author. Of course, this fact unsettles the entire universe. [...] Humanity itself breaks in half: on the one hand, those who appreciate her talent [...] and, on the other, those who know-nothings, such as university professors". A similar verdict was provided by Lovinescu: [...] "the writer explored the situations facing her tiny personality in two more novels , which failed to make her interesting anew; the genre is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to handle".|$|E
2500|$|Daredevil would {{embark on}} a series of adventures {{involving}} such villains as the Owl, Stilt-Man, the Gladiator, and the Enforcers. In issue #16 (May 1966), he meets Spider-Man, a character who would later be one of his greatest hero friends. A letter from Spider-Man unintentionally exposed Daredevil's secret identity, compelling him to adopt a third identity as his twin brother Mike Murdock, whose carefree, wisecracking personality much more closely resembled that of the Daredevil guise than the stern, studious, and emotionally-withdrawn Matt Murdock did. The [...] "Mike Murdock" [...] scheme was used to highlight the character's quasi-multiple personality disorder (he at one point wonders whether Matt or Mike/Daredevil [...] "is the real me"), but it proved confusing to readers and was dropped in issues #41–42, with Daredevil faking Mike Murdock's death and claiming he had trained a replacement Daredevil. Murdock reveals his secret identity to his girlfriend Karen Page in issue #57, although she leaves the series after the revelation proves <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> This was the first of several long-term breakups between Murdock and Page, who would prove the most enduring of his love interests.|$|E

[...] After pleading for the role with both MGM and her home studio of Paramount, a loan-out deal was brokered and the part of Annie eventually went to Betty Hutton.
