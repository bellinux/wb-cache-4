5|$|The {{idea came}} to him after {{attending}} the first Jubilee {{in the city of}} Rome, in 1300, where he realized that Rome's many historical achievements were well-known, and he desired to lay out a history of the origins of his own city of Florence. In his Cronica, Villani described in detail the many building projects of the city, statistical information on population, ordinances, commerce and trade, education, and religious facilities. He also described several disasters such as famines, floods, fires, and the pandemic of the Black Death in 1348, which would take his own life. Villani's work on the Cronica was continued by his brother and nephew after his death. It has been described as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> statistics as a positive element in history.|$|E
5|$|Lexus' {{arrival in}} the Japanese market in July 2005 marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> a Japanese premium car marque in the {{domestic}} market. New generation LS, IS, ES, GS, and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with the SC 430, ending domestic sales of Toyota-branded models under the Celsior, Altezza, Windom, Aristo, Harrier, and Soarer nameplates, respectively. The Altezza and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail sales channels called Toyota Vista Store, the Windom was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store, the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet Store, and the Soarer was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a price premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts. Sales for the first half-year were slower than expected, affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price increases, but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> drab general uniform {{was by the}} British Corps of Guides in India in 1848. Initially {{the drab}} uniform was {{specially}} imported from England, {{with one of the}} reasons being to [...] "make them invisible in a land of dust". However, when a larger quantity was required the army improvised, using a local dye to produce uniform locally. This type of drab uniform soon became known as khaki (Urdu for dusty, soil-coloured) by the Indian soldiers, and was of a similar colour to a local dress of cotton coloured with the mazari palm. The example was followed by other British units during the mutiny of 1857, dying their white drill uniforms to inconspicuous tones with mud, tea, coffee or coloured inks. The resulting hue varied from dark or slate grey through light brown to off-white, or sometimes even lavender. This improvised measure gradually became widespread among the troops stationed in India and North-West Frontier, and sometimes among the troops campaigning on the African continent.|$|E

500|$|Outside of recordings, {{occasional}} {{radio broadcasts}} {{were one of}} the few ways that British people could become familiar with the blues. A one-off broadcast by Josh White while he was visiting Britain in 1951 was so popular that he was asked to perform for a series of programmes for the BBC, eventually titled The Glory Road and broadcast in 1952. Later that year, folk song collector Alan Lomax, then resident in London, produced a series of three programmes under the title The Art of the Negro, of last of which, [...] "Blues in the Mississippi Night" [...] featured folk blues recordings by artists including Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and John Lee Hooker and was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> many later followers of the blues to the music and hardships of life for African Americans in the Southern US.

500|$|As in most cantatas of {{the second}} cycle, Bach set the opening chorus on the first stanza of the hymn in its {{original}} wording, [...] "" [...] (Lord Christ, only Son of God), as chorale fantasia. He assigned the cantus firmus to the alto, enforced by a horn (in later performance replaced by trombone). Bach had a used a cantus firmus in the alto already in his chorale cantata , for the second Sunday after Trinity. In , this leaves the sopranos free, as the musicologist Julian Mincham notes, [...] "to dance their own hymn of joy in the upper register above the chorale tune, thus lightening the texture and mood of the entire chorus". An unusual flauto piccolo or sopranino recorder is used to illustrate the sparkling of the morning star. Hofmann notes {{that it was the}} Bach's first use of a sopranino in a cantata, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> his Leipzig audience to the instrument which had not been used as a concert instrument. In a later performance (probably 1734) it was replaced by a violino piccolo. The choral setting is polyphonic in the three other voices and embedded in instrumental music based on similar motifs.|$|E
