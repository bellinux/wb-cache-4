The day concluded with a spectacular display of fireworks near the statue.|$|E
5|$|Cimabue {{achieves}} a masterful handling of colour; medieval churches {{tended to be}} extremely colourful, with frescoed walls, painted capitals, and gold leaf paintings. Pale tonalities dominate, with the main contrast found in the dark areas of Christ's hair and beard, which are utilised to make the features of his face stand out more, and position his head as <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> point.|$|E

5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> {{point of}} the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, {{the crook of his}} arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Emanuel was {{reported}} to have conflicts with other senior members of the president's team and ideological clashes over policy. He was also <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> point of criticism from left-leaning Democrats for the administration's perceived move to the center. By September 2010, with the Democrats anticipating heavy losses in midterm elections, this was said to precipitate Emanuel's departure as chief of staff.|$|E

5|$|Also {{known as}} Nam Tin Hotel, the Great Southern Hotel in Singapore's Chinatown {{was built by}} Swan and Maclaren in 1936.

5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent at the corners, while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> length range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the {{telescope}} surface was becoming badly corroded. In 2001–2003, {{the telescope}} was resurfaced, increasing its sensitivity at 5GHz {{by a factor}} of five. A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E
5|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for {{the purpose}} of electrical power production. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction solar cells. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a solar tracker in order to keep <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. Luminescent solar concentrators (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.|$|E
50|$|For {{an optical}} system in air, <b>the</b> {{effective}} <b>focal</b> length (f and f′) gives {{the distance from}} the front and rear principal planes (H and H′) to <b>the</b> corresponding <b>focal</b> points (F and F′). If the surrounding medium is not air, then the distance is multiplied by the refractive index of the medium (n is the refractive index of the substance from which the lens itself is made; n1 is the refractive index of any medium in front of the lens; n2 is that of any medium in back of it). Some authors call these distances <b>the</b> front/rear <b>focal</b> lengths, distinguishing them from <b>the</b> front/rear <b>focal</b> distances, defined above.|$|R
50|$|Phase telescopes are {{primarily}} used for aligning the optical components required for Köhler illumination and phase contrast microscopy. For Köhler illumination the light source and condenser diaphragm should appear in focus at <b>the</b> back <b>focal</b> plane of <b>the</b> objective lens. For phase contrast microscopy the phase ring (at <b>the</b> back <b>focal</b> plane of <b>the</b> objective) and the annulus (at <b>the</b> back <b>focal</b> plane of <b>the</b> condenser lens) should appear in focus and in alignment.|$|R
5000|$|The visual {{magnification}} [...] of {{the field}} of view through a telescope can be determined by <b>the</b> telescopes <b>focal</b> length [...] divided by <b>the</b> eyepiece <b>focal</b> length [...] (or diameter). The maximum is limited by the diameter of the eyepiece.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{its history}} of {{generating}} great earthquakes (1857, 1906) <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> point of earthquake hazard assessment in California {{has been the}} strike-slip San Andreas System of faults. However, a system of faults, including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs along {{the border of the}} San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that pose a threat to the highly populated region.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, then-President Hugo Sonnenschein {{announced}} plans to relax the university's famed core curriculum, {{reducing the number of}} required courses from 21 to 15. When The New York Times, The Economist, and other major news outlets picked up this story, the university became <b>the</b> <b>focal</b> point of a national debate on education. The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein's decision to resign in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, architects Zaha Hadid and Ben van Berkel {{were invited}} to design and build two pavilions on the Chase Promenade South, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago.
