5|$|Brothers Cory and Todd Edwards founded Blue Yonder Films after {{a number}} of years spent {{producing}} commercials and music videos in Tulsa. Joined by their friend Preston Stutzman, who was put in charge of marketing for the company, they released their first feature film, Chillicothe, at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival. The three then moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of new opportunities, but did not find the amount of success that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cerny {{also gave}} input and {{feedback}} on the game's level-design. However, the 3DO did not perform as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected,</b> and Universal suggested that the team should switched to Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation to increase sales of the game. The game originally ran on a custom engine developed by Alex Hastings, and was upgraded and converted for the PlayStation within a month. The debut title was called Disruptor, and was released worldwide in November 1996.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had given}} {{sanctuary}} to Tostig Godwinson when the Northumbrians drove him out, Malcolm was not {{directly involved in the}} ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardraade and Tostig in 1066, which ended in defeat and death at the battle of Stamford Bridge. In 1068, he granted asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing from William of Normandy, among them Agatha, widow of Edward the Confessor's nephew Edward the Exile, and her children: Edgar Ætheling and his sisters Margaret and Cristina. They were accompanied by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The exiles were disappointed, however, if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> immediate assistance from the Scots.|$|E
40|$|Men are reticent {{to share}} with others the slow {{realization}} that with age they begin to confront a world that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not <b>expected.</b> <b>They</b> <b>had</b> not <b>expected</b> to grow old. Now that this is happening, men have few relationships that permit them to share their thoughts and moments of recognition.

50|$|Traditionally, {{however, the}} {{deliberate}} cultivation {{of a particularly}} wide, pervasive vibrato by opera singers from the Latin countries has been denounced by English-speaking music critics and pedagogues as a technical fault and a stylistic blot (see Scott, cited below, Volume 1, pp. 123-127). <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> vocalists to emit a pure, steady stream of clear sound — irrespective of whether they were singing in church, on the concert platform, or on the operatic stage.|$|R

5|$|The Malagasy nationalists {{were mostly}} {{equipped}} with spears {{and had little}} protection from the firearms of the French military. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> that the United States might intervene in their favor, but no such action was taken by Washington. In addition, {{the majority of the}} population did not rise up to join them in their fight. Between July and September 1948, most of the key leaders of the Uprising were captured or killed. The last rebel stronghold, named Tsiazombazaha ("That which is inaccessible to Europeans"), fell in November 1948. Defeated, most of the remaining nationalist fighters disappeared into the eastern rainforest in December 1948.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} {{of the game and}} of its characters led Valve to develop merchandise for Portal made available through its online Steam store. Some of the more popular items were the Weighted Companion Cube plush toys and fuzzy dice. When first released, both were sold out in under 24 hours. Other products available through the Valve store include T-shirts and Aperture Science coffee mugs and parking stickers, and merchandise relating to the phrase the cake is a lie, which has become an internet meme. Wolpaw noted they did not expect certain elements of the game to be as popular as they were, while other elements <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> to become fads were ignored, such as a giant hoop that rolls on-screen during the final scene of the game that the team had named Hoopy.|$|E
5|$|The railway opened {{short of}} rolling stock as {{only half of}} the twelve {{locomotives}} and twenty-four of forty passenger carriages ordered had arrived. The carriage builders, Brown, Marshall & Co of Birmingham, stated that based on their experience <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> the line to open at least two months late. The third day after opening to passengers, on 23 September, there was a collision between two trains at Kittybrewster that resulted in the death of a passenger and several serious injuries. The inquiry found that the driver, attempting to make up time after a late start, had over-run previous stations and been approaching the terminus with excessive speed. The driver attempted to select reverse gear to slow the train but had failed {{to hold on to the}} lever, which slipped into forward, propelling the train into carriages waiting at the platform. The report also criticised the station staff, who should not have allowed the carriages to be waiting at the station. The layout at Kittybrewster was altered after the accident.|$|E
50|$|The Act also {{rectified}} employers underpaying {{employees for}} sick days and holidays, particularly in jobs where {{part of the}} employee’s pay was bonus or performance pay. For instance, if an employee got paid $100 a day, plus $200 a day bonus, the employer could have paid the employee $100 for a sick day, and not $300 as <b>they</b> would <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> of earned for that day. The Act now requires an employee to be paid what <b>they</b> would <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> to earn <b>had</b> <b>they</b> worked that day. Typically, this is calculated to the person’s average daily pay for the last 12 months.|$|R
50|$|On 11 September 2000, the MSM/MMM {{team won}} over the general {{elections}} with a bigger majority that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> themselves <b>expected.</b> <b>They</b> <b>had</b> won 56 seats out of 60 {{seats in the}} parliament.|$|R

5|$|In September 2013, {{the first}} playable alpha version of Mini Metro was released. They {{decided to keep}} the web version of the game freely available, {{at least until the}} release of the final game. They also {{submitted}} Mini Metro on Steam Greenlight, a community voting system that allows games to be released on digital distribution service Steam. Initially, they intended on releasing {{the final version of the}} game by the end of 2013, however despite the game's limited scope, development took far longer than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected.</b> A graphical overhaul, issues within the game's balance, and scheduling someone to work on the game's audio contributed to its delay. In August 2014, they decided to release an in-development version of the game commercially through Steam Early Access. They felt that the early access model was suitable for Mini Metro because the game was designed to have replay value and there was no fixed narrative to be spoiled. They continually released new builds of the game based on the community's feedback. The early access release provided them with funds to work full-time on the game. Peter Curry had been working on Mini Metro full-time since March 2014, and his brother Robert started working full-time in November 2014. Originally Mini Metro was being built for mobile platforms, however they shifted their focus to desktop PCs because of the ability to release their game in the early access state.|$|E
25|$|The New York City Sons of Liberty {{learned of}} Boston's plan {{to stop the}} {{unloading}} of any tea and resolved to also follow this policy. Since the Association had not obtained the support <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected,</b> the Sons of Liberty were afraid that if the tea was landed the population would demand its distribution for retail.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{employment}} opportunities has increasingly made life in many rural regions difficult, hence the apparent enticement to resettle in urban areas. Of course, jobs are still limited, so many do relocate in cities {{only to find}} prospects much more meager than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected.</b> Statistics suggest a very high proportion of residents of rural areas are unemployed or underemployed.|$|E

25|$|During the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857–58, some {{units of}} the Bengal Native Infantry and Cavalry revolted against the British East India Company. The rebels {{received}} less support than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> {{from members of the}} Bombay and Madras Armies. A number of atrocities took place, among them the Siege of Cawnpore. The mutiny ultimately failed because of lack of resources and coordination among the rebels. Reprisals by the victorious British Army, assisted by Sikh and Afghan regulars and irregulars, were ruthless.|$|E
25|$|For Toungoo, {{there was}} no time to waste. Right after the battle, the Toungoo command {{received}} intelligence that the Arakanese army led by Min Aung Hla, Viceroy of Sandoway (Thandwe), was crossing the Arakan Yoma range at the Padaung Pass, and that a sizable Arakanese navy led by Crown Prince Min Dikkha was sailing past Cape Negrais. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> a land invasion but the size of the Arakanese naval force caught them by surprise. It was late April 1542.|$|E
25|$|Minor {{parties had}} mixed results. The Australian Democrats polled their lowest vote since their {{creation}} in 1977, and lost the three Senate seats they were defending. The Australian Greens won Senate seats in Western Australia and in Tasmania. They missed seats in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, {{partly because of}} preference deals by other parties. This was a poorer result than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected.</b> They failed to win {{a seat in the}} House, losing the seat of Cunningham which they gained at a 2002 by-election.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} several model {{structures on}} {{the categories of}} ex-spaces and ex-G-spaces when G is a compact Lie group. Two of these are of particular interest in that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> applications {{to the study of}} transfer maps and to parametrized spectra. These two structures are shown to coincide on the collection of Hurewicz fibrations, and an indication is also given, mainly via examples, of how they differ. The last two sections of this paper are mostly expository; they set forth the model category techniques needed to prove the main theorems...|$|R
25|$|During the reward, {{all three}} members of Alpha {{admitted}} that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> to lose the task. Their advert, which involved parents discussing {{the use of the}} tissues for their ill child, was later discussed on You're Hired as being humorously flawed on a number of points – the child being sent to school when she was ill; one parent pinching the child's nose and thus likely to spread their illness; the mother appearing dazed; and the product appearing to have been chucked {{out of the back of}} the car and into a flower bed.|$|E
25|$|When Penzias and Wilson {{reduced their}} data {{they found a}} low, steady, mysterious noise that persisted in their receiver. This {{residual}} noise was 100 times more intense than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected,</b> was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. They were certain that the radiation they detected on a wavelength of 7.35 centimeters {{did not come from}} the Earth, the Sun, or our galaxy. After thoroughly checking their equipment, removing some pigeons nesting in the antenna and cleaning out the accumulated droppings, the noise remained. Both concluded that this noise was coming from outside our own galaxy—although they were not aware of any radio source that would account for it.|$|E
25|$|Due to the PLA's defeat, the Battle of Guningtou was {{not widely}} publicized in the PRC until {{early in the}} 21st century when the {{publication}} of articles within the mainland examining reasons for its failure was widely distributed. The army generally concluded that due to its lack of amphibious landing experience, lack of sophisticated landing crafts, lack of armor, low attack-repelling ability, lack of international recognition, and lack of intelligence services contributed to their defeat. As <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> to win the battle after one day of fighting, they therefore did not bring enough ammunition, supplies, food, and water on the first wave and also to a lesser degree during the second day's invasion. The battle is seen as being highly significant in Taiwan, as it laid the foundation for the current status quo relationship between the two parts of China.|$|E

25|$|In 1787, 1789 and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of the French revolution looming {{in the minds of many}} members of Parliament, few were swayed by Charles James Fox's arguments for equal rights. Political cartoons, one of the most effective and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley specifically. In the midst of these trying times, it was the betrayal of William Pitt and Edmund Burke that most angered Priestley and his friends; <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> the two men's support and instead both argued vociferously against the repeal. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but to no avail. These publications unfortunately also inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
25|$|The besiegers {{had more}} {{problems}} than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> {{at the start of}} the siege. During the first days of October there was a huge storm. The camp in the northwest was sited in a traditionally flooded area, and turned into a swamp. The defenders took advantage of the confusion created by the storm to attack during the night, causing extensive damage. Floods in the camp and in the encircling lines required the headquarters and the larger part of the troops to move to the mouth of the river Palmones, where they spent the remainder of October 1342. Soon after the main Christian camp had moved, the Algecireños gathered all their forces in the Villa Vieja to make a desperate attack against their besiegers. The Muslim knights were able to reach the newly established Christian camp and kill many Christian knights including Gutier Díaz de Sandoval and Lope Fernández de Villagrand, vassals of Joan Núñez and Ruy Sánchez de Rojas, vassal of the Master of Santiago.|$|E
25|$|During the Salerno landings, Force V, {{commanded}} by Admiral Philip Vian and consisting of , , , and , {{along with the}} light fleet carrier , provided air cover. The five carriers were expected to keep a fighter aircraft force of 22 Supermarine Seafires over the landing area until the ground forces had seized an Italian airfield for use by ground-based aircraft. On the first day, 9 September 1943, they flew 265 sorties. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> to be relieved by 10 September, but a suitable airfield was not captured until 12 September. Of the carriers' 105 fighters, ten were lost in action and 33 written off in accidents. In exchange, they claimed two German aircraft destroyed and four others probably destroyed. For the landings {{in the south of}} France on 15 August 1944, Attacker, Stalker, and Hunter, each equipped with 24 Supermarine Seafires and Pursuer, with 24 Grumman Wildcats, formed part of the aircraft carrier force dubbed Task Force 88.|$|E
