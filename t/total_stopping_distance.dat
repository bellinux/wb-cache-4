50|$|The actual <b>total</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> {{may differ}} from the {{baseline}} value when the road or tire conditions are substantially different from the baseline conditions or when the driver's cognitive function is superior or deficient. To determine actual <b>total</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>distance,</b> one would typically empirically obtain the coefficient of friction between the tire material and the exact road spot under the same road conditions and temperature. They would also measure the person's perception and reaction times. A driver who has innate reflexes, and thus braking distances, that are far below the safety margins provided in the road design or expected by other users, may not be safe to drive. Most old roads were not engineered with the deficient driver in mind, and often used a defunct 3/4 second reaction time standard. There have been recent road standard changes to make modern roadways more accessible to an increasingly aging population of drivers.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. In {{the paper}} it is {{necessary}} to estimate the determination accuracy of a car <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> during the test by the method of sequential braking. The method of sequential braking is applied for experimental evaluation of the <b>stopping</b> <b>distances.</b> Unlike the abandonment method when a sample car is disconnected from the tractive connection and they record the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of a single car from the moment of uncoupling to the moment of stop, the method of sequential braking involves <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> measurement of the tractive connection, the integrity of which {{in the course of the}} test is not affected, but its set (locomotive, locomotive with the track test car or with a sample car) at the different stages of the test is changed. Direct measuring of the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of a sample car is not possible using this way, it requires calculating of the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> values of the tractive connection. This adversely affects the accuracy of the result, but it can increase the safety level of the test. Methodology. To evaluate the accuracy researches have conducted the numerical experiment, which simulated experimental processing of <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> values. An error was found by giving disturbance of basic data (<b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of tractive connection of different configuration) and analyzing the resulted scatter of readings (<b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of a single car). Findings. The study proved: 1) the relative error of car <b>stopping</b> <b>distances</b> value, with relative error of basic data 1 %, made 3. 3 - 19. 7 % (depending on the tractive connection variant). 2) the proposed ways of error reduction (without track test car, less-weighed-locomotive use) allowed declining the error to 2. 15 - 5. 1 %. Originality. The methodology of error estimation of car <b>stopping</b> <b>distances</b> determination under tests by the method of sequential braking was proposed. Practical value. Work results make it possible to replace the running brake tests by the abandonment method, under which the integrity of tractive connections is broken, with safer testing by the method of sequential braking, providing the level of result accuracy of 2 - 5 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There {{are many}} factors {{affecting}} vessel’s <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> and crash <b>stopping</b> <b>distance,</b> {{and it is}} very complicated to calculate them accurately. At present there are several calculation methods about them, but all these methods have large error. Based on the research of the existing calculation methods, this paper simplifies vessel resistance and calculates vessel’s <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> and crash <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> accurately by means of physical and mathematical methods. 1 forward Vessel’s <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> (VSD) and Vessel’s crash <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> (VCSD) are two important indexes measuring the braking performance of the vessel. They have very important influence on the vessel navigation safety. Calculation of them {{is one of the major}} problems in Marine research. As early as the 1970 s, Chinese scholars Wang FengChen and Liu ZhengJiang et al. began to make research on large vessel’s stopping performance. [1, 2, 3] These research mainly used regression method on the measured data of VCSD to get the VCSD calculation formula. Foreign scholars have carried out extensive research, such as Tani, Okamoto, Havald, respectively put forward their own views and methods about the calculation of the VCSD for different type of vessel...|$|R

40|$|When {{the city}} centre {{is the major}} {{destination}} of the passengers, public transport vehicles will get fuller as they approach it. The disadvantage of time loss due to stops {{on the way to}} the centre is thus experienced by an increasing number of travellers. We demonstrate that optimal <b>stop</b> <b>distances</b> increase as vehicles get closer to the centre. This is at variance with the usual assumption of constant <b>stop</b> <b>distances</b> employed in this type of models. A Countervailing force is that urban densities increase as one approaches the centre.

40|$|Kids die or suffer serious {{injuries}} by moving tractors or other vehicles on farms. For this worldwide problem three reasons have been identified, {{these are the}} restricted view of the driver and the limited risk awareness of children and parents. Experimental results show that there exist invisible areas next to the wheels, hitched up machineries {{and in front of}} the tractor bonnet. Small children cannot be detected from drivers in these areas. They are usually uninformed about the presence of children during machinery work. Keeping children away from farm activities as good as possible is not appropriate for every family. Therefore an alternative would be a driver assistant system which warns the driver about the presence of kids in invisible zones. The size of invisible zones is influenced by the moving speed of vehicles and kids which determine the <b>total</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>distance.</b> Test scores indicate that a driver assistant system must cover the area of at least 5 meters in front and beside a moving farm vehicle and at least 2 meters at the back side of a hitched up machinery to avoid collision.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether motorcycle handling capabilities – measured by means of the efficiency of emergency manoeuvres – were dependent on prior sleep deprivation and time of day. Twelve male participants voluntarily took part in four test sessions, starting at 6 a. m., 10 a. m., 2 p. m., and 6 p. m., following a night either with or without sleep. Each test session comprised temperature and sleepiness measurements, before three different types of motorcycling tests were initiated: (1) stability in straight ahead riding at low speed (in ‘‘slow motion’ ’ mode and in ‘‘brakes and clutch’ ’ mode), (2) emergency braking and (3) crash avoidance tasks performed at 20 kph and 40 kph. The results indicate that motorcycle control at low speed depends on time of day, with an improvement in performance throughout the day. Emergency braking performance is affected at both speeds by time of day, with poorer performance (longer <b>total</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>distance,</b> reaction time and braking distance) in the morning, and also by sleep deprivation, from measurements obtained at 40 kph (incorrect initial speed). Except for a tendency observed after the sleepless night to deviate from the initial speed, it seems that crash avoidance capabilities are quite unaffected by the two disturbance factors. Consequently, some motorcycle handling capabilities (stability at low speed and emergency braking) change in the same way as the diurnal fluctuation observed in body temperature and sleepiness, whereas for others (crash avoidance) the participants were able to maintain their initial performance level despite the high levels of sleepiness recorded after a sleepless night. Motorcycle riders have t...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The Automobile Braking System has {{a crucial}} role for safety of the {{passenger}} and riding quality of the vehicle. The braking force mainly depends on normal reaction on the wheel and the co-efficient of friction between the tire and the road surface. Whenever a vehicle is loaded, the normal reaction on the rear wheel is increased. Thus the amount of braking force required to halt the vehicle with minimum <b>stopping</b> <b>distance,</b> {{is based on the}} pillion load on the vehicle. In this work, in order to vary the braking force in two wheelers, the mechanical leverage which operates the master cylinder is varied based on the pillion load. Thus the amount of braking force developed between ground and tire is varied. This optimum braking force on the disc brake helps in attaining the minimum vehicle <b>stopping</b> <b>distance.</b> In addition to that, it also helps in preventing sliding. Thus the system results in reducing the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> of the two wheelers and providing a better braking efficiency than the conventional braking system.

50|$|In Germany {{the rule}} of thumb for the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> in a city in good {{conditions}} is the 1-second rule, i.e. the distance covered in 1 second should at most be the distance to the vehicle ahead. At 50 km/h this corresponds to about 15 m. For higher speeds up to about 100 km/h outside built-up areas a similarly defined 2-second rule applies, which for 100 km/h translates to about 50 m. For speeds on the order of 100 km/h there is also the more or less equivalent rule that the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> be the speed divided by 2 k/h, referred to as halber tacho (half the speedometer) rule, e.g. for 100 km/h the <b>stopping</b> <b>distance</b> should be about 50 m.|$|R
