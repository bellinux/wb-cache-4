5|$|On March 31, 1821, after {{protracted}} {{legal battles}} with the Desrivières family (the heirs of his wife), McGill College received a royal charter from King George IV. The Charter provided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>College</b> should be deemed and {{taken as a}} University, {{with the power of}} conferring degrees.|$|E
5|$|Despite its name, {{the college}} taught no classes in agriculture, instead concentrating on {{classical}} studies, languages, literature, and applied mathematics. After four years, students could attain degrees in scientific agriculture, civil and mining engineering, and language and literature. Local farmers complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> was abusing its mission, and, in November 1879, {{the president and}} faculty were replaced and given a mandated curriculum in agriculture and engineering.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Black {{and other}} {{citizens}} of Barbourville purchased stock {{to fund the}} start up of a new college in Barbourville. Black insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> be named Union College, because he hoped the college would unify the community. He continued {{to be involved in}} the development of the college, serving as its attorney and as a fund-raiser. Deeply interested in education, he also served as superintendent of the Knox County public schools in 1884 and 1885, but returned to his law practice thereafter.|$|E

50|$|On 21 December 2016, it was {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college's</b> nursery would remain open, following the submission {{of a business}} plan.|$|R
50|$|Primary {{concerns}} hinged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{image of}} <b>the</b> <b>college</b> (particularly <b>the</b> {{image of the}} building) could be damaged, while other concerns were <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college's</b> primary iconic image was being used for promotion of an unrelated business venture.|$|R
5|$|In 1613 James I {{returned}} the castle to Thomas Howard, the Earl of Suffolk, but the castle was now derelict and {{he chose to}} live at Audley End House instead. Thomas's son, Theophilus Howard, fell heavily into debt and sold the castle, the estate and the former Great Park to Sir Robert Hitcham in 1635 for £14,000; as with several other established parks, such as Eye, Kelsale and Hundon, the Great Park was broken up turned into separate estates. Hitcham died the following year, leaving the castle and the manor to Pembroke College in Cambridge, with the proviso <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> destroy the internal castle buildings and construct a poorhouse on the site instead, operating {{under the terms of}} the recently passed Poor Law.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, she {{graduated}} with a Bachelor of Arts, with departmental honors in political science. After some fellow seniors requested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> administration allow a student speaker at commencement, {{she became the first}} student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke. After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes. She was featured in an article published in Life magazine, due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke. She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers. That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).|$|E
5|$|The arms of Maud Green, Lady Parr, {{mother of}} Catherine Parr (the {{last of the}} six wives of Henry VIII and {{stepmother}} to Elizabeth I), were of three stags on an azure background, and this {{became one of the}} elements of the arms of Catherine Parr on her marriage. Her sister, Anne Parr, married William, 1st Earl of Pembroke, whose grandson (the 3rd Earl, also called William) became the first Visitor of the college in 1622. Maud Green's arms are depicted in plasterwork from about 1592 at Powis Castle, owned by a kinsman of the earls. One writer has suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> may have adopted the arms in order to be associated with one of the leading Welsh families of the day.|$|E
50|$|After {{a focused}} {{evaluation}} in 2001, the Massachusetts Commission on Institutions of Higher Education recommended to the Board of Trustees for NEASC <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>College’s</b> accreditation be terminated. In December 2003, the Board of Trustees placed <b>the</b> <b>College</b> on probation.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2014 BCCC was warned by the Middle States Commission <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college's</b> {{accreditation}} was in jeopardy. [...] MSCHE reaffirmed its accreditation on June 25, 2015.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} Ofsted inspection, the Inspectors gave <b>the</b> <b>college's</b> quality of {{provision}} outstanding {{in all of}} the curriculum areas inspected. The inspectors also noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> overall retention and pass rates are very high and are significantly above the national averages for other sixth form colleges.|$|R
5|$|The life of {{the college}} was {{disrupted}} by the English Civil War. Leoline Jenkins, who became principal after the war in 1661, put the college on a more stable financial footing. Little happened at the college during the 18th century, and the 19th century saw a decline in numbers and academic standards. Reforms of Oxford University after two Royal Commissions {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century led to removal of many of the restrictions placed on the college's fellowships and scholarships, such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> ceased to be predominantly full of Welsh students and academics. Students' academic achievements rose in the early 20th century as fellows were appointed to teach in new subjects. Women were first admitted in 1974 and now form a large part of the undergraduate population.|$|E
5|$|There is {{some debate}} over whether the Electoral College favors small- or large-population states. Those who argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>College</b> favors low-population states point out that such states have {{proportionally}} more electoral votes relative to their populations, because each state's number of electors is greater by two than its (proportionally allocated) number of Congressional representatives. In the most populous state, California, this results in an electoral clout 16% smaller than a purely proportional allocation would produce, whereas the least-populous states, with three electors, hold a voting power 143% greater than they would under purely proportional allocation. The proposed compact would give equal weight to each voter's ballot, regardless of what state they live in. Others, however, believe that since most states award electoral votes on a winner-takes-all system, the potential of populous states to shift greater numbers of electoral votes gives them more actual clout.|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> would take over Saint Aeden's Church at McGinley Square from the Archdiocese of Newark.|$|E
50|$|The medical profession, in general, reacted {{very poorly}} to <b>the</b> <b>College,</b> espousing various grounds in the British Medical Journal: <b>that</b> <b>the</b> midwifery role should remain {{subordinate}} to <b>the</b> (male) physician; <b>that</b> despite its name, <b>the</b> <b>college</b> provided an insufficient education; or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> aims were too high. Feminist journals {{such as the}} Alexandra Magazine and Englishwoman’s Journal were more supportive.|$|R

25|$|New Campus Basildon – {{formerly}} part of SEEVIC {{and based}} in Church Walk. It {{was announced in}} January 2017 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> would be closing from September 2017.|$|E
25|$|The College's {{colors were}} changed to green, gold and silver. The colors {{came from the}} College's coat of arms. The change was officially made so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>College</b> and {{athletic}} colors would be identical.|$|E
25|$|But, by 1597, a {{proposal}} to close the college had been addressed (which remained operational), yet, in 1600, the municipal government requested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> provide classes in Latin for the island. This was accomplished in Ribeira Grande during the 17th century, when a school for Latin and Moral Theology was opened.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>college</b> {{operates}} at <b>the</b> temporary campus in Mount Sinai, formerly {{the site of}} Raffles Junior College. It was announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college's</b> permanent campus located off the junction of Sin Ming Avenue and Marymount Road will be ready in late 2019, owing to the delay {{in the construction of}} the Cross Island Line.|$|R
50|$|The District Board of Trustees {{approved}} in June 2009 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college's</b> name should change {{in light of}} offering baccalaureate degrees. On September 8, 2009, the Board approved changing the name to Palm Beach State <b>College.</b> <b>The</b> new name officially took effect on January 12, 2010.|$|R
50|$|Research in 1990 found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college's</b> {{students}} mainly {{lived in}} {{eastern and southern}} Melbourne, and on the Mornington Peninsula. Students residing in the outer east found it particularly popular. It was suggested that {{this was due to}} their relative disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds.|$|R
25|$|In December 2005 the Pune Municipal Corporation {{asked the}} college {{for some of}} its land for road widening. This led to {{considerable}} outrage amongst students, and the issue was under heated debate. It was pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> was classified as a 'heritage complex' by the state government.|$|E
25|$|At an Antioch University Board of Trustees {{meeting in}} June 2007 the board stated {{that while the}} college was only in its third year of {{implementation}} of the plan they had not raised the funds needed, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> would be indefinitely closed {{at the end of}} the 2007–08 academic year.|$|E
25|$|The main {{entrance}} of the college was remodelled in 2003, with the capola from the original Christian Brothers College building on St Georges Terrace as the focal point. The drive has five pillars with dates engraved in them that are significant in the college's history, and a large wall with large brick sections and smaller sections - which symbolise the highs and lows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> has been through.|$|E
50|$|<b>That</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colleges</b> ambitions {{were limited}} {{appears to have}} limited its life-span. Aspiring female {{physicians}} were concerned {{with access to the}} acquisition of credentials enabling them to be listed on the Medical Register, and these <b>the</b> <b>College</b> did not offer. In 1872, the Society unsuccessfully sought funds to extend the curriculum offered at <b>the</b> <b>College,</b> at <b>the</b> same time renaming it <b>The</b> Obstetrical <b>College</b> for Women and in 1873 <b>the</b> <b>College</b> closed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{appellate court}} held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Respondents (who, importantly, {{bear the burden}} of proof) have not shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Appellant’s {{adoption}} of the VPP doctrine is inconsistent with the fundamental doctrines of <b>the</b> <b>College.</b> [...] <b>The</b> appellate court further held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>College’s</b> status as a beneficiary under the purpose trust over the Premises was not conditioned on its continued doctrinal alignment with the Church.|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} {{developed}} in response to <b>the</b> conflicts <b>that</b> have arisen over the mission of <b>the</b> community <b>college.</b> Critics of community <b>colleges</b> claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> have become unfocused and lost their way {{in an attempt to}} {{be all things to all}} people, while advocates state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> play a broad, but essential, educational, social, and economic role in society. The paper is intended to clarify some of the underlying assumptions and suggest a framework for analyzing the optimal set of missions for <b>the</b> <b>colleges.</b> Descriptions of <b>the</b> current arguments about the missions of community colleges are presented, including the collegiate or academic function, vocational preparation, economic development activities, remediation, and community service. The authors then assert that integrating several of these functions at a single institution benefits <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> by allowing them to take advantage of possible complementarities and economies of scope. Specific advantages may include improved coordination betwee...|$|R
25|$|In 1979, RIT {{took over}} Eisenhower College, {{a liberal arts}} college located in Seneca Falls, New York. Despite making a 5-year {{commitment}} to keep Eisenhower open, RIT announced in July 1982 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>college</b> would close immediately. One final year of operation by Eisenhower's academic program {{took place in the}} 1982–83 school year on the Henrietta campus. The final Eisenhower graduation took place in May 1983 back in Seneca Falls.|$|E
25|$|Performance {{history for}} Broad Run {{students}} during the span from 2000 to 2006 shows a steady improvement in Math scores (note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>College</b> Board added the Writing component to the examination {{for the first}} time in 2006, and the Critical Reading section was previously called Verbal). In 2006 the school was the only Loudoun County high school whose average SAT scores increased from the previous year.|$|E
25|$|Manning {{arrived at}} Newport in July 1763 and was {{introduced}} to Stiles, who agreed to write the Charter for the College. Stiles's first draft was read to the General Assembly in August 1763 and rejected by Baptist members who worried <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>College</b> Board of Fellows would under-represent the Baptists. A revised Charter written by Stiles and Ellery {{was adopted by the}} Assembly on March 3, 1764.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, at the {{prompting}} of Protestant interests <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> {{were not}} permitted to give instruction in theology. <b>The</b> result was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>colleges</b> became derided as the [...] "godless colleges" [...] — Pope Pius IX even {{went as far as}} saying they were [...] "detrimental to religion" [...] in an official condemnation - and this non-acceptance was articulated {{in the creation of the}} Catholic University of Ireland to rival <b>the</b> <b>colleges.</b>|$|R
