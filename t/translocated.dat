40|$|The insulin {{receptor}} substrate 1 (IRS- 1) can <b>translocate</b> to the nuclei and nucleoli {{of several}} types of cells. Nuclear translocation can be induced by an activated {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} receptor (IGF-IR), and by certain oncogenes, such as the Simian virus 40 T antigen and v-src. We have asked whether IRS- 2 could also <b>translocate</b> to the nuclei. In addition, we have studied the effects of functional mutations in the IGF-IR on nuclear translocation of IRS proteins. IRS- 2 <b>translocates</b> to the nuclei of mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing the IGF-IR, but, at variance with IRS- 1, does not <b>translocate</b> in cells expressing the Simian virus 40 T antigen. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the IGF-IR abrogate translocation of the IRS proteins...|$|R

Using immunoelectron microscopy, we localize to the Golgi stack the glycosyltransferases that produce glucosylceramide (GlcCer), lactosylceramide (LacCer), and GM 3. GlcCer is synthesized on the cytosolic side and must <b>translocate</b> across to the Golgi lumen for LacCer synthesis. However, only very little natural GlcCer <b>translocates</b> across the Golgi in vitro.

5|$|The {{northern}} quoll (D. hallucatus) {{could be}} found in the northern third of Australia a century ago. Presently, it resides in high rocky areas and areas with heavy rainfall. It is abundant on the minor islands surrounding northern Australia. In 2003, northern quolls were <b>translocated</b> to Astell and Pobassoo Islands to isolate them from the toxic invasive cane toad. Genetic analysis indicates it is the earliest offshoot from the ancestors of other quolls.|$|E
5|$|The Laysan duck is an insular {{relative}} of the mallard, with a very small and fluctuating population. Mallards sometimes arrive on its island home during migration, and {{can be expected to}} occasionally have remained and hybridised with Laysan ducks as long as these species have existed. However, these hybrids are less well adapted to the peculiar ecological conditions of Laysan Island than the local ducks, and thus have lower fitness. These ducks were found throughout the Hawaiian archipelago before 400AD, after which they suffered a rapid decline during the Polynesian colonisation. Now, their range includes only Laysan Island. It is one of the successfully <b>translocated</b> birds, after having become nearly extinct in the early 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH {{relies on the}} malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is <b>translocated</b> to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD+. A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.|$|E

5|$|Tammars {{from these}} areas were {{introduced}} to Kawau Island in New Zealand by colonial administrator Sir George Grey in 1870. Since then, they have flourished {{to the point where}} their foraging has damaged indigenous plants. Pest control operators have used sodium fluoroacetate, a naturally occurring rodenticide, to control their populations, a practice which has been controversial because of its possible effect on organisms not targeted, including humans. Cyanide pellets have been used as an alternative. In 1985, tammars {{were introduced to}} the North Island of the Houtman Abrolhos and have made similar impacts on native vegetation. Their numbers grew to 450 individuals, but by 2008 culling efforts appeared to have reduced their numbers to 25 individuals. In 2003, the Monarto Zoo temporarily housed 85 tammars from New Zealand awaiting reintroduction to the Innes National Park on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. Four releases have been made, and a stable wild population of 100–120 animals exists as of 2012. Tammars have also been successfully <b>translocated</b> to other areas, such as Nambung National Park and Avon Valley National Park in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{nonetheless}} evaluated as critically endangered by the IUCN because {{the population is}} expected to undergo a rapid decline if the brown tree snake becomes established on Saipan. The primary threat to this species is the brown tree snake, a native of Australia, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, which eliminated all 12 landbird species on nearby Guam after being accidentally introduced. The snake has not yet become established on Saipan, {{one of the two}} islands that compose the range of the golden white-eye, and which holds the largest population of the species. The isolation of Aguijan makes the introduction of brown tree snakes there unlikely, but the small population there is vulnerable as the island is only 718 ha (1774 acres) in size and a direct hit by a supertyphoon could wipe them out. Efforts are under way to breed the species in captivity and to prevent the snakes from being introduced and established on Saipan. Six zoos have recently received this species and breeding was expected to begin by 2011. Success came more quickly, and the first captive birds were bred in 2009 in the North Carolina Zoo. Birds from captive breeding will be introduced on new islands. In addition, 24 birds were <b>translocated</b> from Saipan to the island of Sarigan, a predator-free island reserve, in 2011 in the hope of establishing a breeding population.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Rho GTPases are {{important}} regulators of many cellular processes. Subversion of Rho GTPases {{is a common}} infection strategy employed by many important human pathogens. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC) <b>translocate</b> the effector EspH, which inactivates mammalian Rho guanine exchange factors (GEFs), as well as Map, EspT, and EspM 2, which, by mimicking mammalian RhoGEFs, activate Rho GTPases. In this study we found that EspH induces focal adhesion disassembly, triggers cell detachment, activates caspase- 3, and induces cytotoxicity. EspH-induced cell detachment and caspase- 3 activation can be offset by EspT, EspM 2, and the Salmonella Cdc 42 /Rac 1 GEF effector SopE, which remain active {{in the presence of}} EspH. EPEC and EHEC therefore use a novel strategy of controlling Rho GTPase activity by <b>translocating</b> one effector to inactivate mammalian RhoGEFs, replacing themwith bacterial RhoGEFs. This study also ex-pands the functional range of bacterial RhoGEFs to include cell adhesion and survival. IMPORTANCE Many human pathogens use a type III secretion system to <b>translocate</b> effectors that can functionally be divided into signaling, disabling, and countervirulence effectors. Among the signaling effectors are those that activate Rho GTPases, which {{play a central role in}} coordinating actin dynamics. However, many pathogens also <b>translocate</b> effectors with antagonistic or counteractive functions. For example, Salmonella <b>translocates</b> SopE and SptP, which sequentially turn Rac 1 and Cdc 42 on and off. In this paper, we show that enteropathogenic E. coli <b>translocates</b> EspH, which inactivates mammalian RhoGEFs and triggers cytotoxicity and at the same time <b>translocates</b> the bacterial RhoGEFs EspM 2 and EspT, which are insensitive to EspH...|$|R

40|$|FtsK is a hexameric DNA {{translocase}} that {{participates in}} the final stages of bacterial chromosome segregation. Here we investigate the DNA-binding and translocation activities of FtsK in real time by imaging fluorescently tagged proteins on nanofabricated curtains of DNA. We show that FtsK preferentially loads at 8 -bp KOPS (FtsK Orienting Polar Sequences) sites and that loading is enhanced in the presence of ADP. We also demonstrate that FtsK locates KOPS through a mechanism that does not involve extensive 1 D diffusion at the scale of our resolution. Upon addition of ATP, KOPS-bound FtsK <b>translocates</b> in the direction dictated by KOPS polarity, and once FtsK has begun <b>translocating</b> it does not rerecognize KOPS from either direction. However, FtsK can abruptly change directions while <b>translocating</b> along DNA independent of KOPS, suggesting that the ability to reorient on DNA does not arise from DNA sequence-specific effects. Taken together, our data support a model in which FtsK locates KOPS through random collisions, preferentially engages KOPS in the ADP-bound state, <b>translocates</b> in the direction dictated by the polar orientation of KOPS, and is incapable of recognizing KOPS while <b>translocating</b> along DNA...|$|R
25|$|To cause {{growth in}} the {{required}} domains, auxins must of necessity be active preferentially in them. Local auxin maxima can be formed by active biosynthesis in certain cells of tissues, for example via tryptophan-dependent pathways, but auxins are not synthesized in all cells (even if cells retain the potential ability to do so, only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated in them). For that purpose, auxins have {{to be not only}} <b>translocated</b> toward those sites where they are needed, but also they must have an established mechanism to detect those sites. For that purpose, auxins have to be <b>translocated</b> toward those sites where they are needed. Translocation is driven throughout the plant body, primarily from peaks of shoots to peaks of roots (from up to down).|$|E

40|$|SummaryRing NTPases are a {{class of}} {{ubiquitous}} molecular motors involved in basic biological partitioning processes. dsDNA viruses encode ring ATPases that <b>translocate</b> their genomes to near-crystalline densities within pre-assembled viral capsids. Here, X-ray crystallography, cryoEM, and biochemical analyses of the dsDNA packaging motor in bacteriophage phi 29 show how individual subunits are arranged in a pentameric ATPase ring and suggest how their activities are coordinated to <b>translocate</b> dsDNA. The resulting pseudo-atomic structure of the motor and accompanying functional analyses show how ATP is bound in the ATPase active site; identify two DNA contacts, including a potential DNA <b>translocating</b> loop; demonstrate that a trans-acting arginine finger is involved in coordinating hydrolysis around the ring; and suggest a functional coupling between the arginine finger and the DNA <b>translocating</b> loop.

40|$|The {{antibiotic}} ionophore ionomycin <b>translocates</b> Ca from an aqueous medium into {{or across}} an organic immiscible phase. At pH 8. 0, ionomycin <b>translocates</b> less Ca than A 23187, {{the effects of}} these ionophores being additive to one another. The capacity of ionomycin to <b>translocate</b> Ca across the organic phase is dramatically decreased when the pH of the aqueous media is reduced from 8. 0 to 7. 5 or lower values. Ionomycin also mediates Ca exchange-diffusion in liposomes, the magnitude of such a process being greater in fluid than in rigid liposomes. At a physiological pH (7. 4), ionomycin is unexpectedly as potent as A 23187 in mediating Ca transport in fluid liposomes. These findings suggest that the capacity of ionophores to <b>translocate</b> Ca across model membranes depends on both the transverse and lateral mobility of the ionophoretic molecules. The relative importance of the latter phenomenon itself largely depends on the stoichiometry of the Ca-ionophore complex. © 1981. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
