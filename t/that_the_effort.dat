However, when the state legislature did not give approval for the county to provide funds by an April 10 deadline, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> had failed and the city's hopes rested in its lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product. He {{said that there were}} enough ideas for a sequel within the new intellectual property if players were interested. Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate the number of slaves in ancient Greece, {{given the lack of}} a precise census and variations in definitions during that era. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, on average three or four slaves per household. In the 5th century BC, Thucydides remarked on the desertion of 20,890 slaves during the war of Decelea, mostly tradesmen. The lowest estimate, of 20,000 slaves, during the time of Demosthenes, corresponds to one slave per family. Between 317 BC and 307 BC, the tyrant Demetrius Phalereus ordered a general census of Attica, which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves. The orator Hypereides, in his Against Areistogiton, recalls <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to enlist 15,000 male slaves of military age led to the defeat of the Southern Greeks at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), which corresponds to the figures of Ctesicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{sides of}} the Tor have seven deep, roughly {{symmetrical}} terraces, or lynchets. Their formation remains a mystery with many possible explanations. They may have been formed {{as a result of}} natural differentiation of the layers of Lias stone and clay used by farmers during the Middle Ages as terraced hills to make ploughing for crops easier. Author Nicholas Mann questions this theory. If agriculture had been the reason for the creation of the terraces, it would be expected <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> would be concentrated on the south side, where the sunny conditions would provide a good yield, but the terraces are equally deep on the northern side, which would provide little benefit. Additionally, none of the other slopes of the island have been terraced, even though the more sheltered locations would provide a greater return on the labour involved. Alternatively, the flattened paths may have been created by the hooves of grazing cattle.|$|E
5|$|Work on the {{foundations}} for the lighthouse continued until 30 September. A total of 296 charges were used to remove 2,000tons of rock and Stevenson believed that the rock was so hard <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> involved was four times that required for boring Aberdeenshire granite. The work went well {{but by the end}} of the second season, no blocks had yet been laid. However, between April 1839 and June 1840 4,300 blocks had been fashioned, the stone donated by the Duke of Argyll from quarries on Mull. The roughly hewn rock was taken to Hynish where the blocks were hammered and chiselled into shape. The largest weighed over 2.5tons, the smallest 0.75tons and the precision required meant that a single block could take 320 man hours to complete.|$|E

5|$|Sakaguchi {{revealed}} that {{he was working on}} a new game in July 2009. Initially targeted for a reveal that year, this was delayed for unknown reasons into 2010. The game was announced by Nintendo in January 2010, alongside its platform and logo. It was released on January 27, 2011. Despite prompting interest from genre fans in the west since its official announcement, shortly before its Japanese release, Nintendo announced that The Last Story would remain exclusive to Japan. Nintendo explained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> involved in bringing The Last Story overseas would be too much work on top of other important releases such as Kirby's Epic Yarn and titles for the Nintendo 3DS. Despite this, Nintendo stated that there was a strong possibility of it releasing in the United Kingdom due to its growing RPG market. It was officially announced for Europe in June 2011. The European localization was handled by Nintendo of Europe, using the same team that had done Xenoblade Chronicles. British voice actors were used for the dubbing, making use of various accents for the different characters. Some of the original programmers helped with the implementation of the localization, and it underwent unspecified adjustments. The game released in Europe on February 24, 2012. It received a limited edition, featuring a CD with seven music tracks and an artbook. It was also released in Australia on February 23.|$|E

25|$|General Hermann Breith, {{commander}} of III Panzer Corps requested the relief formations be united {{to attempt to}} force a corridor to the encircled Gruppe Stemmermann. This request was refused, and the counter-encirclement of the Soviet forces was attempted. The attack by the XLVII Panzer Corps' 11th Panzer Division on the southeastern flank of the pocket quickly stalled, as it only had only 27 tanks and 34 assault guns operational. The III Panzer Corps' attempt continued until 8 February, when it became undeniable <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> had failed. Manstein ordered the corps to instead drive directly to the relief of Gruppe Stemmermann. Pulling the III Panzer Corps back and reorganizing for the new attack 15 kilometers south of Boyarka took three days.|$|E

Laxalt made a brief run for the Republican Presidential nomination during 1987. The campaign lasted only four months after Laxalt determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> had fallen short of its fundraising goals. Political commentators at the time concluded that he had waited too long to enter the race, which meant that not only did his competitors have a leg up in organization, but many of the top political strategists and fundraisers had already signed on with other camps. He was eventually named a co-chairman of George H.W. Bush's successful presidential campaign. Eight years later, he served in a similar capacity in Bob Dole's failed presidential bid.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, he was {{appointed}} Assistant Attorney General {{in charge of the}} Office of Legal Counsel. In this capacity, Rankin may best be remembered for arguing in favor of the African-American plaintiffs in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), advocating that the doctrine of “separate-but-equal” facilities for blacks and whites was unconstitutional. After the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown, Rankin argued in a presentation before the Court <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to desegregate schools should take place gradually in an effort to avoid any violence that might arise from the decision. Accordingly, he suggested the plan by which local school districts submitted desegregation plans to federal judges in their states. In addition, Rankin argued a great range of other important cases before the Supreme Court. He was instrumental in resolving conflicting claims among Western states to the Colorado River, and in establishing a balance of federal and state jurisdictions in offshore oil drilling.|$|E
25|$|In February the British {{government}} {{planned to}} send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed {{the arrival of}} an infantry battalion until 15 May and a second battalion until 12 July. The French in Djibouti were asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> of invading British Somaliland would act as a deterrent and that Djibouti {{would be a more}} tempting target. When the French in French Somaliland rallied to Vichy after the French armistice of 22 June 1940 with Germany, The Officer Commanding, Troops in British Somaliland, Brigadier Arthur Reginald Chater RM, was ordered to make a contingency plan for an evacuation if the colony became untenable. By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesia Regiment (1st NRR), the 2nd (Nyasaland) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (4 × 3.7-inch howitzers) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion 2nd Punjab Regiment and the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment from the Colony of Aden and the lightly armed Somaliland Camel Corps (SCC) including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment. On 8 August the 2nd Battalion Black Watch arrived. The garrison was a motley group with no proper base or headquarters and was short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence. Two anti-aircraft guns were sent over from Aden but that was the most that could be spared.|$|E
