40|$|AbstractThe local delilvery of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> to the {{arterial}} wall represents {{a new strategy}} {{for the treatment of}} vascular diseases, including restenosis. Approaches for local, intravascular, sitespecific delivery include 1) direct deposition of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> into the vessel wall through an intravascular delivery system; 2) systemic administration of inactive agents followed by local activation; and 3) systemic administration of fusion toxins that have a specific affinity to proliferating smooth muscle cells at the angioplasty site. In addition to conventional drugs, new <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agents</b> based on molecular mechanisms, including recombinant genes and antisense oligonucleotides, are now under investigation.

25|$|A major {{limitation}} to {{the therapeutic}} potential {{is the possibility}} of bacteria developing resistance to the peptides, and particularly if that produces a resistance to the body's own immune system use of those peptides. That is, providing a lot of the peptides as a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> makes it easier for resistance to evolve; unlike antibiotic resistance, however, resistance to antimicrobial peptides mimicking those produced by humans can make the bacteria more resistant to the body's own immune system rather than just the antibiotic.|$|E
25|$|NET and {{its major}} active {{metabolite}} 5α-DHNET {{have been found}} to act as irreversible aromatase inhibitors (Ki = 1.7μM and 9.0μM, respectively). However, like the case of 5α-reductase, the concentrations required are probably too high to be clinically relevant at typical dosages. 5α-DHNET specifically has been assessed and found to be selective in its inhibition of aromatase, and does not affect cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase, 21-hydroxylase, or 11β-hydroxylase. Since it is not aromatized (and hence cannot be transformed into an estrogenic metabolite), unlike NET, 5α-DHNET has been proposed as a potential <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Deoxyribozymes, {{also called}} DNAzymes or {{catalytic}} DNA, are first discovered in 1994 and quickly {{emerged as a}} new class of metalloenzymes. Almost all DNAzymes require metal ions for their function; thus they are classified as metalloenzymes. Although ribozymes mostly catalyze cleavage of RNA substrates, variety of reactions can be catalyzed by DNAzymes including RNA/DNA cleavage, RNA/DNA ligation, amino acid phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and carbon–carbon bond formation. Yet, DNAzymes that catalyze RNA cleavage reaction are the most extensively explored ones. 10-23 DNAzyme, discovered in 1997, {{is one of the most}} studied catalytic DNAs with clinical applications as a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agent.</b> Several metal-specific DNAzymes have been reported including the GR-5 DNAzyme (lead-specific), the CA1-3 DNAzymes (copper-specific), the 39E DNAzyme (uranyl-specific) and the NaA43 DNAzyme (sodium-specific).|$|E

25|$|Another {{gene that}} {{experiences}} {{a change in}} methylation status in atherosclerosis is the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT3), which produces a protein responsible for the transport of lactate and other ketone bodies out of many cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells. In atherosclerosis patients, there {{is an increase in}} methylation of the CpG islands in exon 2, which decreases MCT3 protein expression. The down regulation of MCT3 impairs lactate transport, and significantly increases smooth muscle cell proliferation, which further contributes to the atherosclerotic lesion. An ex vivo experiment using the demethylating agent Decitabine (5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine) was shown to induce MCT3 expression in a dose dependant manner, as all hypermethylated sites in the exon 2 CpG island became demethylated after treatment. This may serve as a novel <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> to treat atherosclerosis, although no human studies have been conducted thus far.|$|E
25|$|Calcium, {{as found}} in food such as milk and green vegetables, is often {{recommended}} to protect against dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent decay of a tooth by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. Streptococcus mutans {{is the leading cause}} of tooth decay. Low concentration fluoride ions act as bacteriostatic <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> and high concentration fluoride ions are bactericidal. The incorporated fluorine makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and, thus, resistant to decay. Topical fluoride is more highly recommended than systemic intake such as by tablets or drops to protect the surface of the teeth. This may include a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash or varnish. Standard fluoride toothpaste (1,000–1,500 ppm) is more effective than low fluoride toothpaste (< 600ppm) to prevent dental caries. After brushing with fluoride toothpaste, rinsing should be avoided and the excess spat out. Many dental professionals include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine visits and recommend the use of xylitol and amorphous calcium phosphate products. Silver diamine fluoride may work better than fluoride varnish to prevent cavities. Water fluoridation also lowers the risk of tooth decay.|$|E
500|$|Seacology {{was founded}} in 1991 by {{ethnobotanist}} Paul Alan Cox in Hawaii using prize money and consulting fees resulting from his efforts to preserve [...] of rainforest outside the village of Falealupo {{on the island of}} Savai'i in Samoa. [...] He later recorded these events in his book, Nafanua: Saving the Samoan Rain Forest. [...] Cox began his work in Samoa in 1973 during his first Mormon missionary service, at which time he learned from local people about the medicinal properties of the native plants. [...] After working with local communities in other rainforests, Cox returned to Samoa in 1984 with his family. His aim was to find a cure for cancer, which had claimed the life of his mother earlier that year. [...] In return for the help of the local healers (called fofo), Cox offered to share the revenue generated by his research with the local villages. [...] Over time, his research identified five new drugs, including the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> prostratin, a potential treatment for HIV. [...] Prostratin was isolated in a concoction made from the bark of the local mamala tree (Homalanthus nutans) and shared with him by a healer named Epenesa Mauigoa, who used it to treat hepatitis. [...] Cox set up royalty agreements to ensure that the Samoans will share in the revenue.|$|E

2500|$|Such {{localized}} {{administration of}} the potent angiogenic growth factor, human FGF-1, has recently given promising results in clinical trials in no-option heart patients. Angiogenesis was documented by angiographically visible [...] "blushing", and functional exercise tests were also performed on a subset of patients. The attractiveness of protein therapy is that large amounts of the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> can be injected into the ischemic area of interest, to pharmacologically start the process of blood vessel growth and collateral arteries formation. In addition, from pharmacokinetic data collected from the recent FGF-1 studies in the human heart, it appears that FGF-1, once it exits the heart, is cleared {{in less than three}} hours from the circulation. This would presumably prevent FGF-1 from stimulating unwanted angiogenesis in other tissues of the bodies where it could potentially cause harm, such as the retina and in the kidneys. No serious adverse events have yet to be noted in any of the completed or ongoing clinical trials in which the FGF-1 protein is used as the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> to stimulate angiogenesis.|$|E

2500|$|Aprepitant {{is taken}} orally {{in the form}} of a capsule. Before {{clinical}} testing, a new class of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>agent</b> has to be characterized in terms of preclinical metabolism and excretion studies. [...] Average bioavailability is found to be around 60-65%. [...] Aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Seven metabolites of aprepitant, which are only weakly active, have been identified in human plasma. [...] As a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, aprepitant can increase plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are metabolized through CYP3A4. Specific interaction has been demonstrated with oxycodone, where aprepitant both increased the efficacy and worsened the side effects of oxycodone; however it is unclear whether this is due to CPY3A4 inhibition or through its NK-1 antagonist action. Following IV administration of a 14C-labeled prodrug of aprepitant (L-758298), which is converted rapidly and completely to aprepitant, approximately 57% of the total radioactivity is excreted in the urine and 45% in feces. No unchanged substance is excreted in urine.|$|E
