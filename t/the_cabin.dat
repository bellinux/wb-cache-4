5|$|As the {{pressure}} was released by <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> rupture, the convective rush of air caused the flames to spread across <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> beginning the second phase. The third phase began {{when most of the}} oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially quenching the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.|$|E
5|$|As he nears <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> the {{imaginary}} Barry appears and tells Alan {{that he will}} have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version of Alan, including the apparition of Barry. Alan is ready to accept that, forcing Alan to fight Taken illusions of Dr. Hartman, Barry, and the Andersons, defeating them all before he is able to reenter <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> His crazed side is in a paranoid state on <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—"Return".|$|E

40|$|The {{comfort of}} the {{operators}} in <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> of vehicles is getting an increasingly important issue. At first glance, <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> of professional machines (earth-moving equipment, busses, harvesting equipment) might look modern and highly comfortable. However, this {{does not imply that}} <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> actually are comfortable, especially in the long term. How to improve comfort in combination with efficiency in <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> of vehicles is the topic of this symposium...|$|R

5|$|Prior to impact, {{passengers}} did {{not assume}} the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion of <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped {{through a hole in}} <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> floor near the flight attendant’s position. Several passengers reported assisting others out of <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and slid down a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted out of the water by ground personnel.|$|E

5|$|The first {{target of}} the WSGA was Nate Champion, {{who was at the}} KC Ranch (also known as Kaycee) at that time. They were tasked to perform the {{assassination}} that others had failed to carry out five months before. The group traveled to the ranch late Friday, April 8, 1892, quietly surrounded the buildings, and waited for daybreak. Three men besides Champion were at the KC. Two men who were evidently going to spend the night on their way through were captured as they emerged from <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> early that morning to collect water at the nearby Powder River, while the third, Nick Ray, was shot while standing inside the doorway of <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> As the gunmen opened fire on <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> Champion grabbed the mortally wounded Nick Ray back to <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> The latter died hours later, and Champion was left besieged inside the log cabin alone.|$|E
50|$|The pulse-movement gondola system runs {{two sets}} of two {{unidirectional}} six-seater tandem cabins.

It spread from the left wall of <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> to the right, with the floor being affected only briefly.|$|E
5|$|Using Dexter Morgan's (Michael C. Hall) {{satellite}} navigation system, Lila Tournay (Jaime Murray) arrives at <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> in the Everglades. She breaks in {{to find an}} imprisoned Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King), who tells her that Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher. She can only sympathize with Dexter, however, for having to hide such an enormous secret, and refuses to unlock Doakes's cage. Convinced that Dexter is her soul mate, Lila tries to help him by blowing up <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> with Doakes inside. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy's (Keith Carradine) task force has determined Doakes's location, and Dexter must race his colleagues to reach <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> first. When he arrives at <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> he discovers {{that it has been}} destroyed in a fire and at first believes it to be a miracle. The next morning, the police find Doakes's body in the water, while Dexter embraces his freedom. He visits his girlfriend Rita Bennett's (Julie Benz) house, where they reconcile after having sex.|$|E

As they unpack, Alan finds that Alice {{arranged}} this trip to try to break his writer's block, scheduling him to see a Bright Falls psychologist named Dr. Hartman and leaving a typewriter in <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> for him. Alan is infuriated and takes a short walk, but runs back when Alice cries for help. He returns to <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> just as Alice is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force. Alan dives into the water after her, blacking out as he submerges.|$|E
5|$|As {{the week}} goes on, {{the people in}} <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> {{are running out of}} food, while Satoru is {{subjected}} to multiple attempts on his life by an unknown assailant. As days pass, Satoru notices that he can see the same lunar phase at SPHIA and at <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> and that both areas are surrounded by a body of water. It is revealed that the Yuni in <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> is from the year 2012, while the Yuni at SPHIA is from 2011. Satoru finds a locked room in the basement of SPHIA, where he encounters a man named Enomoto, monitoring the facility through cameras. Enomoto tells Satoru that it is not consciousnesses that are transferred but the entire area within a 110-metre radius that is transported across time and space, with their consciousnesses left behind. Satoru attempts to destroy the facility, and Enomoto tries to stop him. A set of transfers occur, and Enomoto is killed by someone using Satoru's body.|$|E

5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found. This wreckage was from the starboard side of <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> just above the three front windows. Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding window on the roof of <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> as had been previously thought. These findings were kept secret until the details were published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|It {{took five}} {{minutes for the}} pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> floor as intended, so they pushed {{it out of the}} way to one side. Although <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the others}} arrive at <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> for the hunting trip. Leslie (Amy Poehler) {{proves to be}} an {{excellent}} hunter and bags the first quail. Growing increasingly agitated, Ron agrees to a challenge that Leslie cannot shoot more birds than he can, and they split up. After {{a few hours of}} hunting, Ron screams and the others rush to his side and find he has been shot in the head. Ann, a nurse, takes Ron back to <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious. Ron asks whether Leslie shot him, but she insists she did not. Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie to hold his mouth open and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself.|$|E
