500|$|<b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> at {{the awesome}} West {{wall of the}} {{mountain}} above them. They walk up the glacier wearing new crampons, probing for crevasses with their ice-axes. They cross the bergschrund and climb [...] "a few feet of easy rock". Carless suggests rappelling 200 feet (60 m) to the next glacier. They agree [...] "it would be difficult" [...] to get back if they did that. They return to their base camp and try again the next morning, again finding their way blocked. They wish the climbing waitresses from Wales were with them.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} half of the scenario, heavy rain descends on the city and the {{citizens}} try to flee, all again seen in slow motion. From the safety of shelter, the six [...] "strangers" [...] watch everyone's futile attempts to avoid the sudden change in weather. Eventually they decide to go outside, where <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> at the sky and allow the rain to soak them. The video ends with Michael whipping his hair. During this scene, you hear a voicing softly in Russian, a reference to Moscow.|$|E
500|$|Animals {{that live}} in groups often give alarm calls that give warning of an attack. For example, vervet monkeys give {{different}} calls depending {{on the nature of}} the attack: for an eagle, a disyllabic cough; for a leopard or other cat, a loud bark; for a python or other snake, a [...] "chutter". The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> and run into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs and look around for snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> {{the gully}} and soon espied the {{youngest}} Rover hurrying toward them.|$|R
60|$|Above {{the control}} panel the wall speaker made a sound, a {{sputtering}} static. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Wake, priests," [...] {{she cried}} {{in a loud}} voice, and <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> astonished, rubbing their eyes, and asked what was the matter.|$|R
500|$|The boys readily {{admit to}} the spray painting, {{and explain to}} the city council that the word [...] "fag" [...] is not {{intended}} as an insult to homosexuals, and is being used only in reference to a contemptible person who rides a Harley motorcycle, or [...] "an inconsiderate douchebag", as Stan puts it. They call upon the council to formally recognize this new usage. Support from the town, including the local gay community (who realize that the boys weren't intending to insult them, but in fact, the bikers), results in a town ordinance declaring {{a change in the}} word's definition. This action leads to negative publicity {{from the rest of the}} nation, and further angers the displaced bikers who refuse to be labeled as [...] "fags" [...] (one rider even assaulted a news reporter for calling him fag to his face three times). <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> the word in the dictionary and learn its definition has adapted over the years: it previously meant [...] "an unpleasant old woman" [...] and a bundle of sticks.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When his {{children}} are older, {{and he feels}} that <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> to him' thought Violet, hopefully, {{and in the meantime}} she prayed.|$|E
6000|$|PAUL. So am I, my sweetheart. More than I {{can tell}} you. (The {{sound of a}} window being opened is heard. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> and see the BARONESS dressed in a peignoir of the tenderest blue, {{emerging}} on to the right hand of the three balconies.) ...|$|E
60|$|They {{went into}} a large room, where two or three natives were sitting writing. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> in {{surprise}} at the two travel-stained English lads.|$|R
60|$|As {{they went}} in <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> and saw a great many cannons pointed down at them from the embrasures in the {{surrounding}} ramparts and bastions.|$|R
60|$|A wild shout {{from every}} {{height of the}} defile was the answer. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> round; the crest of every steep was covered with armed Arabs, each man with his musket levelled.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' {{replied the}} manager. 'I bought 'em cheap, at a sale the other day, and they'll come in admirably. That's the London plan. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> some dresses, and properties, {{and have a}} piece written to fit 'em. Most of the theatres keep an author on purpose.' ...|$|E
60|$|Naylor {{whispers to}} Wynd, who sets {{the two little}} girls on the table, and hurries out with him. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> the road, and see no one; run {{a couple of hundred}} yards, where they catch a sight of the next turn, clear in the moonlight. There is no one on the road.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dark {{faces and}} golden crowns--they're kings of Ethiopia. And I {{like the way}} the tits cling to the flowers and pick out the seeds, while the other loutish birds, {{grubbing}} dirtily for their food, look up in envy from the ground. Do <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> in envy? That's the literary touch, I'm afraid. Education again. It always comes back to that." [...] He was silent.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> in surprise. He was grimed {{with the}} dust, which had risen in clouds {{as he drove}} along, and his clothes bore signs of their immersion.|$|R
60|$|They {{were deep}} in the forest when they heard a whir overhead. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> quickly to see a number of {{partridges}} sailing past close to the tree tops.|$|R
60|$|They {{talked for}} an hour or more; neither, in fact, took an exact account of the time. Suddenly <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to see a dark-faced, correct-looking servant {{standing}} before them.|$|R
6000|$|JULIA (with {{suppressed}} fury). You seem to {{have found}} a very interesting book, Dr. Paramore. (<b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> astonished.) May I ask what it is? (She stoops swiftly; snatches the book from Paramore; and comes down to the table quickly to look at it whilst they rise in amazement.) Good Words! (She flings it on the table and sweeps back past Charteris, exclaiming contemptuously) You fool! (Paramore and Grace, meanwhile, come from the recess; Paramore bewildered, Grace very determined.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Therein you belie {{the nature}} of an Indian. Even the Mingo adores but the true and living God. 'Tis a wicked {{fabrication}} of the whites, and I say it to the shame of my color, {{that would make the}} warrior bow down before images of his own creation. It is true, they endeavor to make truces with the wicked one--as who would not with an enemy he cannot conquer!--but <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> for favor and assistance to the Great and Good Spirit only." ...|$|E
60|$|To his own wonder, Will Brangwen {{found himself}} in an {{electric}} state of passion. To his wonder, he had stopped her at the gate as they came home from Ilkeston one night, and had kissed her, blocking her way and kissing her whilst {{he felt as if}} some blow were struck at him in the dark. And when they went indoors, he was acutely angry that her parents looked up scrutinizing at him and her. What right had they there: why should <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>up!</b> Let them remove themselves, or look elsewhere.|$|E
60|$|Two men, Cathcart and his assistant, who {{was only}} a boy, were {{lounging}} in low chairs. As he entered <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> exchanging quick, startled glances. Then Cathcart gave vent to a little exclamation.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at it. The sill {{was fully}} six {{feet from the}} ground. The window was {{a little over a}} foot wide, with a heavy bar running down the centre, and cross bars.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he drew aside some heavy {{curtains}} and entered a large room. Some {{ten or twelve}} young men were assembled there. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> in surprise as Giscon entered followed by his companion.|$|R
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> {{with their}} pale and sunken faces, [...] And their look is dread to see, [...] For they mind you of their angels in high places, [...] With eyes turned on Deity. [...] "How long," [...] they say, [...] "how long, O cruel nation, [...] Will you stand, {{to move the}} world, on a child's heart,-- [...] Stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation, [...] And tread onward to your throne amid the mart? [...] Our blood {{splashes}} upward, O gold-heaper, [...] And your purple shows your path! [...] But the child's sob in the silence curses deeper [...] Than the strong man in his wrath." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> {{with their}} pale and sunken faces, [...] And their looks are sad to see, [...] For the man's hoary anguish draws and presses [...] Down the cheeks of infancy; [...] "Your old earth," [...] they say, [...] "is very dreary, [...] Our young feet," [...] they say, [...] "are very weak; [...] Few paces have we taken, yet are weary-- [...] Our grave-rest is very far to seek: [...] Ask the aged why they weep, {{and not the}} children, [...] For the outside earth is cold, [...] And we young ones stand without, in our bewildering, [...] And the graves are for the old." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have the}} jolliest little fellows this time--about seven of them-- fellows {{scarcely}} {{too big to}} take on my knee, and talk to about God, and Heaven, and Jesus Christ; and I feel almost as if I {{had a kind of}} instinct of love towards them, as <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> wonderingly with their deep deep eyes, and smooth and glossy skins, and warm soft cheeks, and ask their simple questions. I wish you could have seen the twenty Banks Islanders as I told them that most excellent of all tales--the story of Joseph. How their eyes glistened! and they pushed out their heads to hear the sequel of his making himself known to his brethren, and asking once more about [...] "the old man of whom ye spake, is he yet alive?" ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to {{find the}} room filled with the silent, solemn-eyed Mangaboos. Each of the {{vegetable}} folks bore a branch covered with sharp thorns, which was thrust defiantly toward the horse, the kitten and the piglets.|$|R
6000|$|... "The same, ma'am," [...] said Mrs. Mackridge. [...] "They {{say he was}} extremelay {{popular in}} New South Wales. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to him greatlay. I knew him, ma'am, as a young man. A very nice {{pleasant}} young fella." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When Captain Abner and Sam {{returned}} from the stable <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and down the far-stretching road, and then, {{at the invitation of}} the toll-gate woman, they seated themselves on a bench {{at the back of the}} toll-house.|$|R
60|$|Again, if {{a mother}} neglect her child, it cries, it weeps for her love and attention. Its pitiful lament {{is one of}} the forms of {{compulsion}} from the upper center. This insistence on pity, on love, {{is quite different from the}} rageous weeping, which is compulsion from the lower center, below the diaphragm. Again, some children just drop everything they can lay hands on over the edge of their crib, or their table. They drop everything out of sight. And then <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> with a curious look of negative triumph. This is again a form of recoil from the upper center, the obliteration of the thing which is outside. And here a child is acting quite differently from the child who joyously smashes. The desire to smash comes from the lower centers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so?" [...] said Fanny: [...] "in my opinion, my uncle {{would not like}} any addition. I think he values the very {{quietness}} you speak of, and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants. And {{it does not appear}} to me that we are more serious than we used to be--I mean before my uncle went abroad. As well as I can recollect, it was always much the same. There was never much laughing in his presence; or, if there is any difference, it is not more, I think, than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first. There must be a sort of shyness; but I cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry, except when my uncle was in town. No young people's are, I suppose, when those <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> to are at home".|$|E
6000|$|In {{the first}} place, it would shake entirely {{the respect and}} reverence in which the priesthood were held, and would annihilate their influence. The temples would be deserted, and, losing the faith which they now so steadfastly held in the gods, people would soon cease to have any {{religion}} at all. [...] "There are no people," [...] they urged, [...] "on {{the face of the}} earth so moral, so contented, so happy, and so easily ruled as the Egyptians; but what would they be did you destroy all their beliefs, and launch them upon a sea of doubt and speculation! No longer would <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> to those who have so long been their guides and teachers, and whom they regard as possessing a knowledge and wisdom infinitely beyond theirs. They would accuse us of having deceived them, and in their blind fury destroy alike the gods and their ministers. The idea of such a thing is horrible." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{moved on}} rapidly {{in silence for}} a few minutes when their {{attention}} was attracted by the flapping of the wings of a bird above them. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to discover a parrot circling about over their heads.|$|R
50|$|Netizens {{have criticized}} i.n.g for imitating S.H.E, a girl group that debuted five years earlier. In response, i.n.g stated that <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to S.H.E as models of success, {{and had no}} plans to make {{themselves}} into S.H.E clones.|$|R
60|$|Doctor Sarson {{stood by}} Mr. Fentolin's chair, and {{together}} <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> through {{the fragments of}} the trap-door. Meekins was still breathing heavily. Suddenly they {{heard the sound of}} a sharp report, as of a door above being slammed.|$|R
