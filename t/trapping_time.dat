40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} paper the marked changes in {{photochemical}} <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> over the absorption/fluorescence band of isolated PSI–LHCI are studied by means of time resolved fluorescence decay measurements. For emission at 680 – 690 nm the effective <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> is close to 17 – 18 ps, and represents the effective <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> from the bulk antenna. At wavelengths above 700 nm the effective <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> increases in a monotonic way, over the entire emission band, to attain values {{in the range of}} 70 – 80 ps near 760 nm. This is argued to be caused by “uphill” energy transfer from the low energy states to the core antenna and reaction centre. These data, together with the steady state emission spectrum, permit calculation of the overall <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> for maize PSI–LHCI, which is estimated to be approximately 40 ps. The wavelength dependence of the <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> indicates, that in PSI–LHCI there exists at least one red form which emits at lower energies than the 735 nm state. These data indicate that Photosystem I is about 55 % diffusion limited...|$|E

In this paper, we study the trapping problem on two families of networks. The first is deterministic, often called $(x,y) $-flowers; the other is random, which is a combination of $(1, 3) $-flower and $(2, 4) $-flower and thus called hybrid networks. The two network families display rich behavior as observed in various real systems, as well as some unique topological properties not shared by other networks. We derive analytically the average <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> for random walks on both the $(x,y) $-flowers and the hybrid networks with an immobile trap positioned at an initial node, i. e., a hub node with the highest degree in the networks. Based on these analytical formulae, we show how the average <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> scales with the network size. Comparing the obtained results, we further uncover that fractal dimension plays a decisive role in the behavior of average <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> on fractal scale-free networks, i. e., the average <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> decreases with an increasing fractal dimension.

Recently Horizontal Bridgman (HB) Cd{sub 1 {minus}x}Zn{sub x}Te crystals produced by IMARAD Co. have also been successfully fabricated into nuclear spectroscopic radiation detectors. In view of the database of many years' study of the electrical properties of VHPB CZT grown and obtained from various sources, the authors also studied the HB CZT crystals in order to compare the defects present in both different kinds of crystals grown by different methods. The VHB-grown samples were examined using thermoelectric emission spectroscopy (TEES), X- and gamma ray spectroscopy and laser induced transient charge technique (TCT). The surface and the bulk crystalline homogeneity were mapped using triaxial double crystal x-ray diffraction (TADXRD) and infrared transmission spectroscopy (IR).

Trapping of excitations, created at the periphery of the dendrimer, on a trap located at its core, is used as a probe of {{the efficiency of the}} energy transport across the dendrimer. The transport process is treated as incoherent hopping of excitations between nearest-neighbor dendrimer units and is described using a rate equation. We account for radiative and non-radiative decay of the excitations while diffusing across the dendrimer. We derive exact expressions for the Laplace transform of the <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> distribution and the efficiency of trapping and analyze those for various realizations of the energy bias, number of dendrimer generations, and relative rates for decay and hopping.

In the SEDLF, a random walker cannot move while storing energy, and it jumps by the stored energy. The SEDLF shows a whole spectrum of anomalous diffusions including subdiffusion and superdiffusion, depending on the coupling parameter between storing time (<b>trapping</b> <b>time)</b> and stored energy. This stochastic process can be investigated analytically with the aid of renewal theory. Here, we consider two different renewal processes, i. e., ordinary renewal process and equilibrium renewal process, when the mean <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> does not diverge. We analytically show the phase diagram according to the coupling parameter and the power exponent in the trapping-time distribution.

40|$|Wide bandgap {{semiconductors}} {{are being}} widely investigated {{because they have}} the potential to satisfy the stringent material requirements of high resolution, room temperature gamma-ray spectrometers. In particular, Cadmium Zinc Telluride (Cd 1 -xZnxTe, x~ 0. 1) and Thallium Bromide (TlBr), due to their combination of high resistivity, high atomic number and good electron mobility, have became very promising candidates for use in X- and gamma-ray detectors operating at room temperature. In this study, carrier trapping times were measured in CZT and TlBr as a function of temperature and material quality. Carrier lifetimes and tellurium inclusion densities were measured in detector-grade Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) crystals grown by the High Pressure Bridgman method and Modified Bridgman method. Excess carriers were produced in the material using a pulsed YAG laser with a 1064 nm wavelength and 7 ns pulse width. Infrared microscopy was used to measure the tellurium defect densities in CZT crystals. The electronic decay was optically measured at room temperature. Spatial mapping of lifetimes and defect densities in CZT was performed to determine the relationship between defect density and electronic decay. A significant and strong correlation was found between the volume fraction of tellurium inclusions and the carrier <b>trapping</b> <b>time.</b> Carrier trapping times and tellurium inclusions were measured in CZT in the temperature range from 300 K to 110 K and the results were analyzed using a theoretical trapping model. Spatial mapping of carrier trapping times and defect densities in CZT was performed to determine the relationship between defect density and electronic decay. While a strong correlation between <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> and defect density of tellurium inclusions was observed, there was no significant change in the trap energy. Carrier trapping times were measured in detector grade thallium bromide (TlBr) and compared with the results for cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) in a temperature range from 300 K to 110 K. The experimental data was analyzed using a trapping model. In CZT, because the majority carrier concentration is close to the intrinsic carrier concentration, the <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> increases exponentially as the temperature decreases below about 160 K. While, in TlBr, the majority carrier concentration is many orders of magnitude greater than the intrinsic carrier concentration and the <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> followed a temperature dependence over the range of temperatures studied. The results of the model suggest that a moderately deep compensation center, located approximately 200 meV {{from the middle of the}} bandgap, could be used to significantly increase the room temperature <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> in TlBr. The results of this model demonstrate that the room temperature <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> in TlBr can, in principle, approach 0. 1 ms through the introduction of a moderately deep compensation level but without decreasing the overall trap concentration. This strategy is not possible in CZT, because the band gap is too small to use a moderately deep compensation level while still maintaining high material resistivity. Carrier trapping times were measured in three polycrystalline TlBr samples produced by melting commercial TlBr beads in a sealed quartz ampoule for two hours at three different temperatures near the melting point. The <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> decreased with increasing melting temperature, presumably due to the thermal generation of a trap state...|$|E

40|$|An electrode-based flow-injection system {{suitable}} for the direct determination of salicylic acid is described. The system utilizez a tubular polymer membrrane electrode based on manganese(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride to sense salicylate ions formed in a recipient buffer solution held within the upper channel of a flow-through membrane dialyzer assembly. Samples containing salicylic acid are manually intoduced into the lower channel of the dialysis unit, in which a thin silicone rubber membrane separates the two channels. The analyte is trapped across the membrane as salicylate ions within a static layer of an appropriate recipient buffer. After a fixed <b>trapping</b> <b>time,</b> the recipient plug is flushed to the electrode in a conventional flow-injection manner. Peak potentials observed are logarithmically related to the salicylic acid concentrations in the original sample. Without the dialysis unit, the electrode response to salicylate is nearly Nernstian over the range 2 x 10 - 6 - 10 - 2 M.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{spectacular}} 1991 June X-class flares using gamma-ray data from the Charged Particle Detectors (CPDs) of the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) and 80 GHz millimeter data from Nobeyama, Japan. The CPDs were the only CGRO instrument that did not saturate during the extremely intense 1991 June 4 flare. We have shown that for this flare the CPDs respond to MeV photons, {{most of which are}} due to bremsstrahlung produced by relativistic electrons at the Sun. We have further shown that the gamma-ray and millimeter observations agree numerically if the 80 GHz radiation is gyrosynchrotron radiation produced by trapped electrons and the gamma rays are thick-target bremsstrahlung due to electrons precipitating out of the trap. The requirement that the <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> obtained from the numerical comparison be consistent with the observed time profiles implies a magnetic field between about 200 and 300 G and an electron spectral index between about 3 to 5. By comparing the CPD observations with both the 80 GHz data and nuclear line data from the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) and the Oriented Scintillation Spectroscopy Experiment (OSSE) on CGRO for the flares of June 4, 6, 9, and 11, we found that the ratio of the CPD counts to both the millimeter flux densities and the nuclear line fluences decreases with decreasing flare heliocentric angle. All of these flares were produced in the same active region. We interpreted this result in terms of a loop model in which the gyrosynchrotron emission is produced in the coronal portion of the loop where the electrons are kept isotropic by pitch angle scattering due to plasma turbulence, while the bremsstrahlung is produced by precipitating electrons that interact anisotropically. We found that the <b>trapping</b> <b>time</b> in the coronal portion is time dependent, reaching a minimum of about 10 s {{at the peak of the}} CPD count rate.
