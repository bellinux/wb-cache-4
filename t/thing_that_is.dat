5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E
5|$|The sixth book, Darke (published in America in June 2011 and England in October 2011), sees Septimus and {{his friends}} battling the Darke which has engulfed the Castle and {{everything}} and everyone in it. The only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> standing in between is Merrin Meredith and his gang of Things and his Darke Dragon. Alther Mella has been Banished (together with Tertius Fume) and Septimus wants to release him from the Darke Halls thinking he could help in undoing the Darke. When Marcia Overstrand, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard undoes the Darke spell {{with the help of}} the Paired Codes, all is well. Beetle becomes Chief Hermetic Scribe; Simon is reunited with his family after leaving his past behind and Princess Jenna is happy that the Palace and Castle are back to normal.|$|E

5|$|Mother Gothel {{appears in}} Tangled (2010). For {{hundreds}} of years, Gothel, a vain old woman, hoards the rejuvenation powers of a magical flower {{in order to}} remain young and beautiful, while selfishly keeping the flower's whereabouts a secret {{from the rest of the}} kingdom. However, when the pregnant Queen of Corona falls fatally ill, the flower is desperately retrieved and fed to her, healing her and in turn inadvertently stripping Gothel of her access to what is essentially the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> keeping her alive. Meanwhile, the King and Queen's newborn daughter Rapunzel is gifted with the flower's abilities, which manifest via her long, golden hair when a special song is sung so long as it remains uncut. Desperate to stay alive, Gothel steals the baby from the palace and she imprisoned her in a secluded tower for eighteen years, raising the child as her own and prohibiting her from leaving solely in order to use her hair to stay young.|$|E

25|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{different}} about the Basilica of Our Lady of Piat was its entrance arch. It {{was at the}} back of the church and one has to go around from the entrance to see the church façade. The arch has the phrase, Basilica Minore Nuestra Señora de Piat (Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Piat). Our Lady of Piat Basilica sports a simple facade flanked with a tall belfry. It is on top of a hill in the midst of Cagayan River with the intention of avoiding floods brought about by the seasonal overflowing of the river. The church structure is mainly made of red bricks, which is common among churches in Cagayan Valley. It is a contrast to old churches made of limestone and coral stone in many parts of the Philippines.|$|E

500|$|Avicenna anticipates {{that one}} could reject the {{argument}} {{by saying that the}} collection of contingent things may not be contingent. A whole does not automatically share the features of its parts; for example, in mathematics a set of numbers is not a number. Therefore, the objection goes, the step in the argument that assumes that the collection of contingent things is also contingent, is wrong. However, Avicenna dismisses this counter-argument as a capitulation, and not an objection at all. If the entire collection of contingent things is not contingent, then it must be necessary. This also leads to the conclusion that there is a necessary existent, the very thing Avicenna is trying to prove. Avicenna remarks, [...] "in a certain way, this is the very <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> sought".|$|E

[...] In response to claims that a strong opposition was needed to exercise a check on his certain-to-be-re-elected government, he restated his view of government as [...] "the administration of business" [...] by saying [...] "an opposition is a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> no more needed in the public business of this Province...than in the management of the affairs of any of our large corporations."

Her auditions for both Bollywood and Hollywood productions, including {{for the role of}} Bond girl Camille Montes in Marc Forster's Quantum of Solace (2008), were largely unsuccessful. Pinto later claimed {{that it was a good}} learning experience, stating that she was [...] "glad things happened the way they happened.

500|$|During December 2008, {{while still}} in the process of drafting, Loeb said that he had been riveted by the Bernard Madoff {{headlines}} and showed interest in referencing him in the film, noting: [...] "the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> so crazy about this story is that Ponzi schemes seem to be the simplest low-class scam," [...] and [...] "but this was carried out in the highest echelon of high finance.

[...] Stone clarified that Madoff will not be mentioned in the film, commenting that he considered Madoff's actions to be [...] "a crook running a Ponzi scheme" [...] which is [...] "legal robbery." [...] The filmmaker returned to the project in April on the strength of this script, feeling Loeb's draft was [...] "so great" [...] that he did not feel the need to touch it, although he did have the option.|$|E
500|$|Signs {{of missing}} footage from the Sellers {{segments}} are evident at various points. Evelyn Tremble is not captured on camera; an outtake of Sellers entering a racing car was substituted. In this outtake, {{he calls for}} the car, à la Pink Panther, to chase down Vesper and her kidnappers; the next <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> shown is Tremble being tortured. Out-takes of Sellers were also used for Tremble's dream sequence (pretending {{to play the piano}} on Ursula Andress' torso), in the finale - blowing out the candles whilst in highland dress - {{and at the end of}} the film when all the various [...] "James Bond doubles" [...] are together. In the kidnap sequence, Tremble's death is also very abruptly inserted; it consists of pre-existing footage of Tremble being rescued by Vesper, followed by a later-filmed shot of her abruptly deciding to shoot him, followed by a freeze-frame over some of the previous footage of her surrounded by bodies (noticeably a zoom-in on the previous shot).|$|E
500|$|Danielle {{was killed}} off minutes after {{revealing}} her true identity to Ronnie, dying in her mother's arms. Although different outcomes to the storyline were considered, Santer explained that Danielle dying best preserved Ronnie's status as EastEnders [...] "tragic heroine character". Treadwell-Collins felt that to allow Ronnie {{to have her}} daughter, the [...] "one <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> key to her character" [...] would serve to progressively weaken her character, and Santer agreed that while it may initially be touching, ultimately the relationship would become boring. The scene in which Danielle dies was filmed during winter, but as it was set in early April, snow had to be cleared away from the set before filming could commence. A body double {{was used for the}} moment Danielle was run over. Although sad to leave, Crace felt that the story's conclusion was the right one, and was glad that Ronnie and Danielle finally shared a brief moment in the end, explaining: [...] "It was so important that that tender moment was finally found, because that's all people wanted. It's all Danielle wanted, and it's all Ronnie wants." [...] Crace concluded: [...] "I think Danielle will leave quite a big mark on the Square and on the people in the Square – probably a bigger mark than she did when she was alive.|$|E
