5|$|Ports use Makefile to {{automatically}} fetch the desired application's source code, either {{from a local}} or remote repository, unpack it on the system, apply patches to it and compile it. Depending {{on the size of}} the source code, compiling can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> but it gives the user more control over the process and its result. Most ports also have package counterparts (i.e. pre-compiled binaries), giving the user a choice. Although this method is faster, the user has fewer customisation options.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to reach the Solar System, once there {{they would be able}} to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> and is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The SSEM had a 32-bit {{word length}} and {{a memory of}} 32words (1 kilobit). As it was {{designed}} to be the simplest possible stored-program computer, the only arithmetic operations implemented in hardware were subtraction and negation; other arithmetic operations were implemented in software. The first of three programs written for the machine found the highest proper divisor of 218 (262,144), a calculation that was known would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to run—and so prove the computer's reliability—by testing every integer from 218−1 downwards, as division was implemented by repeated subtraction of the divisor. The program consisted of 17instructions and ran for 52minutes before reaching the correct answer of 131,072, after the SSEM had performed 3.5million operations (for an effective CPU speed of 1.1 kIPS).|$|E
5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E

5|$|Albatross chicks <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to fledge. In {{the case}} of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E

25|$|The {{initial cost}} of CFLs and LEDs {{are higher than}} that of {{incandescent}} light bulbs. Typically this extra cost is repaid in the long-term, as both use less energy and have longer operating lives than incandescent bulbs.

Chronic wounds <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to heal and patients can suffer from chronic wounds for many years. Chronic wound healing may be compromised by coexisting underlying conditions, such as venous valve backflow, peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled edema and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|Irenaeus' {{emphasis}} on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding {{emphasis on}} the unity of salvation history.

25|$|These techniques, {{although}} they <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> involve very little operator intervention {{and thus are}} very cheap. Small tumblers (one pound capacity) are available and inexpensive for home/hobbyist use. At {{the other end of}} the scale, professionals can use very large barrels to do a lot of work at once. The main disadvantage of tumbling is its limited scope - stones will be smooth and have semi-random shapes (like pebbles from the beach), and metals need to be relatively simple shapes, with no fine work.|$|E
25|$|Another {{disadvantage}} {{is due to}} {{the complexity}} of plasma processes. Because of the complexity {{it is not easy to}} achieve a good control over the chemical composition of the surface after modification. The influence of process parameters on the chemical composition of the resultant polymer means it can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to determine the optimal conditions. The complexity of the process also makes it impossible to theorize what the resultant polymer will look like, unlike conventional polymers which can be easily determined based on the monomer.|$|E
