5|$|These {{three were}} among those {{commissioned}} to paint the walls of <b>the</b> <b>Sistine</b> Chapel, the work commencing with Perugino's employment in 1479.

5|$|In January 2007, it was {{claimed that}} as many as 10,000 {{visitors}} passed through the Vatican Museums in a day and that the ceiling of <b>the</b> <b>Sistine</b> Chapel is the biggest attraction. The Vatican, anxious at the possibility that the newly restored frescoes will suffer damage, announced plans to reduce visiting hours and raise the price in an attempt to discourage visitors.|$|E

5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{where there}} was an {{increasing}} interest in {{the remains of the}} city's pagan past, where scholars turned from reading Medieval Church Latin to Classical Latin and the philosophies of the Classical world were studied along with the writings of St Augustine, the presence, in <b>the</b> <b>Sistine</b> Chapel of five pagan prophets is not surprising.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceiling is}} that of <b>the</b> <b>Sistine</b> Chapel, the large papal chapel built within the Vatican between 1477 and 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV, for whom the chapel is named. It was painted at the {{commission}} of Pope Julius II. The chapel is the location for papal conclaves and many other important services.|$|E
5|$|The chapel has {{a number}} of stained glass windows. One depicts a design taken from The Light of the World, a {{painting}} by the Pre-Raphaelite artist William Holman Hunt, and is situated {{to the left of the}} east aisle. A second window dedicated to one Fannie Nuttall is located next to the right aisle, depicting <b>the</b> <b>Sistine</b> Madonna by Raphael.|$|E
25|$|Erasmus {{published}} an edition corrected to agree {{better with the}} Greek and Hebrew in 1516. Other corrected editions were published by Xanthus Pagninus in 1518, Cardinal Cajetan, Augustinus Steuchius in 1529, Abbot Isidorus Clarius (Venice, 1542), and others. In 1528, Robertus Stephanus published {{the first of a}} series of critical editions, which formed the basis of <b>the</b> later <b>Sistine</b> and Clementine editions. The critical edition of John Hentenius of Louvain followed in 1547.|$|R
50|$|Ghirlandaio {{was well}} known when he {{received}} the commission for this fresco, and soon after its completion, he was called to Rome to help decorate <b>the</b> walls <b>Sistine</b> Chapel. It is likely that Leonardo da Vinci was familiar with this treatment of the subject, {{as well as that}} of Castagno, and painted his own Last Supper in a more dramatic form to contrast with the stillness of these works, so that more emotion would be displayed.|$|R
5000|$|The track [...] "Midnight City" [...] {{has been}} singled out for praise. Paste named it the second-best song of the year. PopMatters named the track the best song of 2011, with Ryan Reed writing: [...] "On this transcendent {{standout}} ... Anthony Gonzalez and co-synth-scientist Justin Meldal-Johnsen build layer upon layer of keys, arena-sized drums, and vocal atmospherics (not mentioning one of the tastiest sax solos this side of a Springsteen record).

5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit. Henry Fuseli long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (in {{imitation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Sistine</b> Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell {{the idea for the}} gallery. James Northcote claimed that his Death of Wat Tyler and Murder of the Princes in the Tower had motivated Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E
5|$|Arcadelt {{remained}} in Rome {{as a singer}} and composer at <b>the</b> <b>Sistine</b> Chapel until 1551, except for one leave of absence to visit France in 1547. During this period, probably in early 1542, he made the acquaintance of Michelangelo, but his madrigalian settings {{of two of the}} artist's sonnets were received with indifference; indeed, from Michelangelo's letters on the topic, he probably considered himself unmusical and incapable of appreciating Arcadelt's work. Michelangelo paid Arcadelt with a piece of satin suitable for making into a doublet.|$|E
5|$|As {{dictated}} by the prescriptions Ubi periculum and Ne Romani, the conclave should have begun on 4 August, ten days {{after the death of}} Innocent VIII; however, the conclave was delayed to await the slow arrival of the aged Gherardo, bearing a letter from Venice's Council of Ten urging his acceptance into the College. The cardinals had decided as early as their first meeting on 24 July to use <b>the</b> <b>Sistine</b> Chapel for the balloting and assembly of the conclave.|$|E
50|$|Michelangelo excelled as a painter, architect, and poet. In addition, he {{has been}} called the {{greatest}} sculptor in history. Michelangelo was a master of portraying the human figure. For example, his famous statue of the Israelite leader Moses (1516) gives an overwhelming impression of physical and spiritual power. These qualities also appear in the frescoes of Biblical and classical subjects that Michelangelo painted on the ceiling of <b>the</b> Vatican's <b>Sistine</b> Chapel. <b>The</b> frescoes, painted from 1508 to 1512, rank among the greatest works of Renaissance art.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> last <b>Sistine</b> castrato {{to survive}} was Alessandro Moreschi, the only castrato {{to have made}} solo recordings. While an {{interesting}} historical record, these discs of his give us only {{a glimpse of the}} castrato voice – although he had been renowned as [...] "The Angel of Rome" [...] {{at the beginning of his}} career, some would say he was past his prime when the recordings were made in 1902 and 1904 and he never attempted to sing opera. He retired officially in March 1913, and died in 1922.|$|R
50|$|The {{ensemble}} of <b>the</b> Pontifical <b>Sistine</b> Chapel Choir upon {{the death of}} Perosi was in poor condition. The situation was restored, however, thanks to the commitment of Bartolucci and personal interest of Pope John XXIII. In the forty years of Bartolucci's leadership, the choir balanced the obligation of papal liturgies with tours in various countries throughout the world, including Austria, France, Belgium, the Philippines, Australia, the United States, Turkey, Poland and Japan. In {{the years of the}} Second Vatican Council Bartolucci, against abandoning Latin, committed himself that the liturgical reform should not take a direction hostile to sacred music.|$|R
5|$|In 1979 Colalucci {{undertook}} {{a series of}} experiments to discover the right approach {{for the restoration of}} the frescoes of <b>the</b> <b>Sistine</b> Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, Conflict over the Body of Moses by Matteo de Lecce, which had similar physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued on {{a small portion of the}} Eleazar and Matthan lunette.|$|E
5|$|Pietrangeli, in his {{foreword}} to <b>The</b> <b>Sistine</b> Chapel, written {{after the}} restoration of the lunettes, but prior to {{the restoration of}} the ceiling, commends those who had the courage to commence the restoration process, and thanks not only those who visited the restoration while it was in progress and gave the benefit of their knowledge and experience, but also those who were critical of the enterprise. Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested, both in the present and the future.|$|E
5|$|Prior to restoration, {{of all the}} {{paintings}} in <b>the</b> <b>Sistine</b> Chapel, the lunettes and spandrels were the dirtiest. Added to this, {{there has always been}} a problem of poor daytime visibility of the panels nearest the windows because of halination. Consequently, they were the least well known of all Michelangelo's publicly accessible works. The recent restoration has made these masterly studies of human nature and inventive depiction of the human form known once more.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} {{built in the}} Baroque {{architecture}} style. Its frescos and paintings on the altar are beautiful and well renowned showing Jesus sitting with his Apostles and clearly portraying the artistic touch of Br. Antonio Moscheni, who also painted the St. Aloysius Chapel in Mangalore in <b>the</b> style of <b>Sistine</b> Chapel in Vatican City.|$|R
5000|$|The Tallis Scholars singers tour widely, {{performing}} some 70 concerts a year, in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. In April 1994, {{they sang}} Allegri's Miserere mei, Deus in <b>the</b> newly restored <b>Sistine</b> Chapel in Vatican, and performed in February 1994 in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome to commemorate Palestrina's 400th anniversary.|$|R
50|$|People’s faces present {{reflective}} or ecstatic attitudes. The {{figures in}} the latter condition have their eyes open wider and their pupils surrounded by white; their mouths agape, their faces are caricatures, animalistic and grotesque. We {{are faced with the}} digestive tract, something disowned by academic norms. Goya shows us the ugly, the terrible; there is no beauty in art, only “pathos” and a certain intention to display all aspects of human life, including those aspects that make us feel uncomfortable. Bozal, not in vain, has called it <b>the</b> secular <b>Sistine</b> Chapel where salvation and beauty have been substituted by lucidity and an awareness of solitude, old age and death.|$|R
