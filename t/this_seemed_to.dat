5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when they {{discovered}} {{that the number of}} trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and <b>this</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> indicate that the enemy was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E
5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because <b>this</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} episode, both St-Pierre and Koscheck had Johnson {{at the top}} of their lists when it came time to select fighters. During the team {{selection}} process however, St-Pierre created a fake list which did not have Johnson among his top selections, and subtly showed it to Koscheck to fool him into believing it. <b>This</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> manipulate Koscheck into picking Marc Stevens, as he may have believed he could take Johnson later. This allowed St-Pierre to choose Johnson with the second overall pick.|$|E

5|$|With {{the arrival}} of English {{soldiers}} by ship, and naval battles on the seas, areas used for salt water fishing became perilous, and lay dormant {{for much of the}} war. In addition, many of the fishing vessels were converted into warships. Before the war, there was often talk about the excess of lobsters and cod off the shores of New England. <b>This</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> change during and after the war, due to the vast numbers of ships and artillery entering the ocean waters. Once lobster harvesting and cod fishing was reestablished, most fishermen found that the lobster and cod had migrated away from the shores.|$|E
5|$|In April 1992, South Africa toured West Indies for {{the first}} time, and played their first Test match for 22 years. Ambrose played in all three ODIs, {{all of which were}} won by West Indies. The Test match was the first time West Indies bowled under a new playing {{regulation}} which permitted only one bouncer per over; <b>this</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> affect the home bowlers, but Ambrose took two for 47 from 36 overs. South Africa began {{the final day of the}} match requiring 79 runs to win with just two batsmen out, but Ambrose and Courtney Walsh took the last eight wickets for 26 runs to bowl West Indies to a 52-run win. On a difficult pitch for batting, the ball bounced unevenly, and both bowlers concentrated on accuracy. Ambrose took six for 34 in the second innings, and was named joint man of the match; in just over 60 overs, he took eight for 81 in the match.|$|E
5|$|In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee {{approved}} {{the construction of}} a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December, M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents. The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride had to be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for <b>this</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be nickel, and Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.|$|E

5|$|Late in 1991, Paul E. Dangerously {{formed the}} faction The Dangerous Alliance. Eaton {{joined the group}} when he {{assisted}} Rick Rude, whom Dangerously had (kayfabe) brought into WCW, in defeating Sting for the United States Championship. In joining the group, Eaton became allies with Rude, Larry Zbyszko, and his two former rivals for the World Television Championship in Arn Anderson and Steve Austin. Shortly after the group was formed, Anderson and Eaton became its tag team specialists. <b>This</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> make sense, as both men had been successful tag team wrestlers in their careers; Anderson himself had been a two-time world champion teaming with Tully Blanchard in the Four Horsemen and had also won the belts with Zbyszko earlier in the year. Eaton and Anderson quickly won the WCW World Tag Team Championship by defeating Ricky Steamboat and Dustin Rhodes, the team to whom Anderson and Zbyszko lost the belts, for the championship and {{held on to the}} belts for five months before they lost them to the Steiner Brothers.|$|E
5|$|The widespread—mainly German—revolutions of 1848–49 sought {{unification}} of Germany {{under a single}} constitution. The revolutionaries pressured various state governments, particularly those in the Rhineland, for a parliamentary assembly that would {{have the responsibility to}} draft a constitution. Ultimately, many of the left-wing revolutionaries hoped this constitution would establish universal male suffrage, a permanent national parliament, and a unified Germany, possibly under the leadership of the Prussian king. <b>This</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be the most logical course since Prussia was the strongest of the German states, as well as the largest in geographic size. Generally, center-right revolutionaries sought some kind of expanded suffrage within their states and potentially, a form of loose unification. Their pressure resulted in a variety of elections, based on different voting qualifications, such as the Prussian three-class franchise, which granted to some electoral groups—chiefly the wealthier, landed ones—greater representative power.|$|E
5|$|Udell {{recorded}} that in {{the late}} afternoon of August 27, 1858, the Rose–Baley Party reached the Black Mountains. They made their crossing at Sitgreaves Pass, elevation 3,652 feet and named after Lieutenant Lorenzo Sitgreaves, who led an expedition party to the region in 1851. From the crest they could see the Colorado River in the distance. Having traveled all night and worked continuously during the morning and afternoon, the Rose–Baley Party stopped to prepare their first meal of the day. Soon afterward, a small group of Mohave warriors approached and asked, in a combination of broken English and Spanish, how many people their wagon train included and whether they intended to permanently settle near the Colorado River. The Mohave, who appeared friendly and had brought with them corn and melons, which they sold to the emigrants, were promised that the wagon train planned to travel through the region en route to their intended destination in Southern California. <b>This</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> appease the Natives, many of whom helped the party during their descent down the western slope of the Black Mountains to the Colorado River below. The emigrants were now entering Mohave country, near present-day Needles, California.|$|E

5|$|Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky {{was educated}} {{for a career}} as a civil servant. There was scant {{opportunity}} for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; <b>this</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.|$|E

In 1833 the Whigs passed the Church Temporalities Act.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} relationship between attribution scores and competitive motivation, or competitive anxiety. Subjects were 44 athletes in track and field, composed of 25 males and 19 females. Questionnaires were administered over a period of one year to subjects as soon as they had competed.
