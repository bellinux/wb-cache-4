5|$|The seven {{chapters}} of the book cover the origins {{and implementation of the}} school, and other topics in childrearing. Summerhill, founded in the 1920s, is run as a children's democracy under Neill's educational philosophy of self-regulation, where kids choose whether to go to lessons and how <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> freely without imposing on others. The school makes its rules at a weekly schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote alike. Neill discarded other pedagogies for one of the innate goodness of the child.|$|E

According to OLF, Ethiopian colonialism has been led by Abyssinian Emperors {{which has been}} chiefly the Amhara ruling class until it {{was replaced by a}} Tigrayan-led government in the early 1990s. OLF {{is one of the many}} Oromo political organizations in Ethiopia that are committed to the Oromo people who are endowed with the right to decide the type of sovereignty <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> under and the type of political union they want to form with other peoples.|$|E

25|$|Some {{persons have}} a {{disorder}} of consciousness (DOC). This state is defined to include persons with coma, {{as well as}} persons in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). New BCI research seeks to help persons with DOC in different ways. A key initial goal is to identify patients {{who are able to}} perform basic cognitive tasks, which would of course lead to a change in their diagnosis. That is, some persons who are diagnosed with DOC may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them). Some persons who are diagnosed with DOC die as a result of end-of-life decisions, which may be made by family members who sincerely feel this is in the patient's best interests. Given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision, there {{would seem to be a}} strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that DOC patients are given an opportunity to decide whether <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{calculate}} the total benefits a retiree is eligible for, the average indexed monthly salary (AIME) is then {{divided into three}} separate salary brackets—each multiplied by a different benefit percentage. The benefits receivable (the so-called Primary Insurance Amount, PIA) are {{the sum of the}} salary in each bracket times the benefit percentages that apply to each bracket. The benefit percentages are set by Congress and so can easily change in the future. The bendpoints, where the brackets change, are adjusted for inflation each year by Social Security. For example, in 2013 the first bracket runs from $1 to $791/month and is multiplied by the benefit percentage of 90%, the second salary bracket extends from $791 to $4,781/month is multiplied by 32%, the third salary bracket of more than $4,781/month is multiplied by 15%. Any higher incomes than the ceiling income are not FICA covered and are not considered in the benefits calculation or in determining the average indexed monthly salary, AIME. At full retirement age the projected retirement income amount (PIA) is the sum of these three brackets of income multiplied by the appropriate benefit percentages—90%, 32% and 15%. Unlike income tax brackets, the Social Security benefits are heavily biased towards lower salaried workers. Social Security has always been primarily a retirement, disability and spousal insurance policy for low wage workers and a very poor retirement plan for higher salaried workers who hopefully have a supplemental retirement plan unless <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on significantly less after retirement than they used to earn.|$|E

On-screen, neither family approved of Scott and Charlene's plan to move in together, but when Scott learned his father was only 18 when he got married, Scott found the solution to their problem and asked Charlene to marry him. Minogue said Charlene was shocked at first, but she became [...] "very excited" [...] {{about the idea of}} getting married. She continued, [...] "She knows <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> together and they have had so much trouble getting their parents' approval that I suppose getting married seems the logical thing to do.

Minogue and Donovan both agreed that they would not get married so young, and Donovan thought that younger couples should live together first. He also believed that Scott was rushing into things. Scott and Charlene were married during [...] "Episode 523", which was first broadcast on 1 July 1987 to two million Australian viewers.

The agreement gave to minority groups in both countries several rights, such as the right to use national surnames, speak their native languages, and attend schools and churches of their choice.

Of course that doesn't do unless children are HEALTHY: I quite allow THAT. Well, the doctor tells me no children are healthy unless they've got a good colour in their cheeks. And only just look at my darlings! Why, their cheeks bloom like peonies! Well, now, they tell me that, to keep children in health, you should never give them more than six hours altogether at lessons in the day, and at least two half-holidays in the week. And that's EXACTLY our plan I can assure you! We never go beyond six hours, and every Wednesday and Saturday, as ever is, not one syllable of lessons do they do after their one o'clock dinner! So how you can imagine I'm running any risk in the education of my precious pets is more than I can understand, I promise you!" ...|$|E
