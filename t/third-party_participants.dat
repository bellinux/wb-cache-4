50|$|Since 1981, the U.S. patent {{system has}} {{incorporated}} “reexamination” proceedings, during which third parties can submit information challenging {{the validity of}} a patent. In order to discourage abuse of these proceedings, <b>third-party</b> <b>participants</b> may not later assert that a patent is invalid “on any ground that they raised or could have raised during the inter partes reexamination proceedings.” Some observers believe that this estoppel dissuades potential requesters from use of reexamination, forcing them into federal court. H.R. 2795 would have deleted the phrase “or could have raised” from the statute, so that reexamination requesters would be limited only with respect to arguments that they actually made before the USPTO.|$|E

40|$|Decisions to {{cooperate}} are often delegated {{to a third}} party. We examined whether cooperation differs when decisions are made for a third party compared with ourselves and specified which motives are important for <b>third-party</b> cooperation. <b>Participants</b> played multiple rounds of a public goods game (PGG). In Study 1, we varied personal involvement from high to low; participants played for themselves (Self), for themselves and a third party (Shared), and solely for a third party (Third Party). Participants contributed most when personal involvement was lowest (i. e., Third Party) and least when personal involvement was high (i. e., Self). Study 2 explored if social motives underlie third-party cooperation by comparing cooperation with social (human) and non-social (computer) group members. Reducing personal involvement in the PGG (i. e., Third Party) increased cooperation in social contexts compared with non-social contexts, indicating enhanced collective interest. Increased cooperation for a third party may result from taking the other's perspective, thereby increasing social norm preferences...|$|R
2500|$|The Sustainable Materials Management Electronic Challenge {{was created}} by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). [...] Participants of the Challenge are {{manufacturers}} of electronics and electronic retailers. These companies collect end-of-life (EOL) electronics at various locations and send them to a certified, <b>third-party</b> recycler. Program <b>participants</b> are then able publicly promote and report 100% responsible recycling for their companies. The Electronics TakeBack Coalition is a campaign aimed at protecting human health and limiting environmental effects where electronics are being produced, used, and discarded. The ETBC aims to place responsibility for disposal of technology products on electronic manufacturers and brand owners, primarily through community promotions and legal enforcement initiatives. It provides recommendations for consumer recycling and a list of recyclers judged environmentally responsible.|$|R
40|$|In urban sensing applications, {{participants}} carry mobile {{devices that}} collect sensor readings annotated with spatiotemporal information. However, such annotations put the participants' privacy at stake, {{as they can}} reveal their whereabouts and habits to the urban sensing campaign administrators. A solution to protect the participants' privacy is to apply the concept of k-anonymity. In this approach, the reported participants' locations are modified such that at least k- 1 other participants appear to share the same location, and hence become indistinguishable from each other. In existing implementations of k-anonymity, the participants need to reveal their precise locations to either a third party or other participants {{in order to find}} k- 1 other participants. As a result, the participants' location privacy may still be endangered in case of ill-intentioned <b>third-party</b> administrators and/or <b>participants.</b> We tackle this challenge by proposing a novel approach that supports the participants in their search for other participants without disclosing their exact locations to any other parties. To evaluate our approach, we conduct a threat analysis and study its feasibility by means of extensive simulations using a real-world dataset...|$|R
40|$|Costly {{third-party}} interventions {{have been}} regarded as hallmarks of moral behaviour, because {{they are unlikely to}} be motivated by self-interest. This research investigated the cognitive and emotional processes underlying two types of costly third-party interventions by manipulating incidental emotions and attention focus. In Study 1, we investigated the effect of incidental anger on third-party punishment decisions. Study 2 addressed the effect of incidental anger on third-party compensation decisions. In both studies, participants were induced to either an angry or neutral emotion and then had to wait or were distracted before engaging in third-party interventions. In Study 1, angry participants punished highly unequal distributions significantly more than those in the neutral emotion condition. In Study 2, angry participants compensated highly unfair distributions significantly less than those in a neutral emotion. In both studies, the effect of incidental anger was only significant in the wait, not the distraction condition. Study 3 again focused on <b>third-party</b> compensation decisions. <b>Participants</b> were induced to either a self-focused anger or an other-focused anger emotion, and attention focus (wait, distraction) was manipulated experimentally. Those in the other-focused anger condition compensated significantly more than participants in the self-focused anger condition. These results indicate that (self-focused) incidental anger led to antagonistic responses. Incidental anger was only associated with higher third-party compensation when it includes a focus on a suffering other. For incidental emotions to bias subsequent decisions requires attentional resources...|$|R
40|$|Compassion, the {{emotional}} response {{of caring for}} another who is suffering and that results in motivation to relieve suffering, {{is thought to be}} an emotional antecedent to altruistic behavior. However, it remains unclear whether compassion enhances altruistic behavior in a uniform way or is specific to sub-types of behavior such as altruistic helping of a victim or altruistic punishment of a transgressor. We investigated the relationship between compassion and subtypes of altruistic behavior using <b>third-party</b> paradigms where <b>participants</b> (1) witnessed an unfair economic exchange between a transgressor and a victim, and (2) had the opportunity to either spend personal funds to either economically (a) help the victim or (b) punish the transgressor. In Study 1, we examined whether individual differences in self-reported empathic concern ({{the emotional}} component of compassion) was associated with greater altruistic helping or punishment behavior in two independent samples. For participants who witnessed an unfair transaction, trait empathic concern was associated with greater helping of a victim and had no relationship to punishment. However, in those who decided to punish the transgressor, participants who reported greater empathic concern decided to punish less. In Study 2, we directly enhanced compassion using short-term online compassion meditation training to examine whether altruistic helping and punishment were increased after two weeks of training. Compared to an active reappraisal training control group, the compassion training group gave more to help the victim and did not differ in punishment of the transgressor. Together, these two studies suggest that compassion is related to greater altruistic helping of victims and is not associated with or may mitigate altruistic punishment of transgressors...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Low {{back pain}} (LBP) is prevalent, costly and a {{significant}} contributor to societal burden. It {{is not a single}} specific condition, but instead generally considered to be comprised of smaller more homogenous subgroups of patient presentations that meaningfully differ with regard to their symptomology, prognosis and responsiveness to different interventions. The identification of subgroups of patients with LBP is a research priority and several classification mechanisms have been proposed. Traditionally, such classification approaches have been predominantly based upon expert opinion and biologic plausibility, with little concordance among them. More recently, there has been a greater focus upon empirically derived subgrouping methods, notably including the development of clinical prediction rules (CPRs). A CPR is a clinical tool designed to be used with an individual patient, and is based on the statistical identification of a parsimonious composite of variables that facilitate the prediction of a given diagnosis or outcome. The main objective of this thesis is to facilitate the development of CPRs with the greatest potential to positively influence the physiotherapy management of LBP. This was achieved through a series of five published studies and a published Clinical Commentary that together sought to address three primary research aims: 1. Identify and assess the degree to which CPRs for LBP may be confidently applied in clinical practice using a hierarchical framework for CPR development and an appraisal and synthesis of the existing evidence base.; 2. Explore the range of factors that may influence the implementation of CPRs for LBP within Australian physiotherapy practice.; 3. Examine the areas of perceived need for LBP CPRs and the range of characteristics such tools need to encompass to be considered clinically meaningful and useful within Australian physiotherapy practice. Three systematic reviews were conducted which sought to synthesise the available body of evidence to: (1) identify CPRs relevant to the assessment and management of LBP.; (2) assess the degree to which such tools may be confidently applied in clinical practice.; (3) identify opportunities to improve the methodological quality and reporting of LBP CPR development studies. The evidence considered within these reviews identified {{that a large number of}} diagnostic, prognostic and prescriptive LBP CPRs are under development, however the majority of these tools have not undergone validation and therefore cannot be recommended for direct use in clinical practice at this time. The current lack of impact analysis studies also prevents the assessment of whether the application of LBP CPRs in clinical practice results in beneficial effects on patient outcomes or resource efficiencies. A small number of LBP CPRs have undergone validation, such that clinicians may have some confidence in the predictive accuracy of these tools when applied in similar patient populations and settings. Further, several opportunities to improve the methodological rigour of future CPR development studies have been identified. Two qualitative studies using focus groups and involving a sample of Australian physiotherapists who manage patients with LBP were undertaken concurrently to address research aims 2 and 3. The findings of the first of these studies highlighted that physiotherapists’ knowledge of LBP CPRs may be quite varied and few participants in that study reported having ever used them to inform their clinical decision-making. Barriers to the use of LBP CPRs included a negative connotation associated with the term ‘rule’, a perception that CPRs are overly-complex and infrequently applicable, clinical experience obviating the need for such tools, and the potential threat to clinical autonomy and for misuse by <b>third-party</b> payers. Physiotherapy <b>participants</b> felt that LBP CPRs were best used within the suite of clinical reasoning processes physiotherapists typically employ and considered as second opinions or safety nets that were able to be overruled by the clinician. The findings of the second qualitative study indicated that prognostic forms of CPRs for LBP that function to predict future meaningful outcomes may be welcomed by practising physiotherapists. CPRs that identify likely responders to interventions are likely to be considered useful, as well as diagnostic forms of CPRs that function to identify serious causes of LBP such as fracture and cancer. CPRs that identify which patients are more likely to experience an adverse outcome or to not require physiotherapy intervention may also be welcomed by clinicians. Participants thought that LBP CPRs should be uncomplicated, easy to remember, easy to apply, accurate and precise, and well-supported by research evidence. It was believed that LBP CPRs should not contain an excessive number of variables, use complicated statistics, or contain variables that have no clear logical relationship to the dependent outcome. It was further considered by participants that LBP CPRs need to be compatible with traditional clinical reasoning and decision-making processes, and sufficiently inclusive of a broad range of management approaches and common clinical assessment techniques. A published Clinical Commentary was produced as a resource for clinicians and researchers based on findings arising from this research indicating the potential importance of the predictive precision of CPRs. The Clinical Commentary highlights the importance of considering uncertainty in clinical prediction, and provides a technical guide to the calculation and approximation of posterior probability uncertainty intervals. This and other study findings presented in this thesis have direct immediate implications for clinicians contemplating the application of LBP CPRs in clinical practice, and for researchers involved in the development of these tools. Opportunities for further research in this area have also been identified and are presented in the final chapter of this thesis. It is anticipated that consideration of the study findings in this program of research may support the development of CPRs with the greatest capacity to benefit the physiotherapy management of patients with LBP, and also strategies and future research projects designed to facilitate the successful translation of CPR research evidence into clinical practice...|$|R
