5|$|At {{the time}} Zara Yaqob assumed the throne, the Ethiopian church had been divided {{over the issue}} of Biblical Sabbath {{observance}} for roughly a century. One group, loyal to the Coptic bishops, believed that the day of rest should be observed only on Sunday, or Great Sabbath; another group, <b>the</b> <b>followers</b> of Ewostatewos, believed with their founder that both the original seventh-day Sabbath (i.e., Saturday, or Lesser Sabbath) and Sunday should be observed.|$|E
50|$|The {{count is}} the same as for the non-shadow two-step. <b>The</b> <b>follower</b> uses <b>the</b> same {{footwork}} as the lead in this case, beginning on the left foot.

50|$|Trail {{following}} is a complex behavioural pattern which usually involves the active participation of both slugs. <b>The</b> <b>follower</b> keeps {{very close to the}} leader once they are in proximity. In species with pronounced trail following, such as Deroceras panormitanum, the leader flattens its tail laterally and waves it from side to side in front of <b>the</b> <b>follower.</b> It is not yet known whether tail waving is a visual cue or whether it wafts chemical attractants in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>follower.</b> Sometimes, <b>the</b> tail is waved between <b>the</b> <b>follower’s</b> tentacles and occasionally makes contact, contributing to recognition between the slugs. The leading slug seemingly pauses to wait for <b>the</b> <b>follower,</b> tail waving, if <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> falls too far behind.|$|R

25|$|If, {{after the}} leader had {{selected}} its equilibrium quantity, <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> deviated from <b>the</b> equilibrium and chose some non-optimal quantity {{it would not}} only hurt itself, {{but it could also}} hurt the leader.

In this case, <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> could announce to the leader before the game starts that unless the leader chooses a Cournot equilibrium quantity, <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> will choose a deviant quantity that will hit the leader's profits.

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims at {{determining}} the optimal locations for the leader’s new facilities under {{the condition that}} the number of <b>the</b> <b>follower’s</b> new facilities is unknown for the leader. The leader and <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> have some facilities in advance. The first competitor, the leader, opens p new facilities in order to increase her own market share. On the other hand, she knows that her competitor, <b>the</b> <b>follower,</b> will react to her action and locate his new facilities as well. The number of <b>the</b> <b>follower’s</b> new facilities is unknown for the leader but it is assumed that the leader knows the probability of opening different numbers of <b>the</b> <b>follower’s</b> new facilities. <b>The</b> leader aims at maximizing her own market share after <b>the</b> <b>follower’s</b> new facilities entry. <b>The</b> <b>follower’s</b> objective is also to maximize his own market share. Since the number of <b>the</b> <b>follower’s</b> new facilities is unknown for leader, “Robust Optimization” is used for maximizing the leader’s market share and making the obtained results “robust” in various scenarios in terms of different numbers of <b>the</b> <b>follower’s</b> new facilities. <b>The</b> optimal locations for new facilities of both the leader and <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> are chosen among pre-determined potential locations. It is assumed that the demand is inelastic. The customers probabilistically meet their demands from all different facilities and the demand level which is met by each facility is computed by Huff rule. The computational experiments have been applied to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model...|$|R
5|$|The {{extent of}} Arsacid patronism of Zoroastrianism is debated in modern scholarship. <b>The</b> <b>followers</b> of Zoroaster {{would have found}} the bloody sacrifices of some Parthian-era Iranian cults to be unacceptable. However, there is {{evidence}} that Vologeses I encouraged the presence of Zoroastrian magi priests at court and sponsored the compilation of sacred Zoroastrian texts which later formed the Avesta. The Sassanid court would later adopt Zoroastrianism as the official state religion of the empire.|$|E

5|$|While these {{specific}} failings {{came back to}} haunt the Empire in subsequent decades, perhaps the greatest weakness of the Peace of Augsburg was its failure {{to take into account}} the growing diversity of religious expression emerging in the evangelical (Lutheran) and Reformed traditions. Other confessions had acquired popular, if not legal, legitimacy in the intervening decades and by 1555, the reforms proposed by Luther were no longer the only possibilities of religious expression: Anabaptists, such as the Frisian Menno Simons (1492–1559) and his followers; <b>the</b> <b>followers</b> of John Calvin, who were particularly strong in the southwest and the northwest; and <b>the</b> <b>followers</b> of Huldrych Zwingli were excluded from considerations and protections under the Peace of Augsburg.

5|$|Many {{animals can}} learn {{behaviours}} by imitation, but ants {{may be the}} only group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed.

30|$|This {{happens because}} he {{exploits}} {{the information on}} <b>the</b> <b>follower’s</b> target.

5|$|With unity as an {{essential}} teaching of the religion, Bahá'ís follow an administration they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as efforts that are contrary to the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{investment decisions}} in an uncertain and competitive framework, with a first investor, the leader, always producing up to full capacity {{and a second}} investor, <b>the</b> <b>follower,</b> capable of adjusting output levels within the constraint of installed capacity.

Compared to a situation where <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> always produces up to full capacity, the leader has a larger incentive to accommodate a flexible follower. This is because the leader also benefits from <b>the</b> <b>follower's</b> volume flexibility. Due to the first mover advantage, the leader's value is higher than <b>the</b> <b>follower's</b> value, despite <b>the</b> <b>follower's</b> technological advantage in flexibility...|$|R

5|$|For a {{brief period}} {{following}} {{the decline of the}} Vijayanagara Empire, the devotional movement seemed to lose momentum, only to become active again in the 17th century, producing an estimated 300 poets in this genre; famous among them are Vijaya Dasa (1682–1755), Gopala Dasa (1721–1769), Jagannatha Dasa (1728–1809), Mahipathi Dasa (1750), Helavanakatte Giriamma and others. Over time, their devotional songs inspired a form of religious and didactic performing art of the Vaishnava people called the Harikatha ("Stories of Hari"). Similar developments were seen among <b>the</b> <b>followers</b> of the Veerashaiva faith, who popularised the Shivakatha ("Stories of Shiva").|$|E
5|$|In Vagrant Story, the Iocus priesthood of {{the kingdom}} of Valendia is shown to use the Kildean rood as a symbol, {{although}} they follow the teachings of a saint named Iocus instead of the original Kildean teachings of the Kiltia religion of Leá Monde.

Then, to solve efficiently this class of problems by using evolutionary algorithm, novel evolutionary operators are designed by considering the best individuals and the diversity of individuals in the populations. Finally, based on these techniques, a new evolutionary algorithm is proposed. The numerical results on 20 test problems illustrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and stable...|$|R

The birth of Swaminarayan coincided with the Hindu festival of Rama Navami, celebrating the birth of Rama.

2500|$|This is the leader's best {{response}} to the reaction of <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> in equilibrium. <b>The</b> <b>follower's</b> actual can now be found by feeding this into its reaction function calculated earlier: ...|$|R
2500|$|The leader {{wants to}} choose [...] to {{maximise}} its payoff [...] However, in equilibrium, it knows <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> will choose [...] as above. So {{in fact the}} leader wants to maximise its payoff [...] (by substituting [...] for <b>the</b> <b>follower's</b> best response function). By differentiation, the maximum payoff is given by [...] Feeding this into <b>the</b> <b>follower's</b> best response function yields [...] Suppose marginal costs were equal for the firms (so the leader has no market advantage other than first move) and in particular [...] The leader would produce 2000 and <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> would produce 1000. This would give the leader a profit (payoff) of two million and <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> a profit of one million. Simply by moving first, the leader has accrued twice the profit of <b>the</b> <b>follower.</b> However, Cournot profits here are 1.78 million apiece (strictly, [...] apiece), so the leader has not gained much, but <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> has lost. However, this is example-specific. There may be cases where a Stackelberg leader has huge gains beyond Cournot profit that approach monopoly profits (for example, if the leader also had a large cost structure advantage, perhaps due to a better production function). There may also be cases where <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> actually enjoys higher profits than the leader, but only because it, say, has much lower costs.

50|$|Bilevel {{optimization}} {{was first}} {{realized in the}} field of game theory by a German economist Heinrich Freiherr von Stackelberg who published Market Structure and Equilibrium (Marktform und Gleichgewicht) in 1934 that described this hierarchical problem. The strategic game described in his book {{came to be known as}} Stackelberg game that consists of a leader and a <b>follower.</b> <b>The</b> leader is commonly referred as a Stackelberg leader and <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> is commonly referred as a Stackelberg follower. In a Stackelberg game, the players of the game compete with each other, such that the leader makes the first move, and then <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> reacts optimally to the leader's action. This kind of a hierarchical game is asymmetric in nature, where the leader and <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> can not be interchanged. The leader knows ex ante that <b>the</b> <b>follower</b> observes its actions before responding in an optimal manner. Therefore, if the leader wants to optimize its objective, then it needs to anticipate the optimal response of <b>the</b> <b>follower.</b> In this setting, the leader's optimization problem contains a nested optimization task that corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>follower's</b> optimization problem. In the Stackelberg games, the upper level optimization problem is commonly referred as the leader's problem and the lower level optimization problem is commonly referred as <b>the</b> <b>follower's</b> problem.|$|R
