5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular {{contact with the outside world}} and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E

The Chilean congress responded by allocating money for its own dreadnoughts, which were ordered from the United Kingdom despite a strong push from the American government for the contracts, probably due to Chile's traditionally strong ties with the British.|$|E

The novel draws on the oppressive history of Paraguay from the rule of Dr. Jose Gaspar de Francia in the early 19th century until the Chaco War in the 1930s. Its multiple narrative perspectives and historical and political themes anticipate his most famous work, Yo, el Supremo, written more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>later.</b> Roa Bastos adapted Hijo de hombre into an award-winning film in the same year as its publication.|$|E
5|$|The cannon's {{history in}} the Malacca Straits {{began in the early}} 1600s, when Dutch East India Company {{officers}} gave it to the Sultan of Johor in return for trading concessions. Less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>later</b> Johor was destroyed, the sultan captured and the Seri Rambai taken to Aceh. Near {{the end of the eighteenth}} century the cannon was sent to Selangor and mounted next to one of the town's hilltop forts. In 1871 pirates seized a Penang junk, murdered its passengers and crew, and took the stolen vessel to Selangor. The British colonial government responded by burning the town, destroying its forts and confiscating the Seri Rambai.|$|E
5|$|Muirchertach Ua Briain was one {{of three}} sons of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland (died 1086), a man who secured control of the Kingdom of Munster in the 1060s before gaining the high-kingship of Ireland less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>later.</b> In 1175, in an act of overlordship over the Kingdom of Dublin, Toirdelbach Ua Briain {{appointed}} Muirchertach Ua Briain King of Dublin, following a precedent set by Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072), a previous claimant to the Irish high-kingship who had done the same to his own eldest son, Murchad (died 1070), in 1052. When Toirdelbach Ua Briain finally died in 1086, his sons bitterly contested the kingship of Munster before Muirchertach Ua Briain succeeded in securing it for himself. By 1091, the latter appears to have regained control of the Dublin, only to lose it to Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles (died 1095), who united it with the Kingdom of the Isles. Gofraid's reign in Ireland was short-lived, as Muirchertach Ua Briain forced him from Dublin in 1094. After the Gofraid's death the following year, Muirchertach Ua Briain appointed his own nephew, Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115), as King of the Isles. Uí Briain influence in the Isles was similarly short-lived, however, as Domnall mac Taidc was apparently forced from the region, and Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway seized control of not only the Isles, but perhaps even Dublin itself, before falling in battle in 1103. Later in 1111, Domnall mac Taidc temporarily seized the kingship of the Isles in an act that may have been opposed by his aforesaid uncle. The reasons for Domnall mac Taidc's exit from the Isles are uncertain. Although he may have been forcibly ejected by the Islesmen, he may well have returned to Ireland to take advantage of Muirchertach Ua Briain's rapidly failing health.|$|E
