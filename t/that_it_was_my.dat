5|$|Their daughter, Scottie, wrote {{after their}} deaths: I think (short of {{documentary}} {{evidence to the}} contrary) that if people are not crazy, they get themselves out of crazy situations, so I {{have never been able}} to buy the notion <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> father's drinking which led her to the sanitarium. Nor do I think she led him to the drinking.|$|E
500|$|By the 21st century, Seacole {{was much}} more prominent. Several {{buildings}} and entities, mainly connected with health care, were named after her. In 2005, Boris Johnson (former Mayor of London, then editor of The Spectator) wrote of learning about Seacole from his daughter's school pageant and speculated: [...] "I find myself facing the grim possibility <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> own education that was blinkered." [...] In 2007 Seacole was introduced into the National Curriculum, and her life story is taught at many primary schools in the UK alongside that of Florence Nightingale.|$|E
500|$|After Troutman's death, Ice Cube {{said that}} [...] "More Bounce To The Ounce" [...] {{introduced}} him to hip-hop. [...] "I was in the sixth grade, we'd stayed after school. We had this dude named Mr. Lock, {{and he used to}} bring in his radio with these pop-lockers. He used to teach [...] the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after-school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop-locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] yet. It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down. I just think that was a rush of adrenaline for me, like a chemical reaction in my brain." ...|$|E

500|$|Speer {{managed to}} reach a {{relatively}} safe area near Hamburg as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time. Speer stated at Nuremberg, [...] "I felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> duty not to run away like a coward, but {{to stand up to}} him again." [...] Speer visited the Führerbunker on April22. Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of Inside the Third Reich, Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny argued, [...] "Psychologically, it is possible {{that this is the way}} he remembered the occasion, because it was how he would have liked to behave, and the way he would have liked Hitler to react. But the fact is that none of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself." [...] Sereny notes that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.|$|E
500|$|Maximilien Aue is {{a former}} officer of the SD, {{security}} and intelligence service of the SS; the book is written {{in the form of}} his memoirs. His mother was French (from Alsace), while his father, who left his mother and disappeared from their life in 1921, was German. Aue's mother remarried a Frenchman, Aristide Moreau, which Maximilien highly disapproved of. After a childhood in Germany and an adolescence in France, where he attends Sciences-Po, he later returns to Germany to study at the University of Berlin and the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. It is also during this period when he joins the SS, eventually rising to the rank of Obersturmbannführer. Aue is a cultured, highly educated, classical music-loving intellectual. He speaks many languages fluently – German, French, Ancient Greek and Latin – and holds a doctorate in law. Despite his French heritage and upbringing, he is, like his father, an ardent German nationalist. Even after the war, he is unrepentant of the crimes he committed in the name of National Socialism, [...] "believing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> duty and {{that it had to be}} done, disagreeable or unpleasant as it may have been." [...] He is extremely attracted to his twin sister Una, which led to an incestuous relationship with her when they were children, but ended when they entered puberty. Refusing to truly love any woman other than Una, he becomes a homosexual but continues to fantasize about having sex with Una.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} Kossowski began to pray, [...] " [...] … because when I was so deep in this {{calamity}} and nearly dead I promised myself that if I {{came out of}} this subhuman land I would tender my thanks to God. I hesitate to call it a vow, it was rather a promise to myself but later I used to think <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> obligation …" ...|$|E

2500|$|Eisner {{negotiated}} {{an agreement}} with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright The Spirit, but, [...] "Written down in the contract I had with 'Busy' Arnold— and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership— Arnold agreed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to 'Busy' Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership". This would include the eventual backup features [...] "Mr. Mystic" [...] and [...] "Lady Luck".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the eight}} years Getman spent at Taishetlag (Siberia) and Svitlag (Kolyma), he started to develop his plan to record {{the horrors of the}} camp {{conditions}} in the form of paintings. While he could not paint openly in the camps, he took careful note of all that transpired. Even when he started to paint after his release in 1953, he still had to do so in secret as he would otherwise have been convicted once again, perhaps even sentenced to death. In his own words: [...] "I undertook the task because I was convinced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> duty to leave behind a testimony to the fate of the millions of prisoners who died" ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Majerus's 1998 book [...] is an {{adaptation}} of Kettlewell's The Evolution of Melanism, which discussed criticisms of Kettlewell's original experimental methods. When the biologist Jerry Coyne reviewed this book in Nature, he stated that the most serious problem was that only two peppered moths had been found on tree trunks. He also wrote that the white moths had increased in numbers before the lichen had returned and that Kettlewell's findings of moths choosing matching backgrounds had not been replicated in later experiments. Coyne compared his reaction to [...] "the dismay attending my discovery, {{at the age of}} 6, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> father and not Santa who brought the presents on Christmas Eve". He concluded that [...] "for the time being we must discard Biston as a well-understood example of natural selection in action, although it is clearly a case of evolution. There are many studies more appropriate for use in the classroom" [...] and that further studies of the animal's habits were needed.|$|E
