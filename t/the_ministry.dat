5|$|A small {{ministry}} of defence (which was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Ministry</b> of Defence and Security in 2007) was established in 2002 to provide civilian oversight of the F-FDTL. A lack of suitable staff for <b>the</b> <b>ministry</b> and the close political relationship between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor's defence policy up to at least 2004. The failure to institute effective civilian oversight of the F-FDTL also limited {{the extent to which}} foreign countries are willing to provide assistance to the F-FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis. As at early 2010 <b>the</b> <b>Ministry</b> of Defence and Security was organised into elements responsible for defence (including the F-FDTL) and security (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state. At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited the extent to which <b>the</b> <b>ministry</b> could provide civilian oversight to the security sector. Moreover, elements of the F-FDTL were continuing to resist civilian control over the security forces at this time, and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny.|$|E

5|$|After Colonel Brigg's {{death in}} 1900, the castle {{passed into the}} hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and from there to the National Coal Board.

The castle was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen. In 1950, due to local pressure and the threat of demolition, the castle and chapel were taken into the care of <b>the</b> <b>Ministry</b> of Works. Due to the advanced decay of the 19th-century alterations, <b>the</b> <b>ministry</b> removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining medieval masonry. <b>The</b> <b>ministry</b> also appointed a full-time custodian and replaced the missing lead roof with roofing felt to make the site waterproof.|$|E
