50|$|The {{annual survey}} Economic Freedom of the World is an {{indicator}} of economic freedom produced by James Gwartney and Robert Lawson, and is published by the Canadian Fraser Institute. The index uses a definition of economic freedom similar to laissez-faire capitalism {{and it has been}} more widely used than any measure of economic freedom. Its use stems in part from the longer time period covered (data exists from 1980-2008), and the fact that this index is constructed from <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>information</b> (in contrast to the index created by the Heritage Foundation). According to the index, the cornerstones of economic freedom are personal choice, voluntary exchange, freedom to compete, and security of privately owned property.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{will address}} a problem {{concerning}} availability of information systems at an enterprise within the financial sector and its external suppliers, so called trusted <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> The <b>information</b> system resides on the internal network of the enterprise and must be available to both employees of the enterprise and the trusted <b>third</b> <b>party</b> simultaneously. This contradicts the company policy which disallows <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> access to the internal network. The HAVECA-model introduced in this thesis provides a framework of methods, each solving a sub problem identified in the model. The identified methods are hardening, verification, control and assurance, together supplying a method for continuously securing the internal network against a trusted <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> The HAVECA-model will be applied to a scenario, providing real-world examples of techniques of allowing the trusted <b>third</b> <b>party</b> to a restricted number of servers on the network.

50|$|The Information Technology Act, 2000 (“IT Act”) {{contains}} {{specific provisions}} dealing with liabilities of Internet Service Providers. These provisions provide for ‘safe harbors’ for Internet Service Providers. Section 2(w) of the IT Act defines an ‘intermediary’ as ‘intermediary {{with respect to}} any particular electronic message means any person who on behalf of another person receives, stores or transmits that message or provides any service with respect to that message’. Due to this wide definition, almost every entity, including ISPs, search engines and online service providers can get benefit of the safe harbor provisions in the IT Act.Section 79 of the IT Act provides that an intermediary shall not be liable for any <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>information,</b> data, or communication link made available or hosted by the intermediary. But, an intermediary will get benefit of the safe harbor provisions only if it satisfies certain conditions. The intermediaries function {{should be limited to}} providing access to a communication system, the intermediary should not initiate the transmission, select the receiver or modify the transmission and should observe the guidelines formulated by the Central Government in this regard.The ‘IT (Intermediary guidelines) Rules 2011’ have been formulated to specify the conditions that an intermediary must satisfy to get protection of safe harbor provisions. As per these guidelines, the intermediary must observe due diligence measures specified under Rule 3 of the guidelines. For instance, the intermediary should take down any infringing material on its network within thirty six hours of the infringement being brought to its notice.|$|E

40|$|Most {{economic}} interactions {{happen in}} a context of sequential exchange in which innocent <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> suffer <b>information</b> asymmetry with respect to previous "originative" contracts. The law reduces transaction costs by protecting these <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> but preserves some element of consent by property rightholders to avoid damaging property enforcement—e. g., it is they, as principals, who authorize agents in originative contracts. Judicial verifiability of these originative contracts is obtained either as an automatic byproduct of transactions or, when these would have remained private, by requiring them to be made public. Protecting <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> produces a legal commodity which is easy to trade impersonally, improving the allocation and specialization of resources. Historical delay in generalizing this legal commoditization paradigm is attributed to path dependency—the law first developed for personal trade—and an unbalance in vested interests, as luddite legal professionals face weak public bureaucracies.

40|$|In many {{real world}} negotiations, from wage {{contract}} bargaining to product liability disputes, the bargaining parties often interact repeatedly {{and have the}} option of seeking outside judgement. This paper studies a model of repeated bargaining with a third party to analyze how and why bargaining postures endogenously evolve over time. A privately informed long-lived player bargains with a sequence of short-lived players, one at a time. Should the players fail to reach an agreement, an unbiased yet imperfect third party is called upon to make a judgement. The uninformed short-lived players learn through two channels: observed behavior of the informed player (" information) and, if any, verdicts of the third party (" information). The long-lived player wants to guard his private information by bargaining tough but at the expense of more information disclosure from the third party. As a result of the strategic use of these two sources of information, the players' bargaining postures change as the uninformed players' beliefs evolve. Interestingly, as <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>information</b> becomes more precise, the players adopt tough bargaining postures for a wider range of beliefs. Many repeated bargaining problems can be analyzed in this framework. In particular, the equilibrium dynamics provide an explanation for the puzzling contrast between the bargaining postures of Merck and Pfizer in their recent high-profile product liability litigations. The results also help us understand several other phenomena documented in the related literature. bargaining posture, repeated bargaining, <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>information,</b> reputation...|$|E
