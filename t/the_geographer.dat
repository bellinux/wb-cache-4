5|$|After Crawford graduated, Professor A. J. Herbertson {{offered him}} {{a job as a}} junior {{demonstrator}} in the university's geography department. Crawford agreed, and served in the teaching position over the ensuing year. Through Herbertson, Crawford was introduced to <b>the</b> <b>geographer</b> Patrick Geddes. Crawford then decided to focus his attentions on archaeology rather than geography even though few professional positions in the field existed in Britain at the time. Looking elsewhere for archaeological employment, he unsuccessfully applied for a Craven Fellowship and for a post at Bombay Museum.|$|E

50|$|After {{passage of}} the act, on May 27, 1785, Hutchins was {{appropriated}} funds and made arrangements. He arrived in Pittsburgh on September 3, and {{wrote a letter to}} the President of Congress noting that the requirement of the act for equal square townships could not be strictly met on a nearly spherical planet. Hutchins began the survey of <b>the</b> <b>Geographer’s</b> Line on September 30. On October 8, word was received of an Indian attack on the Tuscarawas River. He and his men were scared, and returned to Pittsburgh after only a few miles of <b>the</b> <b>Geographers</b> Line had been completed. Hutchins returned to New York that autumn. On May 9, 1786, Congress instructed him to continue his survey only south of <b>the</b> <b>Geographers</b> line, because <b>the</b> position of the 41st line of latitude, the northern boundary of the Congress Lands, north of which is the Connecticut Western Reserve, was unsettled.|$|R
5|$|Aston {{was born}} on 1 July 1946 into a working-class family in Oldbury, Worcestershire, to cabinet-maker Harold Aston and his wife Gladys. He {{developed}} an early interest in archaeology, although teachers at Oldbury Grammar School attempted to dissuade him from pursuing it. His father gave him two books on archaeology as a Christmas present, and he subsequently spent much time visiting archaeological sites, sometimes playing truant to do so. The first of his family to attend university, Aston studied geography at the University of Birmingham, albeit with a subsidiary in archaeology, graduating in 1967. He taught himself more about archaeology by enrolling in various excavations, and was influenced by such figures as his thesis supervisor Harry Thorpe, as well as <b>the</b> <b>geographer</b> Trevor Rowley and archaeologists Philip Rahtz and Philip Barker. His dissertation was {{on the development of}} settlement in the West Penwith peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In {{the realm}} of cartography, there were further {{advances}} beyond the map-makers of the Han dynasty. When the Tang chancellor Pei Ju (547–627) {{was working for the}} Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a graduated scale in the tradition of Pei Xiu (224–271). The Tang chancellor Xu Jingzong (592–672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658. In the year 785 the Emperor Dezong had <b>the</b> <b>geographer</b> and cartographer Jia Dan (730–805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia. Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1m (30ft) in length and 10m (33ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred li (Chinese unit of measuring distance). A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li. However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are star charts. Despite this, the earliest extant terrain maps of China come from the ancient State of Qin; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Several medieval authors {{wrote about}} Ahmad ibn Tulun. The two major sources are two biographies by two 10th-century authors, Ibn al-Daya and al-Balawi. Both are called Sirat Ahmad ibn Tulun, and al-Balawi's work relies {{to a large}} extent on Ibn al-Daya's, {{although}} it is much more extensive. Ibn al-Daya also wrote a book (Kitab al-mukafa'a) with anecdotes from the Tulunid-era Egyptian society. Further information comes from Ibn Tulun's contemporary, <b>the</b> <b>geographer</b> and traveler Ya'qubi, whose works cover the first years of his rule in Egypt, and from later Egyptian authors, especially the 15th-century historians Ibn Duqmaq and al-Maqrizi, who drew on a variety of earlier sources to write {{on the history of the}} Tulunid state. Several other medieval Arabic chroniclers from the 13th to the 16th centuries mention Ibn Tulun or his officials, but most are of a later date and not very reliable, especially in comparison to Ibn Duqmaq and al-Maqrizi.|$|E

In 1786, with protection of troops from Fort Steuben, Hutchins resumed the survey. In September 1786, Hutchins placed a stone cadastral survey marker at the west edge of the seventh range on <b>the</b> <b>Geographer’s</b> Line, a spot later {{to be known as the}} Seven Ranges Terminus. After the first surveyed seven ranges had been completed some years later, the survey tract was known as the Seven Ranges, or Old Seven Ranges.|$|R

50|$|The {{sections}} of each survey township are numbered {{according to the}} plan of the Land Ordinance of 1785. The Ranges are numbered starting from Ellicott’s Line working westward.

Thus, townships next to one another {{do not have the}} same number due to the irregularity of the Ohio River’s course, with the townships adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>Geographer‘s</b> Line numbered 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 in ranges 1 to 7. This deficiency was corrected outside of Ohio by numbering from a baseline.|$|R

Furthermore, there was also a fire-temple which the 10th-century Arab historian al-Masudi reportedly visited.|$|R
