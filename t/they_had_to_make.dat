5|$|The Supreme Council met at 10:30. Suzuki, who {{had just}} come from {{a meeting with the}} Emperor, said it was {{impossible}} to continue the war. Tōgō Shigenori said that they could accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, but they needed a guarantee of the Emperor's position. Navy Minister Yonai said that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some diplomatic proposal—they could no longer afford to wait for better circumstances.|$|E

The remaining six were loaned out for an episode of Mork & Mindy and badly damaged; Fletcher spent three months salvaging what remained. Additions to established clothing included an officer's vest for Kruge, and jewelry.|$|E

5|$|The employees, however, did {{not like}} living so close to their employers. They complained about the {{distance}} to the city and the transportation problems, and they criticised the rental rates and the reserves <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> After the deaths of Matthes and van Marken, however, the park gradually evolved into a desirable residential area. In 1931 the villa, Rust Roest, which had long been empty, was converted into a school. It was demolished in 1981. Since 1989, the park has been listed as Cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Postclassic, {{the greater}} Q'umarkaj area is {{estimated}} {{to have had a}} population of around 15,000. The inhabitants of Q'umarkaj were divided socially between the nobility and their vassals. The nobles were known as the ajaw, while the vassals were known as the al k'ajol. The nobility were the patrilineal descendents of the founding warlords who appear to have entered as conquerors from the Gulf coast around AD 1200 and who eventually lost their original language and adopted that of their subjects. The nobles were regarded as sacred and bore royal imagery. Their vassals served as foot-soldiers and were subject to the laws laid out by the nobility, although they could receive military titles {{as a result of their}} battlefield prowess. The social divisions were deep seated and were equivalent to strictly observed castes. The merchants were a privileged class, although <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> tributary payments to the nobility. In addition to these classes, the population included rural labourers and artisans. Slaves were also held and included both sentenced criminals and prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{organised}} {{a meeting}} with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, {{with the help of}} Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. The judge had examined the relevant documents, and had {{come to the conclusion that}} Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore felt certain that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing to budge. Smith said that he had always tried to be flexible and civil, but that he and his government felt <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, Smith said the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation.|$|E

5|$|The 30 contestants {{were divided}} into three teams of ten named Team 1, Team 2 and Team 3, and each group met in a {{different}} London location on 10 June, {{the day of the}} programme's launch. To record what each team did, Russian hired unpaid trainee cameramen. Once the teams were assembled, they were given their challenge: in a year, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> £1million. Their first task was to find accommodation for themselves for free for a week. The contestants slowly realised that, despite what their contracts had claimed, they would have to find their own food and accommodation, and would essentially be making their own prize money. Some contestants demanded to meet with Russian, who eventually revealed to them that no television channel had actually commissioned his show. Teams 1 and 3 disbanded within two days.|$|E
5|$|The Llanbadarn tithes {{were not}} easy to collect: both the {{fishermen}} and the farmers of north Cardiganshire strongly resented the payments <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> in goods, while the goods themselves (fish, corn, farm stock etc.) were {{not easy to}} collect {{and had to be}} sold for the money to pass to the Chichesters. It was easy for agents and collectors to line their own pockets, and {{to take advantage of the}} now-widowed Catherine by withholding their accounts. In 1727, she travelled to Cardiganshire by herself to claim her legal rights and stayed over winter. She then had to do so again in 1730: all her efforts were met with blank refusals and lies. During her long periods of forced residence she witnessed the beaching of ninety porpoises at Aberystwyth which were slaughtered by the local people. Her final journey to Wales in 1734 proved fatal, and she died in the county: a slate memorial to her is still to be seen above the vestry door in Llanbadarn church.|$|E

25|$|Álvaro I and his successor, Álvaro II, also faced {{problems}} with factional rivals from families {{that had been}} displaced from succession. In order to raise support against some enemies, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> concessions to others. One {{of the most important}} of these concessions was allowing Manuel, the Count of Soyo, to hold office for many years beginning some time before 1591. During this same period, Álvaro II made a similar concession to António da Silva, the Duke of Mbamba. António da Silva was strong enough that he decided the succession of the kingdom, selecting Bernardo II in 1614, but putting him aside in favor of Álvaro III in 1615. It was only with difficulty that Álvaro III was able to put his own choice in as Duke of Mbamba when António da Silva died in 1620 instead of having the province fall into the hands of the duke's son. At the same time, however, Álvaro III created another powerful and semi-independent nobleman in Manuel Jordão who held Nsundi for him.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Japanese, Okinawan, and Korean men {{traveled}} to Hawaii as cheap labor {{to work on}} the sugarcane plantations. Some continued on {{to work on the}} mainland. These men had originally planned to leave plantation work and go back home after a few years or a contract was up. Between the years of 1886 and 1924, 199,564 Japanese entered Hawaii and 113,362 returned to Japan. However, many men did not make enough money to go back home. Also, in 1907 the Gentlemen's Agreement prohibited immigration from Hawaii to the United States for laborers. Because now these men were put in situations with limited mobility, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Hawaii or the United States their home, and part of that was getting married. In Hawaii, the plantation owners also wanted to see the laborers get married. Though they had originally preferred single men, when the contract labor system was abolished, the owners thought that wives would make the men more likely to settle down and stay. Also, the plantation owners hoped that wives would limit the amount of gambling and opium smoking the workers did, and act as a morale booster for the men.|$|E
