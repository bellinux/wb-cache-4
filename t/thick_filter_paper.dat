The key issue in FPEM is whether and how long a wet filter paper can keep its saturation during the exposed minutes, which is primarily focused in the present study. In the experiment, an evaporating amount from a flat-water surface is also measured, which is requisite to compare as the reference of a perfect saturated surface with the filter paper surface.
