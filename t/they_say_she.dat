5|$|This Amazon {{is famous}} in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; {{some of the}} {{inhabitants}} dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in {{the centre of the}} floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go {{off the side of the}} wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.|$|E
500|$|Authorities have {{acknowledged}} {{that since the}} exact cause of Bella's death remains unknown, asserting that it was homicide to a jury could be [...] "difficult to prove." [...] Rachelle Bond alleged that McCarthy had punched the toddler in the stomach multiple times after claiming Bella was a [...] "demon", {{and that he was}} the sole perpetrator of the murder. Prosecutors of McCarthy allege that Bella was murdered in one of many abusive occasions after she had been uncooperative about going to bed. Citing that McCarthy had decided to [...] "calm the child down," [...] they say Rachelle had not entered the room alongside her boyfriend. When she did enter, <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> witnessed him near the girl's body, which was [...] "swollen and gray," [...] indicating she was deceased. Rachelle Bond's attorney claims McCarthy threatened to murder her client if she contacted authorities. She also maintained that Rachelle was not involved with hiding the victim's body, which had initially been placed in garbage bags and concealed in a refrigerator. Bond later admitted to this accusation as part of a future plea deal. A cadaver dog brought to the house later indicated that it smelled something on the refrigerator. Bond contradicted the belief that the body was placed on Deer Island; she stated that McCarthy had [...] placed the body in a weighted duffel bag and disposed of it in the water, suggesting it drifted to the location where it was found.|$|E
2500|$|Several other songs {{reference}} Joni Mitchell. The song [...] "Our House" [...] by Graham Nash {{refers to}} Nash's two-year affair with Mitchell {{at the time}} that Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young recorded the Déjà Vu album. Led Zeppelin's [...] "Going to California" [...] was said to be written about Robert Plant and Jimmy Page's infatuation with Mitchell, a claim that seems to be borne out by the fact that, in live performances, Plant often says [...] "Joni" [...] after the line [...] "To find a queen without a king, <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> plays guitar and cries and sings". Jimmy Page uses a double dropped D guitar tuning similar to the alternative tunings Mitchell uses. The Sonic Youth song [...] "Hey Joni" [...] is named for Mitchell. Alanis Morissette also mentions Mitchell in one of her songs, [...] "Your House". British folk singer Frank Turner mentions Mitchell in his song [...] "Sunshine State". The Prince song [...] "The Ballad of Dorothy Parker" [...] contains the lyric – [...] " [...] 'Oh, my favorite song' she said – and it was Joni singing 'Help me I think I'm falling' [...] ". [...] "Lavender" [...] by Marillion was partly influenced by [...] "going through parks listening to Joni Mitchell", according to vocalist and lyricist Fish, and she was later mentioned in the lyrics of their song [...] "Montreal" [...] from Sounds That Can't Be Made. John Mayer makes reference to Mitchell and her Blue album in his song [...] "Queen of California", from his 2012 album Born and Raised. The song contains the lyric [...] "Joni wrote Blue in a house by the sea".|$|E
