40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a novel <b>tenant</b> mix model for {{shopping}} malls based on an analogy from ecological theories. Design/methodology/approach: This study empirically investigates the <b>tenant</b> species-area relationship and <b>tenant</b> species-abundance distribution in shopping malls. In this study, the tests on species-area relationship and species-abundance distribution in shopping malls are derived from ecological theories. Empirical tests by a sample of 18 shopping malls for the species-area relationship and of five malls for the species-abundance distribution are carried out in Hong Kong Findings: It shows that, in line with the findings of biogeography, the <b>tenant</b> species-area relationship follows a power law of exponent of about 0. 20. Furthermore, the species-abundance distributions of the five large-scale malls are found to be closely in track with a geometric distribution as commonly found in ecology. These results imply that <b>tenant</b> mix strategies are governed by two principles: the number of <b>tenant</b> species is related to the mall size; and the shop area allocation follows a geometric distribution. Research limitations/implications: The study provides the first quantitative <b>tenant</b> mix model on the number of <b>tenant</b> species in a particular mall size, and on the <b>tenant</b> species abundance distribution pattern. These results provide far-reaching implications for research and practice, including a quantitative benchmarking of <b>tenant</b> mix strategy and an optimal design of shopping malls. Practical implications: The model is the first <b>tenant</b> mix model for practitioners to formulate quantitative <b>tenant</b> mix strategy, and evaluate the effects of <b>tenant</b> mix on the performance of a shopping mall. Originality/value: It is the first quantitative model for <b>tenant</b> mix, and would open up a novel agenda for research on <b>tenant</b> mix strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|During {{his time}} in Lough Mask before the {{controversy}} began, Boycott had become unpopular with the <b>tenants.</b> He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which {{may have contributed to}} his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained that he was on good terms with his <b>tenants,</b> they said that he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing gates to be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed these restrictions. He had also withdrawn privileges from the <b>tenants,</b> such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a wage increase.|$|E

5|$|In August 1992, Greyhound {{canceled}} its {{bus terminal}} license (BTL) agreements with other carriers at 200 terminals, and imposed {{the requirement that}} Greyhound be the sole-seller of the tenant's bus tickets within a 25-mile radius of such a Greyhound terminal. In 1995, The United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division brought suit to stop this practice, alleging {{that it was an}} illegal restraint of trade, bad for consumers, and reduced competition. In February 1996, the United States won its case, and Greyhound agreed to permit its <b>tenants</b> to sell tickets nearby and permit its <b>tenants</b> to honor interline tickets with competitors.|$|E
50|$|A {{tenancy at sufferance}} {{is created}} when a <b>tenant</b> wrongfully holds over past {{the end of the}} {{duration}} period of the tenancy (for example, a <b>tenant</b> who stays past the expiration of his or her lease). In this case, the landlord can hold over the <b>tenant</b> to a new tenancy, and collect rent for the period the <b>tenant</b> has held over.A tenancy at sufferance (sometimes called a holdover tenancy) may exist when a <b>tenant</b> remains in possession of property even {{after the end of the}} lease, until the landlord acts to eject the <b>tenant.</b> The occupant may legally be a trespasser at this point, and the possession of this type may not be a true estate in land, even if authorities recognize the condition to hold the <b>tenant</b> liable for rent. The landlord may be able to evict such <b>tenant</b> at any time, without notice. Action to evict will terminate a tenancy at sufferance, because the <b>tenant</b> no longer enjoys possession. Some jurisdictions impose an irrevocable election whereby the landlord treats the holdover as either a trespasser, or as a <b>tenant</b> at sufferance. A trespasser is not in possession; but a <b>tenant</b> at sufferance continues to enjoy possession of the real property.|$|R
50|$|Leasehold value - The {{interest}} {{held by a}} <b>tenant.</b> If the <b>tenant</b> pays market rent, {{then the}} leasehold has no market value. However, if the <b>tenant</b> pays less than the market, {{the difference between the}} present value of what is paid and the present value of market rents would be a positive leasehold value. For example, a major chain retailer may be able to negotiate a below-market lease to serve as the anchor <b>tenant</b> for a shopping center. This leasehold value may be transferable to another anchor <b>tenant,</b> and if so the retail <b>tenant</b> has a positive interest in the real estate.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{building}}, several large <b>tenants</b> leased space in the Chrysler Building. The Chrysler Corporation moved into the building in 1930 and used the tower as its division headquarters until the 1950s. The mapmaking company Texaco and the magazine magnate Henry Luce were also two of the original <b>tenants.</b> Texaco moved out in 1977 because it wanted a more suburban workplace in Purchase, New York, for its employees. Luce's company Time Inc. was headquartered in the building until 1937, when it moved to the Rockefeller Center due to the latter containing more office space.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} who needed additional funds for education or vied for political office found farming as a decent profession which, although humble, was not {{looked down upon}} by fellow gentrymen. Wealthy nobles, officials, and merchants could own land, but they often did not cultivate it themselves and merely acted as absentee landlords while living in the city. They mostly relied on poor tenant farmers (diannong 佃農) who paid rent {{in the form of}} roughly fifty percent of their produce in exchange for land, tools, draft animals, and a small house. Wage laborers (gunong 雇農) and slaves were also employed on the estates of the wealthy, although they were not as numerous as <b>tenants.</b> During Western Han, the small independent owner-cultivator represented the majority of farming peasants, yet their economic struggle to remain independent during times of war, natural disaster and crisis drove many into debt, banditry, slavery, and dramatically increased the number of landless <b>tenants</b> by late Eastern Han. The social status of poor independent owner-cultivators was above <b>tenants</b> and wage laborers, yet below that of wealthy landowners. While wealthy landowners employed <b>tenants</b> and wage laborers, landowners who managed small to medium-sized estates often acted as managers over their sons who tilled the fields and daughters who weaved clothes and engaged in sericulture to produce silk for the home or sale at market.|$|E

The incubator, which boasts more than a dozen business <b>tenants,</b> has recently completed construction on the Taft Technology Center, where some of its largest <b>tenants</b> will locate their offices.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>tenant</b> of {{a market}} garden, or other land, under the Evesham Custom {{has the right to}} sell their tenancy if the {{landlord}} gives their approval, including the right to nominate the new <b>tenant.</b> The payment (known as the [...] "ingoing") made by the incoming <b>tenant</b> includes compensation for any improvements the outgoing <b>tenant</b> has made, such as the planting of fruit trees. The payment also includes a premium for receiving a tenancy offering lifetime security. The entire transaction is made between the outgoing and incoming <b>tenant,</b> with the landlord not involved beyond giving their approval. Furthermore, if the landlord does not accept the new <b>tenant,</b> they are obliged to compensate the outgoing <b>tenant</b> to ensure they did not suffer any financial loss.|$|R
50|$|It is clear, however, {{that where}} the {{landlord}} {{has in fact}} mitigated their losses (for example by renting out the premises to another <b>tenant</b> following the first <b>tenant's</b> abandonment), courts have taken this into account in the calculation of damages.

5|$|Over {{the next}} few years the {{situation}} deteriorated further. Governor Tryon and the Boys exchanged threats, truce offers, and other writings, which were frequently written by Allen in florid and didactic language, while the Boys continued to drive surveyors and incoming <b>tenants</b> on New York-granted lands away. Most of these incidents did not involve bloodshed, although individuals were at times manhandled, and the Boys sometimes did extensive property damage when driving <b>tenants</b> out. By March 1774, the harsh treatment of settlers and their property by Allen and the Boys prompted Tryon to increase some of the rewards to £100.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{numerous}} structural modifications {{were made}} to suit the needs of <b>tenants</b> in the Twin Towers. Modifications were made {{in accordance with the}} Port Authority's Tenant Alteration Review Manual and were reviewed by the Port Authority to ensure the changes did not compromise structural integrity of the buildings. In many instances, openings were cut in the floors to accommodate new stairways to connect tenant floors. Some steel beams in the core were reinforced and strengthened to accommodate heavy live loads, such as large amounts of heavy files that <b>tenants</b> had on their floors.|$|E
5|$|The 'Land Question', as it {{pertains}} to the history of Prince Edward Island, Canada, related {{to the question of the}} system of ownership of land on the island. Proprietors, the owners of the land parcels on Prince Edward Island, favoured a system of renting to <b>tenants,</b> whilst the <b>tenants</b> preferred a system of freehold. In 1767 the British government divided all land in Prince Edward Island into lots to be owned by 'proprietors' who would collect rent from the settlers, or 'tenants'. Problems soon arose with this scheme, and low numbers of <b>tenants</b> resulted in proprietors collecting little rent, which in turn led to many proprietors defaulting on their quitrents. An attempt at compulsorily acquiring the land by the Prince Edward Island government from rent defaulters in 1781 resulted in Colonial Office intervention in 1783. In 1786, Governor Walter Patterson, who set in motion the compulsory acquisition, was removed from office.|$|E
