40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the integration process between the Gaia Methodology and AUML; this integration allows the developer {{to get a}} better insight into the multiagent system (MAS) that is being built. Gaia generates an abstract model based on roles that describe the system agents, their services and interactions. AUML uses that model as input and breaks it down into a series of diagrams that facilitates its implantation. More specifically, we describe how to integrate a design produced by Gaia with the AIP’s layers of AUML, taking into consideration some other useful techniques in the context of agent-oriented development. We <b>take</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> of study the development of an agent-based system for conference management. ...|$|E

We use the payment ladder design of contingent valuation, and <b>take</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study the value of coastal water quality improvements in Scotland. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Tobit analysis and a modified Turnbull algorithm are used to explore the data.

The paper concludes with some thoughts concerning possible links between value ranges, context-dependence and uncertainty. contingent valuation; preference uncertainty; payment ladders; contextdependence; coastal water quality; survival analysis...|$|E

We suggest that this problem is likely to generalise to other ways of trying to use intuitions or survey data about single-person cases, where those data or intuitions are not just treated as further direct moral intuitions about prioritarianism and telic egalitarianism...|$|E

Moreover, we show how Topic Model can be exploited to further enrich the query with hidden topics induced from the library meta-data. The experimental evaluations show that this system considerably outperforms a matching and ranking classification approach, where queries (and categories) were also enriched with similar information. ...|$|E

In this work we <b>take</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study the IMS Push over Cellular (PoC) service, an OMA standard, and propose a formal testing approach to check that its implementation respects the standard requirements. The approach considers a formal model of the service as well a set of formal invariants representing the most relevant properties expected from the implementation. The invariants are verified on the PoC formal specification and then automatically checked on the execution traces of the implementation. Experimental results are then processed to provide testing verdicts on the implementation under test. Besides, we discuss the results analysis that show false positives essentially raised by inter-working SIP services...|$|E

40|$|We {{explore a}} new low-threshold direct-detection concept for dark matter, {{based on the}} {{breaking}} of chemical bonds between atoms. This includes the dissociation of molecules {{and the creation of}} defects in a lattice. With thresholds of a few to 10 's of eV, such an experiment could probe the nuclear couplings of dark matter particles as light as a few MeV. We calculate the expected rates for dark matter to break apart diatomic molecules, which we <b>take</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study for more general systems. We briefly mention ideas for how chemical-bond breaking might be detected in practice. We also discuss the possibility of detecting solar neutrinos, including pp neutrinos, with this experimental concept. With an event rate of O(0. 1 /kg-year), large exposures are required, but measuring low-energy solar neutrinos would provide a crucial test of the solar model...|$|E
40|$|At the University of Hertfordshire [UH] in UK we have {{hosted a}} series of {{research}} projects into {{the changing nature of}} the arts as it has been progressively academicized and incorporated into the university community. We have observed that the dominant knowledge model of the academic community is the scientific one, valorising text-based reasoning, empirical research and determinacy. We have observed professional arts, on the other hand, valorising non-textual communication, conceptual research and indeterminacy. This struggle for legitimacy can be described in terms of vocational versus academic values, and the different capital and habitus of the actors. In our paper we describe the social space of the contemporary arts in the university. We <b>take</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study a recent report by an arts professor at UH on an artsscience collaboration which shows how this struggle was played out, and the values and capital mobilized by the various actors...|$|E
40|$|The {{human mind}} is a black box. We know what goes into the box and what goes out, {{but we do not}} know what happens inside. However, it is {{generally}} accepted that the manifestations of the mind, in particular language, may be used as a reasonable basis to extrapolate about the mind itself, the idea being to study something unobservable by means of something observable. In this article, we will try to learn more about the cognitive phenomenon of salience by analysing two types of language production which are expected to give access to it, namely corpus data and elicitation data. Using the highly polysemous verbs give and <b>take</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study, we will see that spontaneous production and elicited production may point in different directions, a discrepancy which requires explanation if language production is to be seen as a window to the mind...|$|E

40|$|Wave energy {{converters}} (WECs) require {{active control}} to maximise energy capture {{over a wide}} range of sea conditions, which is generally achieved by making the device resonate. The exaggerated device motion arising at resonance, however, may result in nonlinear effects that are ignored by the linear models that are typically employed. In particular, nonlinear viscous forces are significant for particular device types, such as hinged aps, which we <b>take</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study in this paper. The paper develops a general nonlinear WEC control methodology based on pseudospectral methods. The continuous time energy maximization problem is fully discretised (both state and control), and the optimal solution is obtained by solving the resulting finite dimensional optimization problem. By way of example, the nonlinear viscous damping for a hinged ap WEC is incorporate into the control model. It is shown that the ratio of energy captured to energy dissipated is significantly increased with the nonlinear controller, compared to the linear case...|$|E

40|$|Institutional {{repositories}} typically make {{it easier}} for users to type in new metadata than to look up a standard vocabulary. To provide browse functionality, repository administrators often create ad hoc systems of authority control. Integrating with external systems both highlights and compounds the problems with this approach. An external system harvesting from multiple repositories might deduplicate records, or filter results based on access rights: difficult when each repository has a different local standard. On {{the other end of the}} process, repositories sourcing records from external systems must carefully ‘map’ key fields and terms. Even then, local authority control is likely to suffer when confronted with inconsistent capitalisation of a standard subject vocabulary or wildly varying forms of author names.
