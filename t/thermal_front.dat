Generally, the fishing ground is determined visually by the human operator through direct observation on the monitor (called visualization approach). However, visualization approach is very subjective and labor-intensive. In this study, we focused in determining the upwelling and thermal-front. A new approach is proposed, by extracting the feature from satellite imagery data and using contour matching, can be determined whether the events of <b>thermal</b> <b>fronts</b> and upwelling have occurred.

40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>fronts</b> {{detected}} {{using multiple}} satellite sensors have been integrated to provide new {{information on the}} spatial and seasonal distribution of oceanic fronts in the North Atlantic. The branching of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) as it encounters the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is reflected in surface <b>thermal</b> <b>fronts,</b> which preferentially occur at the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ) and several smaller fracture zones. North of the CGFZ there are few <b>thermal</b> <b>fronts,</b> contrasting with the region to the south, where there are frequent surface <b>thermal</b> <b>fronts</b> that are persistent seasonally and interannually. The alignment of the fronts confirms that the shallower Reykjanes Ridge north of the CGFZ {{is more of a}} barrier to water movements than the ridge to the south. Comparison of front distributions with satellite altimetry data indicates that the MAR influence on deep ocean currents is also frequently exhibited in surface temperature. The improved spatial and temporal resolution of the front analysis has revealed consistent seasonality in the branching patterns. These results contribute {{to our understanding of the}} variability of the NAC, and the techniques for visualising oceanic fronts can be applied in other regions to reveal details of surface currents that cannot be resolved using satellite altimetry or in situ measurements...|$|R
40|$|Phase {{separation}} in {{a complex}} fluid with lamellar order has been studied {{in the case of}} cold <b>thermal</b> <b>fronts</b> propagating diffusively from external walls. The velocity hydrodynamic modes are taken into account by coupling the convection-diffusion equation for the order parameter to a generalised Navier-Stokes equation. The dynamical equations are simulated by implementing a hybrid method based on a lattice Boltzmann algorithm coupled to finite difference schemes. Simulations show that the ordering process occurs with morphologies depending on the speed of the <b>thermal</b> <b>fronts</b> or, equivalently, on the value of the thermal conductivity ξ. At large value of ξ, as in instantaneous quenching, the system is frozen in entangled configurations at high viscosity while consists of grains with well ordered lamellae at low viscosity.

Simulations were made using the M 4 S SAR imaging model. Two SAR {{images of the}} Brazilian Southeastern Coast depicting the BC's <b>thermal</b> <b>front</b> were selected including a VV (ASAR/Envisat) and a HH polarization (RADARSAT- 1) image. Conditions of current shear and divergence were reproduced for the fronts imaged, using in situ (Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers) current velocities. Wind velocity fields were simulated based on QuikSCAT data. Results showed that SAR imaging of the BC front may be influenced both by atmospheric instabilities and hydrodynamic modulations. The first mechanism prevailed on the RADARSAT image and the latter on the ASAR/Envisat image. When atmospheric instabilities prevailed, the contribution of shear and divergence was almost negligible. When hydrodynamic modulations prevailed, a better agreement between the simulated responses and SAR image responses was obtained by inforcing a reduction of 88 % in the relaxation rate, and higher divergence values, {{of the order of}} 10 - 4 s- 1.

40|$|Seasonal <b>thermal</b> <b>fronts</b> {{associated}} with wind-driven coastal downwelling/upwelling {{in the northern}} South China Sea are investigated using satellite measurements and three repeated fine-resolution mapping surveys in winter, spring, and summer. The results show that vigorous <b>thermal</b> <b>fronts</b> develop over the broad shelf with variable widths and intensities in different seasons, {{which tend to be}} approximately aligned with the 20 - 100 m isobaths. Driven by the prevailing winter/summer monsoon, the band-shaped fronts were observed with a magnitude exceeding 0. 1 degrees C/km in the subsurface, and accompanied by energetic coastal downwelling/upwelling due to shoreward/offshore Ekman transport. The downward/upward tilting of seasonal thermoclines across the shelf exceeds 20 m, significantly contributing to the development of <b>thermal</b> <b>fronts</b> over the shelf. In addition, the diagnostic analysis of Potential Vorticity (PV) suggests that the summer frontal activities induced by the coastal upwelling are more stable to convection and symmetric instabilities in comparison to the winter fronts {{associated with}} downwelling-favorable monsoon forcing. This is primarily due to their essential differences in the upper ocean stratification and horizontal buoyancy gradients arising from wind forcing. At the same time, the coastal currents are substantially regulated by the seasonal winds. An expected lag correlation between the velocity from mooring measurements and alongshore wind stress is detected near the frontal region. These results indicate that seasonal wind forcing {{plays an important role in}} the frontal activities and coastal water transport over the shelf...|$|R

Analysis of 13 years of satellite ocean colour data from SeaWiFS, and compared with MODIS-Aqua and MERIS, showed that there was no increase in Chla from 1998 to 2002, which then decreased in all areas from 2002 to 2007 and was most pronounced in the RR.

Large-scale physical gradients constrain seabird habitat. Birds however respond behaviourally to physical heterogeneity at much smaller scales. Here, we use, for the first time, three-dimensional GPS tracking of a seabird, the great frigatebird (Fregata minor), in the Mozambique Channel. These data, which provide {{at the same time}} high-resolution vertical and horizontal positions, allow us to relate the behaviour of frigatebirds to the physical environment at the (sub-) mesoscale (10 - 100 km, days-weeks). Behavioural patterns are classified based on the birds' vertical displacement (e. g. fast/slow ascents and descents), and are overlaid on maps of physical properties of the ocean-atmosphere interface, obtained by a nonlinear analysis of multi-satellite data. We find that frigatebirds modify their behaviours concurrently to transport and <b>thermal</b> <b>fronts.</b> Our results suggest that the birds' co-occurrence with these structures is a consequence of their search not only for food (preferentially searched over <b>thermal</b> <b>fronts)</b> but also for upward vertical wind.

Elucidation of the ecological significance of fronts generates a better understanding of marine ecosystem functioning, conferring opportunities to improve management of anthropogenic activities in the oceans. This study presents novel insights into the oceanographic drivers of habitat use in a population of marine turtles characterised by an oceanic-neritic foraging dichotomy.

We used a survey method, in which catch and fishing position data were collected by following pole and line fishing operations. This study also collected secondary data that consisted of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and chlorophyll-a derived from Aqua / MODIS. Fronts were determined by calculating SST gradient, SSTs preferences, chlorophyll-a, bathymetry and distance from coastline, whereas SST anomaly was calculated from the difference between monthly SST and mean SST.

Possible thermal, as well as chemical contamination of the resources present key questions that have to be appropiately answered before a reinjection project is actually implemented in the field. This paper focusses on the basic heat-transfer process that takes place when a relatively cold brine is injected back into the naturally fractured hot geothermal reservoir after steam has been separated at the surface. The mathematical description of this process considers that rock matrix blocks behaves as uniformly distributed heat sources, meanwhile heat transfer between matrix blocks and the fluid contained in the fractures takes place under pseudo-steady state conditions with the main temperature drop occurring in the rock-matrix blocks interphase. Analytical solutions describing the <b>thermal</b> <b>front</b> speed of propagation are presented. Discussion on the effect of several variables affecting the <b>thermal</b> <b>front</b> speed of propagation is included, stressing the importance that a proper “in-situ” determination of the effective heat transfer area at the rock-fluid interphase has on the whole process.
