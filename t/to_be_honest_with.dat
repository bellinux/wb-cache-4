5|$|Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl {{to take a}} tour of {{the park}} where Jerry was mugged. Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to grab it and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says that Jerry was too scared of his co-workers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't really care because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement.|$|E

25|$|The code {{of ethics}} that is {{affiliated}} with traditional marketing can also be applied to social media. However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers {{like to hear from}} advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are. The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message to people who are genuinely interested, many people game the system with auto-friend adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.|$|E

500|$|Many reviews {{also noted}} the game's high difficulty. Both Giancarlo Varanini of GameSpot and Craig Harris of IGN {{found that the}} game's bosses have very {{unpredictable}} attack patterns, thus making the battles extremely challenging. Harris additionally observed a heavy amount of trial-and-error for the levels themselves where the player must die several times before completing each one. He concluded, [...] " [...] It's really the way Mega Man games have always been... and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest,</b> <b>with</b> all of the annoying little deaths in the game, there's always that sensation after every failure that you've learned the challenge, and perseverance definitely prevails in this game".|$|E

500|$|Due to the high-pitch {{employed}} in the recording, Dickson reflected in later years that she [...] "never liked the original [...] for that reason. The song has seasoned over the years with my singing of it." [...] Dickson believed {{that she did not}} sound like herself on the song. While performing it later point of time on her concerts, Dickson sang it in her actual tone, saying that although the track [...] "might have been written for a teenage girl, but the experience of being abandoned by a man is one, women of all ages can relate to. I think you have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> songs and with yourself." [...] The singer's music director Ian Lynn arranged the track differently which she performs currently.|$|E
500|$|Conservatives and isolationists {{had little}} {{enthusiasm for the}} Willkie campaign, and the moderates wanted to see {{stronger}} positions on progressive issues and foreign policy. Publisher Henry Luce decried both Roosevelt and Willkie for failing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> the American people, [...] "America will never be ready for any war until she makes her mind up {{there is going to}} be a war." [...] (italics in original) Despite his pledge not to campaign, Roosevelt made inspection tours to military installations, well covered by the press. The president did not mention Willkie by name, seeking to avoid giving him publicity. [...] According to Susan Dunn in her book in the 1940 campaign, this forced Willkie [...] "to box against a phantom opponent and carry on a one-sided partisan debate... Even in Willkie's speeches, Roosevelt occupied center stage". Willkie promised to keep New Deal social welfare programs intact, expand Social Security, and provide full employment, a job for everyone: [...] "I pledge a new world".|$|E
500|$|Allison Mack characterizes Chloe {{as being}} a [...] "misfit" [...] during the first season; more of [...] "a really smart girl with attitude". She goes on to {{describe}} Chloe as intelligent and independent. Another of Chloe's defining characteristics is her need to [...] "expose falsehoods" [...] and find the truth in every situation. The character is curious, and wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> people. She is always {{trying to make sense}} of the situation. Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that [...] "drives [...] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is".|$|E

Page was replaced by Sam Moran, who had served as an understudy for The Wiggles for five years and had already stood in for Page for 150 shows. Initially, The Wiggles struggled over their decision to replace Page, but after their audience's positive response to Moran, they decided to continue as a group because they thought that was what their young audience would want. [...] According to Fatt, who called it [...] "a huge decision" [...] and [...] "a teachable moment" [...] for them, they chose <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> their young audience as they made the transition from Page to Moran. [...] As part owner of The Wiggles, Page received a payout of about $20 million.|$|E
500|$|While in Paris, Lana {{begins a}} new romantic {{relationship}} with Jason Teague. Kreuk believes that Lana did love Jason Teague, {{but she also}} still loved Clark at the same time. With Clark, it was the [...] "first love" [...] that she never {{had the chance to}} discover, and that lingered with her while she was in Paris during the space between seasons three and four. According to Kreuk, before Lana can experience successful relationships with other people she will need to know {{what it is like to}} truly be in a relationship with Clark, because of the [...] "intense connection between [...] two". Allison Mack shares her insight into the relationship between Clark and Lana, believing that the pair should have remained apart until they could finally be honest with each other: [...] "There's no honesty in their relationship, and there's no way that they could have a healthy relationship without that honesty [...] You can't be with someone if you're not honest with them." [...] Kreuk echoes Mack's sentiments, acknowledging that Lana is not stupid, and if Clark wants a real relationship then he is going to have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> her.|$|E

The only thing really frustrating for me, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E

Speaking to reporters outside Leinster House soon after his announcement, Lee said it would have been dishonest of him to accept the position: [...] "I had absolutely no input for nine months. I think I had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> myself and honest with the electorate about that and not pretend." [...] Asked if his resignation was a vote of no confidence in Kenny, Lee said there were [...] "certainly lots of large mutterings at the moment in relation to the leader's position".

Rhys then becomes involved in a mission to uncover and destroy an alien meat-trading racket, and ends up taking a bullet to protect Gwen's life. Because she enjoys finally being able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> Rhys, Gwen cannot bring herself to drug him for a second time, and so demands that Jack allow Rhys keep his memories of Torchwood. Rhys and Gwen marry in the episode [...] "Something Borrowed". Following the wedding, in the episode [...] "Adrift", Rhys brings up the issue of starting a family with Gwen, though she dismisses the idea, arguing that it would be impossible to have children with her job. [...] During the events of [...] "Fragments" [...] and series finale [...] "Exit Wounds", Rhys plays a particular role in the team's campaign against the returned Captain John Hart (James Marsters) and the insane Gray (Lachlan Nieboer), helping Gwen rescue the others after they are caught in an exploding building and subsequently working with Gwen's former colleague Andy Davidson (Tom Price) to help keep the attacking alien Weevils out of the police station.|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles from The New York Times {{felt that}} Madonna tried <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> {{the concept of}} American Dream in the album, but ended up {{producing}} songs akin to the [...] "folkie psychobabble" [...] of songwriters like Jewel. James Hannaham from Spin compared the album's introspective themes to her previous albums Ray of Light and Music and also noted Madonna spends much of American Life bemoaning the emptiness of celebrity culture. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian responded well to parts of the record saying [...] "American Lifes best tracks make a mockery of virtually all other current pop music" [...] however his conclusive point in the review {{was that there was}} not enough of good songs. The Village Voices Jessica Winter called Madonna's voice [...] "redundant" [...] and commented that [...] "she ironizes 'the American dream' only to pitch woo at her English husband and articulate a vague yet fiery frustration with her outrageously privileged station in the world". Ed Howard from Stylus Magazine gave the album a negative review calling the album [...] "about Madonna" [...] instead of American culture explaining, [...] "it's Madonna who, surprisingly, has simply run out of things to say". BBC's Ian Young also gave a negative review, saying that [...] "the tunes are bland and weak, the lyrics are uninspired and self-absorbed and the semi-Ibiza backing music is bare and recycled—and we are convinced that she has lost it." ...|$|E

500|$|The Buccaneers’ first {{training}} camp began on July 6, at the team’s training facility near Tampa International Airport, {{with a crew}} from NFL Films on hand to film the proceedings. Chicago Bears quarterback and Tampa native Gary Huff showed up to taunt the receivers. McKay noted {{that many of the}} players were out of shape, and expressed surprise at players who he felt were not taking advantage of a big opportunity. Ron Wolf, after seeing the team’s players in action, admitted disappointment at his own efforts in assembling the team. Defensive coordinator Abe Gibron, who promised <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> each player about his performance and told one that he had a chance of making the team, but that “You’re built like Tarzan, but you run like Jane”, assessed the defense as having the makings of a great front four. The team’s smallest, and perhaps fastest, player was Carl Roaches, who at 5'6½" [...] and 165 pounds, could run the 100-yard dash in 9.5 seconds. The team’s strongest player was fitness fanatic Dave Pear, who could bench press 10 repetitions at 400 pounds. McKay was unimpressed with the candidates at backup quarterback, saying of one injured contender, “his hand is still bad, but his passing is worse”. Middle linebacker soon proved to be a position for which there were no quality candidates in camp. [...] Running back George Ragsdale impressed the coaches, but broke his wrist in {{training camp}}. Essex Johnson, the Cincinnati Bengals’ all-time leading rusher and one of three remaining original Bengals, was obtained for “undisclosed considerations”.|$|E

John Nordling and Carl Molinder, the Swedish producers of the original film, were both involved as producers for the adaptation. Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that [...] "I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell." [...] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes initially referred to the film with [...] "If you call it a faithful remake, I think that's true to say that's what it is. It's not a reimagining; the same beats , maybe the scares are a little bit more scary." [...] He later said, [...] "I call it his [...] version. I don't call it his remake or his re-imagining of it." [...] The decision to make a new film adaptation has been criticized by Tomas Alfredson. He has stated on numerous occasions that he is not in favor of remaking his film. [...] "If one should remake a film, it's because the original is bad. And I don't think mine is," [...] he said. Producer Donna Gigliotti said, [...] "We're incredibly admiring of the original, but <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> you, that picture grossed $2 million.

[...] Carlton Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] felt that the audience deserved to know, you know, once he and Walt sailed off in the boat, what was their journey." [...] Supervising producer/writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "Michael's goal—the whole season—is to die and he gets an opportunity to redeem himself when [...] finds him." [...] Co-executive producer/staff writer Edward Kitsis added that [...] "It's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn't see [...] … I always respected the fact that he told his son about the murders … Even though he knew it would probably blow up their relationship, he wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> his son. In a way, you've got to respect that." [...] Harold Perrineau, who plays Michael, concluded that [...] "He's done some bad things and he's you know, got himself into a messy situation, but at the end of the day, Michael's a good guy." [...] Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot, the flashbacks of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] are presented continuously and are only bookended by present-day scenes. This is the second episode to do this after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. The flashback portion of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] is the longest in Lost history; Horowitz stated that [...] "As we were breaking the story, it just happened, and it turned into the longest flashback to date." [...] When asked why Michael's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure, as with other Lost characters, Damon Lindelof explained that [...] "if the Others … had chosen … Darwin or … Dickens, then … Widmore would have gotten suspicious: he'd go like, 'oh, now there's somebody on my boat with a literary allusion in their name, which sounds very much like that's a Benjamin Linus alias', so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could, which was Kevin Johnson."
