50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, the first tests for the manufacture of steel cord were undertaken. The company wanted to include <b>tyre</b> <b>reinforcement</b> material in its product range. A large-scale production was established in Oberbruch in 1969 which Akzo ceased again in 1991 for reason of international competition and establishment of tyre manufacturers' own capacities.In {{the second half of the}} 1960s, the number of employees reached a peak of 7,088. Glanzstoff remained a world leader in the production of man made fibers and their basic products up to the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Recently, tyre-reinforced {{unsealed}} pavements {{had been}} constructed {{in a number}} of sites throughout Australia. The use of partially cut-up waste tyres within the base layer was expected to produce (i) less lateral movement of base aggregate; (ii) increase in modulus through confinement; (iii) improved vertical stress distribution on the subgrade due to increased base modulus or slab action and (iv) reduced shearing {{in the top of the}} subgrade. This paper presents the results of preliminary study to confirm these expectations through experimental testing and finite element analyses. In the experimental testing, a box test was used to investigate the performance of a model unsealed pavement, reinforced with a tyre. Surface and subsurface measurements indicate that the tyre and base aggregate worked together and acted as a flexible foundation. Finite element analysis confirms that <b>tyre</b> <b>reinforcements</b> help reduce the subgrade vertical pressure which provides a lucrative alternate tyre reinforced pavements that can be constructed over soft subgrades...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of steel}} fibres {{extracted}} from waste <b>tyres</b> as <b>reinforcement</b> for concrete pavements {{has been developed}} at the University of Sheffield. The EU funded EcoLanes Project (Economical and sustainable pavement infrastructure for surface transport) undertook extensive research and developed solutions for Steel-Fibre-Reinforced-Concrete (SFRC) pavements with a particular focus on using recycled steel fibres and roller compacted concrete. The current research project ran alongside the EcoLanes project and aimed at contributing towards the development of design guidelines for pavements reinforced with recycled steel fibres. It was achieved through {{a study on the}} restrained shrinkage behaviour of Recycled-Steel-Fibre-Reinforced-Roller-Compacted-Concrete (R-SFR-RCC) pavements, and its consequent effect on the load bearing capacity and fatigue performance of pavements. The work in this thesis is mainly based on numerical investigations, but experiments were carried out to obtain the material properties (moisture transport, free shrinkage and mechanical). These basic physical properties were extracted from test results, using inverse analysis. The extent of distress induced by drying shrinkage was evaluated using moisture transport analysis coupled with stress analysis. The effect of shrinkage distress on the load bearing capacity of the pavement was investigated in a comparative way with and without shrinkage. Fatigue test results were also used to study the long-term load-bearing capacity. It was found that the rate of drying and consequent moisture diffusivity in SFRC is higher than for plain concrete and in RCC it is higher than for CC. Moisture diffusivity varies in the range of 0 - 5 mm 2 /day for moisture contents lower than 87 - 92...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{disposal}} of waste tyres has facing major problems in India. The growing problem of waste tyre disposal in the India can be alleviated if new recycling routes can be found for the surplus tyres. It is estimated that 1. 2 billions of waste tyre rubber produced globally in a year. It is estimated that 11 % of postconsumer tyres are exported and 27 % are sent to landfill, stockpiled or dumped illegally and only 4 % is used for civil engineering projects. Hence efforts {{have been taken to}} identify the potential application of waste tyres in civil engineering projects. In this essence, our present study aims to study the use of waste tyre rubber as tension reinforcement in beam. 6 numbers of beams were cast 3 of them are 10 mm x 15 mm flat size scrap <b>tyre</b> rubber as <b>reinforcement</b> instead of steel in tension zone and other with conventional steel. The experiments were carried out to determine flexural behavior of waste tyre reinforced concrete beam on 28 days. The result of use of waste tyre rubber as compared to normal beam are analyzed and compared...|$|R
