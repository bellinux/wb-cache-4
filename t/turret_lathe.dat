5|$|As {{president}} of J, Flanders implemented a continuous production line to manufacture the Hartness <b>Turret</b> <b>Lathe</b> instead of building each machine individually, attempting {{to bring some}} of the efficiencies of mass production to machine tool building.|$|E
25|$|Hartness {{discouraged}} modernizing of the Hartness Flat <b>Turret</b> <b>Lathe.</b> Nevertheless, {{it remained}} {{a very successful}} product until after Hartness's retirement, when a new J <b>turret</b> <b>lathe</b> model by John Lovely finally replaced it.|$|E
25|$|The 1921 {{edition of}} the ASME {{mechanical}} catalog and directory showed that J offered several models of Hartness flat <b>turret</b> <b>lathe,</b> an automatic chucking lathe, an automatic die, a screw-thread comparator, and the Fay automatic lathe. J had offices in Springfield, Vermont, San Francisco, California, and London, England, plus agents in five other countries.|$|E

50|$|Turrets can {{be added}} to non-turret lathes (bench lathes, engine lathes, toolroom lathes, etc.) by {{mounting}} them on the toolpost, tailstock, or both. Often these turrets are not as large as a <b>turret</b> <b>lathe's,</b> and they usually do not offer the sliding and stopping that a <b>turret</b> <b>lathe's</b> <b>turret</b> does; but they do offer the ability to index through successive tool settings.|$|R

25|$|His life {{achievements}} {{were recognized}} with honorary {{degrees from the}} University of Vermont (ME in 1910 and LLD in 1920) and Yale University (MA in 1914). The Franklin Institute awarded Hartness the Edward Longstreth Medal in 1921, recognizing his invention of the Hartness screw thread comparator. In the same year the American Philosophical Society and the City Trusts of Philadelphia awarded the John Scott Medal to Hartness for the flat <b>turret</b> <b>lathe,</b> citing its usefulness in making artillery.|$|E
25|$|In April 1889 Hartness {{moved to}} Springfield, Vermont {{to become the}} {{superintendent}} at the struggling Jones and Lamson (J) Machine Company. He used his creative energy to revitalize the company. Here he found his chance to manufacture the flat-turret lathe, which increased efficiency and productivity and was especially well adapted to the burgeoning automobile industry. The flat <b>turret</b> <b>lathe</b> improved upon earlier turret lathes via greater rigidity, allowing higher precision, higher speeds and feeds, and longer cuts. Hartness also developed an array of highly advanced tooling to complement the lathe, including improved roller bar feed and die head designs. All of these advantages allowed better parts to be made faster, and thus less expensively, which made the lathe highly desirable to manufacturers. This time, Hartness was prepared to defend his interest in his patent. He arranged with J to receive a $100 royalty on each machine.|$|E
2500|$|His son-in-law, Ralph Flanders, {{reported}} that Hartness examined “some {{of the elements}} which go into making workmen both contented and productive” in his book The Human Factor in Works Management. His Hartness <b>Turret</b> <b>Lathe</b> Manual starts with the statement, [...] "Since the machine is only an implement, it cannot be considered a thing entirely apart from the man. In fact, the man is the greater part. The personal welfare of the operator must be considered. This is something more than the man’s relation to the machine. It includes an equally important phase—his relationship to other men and to his environment in general." ...|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "monitor lathe" [...] {{formerly}} (1860s-1940s) {{referred to}} the class of small- to medium-sized manual <b>turret</b> <b>lathes</b> used on relatively small work. The name {{was inspired by the}} monitor-class warships, which the monitor <b>lathe's</b> <b>turret</b> resembled. Today, <b>lathes</b> of such appearance, such as the Hardinge DSM-59 and its many clones, are still common, but the name [...] "monitor lathe" [...] is no longer current in the industry.|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes {{machines}} {{similar to}} those above, but with power feeds and automatic turret-indexing {{at the end of}} the return stroke, are called [...] "semi-automatic turret lathes". This nomenclature distinction is blurry and not consistently observed. The term [...] "turret lathe" [...] encompasses them all. During the 1860s, when semi-automatic <b>turret</b> <b>lathes</b> were developed, they were sometimes called [...] "automatic". What we today would call [...] "automatics", that is, fully automatic machines, had not been developed yet. During that era both manual and semi-automatic <b>turret</b> <b>lathes</b> were sometimes called [...] "screw machines", although we today reserve that term for fully automatic machines.|$|R

5000|$|Hollow milling cutters, {{more often}} called simply hollow mills, are {{essentially}} [...] "inside-out endmills". They are {{shaped like a}} piece of pipe (but with thicker walls), with their cutting edges on the inside surface. They are used on <b>turret</b> <b>lathes</b> and screw machines as an alternative to turning with a box tool, or on milling machines or drill presses to finish a cylindrical boss (such as a trunnion).|$|R
50|$|Hollow-hexagon <b>turret</b> <b>lathes</b> {{competed with}} flat-turret lathes {{by taking the}} {{conventional}} hexagon turret and making it hollow, allowing the part to pass into it during the cut, analogously to how the part would pass over the flat turret. In both cases, the main idea is to increase rigidity by allowing a relatively long part to be turned without the tool overhang that would be needed with a conventional turret, which is not flat or hollow.|$|R
