500|$|In {{regards to}} the White Walkers' origin, David Benioff stated [...] "No one's {{innocent}} really in this world, {{and there was just}} something really beautifully right about the idea that the great nemesis of mankind were created to protect the Children of the Forest from mankind." [...] D. B. Weiss noted, [...] "The Night King, who's sort of the embodiment of absolute evil, what you're watching is the creation of that absolute evil, so the absolute evil isn't absolute after all." [...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show. The first <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> {{that was one of the}} very first scenes in the pilot, when Will the ranger sees the Wildling body parts in an odd pattern displayed by the White Walkers. We see it again north of the Wall with the dead horses displayed in a spiral pattern, and then you see it again here and see where these patterns come from, that they're ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals, and the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Marry You" [...] {{is one of}} {{the eleven}} songs {{composed}} and produced by The Smeezingtons, the collaboration of Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, and Ari Levine, for Mars's debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans. Lawrence explained the inspiration behind the song in an interview with American Songwriter stating, [...] "e had this image of a slow-mo video in Vegas of a couple running, and she’s in her gown and he’s in his tux, the wedding party is behind them. This sort of crazy, daring, wedding feeling". Lawrence was surprised at the impact of the song after watching some YouTube videos. He stated that [...] "e always {{thought it was a good}} song and catchy, but we didn’t think it would affect pop culture the way that it has. The first <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> one of those YouTube videos...we were almost in tears... the power of what it is we can create. These ideas, words, and lyrics and how they can get into the fabric of society and affect people’s lives in such an amazing way." [...] In an interview with Idolator Bruno Mars said that the song had its beginning by [...] "just playing the chords," [...] and then freestyling the lyrics [...] "I think I wanna marry you!". He continued, [...] "you’re in Vegas...had way too many drinks, and you love everybody, and you want to do something that you probably shouldn’t do and you’ll regret in the morning." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Nick's {{most notable}} {{returns to the}} series {{occurred}} in 1990. Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim {{that he was a}} born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her £1000 win on the bingo. EastEnders writer Sarah Phelps explained: [...] "For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick knew that. It was sort of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet." [...] With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his new-found faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. Discussing the storyline, scriptwriter Colin Brake has indicated that at first it was not clear to the audience whether Nick had reformed or not, but as the weeks passed it became obvious that he did intend to kill his mother, as he was shown practising a fake suicide note in Dot's handwriting– a foil to cover the intended murder; according to Brake, Dot remained blithely and perhaps purposefully ignorant to his wrongdoing. The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast consisting of Nick, Dot, Nick's estranged father Charlie, Dot's close friend Ethel Skinner and Alistair the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the [...] "one <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> a glimmer of Nick’s good side", Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her.|$|E

5000|$|This {{is about}} {{pointing}} out, that the one-sided {{emphasis on the}} question of wages by workers and unions is connected with the wrong perception of added value by the Marxists. In earlier <b>times</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> how wages and prices were mutually dependent; we now point out that the opinion is totally false, according to which the so-called added value is an absolute quantity produced by the undertaker, from where it flows into the other capitalist categories.|$|R

500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E

2500|$|The costumes of the prequel trilogy are purposefully more {{elaborate}} {{than those of}} the original trilogy. Lucas asserts that galactic society in the prequels is much more sophisticated. Commenting on the disparities between the two trilogies, Carrie Fisher mused, [...] "Harrison Ford wears the same outfit for three flicks, and I was complaining that I wear, like, six outfits. And my mother – Natalie Portman – she wears three million. She walks through a doorway and there's another outfit. It's like the Liberace of sci-fi changing of clothes." [...] Trisha Biggar reveals that originally there were only three costumes planned for Amidala in The Phantom Menace, but [...] " [...] decided that every <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> [...] {{she was going to have}} a different costume." [...] Lucas explains, [...] "Someone of that stature would automatically be changing their costumes to fit the occasion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Lennie James as Morgan Jones in a brief uncredited post-end credits cameo. It marked his third appearance in the show, after the pilot, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and the season three episode [...] "Clear". Gimple explained {{in an interview with}} The Hollywood Reporter that Morgan's appearance was the [...] "beginning of something" [...] for the character, but would not state further; he instead said, [...] "Looking at him, how he's dressed, how he's acting — it's not a 42-minute episode there — but you get some hints about where he's at. I would look at that carefully." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he also noted that Morgan was [...] "definitely dressed better than the last <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> him. He looks pretty well put together. You know, he’s not talking to himself. I would say that, just laying eyes on him, it looks like a different Morgan." [...] Kirkman stated that Morgan was possibly following Rick's trail, as Rick left him a map in [...] "Clear". He also said that the post-credits scene was used not only to surprise the audience, but to also [...] " [...] story of this episode...into its own contiguous piece." ...|$|E
