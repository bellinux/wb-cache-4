6000|$|Passing onward we {{find the}} {{explanation}} of a distinct <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> or marking, often superimposed upon protective tints, {{in the importance of}} easy recognition by many animals of their fellows, their parents, or their mates. By this need {{we have been able to}} account for markings that seem calculated to make the animal conspicuous, when the general tints and well-known habits of the whole group demonstrate the need of concealment. Thus also we are able to explain the constant symmetry in the markings of wild animals, as well as the numerous cases in which the conspicuous colours are concealed when at rest and only become visible during rapid motion. In striking contrast to ordinary protective coloration we have [...] "warning colours," [...] usually very conspicuous and often brilliant or gaudy, which serve to indicate that their possessors are either dangerous or uneatable to the usual enemies of their tribe. This kind of coloration is probably more prevalent than has been hitherto supposed, because in the case of many tropical animals we are quite unacquainted with their special and most dangerous enemies, and are also unable to determine whether they are or are not distasteful to those enemies. As a kind of corollary to the [...] "warning colours," [...] {{we find the}} extraordinary phenomena of [...] "mimicry," [...] in which defenceless species obtain protection by being mistaken for those which, from any cause, possess immunity from attack. Although a large number of instances of warning colour and of mimicry are now recorded, it is probably still an almost unworked field of research, more especially in tropical regions and among the inhabitants of the ocean.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{colour space}} one uses has a {{bearing on the}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> image {{processing}} tasks one does. As we approach the stage of colour processing in image processing, new colour spaces may be needed. In particular, colour spaces that model properties of our perception of colour may be useful. We propose two nonlinear, tridimensional transformations of the variables of the RGB (or LMS) colour space. In the resulting spaces pure S, or pure M input, does not imply the presence of yellow. Since {{there is evidence of}} S input to the parvocelular system, we use a dimension called violet minus green; in the resulting space, as the wavelength variable sweeps the visible spectrum, a circle is obtained, making explicit a circularity of chromaticity for spectral colours. ...|$|E
