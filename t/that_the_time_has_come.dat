Hideki asks why, and Freya explains that Chi discovered there were certain things that humans could do that she could not, leading her to believe that while Hideki would love her, it would make her existence unbearable. Hideki protests that it would not, but Freya tells him that Chi thought otherwise. She then tells Chitose <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> to destroy both of them, and she reluctantly agrees. Against Hideki's protestations, she deactivates Freya. Chi, however, has survived the deactivation and comes {{to the conclusion that}} while life with Hideki may seem painful because of her limitations, it is even more painful without him. She regains control of her body and completes her program, giving every persocom the ability to love then embraces Hideki.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel {{recalls the}} tales that a fellow slave, Macandal, would regale on the {{plantation}} of their master, Lenormand de Mezy. Macandal would tell tales of magical characters and mythical kingdoms with rivers {{rising in the}} sky. He is said to not only have irresistible qualities that appeal to black women, but also the ability to captivate men. He suffers an accident in which his left hand is caught in machinery, and his arm is dragged in up to the shoulder. Being useless to his owner, he departs for the mountains and discovers many secret herbs, plants, and fungi that appear to have magical qualities. Ti Noel joins Macandal and both learn about the magical attributes of these natural elements. Macandal suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come,</b> and no longer goes to the plantation. After the rain season has passed, Ti Noel meets {{with him in a}} cave populated with strange items. Macandal has established contact with surrounding plantations, and gives instructions to ensure the death of cows using secret herbs. The poison spreads, killing livestock by the hundreds as well as Frenchmen, wiping out adults and children. Madame Lenormand de Mezy dies as a result, and the deaths continue with entire families suffering the same fate. At gunpoint, a slave eventually explains that Macandal has superhuman powers and is the Lord of Poison. Death within the plantations returns to normal rates as a result and the Frenchmen return to playing cards and drinking, as months pass with no word of Macandal. Macandal, now with the ability to transform into animal forms, like bird, fish, or insect, visits the plantation to affirm faith in his return. The slaves decide to wait four years for Macandal to complete his metamorphoses and once again become a human. After four years, he returns during a celebration and all present are delighted. The chanting alerts the white men, and preparations are made to capture Macandal. He is captured and tied to a post in order to be lashed and burned in front of massive black crowds, but he escapes, flying overhead, and lands among the crowd. He is again captured and burned, but the slaves are certain that he has been saved by African Gods and return to their plantations, laughing.|$|E
25|$|International {{isolation}} was keenly {{felt by the}} South African team at the time, including Pollock, and {{the players}} took measures to try to reverse the looming sporting boycott. In 1971, Pollock {{took part in a}} protest organised by Barry Richards and Mike Procter against the South African government's apartheid policy as it referred to cricket. During a match to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the formation of the Republic of South Africa, the players from both teams walked off after one ball, issuing a joint statement: We cricketers feel <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> for an expression of our views. We fully support the South African Cricket Association's application to invite non-whites to tour Australia, if they are good enough, and further subscribe to merit being the only criterion on the cricket field.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} {{details on the}} 2013 GT350 accidentally {{surfaced}} online, Shelby has decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> to reveal the official details on the sports car. The model will be built in limited numbers and will be offered in both coupe and convertible versions. The Shelby GT350 was released onto the market in 2011 and since then, has been improved upon every year. In 2011, it only came as a coupe painted in white with blue stripes and for the 2012 model year, Shelby also added a convertible version with three more colors. For the 2013 model year, the GT350 will receive new color options, visual styling cues, and optional performance enhancements. The 2013 Shelby GT350 {{is powered by a}} 5.0 liter V8 engine offered in either a 430 HP normally aspirated version, a Ford Racing supercharged 525 HP, or a Ford Racing supercharged 624 HP version.|$|E
500|$|This revelation in mind, Imaginos decides <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> to {{reattempt}} his aborted {{mission to}} Mexico. On August 1, 1892, he sets sail aboard a [...] "charmed ship" [...] which, despite [...] "storms {{on land and}} storms at sea", delivers him faithfully to Mexico. After several months exploring the jungles of Yucatán he finds an undiscovered Mayan pyramid. Following a long passage into {{the interior of the}} pyramid he discovers a chamber carved from solid jade, in which he finds the [...] "Magna of Illusion", a twin of Dee's magic mirror. Stealing away with the artifact, he returns to Cornwall a year to the day of his departure, which coincides with the tenth birthday of his granddaughter. Imaginos gives the mirror to the young girl as a birthday present, and for the following 21 years it sits collecting dust in her attic, silently poisoning the minds of European leaders. In 1914, [...] "World War I breaks out. A disease with a long incubation" [...] ("Magna of Illusion").|$|E
500|$|Treasury {{officials}} officially recommended Gasparro's design, {{which they}} {{referred to as a}} [...] "modernized version of the classic Liberty design". On May 3, 1978, Wisconsin's William Proxmire introduced legislation in the Senate which was identical to the Treasury proposal, except for mandating a design which was altered to social reformer Susan B. Anthony in place of the allegorical Liberty. On May 15, Representatives Mary Rose Oakar and Patricia Schroeder introduced similar legislation to the House of Representatives. Anthony was also recommended by members of the National Organization for Women, the Congresswomen's Caucus, the National Women's Political Caucus and the League of Women Voters. In support of the proposed legislation, the League addressed a letter to Walter E. Fauntroy, chairman of the Subcommittee on Historic Preservation and Coinage, reading in part: The League believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come,</b> and is indeed long past, for the likeness of a prominent American woman to be placed on a denomination of U.S. currency. We believe strongly that the likeness should be that of an actual woman and not that of an imaginary or symbolic figure. Susan B. Anthony contributed immeasurably to the advancement of human dignity in this nation. It is entirely fitting and appropriate that her memory be honored through this measure. In addition, officials tallied suggestions sent to the Mint by the general public as to the subject of the dollar coin, and Susan B. Anthony had received the most support.|$|E

500|$|After Orik's coronation, Eragon and Saphira {{return to}} the elven capital Ellesméra to train. There, Saphira {{revealed}} from a memory that Eragon's deceased mentor, Brom, is Eragon's father; which Brom asked her to show him when the time was right. Oromis and Glaedr too justify Saphira's revelation. Glaedr also reveals the source of Galbatorix's power: Eldunari, or heart of hearts. An Eldunarí allows the holder to communicate with or draw energy from the dragon it belongs to, even if the dragon is deceased, or a great distance away. Galbatorix spent years collecting Eldunari, and forcing the deceased dragons to channel their energy to him through their Eldunari. Saphira is delighted to learn {{of the existence of}} the dragons, although imprisoned by Galbatorix's dark magics. After training, Eragon visits Rhunön, the elven blacksmith who forges swords for Riders. But Rhunön wouldn't create a weapon for him because long ago she swore an oath never to create a weapon again after the Fall of the Riders. Also her stocks of the metal, required to forge rider's swords was completely exhausted. But by deciphering the werecat Solembum's instructions Eragon is able to acquire the metal he requires, from under the roots of the Menoa Tree. After Eragon's repeated requests, Rhunön creates a weapon by controlling Eragon's body. Eragon gives a name to the sword,"Brisingr." [...] As Eragon's body itself forged the sword, a special bond between the sword and Eragon had been created, thus making the sword burst into flames whenever Eragon utters Brisingr, even when he does not intend to use magic. Oromis suspects that [...] "Brisingr" [...] is part of the sword's true name. Before Eragon and Saphira depart for the Varden, Oromis says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> for him and Glaedr to openly oppose the Empire in combat alongside the Queen of the Elves, Islanzadí. Thus, Glaedr gives his own Eldunari to Eragon. If anything should happen to Glaedr, Eragon would still be able to get advice from him. Then Glaedr and Oromis fly to Gil'ead, while Eragon and Saphira fly to Feinster, the city that the Varden are laying siege to.|$|E

It is posited then that [...] "modern orthodoxy", as such, may be disappearing, [...] "being sucked into pluralistic Judaism {{on the left}} and yeshivish on the right". [...] "Modern orthodoxy", then, as opposed to constituting an ideological spectrum centred on a common core of values, is, in fact, (tending towards) several entirely separate movements.

The PLO was to be expelled from Lebanon, and Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Defense minister, suggested they be moved to Jordan where the monarchy would be toppled and Jordan would serve as an [...] "alternative Palestinian homeland". Sharon boasted: [...] "One speech by me will make King Hussein realize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> to pack his bags."

2500|$|In her 2017 book Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism, Ghodsee {{posits that}} the triumphalist attitudes of Western powers {{at the end}} of the Cold War, and the {{fixation}} with linking all leftist and socialist political ideals with the horrors of Stalinism, allowed neoliberalism to fill the void, which undermined democratic institutions and reforms, leaving a trail of economic misery, unemployment, hopelessness and rising inequality throughout the former Eastern Bloc and much of the West in the following decades that has fueled the rise of extremist nationalism in both the former and the latter. She says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> [...] "to rethink the democratic project and finally do the work necessary to either rescue it from the death grip of neoliberalism, or replace it with a new political ideal that leads us forward to a new stage of human history." ...|$|E
