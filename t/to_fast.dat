Slow skeletal TnI has been proposed as a sensitive and muscle fiber type-specific marker for skeletal muscle injuries. In patients with skeletal muscle disorders, intact ssTnI or its degraded products may be detected in peripheral blood as a diagnostic indicator for slow fiber damages.|$|E

5|$|After {{negotiations}} with Mančevski fell through, Mark Rydell was contracted {{to direct the}} biopic in February 1996. Rydell was also close friends with Dean; the two studied together at Actors Studio in Manhattan, New York during the early 1950s. DiCaprio {{dropped out of the}} lead role entirely when his asking price was determined to be too high after the actor's success with Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997). Meanwhile, Rydell worked with Horovitz on another rewrite, and Warner Bros. planned <b>to</b> <b>fast</b> track production. Don Was was hired to write and compose the film score, but he was later replaced by John Frizzell. Shortly after Rydell's hiring, Stephen Dorff entered discussions to portray James Dean.

In contrast, there are no known compounds that bind with high affinity to cardiac troponin C. The calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, is purported to bind to troponin C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. In contrast, levosimendan inhibits type 3 phosphodiesterase with nanomolar affinity, so its biological target is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Granvin is a port on the Hardangerfjord and was {{the center}} for freight {{transport}} in Hardanger. Hardanger is dominated by {{a small number of}} large industrial companies, primarily smelters, which were responsible for more than 80 percent of the line's cargo volume. While Hardanger in the 1980s had a population of 40,000, Granvin had a population of 1,000 {{and was the}} smallest municipality in Hardanger. Granvin served as a ferry hub for services by Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap (HSD), and in 1980 there up to two daily services with the local ferry services in Hardanger, in addition <b>to</b> <b>fast</b> ferries to both Bergen and Stavanger. Buses operated to Granvin from Norheimsund and Kvanndal.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 {{the hunger}} strike {{was added to}} the WSPU's {{repertoire}} of resistance. On 24 June Marion Wallace Dunlop was arrested for writing an excerpt from the Bill of Rights (1688 or 1689) on a wall in the House of Commons. Angered by the conditions of the jail, Dunlop went on a hunger strike. When it proved effective, fourteen women imprisoned for smashing windows began <b>to</b> <b>fast.</b> WSPU members soon became known around the country for holding prolonged hunger strikes to protest their incarceration. Prison authorities frequently force-fed the women, using tubes inserted through the nose or mouth. The painful techniques (which, in the case of mouth-feeding, required the use of steel gags to force the mouth open) brought condemnation from suffragists and medical professionals.|$|E

5|$|Once {{a hostile}} ship is in range, the player {{will have the}} choice to either open fire or outmanoeuvre the enemy. The Bismarck is able to {{withstand}} 99 points of damage; internal fires may break out during battle and will risk destroying the ship if the fires are not contained quickly enough or if they reach fuel tanks. If fires occur, the player is given the option to order fire-fighting crews to contain the blaze, although it will cause the ship to disengage from combat. The game proceeds in real time, and has the option to change speed from slow <b>to</b> <b>fast</b> at any time.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Test {{team was}} touring South Africa in 1949–50, {{creating}} opportunities for young players back home. This was especially true with respect <b>to</b> <b>fast</b> bowling, as Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, Australia's two leading pacemen, were from New South Wales {{and were in}} South Africa. In addition, Ernie Toshack, {{who had been in}} the Test team since World War II, had broken down.|$|E

5|$|The {{vessels that}} {{eventually}} became the Iowa-class battleships were born from the US Navy's War Plan Orange, a Pacific war plan against Japan. War planners {{anticipated that the}} US fleet would engage and advance in the Central Pacific, with {{a long line of}} communication and logistics that would be vulnerable to high-speed Japanese cruisers. The chief concern was that the US Navy's traditional 21-knot battle force would be too slow to force these Japanese task forces into battle, while faster carriers and cruiser escorts would be outmatched by the Japanese Kongō-class battlecruiser, which had been upgraded in the 1930s <b>to</b> <b>fast</b> battleships. Even during the development process of the North Carolina-class and South Dakota-class battleships, designs that could achieve 30 knots were seriously considered.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was {{organized}} in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under Guglielmo Embriaco arrived at Jaffa, and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build siege engines. The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them <b>to</b> <b>fast</b> and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of Joshua at the siege of Jericho. After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them, and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.|$|E
5|$|As Australia won {{the series}} convincingly 4–0, {{it is not}} {{surprising}} that their players dominated the statistical rankings. Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by their English counterparts and scored their runs at a much higher average. Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian. On the bowling front, Australia's pace attack had far more success and they were a large part of the success. Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets, supported by Miller and Toshack, who took 13 and 11 respectively. For England, only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets, and at a substantially higher cost than the Australian pacemen. The bowling was dominated by pace bowling, with Laker being the only spinner on the list, with by far the worst average. This was in large part because England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than under normal conditions. As a new ball is more conducive <b>to</b> <b>fast</b> bowling, this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack, in this case Australia.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Fibroblast {{growth factor}} 21 (FGF 21), a key {{regulator}} of the metabolic response <b>to</b> <b>fasting,</b> is highly induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp 1) {{is one of}} several ER stress proteins that has been shown to directly activate the FGF 21 promoter. We aimed to determine whether hepatic Xbp 1 is required for induction of hepatic FGF 21 in vivo. Methods: Mice bearing a hepatocyte-specific deletion of Xbp 1 (Xbp 1 LKO) were subjected <b>to</b> <b>fasting,</b> pharmacologic ER stress, or a ketogenic diet, all potent stimuli of Fgf 21 expression. Results: Hepatocyte-specific Xbp 1 knockout mice demonstrated normal induction of FGF 21 in response <b>to</b> <b>fasting</b> or pharmacologic ER stress and enhanced induction of FGF 21 in response to a ketogenic diet. Consistent with preserved induction of FGF 21, Xbp 1 LKO mice exhibited normal induction of FGF 21 target genes and normal ketogenesis in response <b>to</b> <b>fasting</b> or a ketogenic diet. Conclusion: Hepatic Xbp 1 is not required for induction of FGF 21 under physiologic or pathophysiologic conditions in vivo...|$|R
