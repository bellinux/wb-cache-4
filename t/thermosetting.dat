25|$|Thermosets, or <b>thermosetting</b> polymers, can melt {{and take}} shape only once: {{after they have}} solidified, they stay solid. In the <b>thermosetting</b> process, a {{chemical}} reaction occurs that is irreversible. The vulcanization of rubber {{is an example of}} a <b>thermosetting</b> process: before heating with sulfur, the polyisoprene is a tacky, slightly runny material; after vulcanization, the product is rigid and non-tacky.|$|E
25|$|Melamine is {{combined}} with formaldehyde to produce melamine resin, a very durable <b>thermosetting</b> plastic used in high pressure decorative laminates such as Formica, melamine dinnerware, laminate flooring, and dry erase boards.|$|E
25|$|Polyurethane (PUR and PU) is a polymer {{composed}} of organic units joined by carbamate (urethane) links. While most polyurethanes are <b>thermosetting</b> polymers {{that do not}} melt when heated, thermoplastic polyurethanes are also available.|$|E
40|$|<b>Thermosets</b> {{are a key}} {{group of}} polymers. Understanding how their {{chemistry}} and structure affects their properties is essential to their manufacture and use {{in a range of}} applications. Thermosets: Structure, properties and applications reviews both factors affecting <b>thermoset</b> properties and how this understanding can be used to engineer <b>thermosets</b> for particular uses. Part one reviews mechanical and thermal properties, including the role of nanostructures in <b>thermoset</b> toughening. Applications of <b>thermosets</b> are the focus of part two, including the use of <b>thermosets</b> in the building and construction industry, aerospace technology and as insulation materials. <b>Thermoset</b> adhesives are also discussed, followed by a final review of <b>thermosets</b> for electrical applications...|$|R
40|$|This chapter summarises the {{importance}} of chemorheology (rheology of reactive materials) in characterising the fundamental flow behaviour of <b>thermoset</b> materials, and its usefulness in flow simulation of <b>thermoset</b> materials. A review of the <b>thermoset</b> flow simulation process is given, along with descriptions of key material properties, key cure kinetic models and chemorheological models, before examining the usefulness of chemorheological models and flow simulation in industrial <b>thermoset</b> processes...|$|R
40|$|Technique of {{including}} a thermoplastic film as the outermost layer of <b>thermoset</b> composites {{have been developed}} {{as an attempt to}} join the <b>thermoset</b> composites using fusion bonding methods. Special thermoplastic in the form of film was incorporated onto the surface of <b>thermoset</b> composites during co-curing process. Semi-Interpenetration Polymer Network [s-IPN] was formed between thermoplastic and <b>thermoset</b> polymers. The <b>thermoset</b> composites can be fusion bonded using coconsolidation and localized heating through their incorporated thermoplastic surfaces. The mechanical properties of <b>thermoset</b> composites bonded with thermoplastic adhesive were equivalent or superior to the benchmark composites bonded with Cytec FM 300 K adhesive in terms of lap shear strength, high temperature, low temperature and anti-chemical resistance...|$|R
25|$|Materials {{science is}} closely related to civil engineering. It studies {{fundamental}} characteristics of materials, and deals with ceramics such as concrete and mix asphalt concrete, strong metals such as aluminum and steel, and <b>thermosetting</b> polymers including polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and carbon fibers.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above {{the properties of}} the nanocellulose makes an interesting material for reinforcing plastics. Nanocellulose has been reported to improve the mechanical properties of, for example, <b>thermosetting</b> resins, starch-based matrixes, soy protein, rubber latex, poly(lactide). The composite applications may be for use as coatings and films, paints, foams, packaging.|$|E
25|$|Fine {{silica sand}} that {{is covered in}} a thin (3–6%) <b>thermosetting</b> {{phenolic}} resin and liquid catalyst is dumped, blown, or shot onto a hot pattern. The pattern is usually made from cast iron and is heated to 230 to 315°C (450 to 600°F). The sand is allowed {{to sit on the}} pattern for a few minutes to allow the sand to partially cure.|$|E
40|$|<b>Thermosets</b> <b>Thermosets</b> are {{polymeric}} materials generated by irreversible crosslinking of multifunctional monomers or oligomers thus forming a three dimensional network {{out of the}} initial resin system. Obviously, <b>thermoset</b> properties depend both on the monomer structure and on {{the architecture of the}} network...|$|R
50|$|Advanced {{composite}} {{systems are}} divided into two basic types, <b>thermosets</b> and thermoplastics. <b>Thermosets</b> {{are by far the}} predominant type in use today. <b>Thermosets</b> are subdivided into several resin systems including epoxies, phenolics, polyurethanes, and polyimides. Of these, epoxy systems currently dominate the advanced composite industry.|$|R
500|$|Plastics are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} categories, which are [...] "thermosets" [...] and [...] "thermoplastics." [...] A <b>thermoset</b> is a plastic in which a chemical reaction sets the molecular bonds after first forming the plastic, and then the bonds cannot be broken again without degrading the plastic. <b>Thermosets</b> cannot be melted, therefore, once a <b>thermoset</b> has set {{it is impossible to}} weld it. Examples of <b>thermosets</b> include epoxies, silicone, vulcanized rubber, polyester, and polyurethane.|$|R
25|$|The term melting point, {{when applied}} to polymers, {{suggests}} not a solid–liquid phase transition but a transition from a crystalline or semi-crystalline phase to a solid amorphous phase. Though abbreviated as simply Tm, the property in question is more properly called the crystalline melting temperature. Among synthetic polymers, crystalline melting is only discussed with regards to thermoplastics, as <b>thermosetting</b> polymers will decompose at high temperatures rather than melt.|$|E
25|$|Another {{market for}} Bakelite resin was the {{creation}} of phenolic sheet materials. Phenolic sheet is a hard, dense material made by applying heat and pressure to layers of paper or glass cloth impregnated with synthetic resin. Cellulose paper, cotton fabrics, synthetic yarn fabrics, glass fabrics and unwoven fabrics are all possible materials used in lamination. When heat and pressure are applied, polymerization transforms the layers into <b>thermosetting</b> industrial laminated plastic.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of the fusible core process is not limited just to the injection of thermoplastics, but with corresponding core alloys also to <b>thermosetting</b> plastic molding materials (duroplast). The fusible core process finds application, for example, for injection molded passenger car engine intake manifolds. By modifying the equipment, small molded parts like valves or pump housings can be manufactured, as the manufacture of the fusible cores and the injected parts {{can be carried out}} on an injection molding machine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thermoset</b> plastic {{polymers}} characterised by rigid, three-dimensional {{structures and}} high molecular weight, {{stay out of}} shape when deformed and undergo permanent or plastic deformation under load, and normally decompose before melting. <b>Thermoset</b> elastomers, which are soft and springy or rubbery and can be deformed and revert to their original shape on loading release, also decompose before melting. Conventional <b>thermoset</b> plastics or elastomers therefore cannot be melted and re-shaped after they are cured which implies that <b>thermosets</b> cannot be recycled for the same purpose, except as filler material. There are developments however involving <b>thermoset</b> epoxy resins which on controlled and contained heating form crosslinked networks that can be repeatedly reshaped like silica glass by reversible covalent bond exchange reactions on reheating above the glass transition temperature. There are also <b>thermoset</b> polyurethanes shown to have transient properties and which can thus be reprocessed or recycled.|$|R
50|$|Portland cement is {{the most}} common {{cementing}} agent in grout, but <b>thermoset</b> polymer matrix grouts based on <b>thermosets</b> such as urethanes and epoxies are also popular.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis describes a route towards semi-crystalline polyamide (PA 10 T) <b>thermosets.</b> A mild temperature solution polymerization method was developed to synthesize melt-processable PA 10 T precursors with crosslinkable functionalities. These functionalities can be placed at the polymer chain-ends or as pedent groups on the polymer backbone. The reactive precursors were thermally cured into polyamide <b>thermosets</b> and their morphology and thermo-mechanical properties of the final <b>thermosets.</b> Finally, semi-crystalline PA 10 T <b>thermoset</b> films were evaluated as single-component high-temperature shape memory materials.

25|$|Bakelite's {{molding process}} {{had a number}} of advantages. Bakelite resin could be {{provided}} either as powder, or as preformed partially cured slugs, increasing the speed of the casting. <b>Thermosetting</b> resins such as Bakelite required heat and pressure during the molding cycle, but could be removed from the molding process without being cooled, again making the molding process faster. Also, because of the smooth polished surface that resulted, Bakelite objects required less finishing. Millions of parts could be duplicated quickly and relatively cheaply.|$|E
25|$|Phenolics or phenol {{formaldehyde}} (PF) – high modulus, relatively heat resistant, and excellent fire resistant polymer. Used for insulating parts in electrical fixtures, paper laminated products (e.g. Formica), thermally insulation foams. It is a <b>thermosetting</b> plastic, with the familiar trade name Bakelite, {{that can be}} molded by heat and pressure when mixed with a filler-like wood flour or can be cast in its unfilled liquid form or cast as foam (e.g. Oasis). Problems include the probability of moldings naturally being dark colors (red, green, brown), and as thermoset {{it is difficult to}} recycle.|$|E
25|$|Thermoplastics are a {{category}} of polymers that can be reheated and reshaped, {{and there are several}} ways that they can be used to create a bicycle frame. One implementation of thermoplastic bicycle frames are essentially carbon fiber frames with the fibers embedded in a thermoplastic material rather than the more common <b>thermosetting</b> epoxy materials. GT Bicycles {{was one of the first}} major manufacturers to produce a thermoplastic frame with their STS System frames in the mid 1990s. The carbon fibers were loosely woven into a tube along with fibers of thermoplastic. This tube was placed into a mould with a bladder inside which was then inflated to force the carbon and plastic tube against the inside of the mould. The mould was then heated to melt the thermoplastic. Once the thermoplastic cooled it was removed from the mould in its final form.|$|E
40|$|A <b>thermoset</b> or {{network polymer}} is an organic {{material}} where the molecules are tied together through chemical bonds (crosslinks) {{and therefore they}} cannot move past one another. As a result, these materials exhibit {{a certain degree of}} dimensional stability. The chemical composition and the degree of crosslink density of the <b>thermoset</b> have a pronounced effect upon the properties. High temperature <b>thermosets</b> offer a favorable combination of properties that makes them attractive for many applications. Their most important features are the excellent processability particularly of the low molecular weight precusor forms, the chemical and solvent resistance and the dimensional stability. The market for high temperature <b>thermosets</b> will increase as new uses for them are uncovered and new <b>thermosets</b> with better combinations of properties are developed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The 2 -methylimidazole (Im) -terminated hyperbranched polyesters (ImHBPs) with {{different}} generations were prepared {{and used in}} diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) as curing agents and tougheners in this work. It {{was found that the}} ImHBPs had better latent property than Im which indicated that the ImHBPs were proper to be used as low temperature curing agent in epoxy curing system. It was also found that the tensile strength, the flexural strength and impact strength of epoxy <b>thermosets</b> cured by ImHBPs under 90 were much higher than those of CYD- 128 / 2 -methylimidazole <b>thermoset,</b> which indicated that the ImHBPs obviously improved the mechanical properties of epoxy <b>thermosets,</b> and the <b>thermoset</b> cured by ImHBP with two generation had the best performance among the <b>thermosets...</b>|$|R
40|$|Research {{into the}} fusion bonding of joints {{containing}} thermoplastic and/or <b>thermoset</b> composites. A thermoplastic interlayer is co-cured with the <b>thermoset</b> {{that provides a}} fusible surface. Depending {{on the type of}} materials the interlayer can form an adhesive interface or a gradient interphase with the <b>thermoset.</b> Welding of <b>thermoset</b> composite to thermoplastic composite coupons with both interlayer types were performed. High lap shear strength are obtained, even after prolonged exposure to moisture. The joint that uses the gradient interphase {{has the potential to be}} certified for aerospace, in contrast with the adhesive interface type which faces the same challenges as seen in the certification of adhesive bonds. This technique provides an alternative to mechanical joining or adhesive bonding of cured <b>thermoset</b> structures. Aerospace EngineeringAS...|$|R
25|$|Regarding the {{organization}} of covalent bonds, recall that classic molecular solids, as stated above, consist of small, non-polar covalent molecules. The example given, paraffin wax, {{is a member of}} a family of hydrocarbon molecules of differing chain lengths, with high-density polyethylene at the long-chain end of the series. High-density polyethylene can be a strong material: when the hydrocarbon chains are well aligned, the resulting fibers rival the strength of steel. The covalent bonds in this material form extended structures, but do not form a continuous network. With cross-linking, however, polymer networks can become continuous, and a series of materials spans the range from Cross-linked polyethylene, to rigid <b>thermosetting</b> resins, to hydrogen-rich amorphous solids, to vitreous carbon, diamond-like carbons, and ultimately to diamond itself. As this example shows, there can be no sharp boundary between molecular and network covalent solids.|$|E
25|$|The {{properties}} of a polyurethane are {{greatly influenced by}} the types of isocyanates and polyols used to make it. Long, flexible segments, contributed by the polyol, give soft, elastic polymer. High amounts of crosslinking give tough or rigid polymers. Long chains and low crosslinking give a polymer that is very stretchy, short chains with lots of crosslinks produce a hard polymer while long chains and intermediate crosslinking give a polymer useful for making foam. The crosslinking present in polyurethanes means that the polymer consists of a three-dimensional network and molecular weight is very high. In some respects a piece of polyurethane {{can be regarded as}} one giant molecule. One consequence of this is that typical polyurethanes do not soften or melt when they are heated; they are <b>thermosetting</b> polymers. The choices available for the isocyanates and polyols, in addition to other additives and processing conditions allow polyurethanes to have the very wide range of properties that make them such widely used polymers.|$|E
500|$|Injection {{moulding}} uses a ram or screw-type plunger {{to force}} molten plastic material into a mould cavity; this solidifies into a shape that has conformed to the contour of the mould. It is {{most commonly used}} to process both thermoplastic and <b>thermosetting</b> polymers, with the volume used of the former being considerably higher. Thermoplastics are prevalent due to characteristics which make them highly suitable for injection moulding, such as {{the ease with which}} they may be recycled, their versatility allowing them to be used {{in a wide variety of}} applications, [...] and their ability to soften and flow upon heating. Thermoplastics also have an element of safety over thermosets; if a <b>thermosetting</b> polymer is not ejected from the injection barrel in a timely manner, chemical crosslinking may occur causing the screw and check valves to seize and potentially damaging the injection moulding machine.|$|E
40|$|Compressive high-strain rate {{behavior}} of <b>thermoset</b> epoxy resin dispersed with multi-walled carbon nanotubes is presented. The present study investigates {{the effect of}} strain rate as well as effect of multi-walled carbon nanotube dispersion on the compressive stress-compressive strain {{behavior of}} <b>thermoset</b> epoxy resin. The amount of multi-walled carbon nanotubes dispersion was varied up to 3 % by weight.

Processing of multi-walled carbon nanotubes-dispersed <b>thermoset</b> epoxy resin, testing, damage, and energy absorbing mechanisms and key findings are reported. It is observed that the compressive strength of <b>thermoset</b> epoxy resin increases up to 147 % at high-strain rate compared with that at quasi-static loading.

500|$|Injection {{moulding}} BrE or Injection molding AmE, is {{a manufacturing}} process for producing parts by injecting material into a mould. Injection moulding {{can be performed}} {{with a host of}} materials mainly including metals, (for which the process is called die-casting), glasses, elastomers, confections, and most commonly thermoplastic and <b>thermosetting</b> polymers. Material for the part is fed into a heated barrel, mixed, and forced into a mould cavity, where it cools and hardens to the configuration of the cavity. After a product is designed, usually by an industrial designer or an engineer, moulds are made by a mould-maker (or toolmaker) from metal, usually either steel or aluminium, and precision-machined to form the features of the desired part. Injection moulding is widely used for manufacturing a variety of parts, from the smallest components to entire body panels of cars. [...] Advances in 3D printing technology, using photopolymers which do not melt during the injection moulding of some lower temperature thermoplastics, can be used for some simple injection moulds.|$|E
500|$|Most polymers, {{sometimes}} referred to as resins, may be used, including all thermoplastics, some thermosets, and some elastomers. Since 1995, the total number of available materials for injection moulding has increased at a rate of 750 per year; there were approximately 18,000 materials available when that trend began. [...] Available materials include alloys or blends of previously developed materials, so product designers can choose the material with the best set of properties from a vast selection. [...] Major criteria for selection of a material are the strength and function required for the final part, as well as the cost, but also each [...] material has different parameters for moulding that must be taken into account. Common polymers like epoxy and phenolic are examples of <b>thermosetting</b> plastics while nylon, polyethylene, and polystyrene are thermoplastic. Until comparatively recently, plastic springs were not possible, but advances in polymer properties make them now quite practical. Applications include buckles for anchoring and disconnecting the outdoor-equipment webbing.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization {{of different kinds of}} reversible <b>thermosets</b> and <b>thermoset</b> nanocomposite materials by using alternating aliphatic polyketone (PK) as raw material. Fundamental knowledge was generated regarding the molecular design of new polymers via chemical modification of PK with aliphatic and aromatic amine compounds. The resulting thermally reversible <b>thermoset</b> systems were investigated to outline the benefits for the synergistic cooperation between reversible covalent and supramolecular interactions. Moreover, improvements regarding the mechanical performance, reversibility, recyclability, self-healing and electrical conductivity of the <b>thermosets</b> were investigated by incorporating rubber particles and nanofillers into the <b>thermoset</b> matrices. In first instance we investigated the chemical modification of alternating aliphatic polyketones with aliphatic and aromatic amine compounds using the Paal-Knorr reaction to obtain thermally reversible polymers with relatively high glass transition temperatures. These materials display the desired mechanical properties with the exception of toughness. This could be achieved by preparing a reversible and toughened <b>thermoset</b> system based on the covalent incorporation of furan-functionalized ethylene-propylene rubber into a <b>thermoset</b> furan-functionalized polyketone. In order to confer also electrical properties to these materials, conductive nanocomposites containing well-distributed, exfoliated and undamaged MWCNTs were prepared.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} {{reversible}} and toughened <b>thermoset</b> system based on the covalent incorporation of a furane functionalized ethylene-propylene rubber (EPM-Fu) into a <b>thermoset</b> furane functionalized polyketone (PK-Fu) via Diels-Alder (DA) reversible cross-linking with bismaleimide (b-MA). FT-IR and DSC analyses proved the reversible interaction between PK-Fu and EPM-Fu with b-Ma via DA and r-DA sequence. Likewise, thermo-mechanical experiments (DMTA) indicated the re-workability of the material with no evident differences in elastic and loss modulus after several heating cycles and recycling procedures. Moreover, a considerable increase in the softening point (tangent 6) was also found for the higher toughened system containing 12 wt% of EPM-Fu (neat <b>thermoset</b> T = 137 degrees C whereas toughened <b>thermoset</b> T = 155 degrees C). A two-fold increase in IZOD impact strength compared to the neat <b>thermoset</b> (up to 27 J/m) was also recorded by the toughened system. Overall, this approach clearly indicates that fully thermally reversible and toughened <b>thermosets</b> can be realized starting from mixtures of furan functionalized polyketone and EPM rubber, cross-linked via reversible Diels-Alder chemistry.
