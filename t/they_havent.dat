I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be

50|$|In Cross, Alex discovers {{who really}} killed his wife, {{and will do}} {{anything}} to take down her murderer. He learns he was chasing a false killer, and the real killer is Jimmy Hats, whom Sampson killed long ago. At the end of the novel, Alex comes to terms with Marias death and moves on with his life. Double Cross sees Alex as he falls in love again—with detective Bree Stone; he must also assist her in the case of DCAK, a murderer, known as DC Audience Killer, as he retired from the FBI before the events of Cross. In I, Alex Cross, he decides to find and solve the murder case in which his deceased niece, Caroline Cross, was involved in due to her being a victim. He later learns who the murderer is—the presidents husband—but the murderer is later killed by an agent from the Secret Service. Also in the book, Alex proposes to Bree and she accepts, becoming his fiancée. By Cross Fire, Alex and Bree get married and face off once more against Kyle Craig, who dies at the end. With Kyle dead, Alex, Bree, and his family experience a sense of peace, something <b>they</b> <b>havent</b> felt for a long time.|$|E

50|$|In an {{interview}} in 2000, Hogarth expressed regret about the band retaining their name after he joined: If we had known when I joined Marillion what we know now, wed have changed the name and been a new band. It {{was a mistake to}} keep the name, because what it represented in the mid-Eighties is a millstone we now carry. If wed changed it, I think we would have been better off. We would have been judged for our music. Its such a grave injustice that the media constantly calls us a dinosaur prog band. They only say that out of ignorance because <b>they</b> <b>havent</b> listened to anything weve done for the last 15 bloody years. If you hear anything weve done in the last five or six years, that description is totally irrelevant... Its a massive frustration that no-one will play our stuff. If we send our single to Radio 1 they say: Sorry, we dont play music by bands who are over so-many years old... and heres the new U2 single. I suppose its something everyone has to cope with - every band are remembered for their big hit single, irrespective of how much they change over the years. But you can only transcend that by continuing to have hits. Its Catch 22. You know, at some stage, someone has to notice that were doing interesting things.

5000|$|However, {{some critics}} {{felt that the}} album was overly ambitious and that the bands musical {{departure}} may alienate listeners. Chad Grischow of IGN felt that the albums dramatic hooks seem [...] "bloated" [...] at times: [...] "The band does a great of focusing on what they do best, but the album does drown itself a bit with all the overwhelming enormity of it all." [...] Scott Shetler of Slant disliked the [...] "melodramatic" [...] undertones of [...] "Ive Got All This Ringing in My Ears and None on My Fingers" [...] and [...] "Golden", writing [...] "they dont handle that style quite as well as Panic! at the Disco". Cory Apar of AllMusic opined that the albums pop direction contradicts the bands lyrical claims of wishing to stick to their roots. He called the albums various styles [...] "hit and miss", yet commented that [...] "Once Infinity on High sinks in, its indeed a fun record. But for a band that was once so self-assured and able to utilize its talents so compellingly, the album is regrettably haphazard." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian believed that the album was overly sullen, but noted that [...] "They may not be happy, but <b>they</b> <b>havent</b> forgotten to be catchy."

5000|$|Indie Vision Musics Carter Fraser {{said that}} [...] "I {{apologize}} for when I suggested {{that no one}} was approaching worship from an indie rock standpoint; The Royal Royal are more or less trying. Granted, its not like theyre the next Danielson or something, but The Royalty does sound much more similar to, say, a power-pop Arcade Fire than 90% of worship music. In fact, if you were to listen to The Royalty without the lyrics, you wouldnt be able to tell its a worship album at all. Thats a terrific testament to the originality present. Sometimes the style contrasts with the plainly worshipful lyrics so much that the listener is forced to do a double take; while neither The Royal Royals style nor lyricism are unexplored, <b>they</b> <b>havent</b> been combined quite like this." [...] However, Fraser cautioned that [...] "Now dont get too excited yet, theres still much work to be done for the Ontario natives. Theres a lot of inconsistency littered throughout The Royalty but when theyre at their best, the result is striking...Theres quite simply more songwriting talent here than in other acts, yet its still undeveloped. At this point it may just be that The Royal Royal are still sort of naïve. For this reason its fair to call The Royalty a [...] "pop" [...] album when referring to its accessibility, though there are more creative undercurrents present than the term suggests.|$|E

In January 2013, he {{announced that}} the working title was Baahubali, though it would later be finalised. P. M. Satheesh stated that much effort was taken to keep the recording free of anachronistic sounds of modern machinery. Prabhas, Rana and Anushka practiced sword fighting, while Prabhas and Rana learned horse riding. It was later decided {{to make it a}} two part film which would release by 2015. On why the film was split into two parts, Rajamouli said, [...] "The story, about two warring brothers for a kingdom, is so big that one film is not enough. We tried but we were losing some of the emotional quotient hence the second release after a gap of 10 months." [...] Tamil lyricist Madhan Karky was selected to write the dialogues for the Tamil version. He said that his dialogues would be along the lines of yesteryear epic historical movies like Manohara (1954) and Nadodi Mannan (1958) and that they would be in chaste Tamil. The films action sequences were choreographed by Peter Hein who stated that efforts were being made to keep the visuals as a period film. For a particular action sequence, Peter Hein had to handle around 2000 stuntmen and elephants. K. K. Senthil Kumar was selected to handle the films cinematography. Director S.S.Rajamouli said that he was inspired from epic Mahabharata in making Baahubali. The story of Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali: The Conclusion is set in Mahishmati kingdom. Sodhe Matha sent legal notices to the films producers in early January 2014 about the films title Baahubali which is the name of a revered Arihant in Jainism, Bahubali, as they were afraid that the film would portray his story in a violent manner. Days later, Sobhu Yarlagadda defended the story of the film saying [...] "The film {{has nothing to do with}} Gomatheswara or the Jain religion. The story is completely fictional written by Vijayendra Prasad and will remain so. Baahubali refers to the amount of power the protagonist possesses." [...] He also clarified that <b>they</b> <b>havent</b> received the legal notice yet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Instrumented Charpy {{impact test}} method is {{possible}} to obtain various dynamic fracture characteristics from the load-deflection or load-time curve. Recently, instrumented Charpy impact test method is widely used {{for the evaluation of}} toughness of various specimens of different materials with different sizes. It is important to record an accurate impact load in order to improve the reliability of this test method. In some standards of instrumented Charpy impact test method such as ISO and ASTM, <b>they</b> <b>havent</b> clearly standardized striker geometry which seem to directly influence the obtained impact load. There are some differences between standards, although standard procedures are well defined. Therefore, instrumented Charpy impact test method has a problem that measurement value is different depending on each standard. In the present study, the effect of striking edge geometries, which are difference between ISO and ASTM, on load-deflection curve and absorbed energy were investigated. According to ISO and ASTM, two types of striker having different radius were machined. There was no difference between the two different striking edge geometries for values of absorbed energy per unit ligament area less than 0. 75 J/mm 2. However, striking edge geometry according to ASTM is not propriety for Charpy impact test method because of four, instead of three, point bending on process of fracture at high level of absorbed energy. The effect of brinelling deformation, which was considered as an advantage of striking edge geometry according to ASTM, is very small on instrumented Charpy impact test. Consequently, there seem to be not an advantage of striking edge geometry according to ASTM. Therefore, standards should be unified in the striking edge geometry according to ISO...|$|E
40|$|Accurate linear and {{nonlinear}} {{models for}} devices and components {{are essential for}} successful RF/microwave computer aided engineering (CAE). The modeling techniques can be categorized in different levels based on the abstraction of the model {{as well as the}} application of the models at various design phases. This dissertation deals with behavioral modeling techniques for nonlinear RF components, especially amplifiers. There is an increasing demand for accurate behavioral models of RF and microwave components, or integrated circuit (IC) blocks used in wireless system designs. Accurate behavioral models help designers evaluate and select the appropriate components at simulation phase, thereby cutting development cost. However, there isnt a practical (or flexible) solution for accurate and effective behavioral model generation. This dissertation tries to tackle this problem. Power amplifiers and devices are the main components studied in this dissertation. The primary focus is on the characterization of the loadpull performance of power amplifiers and devices. Major contributions of this dissertation include development of advanced loadpull measurement procedures, large-signal load-aware behavioral model, and a load-aware behavioral model with memory-effect capabilities. There are two advanced loadpull measurements documented in this dissertation: the AM-PM loadpull measurement and the digital demodulation loadpull measurement. These two measurements may have been used internally by some research groups, however, according to the best knowledge of the author, <b>they</b> <b>havent</b> received much attention in the literature. This is the first published work on these two topics. It is shown in this work that the AM-PM performance can be strongly dependent on the load conditions. This property provides important information about the nonlinearities of power amplifiers and is used herein to create better behavioral models. This newly developed digital demodulation loadpull measurement procedure enables system designers to evaluate power amplifiers directly against digital communication system parameters such as error vector magnitude (EVM). Two example measurements are given to demonstrate the measurement system setup and the correlations between traditional nonlinear figure-of-merits and system metrics. A new behavioral modeling technique / procedure is developed based on loadpull AM-AM and AM-PM measurements. The large-signal scattering function theory is applied in the technique to formulate the model. The created model is able to automatically detect the load impedance and generate corresponding nonlinear properties. Three example models are presented to demonstrate the capability of this technique to predict accurately the output power contours, 50 ohm large-signal S 21, and 3 rd order intermodulation products (through additional file-based model). Finally, a modeling technique is demonstrated to enable predicting the linear memory effect within a varying load condition. The nonlinear block used in the traditional two-box model structure is replaced with the large-signal loadpull model mentioned above. By adding this new feature, the resulting model is able to predict the load-related AM-AM and AM-PM properties, which will improve the accuracy of ACPR prediction...|$|E

This {{study is}} {{presented}} as a graduate thesis, The slag is assessed by its usage as an aggregate bituminous treated base, taking into account of basic criterias specified in Republic of Turkey General Directorate of Highways Technical Specification 2013. Enverimental problem showed up with industrial revolution. Although people are increasing their startdart of life economically by developtment of industry and technology, eart start to get a sick by polluted. As long as we arent stop this chaos, our resersours will be finish. So we will engaged to local wars, uncoordinated industrialization, famisment and disturp natural balance. As long as we can recycling to plastics, paper, some fossil oil products, rocks etc. As far as we know collection, transportation, transaction and disposal of waste materials are part of waste management.   In 2014, 1636 million ton steel are produce in the world, besides 34 million tonnes steel are produce in Turkey. Nearly 130 – 150 kg slag have been released druring producing 1 ton steel. As long as calculate slag producing, approximately 5, 1 million tonnes slag have been released every year in Turkey.   In our country, the place of construction sector in economy is incrasing gradually. Following that the demand of materials used in the construction sector is also incrasing. Also pavement construction is more consume natural resources than other branches of civil engineering. Huge quantities of natural materiales, rocks, fossil oil and sand are constructed into kilometers of constructed roads or in reconstruction of fault roads. Given the limited resources of our country,as in many areas the recycling of waste materials to useful resources is beneficial to both environment and minimization of the production costs.   As far as we know, we are using huge of amount of aggregate in the construction sector. Every year we are using million tonnes aggregate for built something. If we can give some example, need of aggregate for hospital building is 2, 800 tones, for a hotel building is 1, 100 tones and for 1 km highway construction is 30, 000 tones. This example show us how much aggregate we are using in order construction. Acording to not reduce aggregate amount, we can change aggregate materials. Every year we are {{spent a lot of money}} for road building. As far as we know aggregate is huge amount in budget of road building. If we can replace natural aggregate to blast furnace slag, electic ark furnace slag or basic oxygen furnace slag, we can save our natural resource and our money. Blast furnace slag, electic ark furnace slag and basic oxygen furnace slag are stocked as wasted materials. However, <b>they</b> <b>havent</b> a classification. If goverment and some big firm are deal for useage such kind of slag, it will be helpful our natural resources and enverimental polluted.
