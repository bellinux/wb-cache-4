25|$|At {{the same}} time as Cohen was working on Karl Marx's Theory of History, American {{economist}} John Roemer was employing neoclassical economics {{in order to try to}} defend the Marxist concepts of exploitation and class. In his A General Theory of Exploitation and Class (1982), Roemer employed rational choice and game theory in order to demonstrate how exploitation and class relations may arise in the development of a market for labour. Roemer would go on to reject the idea that the labour theory of value was necessary for explaining exploitation and class. Value was in principle capable of being explained in terms of any class of commodity inputs, such as oil, wheat, etc., rather than being exclusively explained by embodied labour power. Roemer was led to the conclusion that exploitation and class were thus generated not in the sphere of production but of market exchange. Significantly, as a purely <b>technical</b> <b>category,</b> exploitation did not always imply a moral wrong (see section Justice below).|$|E
