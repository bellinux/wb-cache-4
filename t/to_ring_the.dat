Before the 2003 season Sörenstam took the {{opportunity}} to improve her culinary skills by working eight-hour shifts in the kitchens of the Lake Nona Country Club. Sörenstam has had a serious interest in investments, real estate and the stock market since she earned her first LPGA check and in August 2006 was invited <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Rhodes left school, aged 16, he had joined Kirkheaton Cricket Club {{and started to}} take cricket seriously: he watched Yorkshire when they played close to his home and began to {{consider}} {{a career as a}} professional cricketer. Around 1893 he took a job working on the railway in the local town of Mirfield. By now playing regularly for Kirkheaton Second XI, Rhodes's keenness to reach one game on time led him <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> off-duty bell {{before the end of the}} shift and as a result he lost his job. Subsequently, he worked on a local farm, which allowed him more time for cricket. By 1895 he achieved a place in the Kirkheaton first team, and was recommended to Gala Cricket Club, of Galashiels, Scotland, as a professional.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match was}} for the WWE Championship between Champion John Cena and CM Punk. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon had {{threatened}} to have Cena fired if Punk won. During the match, two separate signature Attitude Adjustment moves by Cena failed to score the victory. More than 30 minutes into the match, Punk performed his Go to Sleep maneuver, striking Cena's ribs and causing Cena {{to fall out of}} the ring. As Punk rolled Cena back into the ring, McMahon and John Laurinaitis emerged from backstage and distracted Punk, resulting in Cena placing Punk in the STF submission hold. Punk did not submit, but McMahon signaled the referee to award Cena the match and sent Laurinaitis <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> bell. This was reminiscent of the Montreal Screwjob in 1997, where a conspiracy orchestrated by McMahon led to Bret Hart losing his WWF Championship to Shawn Michaels by submission despite Hart never submitting.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{story about the}} {{cracking}} of the bell is that it happened when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the Chief Justice of the United States, John Marshall. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, {{announced that he had}} ascertained the truth of the story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding the crack in the bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming Lafayette on his return to the United States in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British Catholic Relief Act 1829, and that some boys had been invited <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> bell, and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, the Chapel Bell {{has served}} as an {{athletic}} tradition at the University of Georgia. The ringing of the Chapel Bell after a Georgia victory is a tradition that has endured since the 1890s. In Georgia football's early days, the playing field was located only yards from the chapel, and first-year students were compelled <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> bell until midnight in celebration of a Bulldog victory. Today, students, alumni, fans and townspeople still rush to the Chapel <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> bell after a victory. The bell is also utilized for University meetings and events, weddings and remembrance ringing. The bell was rung in memory of victims of the September 11th attacks in 2001. After the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, the University of Georgia partook in a nationwide mourning by ringing the Chapel Bell {{in honor of the}} victims of the shooting.|$|E

25|$|SodaStream International Ltd. {{went public}} on the NASDAQ stock {{exchange}} in November 2010. The stock offering was jointly led by J.P. Morgan Securities and Deutsche Bank Securities. At the time, the IPO was the eighth largest for an Israeli company on the NASDAQ and during the year 2010 one of the top-performing IPOs generally. To celebrate SodaStream's listing on the NASDAQ, CEO Daniel Birnbaum was invited <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> exchange's closing bell on 3 November 2010. By August 2011, SodaStream's market cap had risen from $367 million to $1.46 billion. During 2012, the stock experienced aggressive growth, with earnings per share growing 57%. In June 2013, Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist incorrectly predicted a $2 billion Pepsi takeover of SodaStream, sending SODA stock higher before the rumours were promptly debunked by PepsiCo.|$|E
25|$|As on-air WCW President, Flair began abusing {{his power}} much like Bischoff had, favoring villains over fan {{favorites}} and even awarding the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship (which was vacated by Scott Steiner due to injury) {{to his son}} David and resorting to whatever means necessary to keep him as United States Heavyweight Champion. Flair eventually formed a stable of followers which included Roddy Piper, Arn Anderson and the Jersey Triad to keep things in order. Flair's reign as president {{came to an end}} on the July 19 episode of Nitro, when he faced and lost to Sting for the position. During the course of the match, Sting had Flair in his Scorpion Death Lock, but with the referee knocked unconscious, no decision could be reached. A returning Eric Bischoff came to the ring and began ordering the timekeeper <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> bell, which he eventually did, awarding the match and the presidency to Sting (who promptly gave it up upon receiving it).|$|E

25|$|The New Inn {{situated}} about 100 metres to {{the east}} of the Corinthian Arch. Built in 1717 specifically to provide accommodation for visitors to the gardens, the red brick Inn included a mini brewery where barley was brewed into beer, a farm and dairy. The Inn closed in the 1850s, it then being used as a farm, smithy and kennels for deer hounds. The building was purchased in a ruinous condition by the National Trust in 2005. In 2010 work started on converting it into the new visitor centre, and since 2011 this has been the entrance for visitors to the gardens. They formerly used The Oxford Gates. The New Inn is linked by the Bell Gate Drive to the Bell Gate next {{to the east}}ern Lake Pavilion, so called because visitors had <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> bell by the gate to gain admittance to the Garden.|$|E
25|$|Next was a Last Man Standing {{match between}} Kane and Shane McMahon. Before the match began, McMahon {{attacked}} Kane, {{who was doing}} his entrance, with a steel chair. As the referee officially called <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> bell to start the match, Kane pushed McMahon away to block another chair shot. After multiple shots with the chair, McMahon targeted Kane's knee using the ring post. Later, Kane attempted to perform a big boot on McMahon, but he accidentally hit the referee. After back and forth action, Kane attempted a Tombstone Piledriver onto the steel steps on McMahon but McMahon countered into a bulldog and performed a Coast-to-Coast into the steel steps, which were positioned against Kane. In the end, McMahon attempted a Leap of Faith, {{from the top of}} the arena TitanTron, which was roughly 25 feet tall. but Kane moved and McMahon fell through the floor. Kane won the match when McMahon did not stand up in time to answer the referee's 10 count.|$|E
25|$|Major {{additions}} {{have been}} made to the buildings through the centuries, and Wolsey's Great Quadrangle was crowned with the famous gate-tower designed by Sir Christopher Wren. To this day the bell in the tower, Great Tom, is rung 101 times at 9pm at the former Oxford time (9:05pm GMT/BST) every night, for the 100 original scholars of the college (plus one added in 1664). In former times this was done at midnight, signalling the close of all college gates throughout Oxford. Since it took 20minutes <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> 101, Christ Church gates, unlike those of other colleges, did not close until 12:20. When the ringing was moved back to 9:00pm, Christ Church gates still remained open until 12.20, 20minutes later than any other college. Although the clock itself now shows GMT/BST, Christ Church still follows Oxford time in the timings of services in the cathedral.|$|E

25|$|Many years later, a 12-year-old Digory Kirke and {{his friend}} Polly Plummer arrive {{in the ruins of}} Charn through Digory's uncle's magic.

Jadis is awakened and by holding on to them is transported with them back to London in the year 1900. She initially aims to conquer the world to which she is transported, but finds that her magic does not work there. Digory, seeking to correct his mistake, attempts to transport her back to Charn, but they end up instead in the world of Narnia at the moment of its creation by the lion Aslan. As Aslan approaches, she attacks him with the rod of iron she has torn by main strength from a London lamp post; but when this has no effect, she flees.|$|E
25|$|The final straw for the Tramways came on 29 April 1960 when {{a number}} 131 tram {{was struck by}} a lorry near the {{intersection}} of Elizabeth and Warrick Streets. The brakes failed {{as a result of the}} collision and the tram began to roll backwards down the step gradient of Elizabeth Street during evening peak hour traffic. Despite being dazed by the collision, and rather than secure his own safety by jumping clear, tram conductor Raymond Donoghue guided the remaining passengers to the front of the vehicle as it was rolling backwards, and warned motorists by continuing <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> <b>the</b> tram's bells and desperately trying to operate the emergency hand brakes to no avail. It is estimated that the tram built up a speed of 40 to 50 miles per hour (64 to 80km/ph). The tram collided with the front of the following number 137 tram, killing Donoghue instantly. He remained vigilantly at his post throughout the disaster and in his heroism, he saved the lives of all of the passengers aboard, although 40 people were injured. Raymond Donoghue was awarded the George Cross posthumously for his actions.|$|E
