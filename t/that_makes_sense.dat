25|$|Convection in {{a liquid}} or gas {{is another example}} of {{emergent}} macroscopic behaviour <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> only when considering differentials of temperature. Convection cells, particularly Bénard cells, are an example of a self-organizing system (more specifically, a dissipative system) whose structure is determined both by the constraints of the system and by random perturbations: the possible realizations of the shape and size of the cells depends on the temperature gradient as well as the nature of the fluid and shape of the container, but which configurations are actually realized is due to random perturbations (thus these systems exhibit a form of symmetry breaking).|$|E
25|$|Bennet becomes {{frustrated}} after Isaac {{is unable}} to paint something <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> to him. When Eden protests his actions, Bennet shows her a series of photographs depicting Sylar's dead victims—all with their brains removed from their heads—and says {{he is determined to}} save his daughter from such a fate. He orders Eden to go to the homecoming game and look for Sylar and grounds Claire to prevent her from being killed. Bennet discovers later, however, that Claire snuck out and worriedly runs to the school to find her. When he arrives, he is too late to stop Sylar from attacking the cheerleader in the pictures. Bennet soon discovers that the victim was not Claire; rather, it was Jackie Wilcox, one of Claire's fellow cheerleaders. A relatively relieved Bennet soon reunites with his daughter and insists they go home while the police handle things. Claire says that she has something to tell her father regarding her uncanny survival.|$|E

500|$|In 1596, despite {{not having}} access to a proper music fount, Barley (using the {{services}} of Danter and his wood blocks) published The Pathway to Music, a music theory book, and A New Booke of Tabliture, a tutor for the lute and related instruments that included compositions by John Dowland, Philip Rosseter, and Anthony Holborne. Both featured numerous errors, and for the latter, Barley {{seems not to have}} gained prior publishing approval from the composers. Dowland disowned A New Booke of Tabliture, calling his lute lessons [...] "falce and unperfect", while Holborne complained of [...] "corrupt coppies" [...] of his work being presented by a [...] "meere stranger". Modern musicologists have labelled the publication [...] "exasperating" [...] and [...] "seedy". Morley criticised The Pathway to Music, stating that the author should be [...] "ashamed of his labour", and that [...] "ix est in toto pagina sana libro" [...] ("there is scarcely a page <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> in the whole book"). Despite their flaws, both works seem to have been instrumental in introducing music tutor books to the London market.|$|E

500|$|Several {{elements}} of the episode were highlighted for their implausibility. The arrival of New Directions in New York without having their songs already prepared received widespread condemnation, including from VanDerWerff and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson, and led Brown to write, [...] "there is absolutely no universe in which <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense.</b> At all. It was so logically unsound that it was distracting." [...] The notion that Rachel would not know that Cats had closed eleven years before was derided by Brown and Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times, while Rachel and Kurt's encounter with [...] "the only friendly security guard in New York City" [...] was mocked by Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times and Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez. Several critics were disappointed that Quinn's ominous mention of plans for New York in [...] "Funeral" [...] came to nothing, including Benigno, who called her actual idea a [...] "cockamamie sabotage plot", though he credited Agron's scene as a [...] "great, wasted job in a great, wasted character", sentiments echoed by VanDerWerff and James Poniewozik of Time. Terron R. Moore of Ology.com gave the episode a [...] "C+", and likened Quinn's dropped plot to Will leaving for Broadway and Rachel disowning her love for Finn: [...] "the fact {{that none of this}} happened—and the fact that we know none of it would ever happen—is just another issue I have with the show.

First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense.</b> It's interesting, because everyone around him is pretty much lying, and Fen {{is supposed to be the}} crazy one.

[...] He also stated that [...] "as an actor, it's fun to go out of control", saying: [...] "As an actor, it’s fun when you’re out of control, and you don’t even know you’re acting. Like, literally, you just escape. And I got to feel that. And I’ve had numerous times on this show where I’ve gotten to be out of control, and it’s a really nice feeling. It’s exhilarating." [...] He also revealed that he had been listening to the music of John Mayer and Bruno Mars to get into Fenmore's head space. Ehrich also conceded that he didn't want Fenmore to go [...] "too far", saying: [...] "He's a really troubled kid who is just trying to find his way in life. He's not evil.

2500|$|Young Earth creationists {{generally}} hold that, when Genesis {{describes the}} creation of the Earth occurring over a period of days, this indicates normal-length 24 hour days, and cannot reasonably be interpreted otherwise. They agree that the Hebrew word for [...] "day" [...] (yôm) can refer to either a 24-hour day or a long or unspecified time; but argue that, whenever the latter interpretation is used, it includes a preposition defining the long or unspecified period. In the specific context of Genesis 1, since the days are both numbered and are referred to as [...] "evening and morning", this can mean only normal-length days. Further, they argue that the 24-hour day is the only interpretation <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> of the Sabbath command in Exodus 20:8–11.
