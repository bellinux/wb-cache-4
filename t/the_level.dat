5|$|As a {{workaround}} many {{policy makers}} try to restore competitiveness through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims {{to reduce its}} unit labour costs. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more to <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy have hit a 25-year low and consumption has fallen to <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of 1950.|$|E
5|$|As players {{walk through}} <b>the</b> <b>level,</b> they are stopped by groups of enemies {{who must be}} {{defeated}} before they can continue. <b>The</b> <b>level</b> ends when all the enemies are defeated. Each level contains many identical groups of enemies, making these games notable for their repetition. In beat 'em up games, players often fight a boss—an enemy much stronger than the other enemies—at {{the end of each}} level.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million years ago to present). Initial volcanism began on {{the summit of the}} volcano, depositing lava in and adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>Level</b> Mountain Range. This activity is indirectly dated as Pleistocene age , on the bases of the presence of subglacial and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and <b>the</b> <b>Level</b> Mountain Range, was volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{studied the}} relationship between <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of Participation in Decision Making and <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of Organizational Health. In collecting the information, thirty four full-time teachers in a Catholic school in Yogyakarta Indonesia are asked to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of participation they actually have experienced. The gap between <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of participation they wanted and <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of participation they actually have experienced express their levels of satisfaction to their levels of participation. Moreover, the teacher respondents are also asked to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of Organizational Health they perceived. The result of the study show that <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of participation, both teachers' desired participation and actual participation are not always significantly correlated to <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of Organizational Health they perceive. Such significant relationship between <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of participation and <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of Organizational Health only occur {{in some areas of}} decision making and some dimensions of Organizational Health. In addition, satisfied teachers and dissatisfied teachers are not always different in their perception of <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> of Organizational Health. Such significant differences only occur in some areas for decision making and some dimensions of Organizational Health...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} formal {{framework}} for feature interaction. The framework consists of three levels: <b>the</b> requirement <b>level,</b> <b>the</b> specification <b>level,</b> and <b>the</b> implementation <b>level.</b> At <b>the</b> requirement <b>level</b> we define interaction as inconsistency between feature requirements. At the specification and implementation level we define interaction as a relative notion. Interaction at <b>the</b> specification <b>level</b> is defined relative to the requirements the feature specifications are expected to satisfy. Interaction at <b>the</b> implementation <b>level</b> is defined relative to both the requirements and the specifications the implementations of the features are supposed to realize. We identify an interaction as originating from one (and only one) of <b>the</b> three <b>levels.</b> Also, we show that interactions may be inherited from <b>the</b> requirement <b>level</b> to <b>the</b> specification <b>level</b> and from <b>the</b> specification <b>level</b> to <b>the</b> implementation <b>level.</b> <b>The</b> final part of the paper contains an outline of how absence of feature interaction can be tested for at <b>the</b> implementation <b>level...</b>|$|R
5|$|The game {{also has}} a {{competitive}} mode, where two players compete against each other to the finish line, as either Sonic or Tails, in a split-screen race through three of the regular levels and a special stage. After one player finishes one of the regular levels, the other player must finish the zone within 60 seconds, or <b>the</b> <b>level</b> ends instantly. In the regular levels, players are ranked in five areas (score, time, rings held {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>level,</b> total rings collected, and the number of item boxes broken). The player with wins in the most number of categories wins <b>the</b> <b>level.</b> In the Special Stage, players compete to obtain the most rings. The mode ends when all stages have been completed, or if a player loses all their lives, in which their opponent will automatically win.|$|E
