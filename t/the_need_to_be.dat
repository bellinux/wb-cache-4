Geoffrey Watling, who was to become club Chairman and after whom a stand at the club's stadium, Carrow Road is named, was instrumental in saving the club from bankruptcy, both in the 1950s and 1990s; his father had played a similar role in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Design 1047, {{also known}} as Project 1047, {{was a series of}} plans for a class of Dutch battlecruisers prior to the Second World War. The ships were {{intended}} to counter a perceived threat posed by Imperial Japanese aggression to the Dutch colonies in the East Indies. Dutch intelligence believed that the Imperial Japanese Navy would deploy its capital ships (aircraft carriers and battleships) against their counterparts of the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy, leaving heavy and light cruisers, along with seaplane carriers, as the largest ships available for an advance into the East Indies. As such, the 1047s were shaped by <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to fight their way through a fleet composed of these ships and smaller destroyers. It was hoped that this capability would allow the battlecruisers to act as a fleet in being.|$|E

The candidate quoted former Secretary of State Colin Powell reflecting <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sure the intelligence was correct, to deploy the right amount of troops and to make sure that an exit strategy was planned.

NGL's approach to activism was that of being an Internet-only gay rights organization using its membership to send activism e-mails, letters to the editor and forum postings. After a year of being a chapter of NGL, the state chapter became independent, still keeping their name, because it felt <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> active beyond Internet activism, felt the $25 membership dues should not be sent for nationwide activities and disagreed with a recent protest action discouraging users from using AOL.|$|E

The assets left by expellees in Poland and Czechoslovakia were successfully used to reward cooperation with the new governments, {{and support for the}} Communists was especially strong in areas that had seen significant expulsions.

25|$|Although, {{according}} to textual scholars, {{the only source}} texts among those comprising the Torah which mention the shewbread are the Holiness Code and later additions to the priestly source, the antiquity of the practice is shown by its mention in the Books of Samuel which textual scholars generally view as predating the priestly source. In the Books of Samuel, Ahimelek is described as asking for an assurance that David's men were in a ritually pure state, namely {{that they had not}} been involved in sexual activity with women, before handing over the old shewbread; biblical scholars view this as suggesting that the showbread was originally a sacrificial meal which was viewed as being shared with the deity, hence <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ritually pure, and the bread not being burnt but instead consumed.|$|E
25|$|TransLink's SkyTrain {{service area}} {{is divided into}} three zones, with fares varying {{depending}} on how many zone boundaries are crossed during one trip (two- and three-zone passengers are charged the one zone rate after 6:30 pm rush hour, and on weekends and statutory holidays). Customers may purchase fares using cash, debit cards, or credit cards from self-serve ticket vending machines at the mezzanine level of each station. A variety of transit passes are available, such as the pre-paid FareSaver ticket, daily DayPass, monthly FareCard, annual EmployerPass, post-secondary student U-Pass, and other specialized passes. Canadian National Institute for the Blind identification cards are accepted without <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> read by the fare box.

Even though still married to JR, Babe starts to have romantic {{feelings}} for Josh and feels <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{there for him}} when Dr. Greg Madden (the man he believes to be his father) goes missing. Babe supports Josh, talks him down, and tries {{to be there for}} him as a friend. When it is found that Greg Madden has died due to being buried alive underground for weeks, Babe sticks by Josh and seeks to help him through this. This enrages JR, causing more problems for their marriage. Due to the lack of communication, JR's murder attempt on her, their increased fighting, the Greg Madden murder mystery looming over their heads, and the search for Kate (JR's long-lost sister), JR and Babe begin shutting down on one another. This leads Babe to turn to Josh, confiding in him even more and spending more time with him.|$|E
