2500|$|A third {{controversy}} concerns persons (whether born Jews or {{converts to}} Judaism) who have converted to another religion. The traditional view is such persons remain Jewish. Reform Judaism regards such people as apostates, and states regarding Messianic Jews: [...] "'Messianic Jews' {{claim that they}} are Jews, but we must asked [...] ourselves whether we identify them as Jews. We can not do so as they consider Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah who has fulfilled the Messianic promises. In this way, they have clearly placed themselves within Christianity. They may be somewhat different from other Christians as they follow various Jewish rites and ceremonials, but <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> them Jews." [...] Regardless, such people do not count as Jewish {{for the purposes of}} the Israeli citizenship laws.|$|E
2500|$|After Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, Powell {{claimed that}} since Britain {{was not an}} ally of Kuwait in the [...] "formal sense" [...] and because {{the balance of power}} in the Middle East had ceased to be a British concern after the end of the British Empire, Britain should not go to war. Powell claimed that [...] "Saddam Hussein has a long way to go yet before his troops come {{storming}} up the beaches of Kent or Sussex". On 21 October, he wrote, [...] "The world is full of evil men engaged in doing evil things. <b>That</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> us policemen to round them up nor judges to find them guilty and to sentence them. What is so special about the ruler of Iraq that we suddenly discover that we are to be his jailers and his judges?... we as a nation have no interest in the existence or non-existence of Kuwait or, for that matter, Saudi Arabia as an independent state. I sometimes wonder if, when we shed our power, we omitted to shed our arrogance".|$|E
2500|$|In {{analyzing}} {{the character of}} Rose, Clive Barnes described her as [...] "bossy, demanding, horrific". [...] Rich described Rose as [...] "a monster". Critic Walter Kerr commented that though Rose is a monster, she must be liked and understood. Patti LuPone describes Rose: [...] "She has tunnel vision, she's driven, and she loves her kids.... And she is a survivor. [...] I do not see her as a monster at allshe may do monstrous things, but <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> a monster." [...] Sondheim has said of the character: [...] "The fact that she's monstrous to her daughters {{and the world is}} secondary... She's a very American character, a gallant figure and a life force." [...] Sondheim also noted, [...] "Yet the end of Gypsy is not entirely bleak. Louise comes out a star and forgives her mother. [...] There is hope for her. [...] Rose does confront who she is in 'Rose's Turn.' There is a catharsis. It's not Rodgers and Hammerstein, but you feel maybe the mother and daughter will come to an understanding and maybe triumph over Rose's craziness and Louise's bitterness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Obama {{has said}} that the death penalty is used too {{frequently}} and inconsistently. However, he favors it for cases in which [...] "the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage." [...] Speaking as a state senator about the Illinois legislature's constant additions to the list of factors that render a defendant eligible for the death penalty, Obama said, [...] "We certainly don't think that we should [...] have this laundry list <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> any distinctions between the run-of-the-mill armed robbery that results in death and systematic killings by a terrorist organization. And I think essentially what the reduction of aggravating factors does is, it says, 'Here's a narrower set of crimes that we think potentially at least could deserve the death penalty.'" [...] In his own words, [...] "While the evidence tells me that the death penalty does little to deter crime; I believe there are some crimes – mass murder, the rape and murder of a child – so heinous that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment. On the other hand, the way capital cases were tried in Illinois at the time was so rife with error, questionable police tactics, racial bias, and shoddy lawyering, that 13 death row inmates had been exonerated." ...|$|E
