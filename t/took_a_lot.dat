5|$|Kemp's {{ankle injury}} <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> longer to heal {{than had been}} expected, and the team {{reported}} that they hoped {{to get him back}} in September. However, when he finally began his minor league rehab assignment at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga in late August, he struggled at the plate and his return date was pushed back. He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.|$|E
5|$|American Gangster premiered in New York on October 20, 2007, and was {{released}} in the United States and Canada on November 2. The film was well received by most film critics, and grossed over US$266.5 million worldwide, with domestic grosses standing at $130.1 million. Many of the people portrayed, including Roberts and Lucas, have stated that the film <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of creative license with the story, and three former DEA agents sued Universal claiming the agency's portrayal was demoralizing. American Gangster was nominated for twenty-one awards, including two Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Supporting Actress (Ruby Dee), and won three including a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role for Dee.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} half of I-35E in {{the metro}} area <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> longer to build. Its first section—a short stretch from MN110 north to State Highway 5, including the Lexington Bridge over the Mississippi River—opened in the mid-1960s. Even though the connecting piece of I-35W and I-35 at the southern terminus of I-35E in Burnsville opened in the mid-1960s, {{it was not until the}} mid-1980s that I-35E was completed south of MN110 at Mendota Heights and southbound through Eagan and Apple Valley, where there had been a missing link of I-35E for 20years. Construction was delayed by opposition from nearby residents in Burnsville and from environmentalists over the proposed alignment across Blackhawk Lake. The final plan involved a new alignment avoiding the lake, as well as a less complicated interchange at I-494 in Mendota Heights, eliminating access to MN55 that was part of the earlier plans.|$|E

This strong domestic form resulted in him making his international breakthrough in the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup.|$|E

The Intertoto and UEFA Cup expedition <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> out of the players – but the team started the season sharper than the others, resulting in a comfortable upper-midtable position by the halfway point of the season. Tiredness, loss of form and a build-up of injuries resulted in a slide downwards towards the end of the season, eventually resulting in a ninth-place finish and a third consecutive year in the top half.|$|E
25|$|Delicate {{sounds and}} fine overtones were mostly lost, because it <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of sound energy to vibrate the {{recording}} horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism. There were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances {{in both the}} recording and playback system. Some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances. Even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment sounds like it was recorded through a horn, notwithstanding a reduction in distortion because of the modern playback. Toward {{the end of the}} acoustic era, there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns.|$|E
25|$|In January 1877 the Managing Committee {{decided to}} start a daily {{register}} noting animal habits and behaviour in the zoo on a day to day log book basis. Sanyal was chosen to assist three Europeans including Carl Louis Schwendler, one of the honorary governors who donated animals from his menagerie to form the zoo's nucleus. Sanyal <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of notes and referred to the existing literature of the time, mainly to T. C. Jerdon's Animals of India and Birds of India. Some of Sanyal's duties were lightened when an additional gardener was recruited during this period.|$|E

On 15 March, when Morazan and his army {{were on their way to}} occupy their previous positions, they were intercepted by federal troops in Las Charcas. However, Morazan had a better position and smashed the federal army. The battle field was left full of corpses, while the allies <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of prisoners and weaponry. the allies continued to recapture their old positions in San José Pinula and Aceituno, and place Guatemala City under siege once again. General Verveer, Ambassador from the King of Netherlands and Belgium before the Central American government and who was in Guatemala to negotiate the construction of a transoceanic Canal in Nicaragua, tried to mediate between the State of Guatemala and Morazán, but did not succeed. Military operations continued, with great success for the allies.|$|E

Ramsbottom added, [...] "Tom <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of chances. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of it [...] I remember him taking a course of strychnine to build up to some big event.
