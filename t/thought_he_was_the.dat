25|$|Doug Wright {{was seen}} as England's trump card {{when he arrived in}} Australia, but he was either the unluckiest or the most over-rated spinner to tour Australia. Don Bradman said he was the best leg-spinner to tour Australia since Sydney Barnes 35 years before, and Keith Miller <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best leg-spinner he knew after Bill O'Reilly. After Tich Freeman retired Wright became Kent's main spinner, taking 2,056 wickets (23.98) and a record seven first class hat-tricks. His long rollicking run up and brisk pace gave away many no-balls and too often he served up full tosses and long hops, but he turned the ball {{fiercely}} and his googly had even the best batsmen groping. His ability to run through a side made him the terror of the County circuit, but he rarely achieved this in Tests. In the Fifth Test at Sydney his 7/105 dismissed Australia for 253 and in 1947 his 10/175 in the Second Test gave England a 10 wicket victory over South Africa. His great asset was that he always looked as if he was about to take a wicket, but in Australia in 1946–47 and again in 1950–51 he proved too expensive and like Bedser was overbowled. Their second leg-spinner was Peter Smith, who was preferred to Eric Hollies because of his batting, but he injured a finger on the journey to Australia and had an appendix removed once there. Even so, he was effective in tour matches - his 9/121 against NSW is the best bowling return by an Englishman in Australia - but was understandably below par in his only Test. James Langridge was a veteran Slow Left Arm bowler who started his trade in 1924, and had taken 92 wickets (22.11) in 1946, but he was 41 years old on his first tour of Australia and just when he appeared to be finding his form he strained a muscle and could not play. Jack Ikin was a part-time leg-spinner whose bowling was thought to be of all round status early in his career (helped by the very poor wickets at Old Trafford), but Hammond used him rarely and he proved to be expensive in the Tests.|$|E

2500|$|The 79th {{running of}} the Tokyo Yushun took place over 2400 metres on firm ground at Tokyo on 27 May. World Ace headed the betting from Gold Ship with Deep Brillante third choice on 7.5/1.

2500|$|After {{the poor}} tour of Australia the {{previous}} year a revamped England team {{was taken to the}} Caribbean under the management of the forthright Walter Robins. Cowdrey was roped in to open the innings with Geoff Pullar as May <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best player of fast bowling. Even though it was not to Cowdrey's liking he made 491 runs (54.55) and two centuries. England won the Second Test by 256 runs despite play being held up by a riot, but May suffered an internal injury and had to go to hospital every morning before play. May soldiered on, but Cowdrey knew he would soon be in charge and was so affected by nerves before the Third Test that he [...] "would have given anything not to have played". To face the fast bowlers he wore rubber padding sewn into his shirt and recovered to make 114 and 97 despite Wes Hall taking 7/69 in England's first innings of 277, no one else making over 30. May had to fly home for treatment (and was unfit to play for 18 months) so Cowdrey took charge in the Fourth Test, winning the toss and top scoring with 65 in England's 295 as Hall took 6/90. The West Indies overtook this with 402, but Ted Dexter (110) and Raman Subba Row (100) saved the match. In the Fifth Test Brian Statham flew home to his sick son, but Cowdrey won the toss and again chose to bat, top scoring with 119 in England's 393.|$|E
2500|$|Strange as it {{may seem}} England had few qualms about the Australian bowling {{at the start of the}} series. Dennis Lillee and Bob Massie had been overbowled in 1972 and 1973 and had both broken down with {{crippling}} injuries, while Jeff Thomson – if they had heard of him – had taken 0/110 in his only Test. However, Lillee returned to Test cricket after considerable determination to overcome his injuries and though he lost a yard or two of pace he had lost none of his old venom and [...] "bowled with a hostility that bordered on savagery". His new bowling action was a text-book model and his straight arm gave him movement through the air and off the pitch that made him more dangerous than ever. But the real revelation was Thomson, whose javelin throw action gave him enormous pace and [...] "slung the ball down at sizzling pace, getting dangerous lift off a length, and not worrying overmuch where the ball landed" [...] In 1975–76 his bowling was clocked at 99.6mph compared to Lillee's 86.4 and his very inaccuracy made him dangerous, the batsmen never knew where the ball was going to land next. They were given wholehearted support by Max Walker, as fast-medium bowler whose awkward whirlwind bowling action gave him the nickname of Tangles. 6'4" [...] tall and as strong as a bull Walker was an accurate swing bowler and took 8/143 in the last Test when Lillee and Thomson were injured. Geoff Dymock was a left-arm swing bowler who struggled to keep his pace in a strong Australian team, but became the first Australian to dismiss all 11 opposition batsmen in a Test when he took 12/166 at Kanpur in 1979–80. Doug Walters was a part-time bowler, but his medium-paced [...] "Golden Arm" [...] was capable of breaking any partnership and he deserved to be regarded an all-rounder. Greg Chappell was also seen as an all-rounder in his youth, and continued to bowl throughout his Test career, but mainly to tie up one end while the other bowlers rested. The orthodox off-spinner Ashley Mallett could turn the ball very sharply. Tom Graveney <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> finest Australian off-spinner since the war and came second in the averages after Thomson. Historically Australian selectors preferred a leg-spinner, but Terry Jenner failed to hold his place and as fast-bowling rose in prominence the Australian 'leggie' became almost extinct.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with their}} batting Australia could muster {{a strong and}} varied bowling attack; Garth McKenzie (29.78), Dennis Lillee (23.92), Alan Connolly (29.22), Ashley Mallett (29.84), John Gleeson (36.20) and Terry Jenner (31.20) with all-rounders Doug Walters (29.08), Kerry O'Keeffe (38.20) and Greg Chappell (40.70). Unfortunately, they were seldom {{given the chance to}} settle into the team and only Gleeson of the regular bowlers played in five Tests. Garth McKenzie had been Australia's premier fast bowler in the 1960s, but had failed spectacularly in South Africa (averaging 333.00), was struck in the face by a John Snow bouncer at Sydney and retired from Test cricket to play for Ray Illingworth's Leicestershire as a professional. Alan Connolly had been a fast bowler in his youth, but slowed his pace to {{increase}} his accuracy and became a reliable support bowler. Alan Thomson - [...] "Froggie" [...] Thomson - was a fast-medium paceman with a [...] "strange, whirlwind, running-through sort of action" [...] in which he loosed the ball while both feet were in the air. He was a non-smoking, non-drinking, physical education teacher whose shaggy red hair make him look like a 'Wild Man of Borneo'. He frequently bounced the England batsmen, took 6/80 against the MCC for Victoria and was called up for the First Test. 'He can't last' predicted Richard Whitington, 'He doesn't even know where he's aiming', and he averaged 54.50 in the Tests. John Gleeson was a mystery bowler who used his bent middle finger to turn the ball either way, but lost control in search of variation and was punished by the England batsmen once they figured out his action. The more orthodox off-spinner Ashley Mallett could turn the ball very sharply and took 28 wickets (19.10) in India in 1969-70. Tom Graveney <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> finest Australian off-spinner since the war and he became the spinning arm of Ian Chappell's all-conquering Australians. Historically Australian selectors always preferred a leg-spinner and Kerry O'Keeffe and Terry Jenner vied for the place, but they never quite fulfilled their promise. Doug Walters was a part-time bowler, but his medium-paced [...] "Golden Arm" [...] was capable of breaking any partnership and he deserved to be regarded an all-rounder. Greg Chappell was also seen as an all-rounder in his youth, and continued to bowl throughout his Test career, but mainly to tie up one end while the other bowlers rested. The greatest Australian bowler of the next decade would be Dennis Lillee, but in 1970 he was a raw, undisciplined fast bowler who had yet to reach his full potential.|$|E
