5|$|As {{with the}} Mackensens, the three ships of the Ersatz Yorck class were never completed. This was {{primarily}} due to shifting wartime construction priorities; U-boats were deemed more important to Germany's war effort, and so work on other types of ships was slowed or halted outright. The lead ship, Ersatz Yorck, was the only vessel of the three to have construction begin, though she was over two years from completion by the <b>time</b> <b>work</b> was abandoned. With the hull incomplete, the ship could not be launched and towed to ship-breakers; as a result, Ersatz Yorck was broken up in situ.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} <b>time,</b> <b>work</b> was {{commissioned}} to precisely determine {{the mass of}} a cubic decimetre (one litre) of water. Although the decreed definition of the kilogram specified water at 0°C—its highly stable temperature point—the French chemist Louis Lefèvre-Gineau and the Italian naturalist Giovanni Fabbroni {{after several years of}} research chose to redefine the standard in 1799 to water's most stable density point: the temperature at which water reaches maximum density, which was measured at the time as 4°C.|$|E
5|$|By 1285, Caernarfon's town {{walls were}} mostly complete. At the same <b>time</b> <b>work</b> {{continued}} on the castle. Spending on construction was negligible from 1289 and accounts end in 1292. EdwardI's campaign of castle-building in Wales cost £80,000 between 1277 and 1304, and £95,000 between 1277 and 1329; by 1292 £12,000 had {{been spent on}} the construction of Caernarfon's castleof which the southern facade was furthest alongand town walls. As the southern wall and town walls completed a defensive circuit around Caernarfon, the plan was to build the castle's northern facade last.|$|E

5|$|By this <b>time</b> <b>work</b> {{had already}} begun on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it {{differed}} in form and in its beam steering system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E
5|$|The {{observation}} {{of a total}} solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, helped to confirm Einstein's theory of general relativity. By comparing the apparent distance between stars in the constellation Taurus, with and without the Sun between them, Arthur Eddington stated that the theoretical predictions about gravitational lenses were confirmed. The observation with the Sun between the stars was only possible during totality since the stars are then visible. Though Eddington's observations were near the experimental limits of accuracy at the <b>time,</b> <b>work</b> in the later half of the 20th century confirmed his results.|$|E
5|$|The three {{ships of}} the Ersatz Yorck class were {{originally}} ordered as Mackensen-class ships, but the design was modified in January 1917 {{to increase the}} armament to eight 38cm (15in) guns. The Ersatz Yorcks were otherwise similar to the Mackensens, {{with the exception of}} the funnels. The Ersatz Yorck-class ships were modified to trunk the two smoke uptakes of the previous design into one large funnel. Only the lead ship was laid down, and work did not proceed far; only about 1,000metric tons of steel had been assembled by the <b>time</b> <b>work</b> ceased. The other two ships were assigned to shipyards, but work never began.|$|E

5|$|At the <b>time</b> <b>work</b> stopped, Normandies hull was 65percent complete, her engines were 70percent complete, and her boilers were {{delivered}} but were instead installed in new destroyers. The turrets were 40percent assembled. Languedoc had 49percent of her hull and 73percent of her engines constructed; her boilers were 96percent complete and only 26percent of her turrets were built. The hulls of Flandre and Gascogne were 65 and 60percent complete, respectively, and their engines were 60 and 44percent assembled. Both of their sets of boilers {{were used for}} destroyers. The two ships' turrets were 51 and 75percent complete. Work on Béarn had not significantly progressed by the time war broke out: her hull was only 8–10percent complete and her engines were only 25percent finished. Her boilers were 17percent assembled, and her turrets were at 20percent.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau and Potsdam {{were to be}} renamed Jade and Elbe, respectively. Once converted, {{the ships}} were {{intended}} to operate twelve Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers and twelve Bf-109 fighters. Work on Jade was not started and the conversion project was abandoned in November 1942. She returned to service as a troopship, only to be sunk by a mine in the western Baltic. Elbe actually began the conversion process in December 1942, but only her passenger fittings were removed by the <b>time</b> <b>work</b> was halted in February 1943. She was converted into a barracks ship in Gotenhafen and seized by the United Kingdom {{after the end of}} the war. She remained in use until 1976, when she was broken up for scrap. A third ocean liner of the same class, , was purchased by the Imperial Japanese Navy and converted into the escort carrier Shin'yō. Shin'yō was torpedoed and sunk in the East China Sea by a United States Navy submarine.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, trade {{along the}} canal commenced; goods {{initially}} {{had to be}} unloaded at Foxhangers {{at the bottom of}} what is now Caen Hill Locks, transported up the hill by a horse-drawn railway, and reloaded into barges at the top. When the flight of locks opened in 1810, allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal, the rate of carriage per ton from London to Bath was £29s6d. This compared well with carriage by road, which cost £63s to £7 per ton, and trade on the canal flourished. In 1812, the Kennet and Avon Canal Company bought the Kennet Navigation, which stretched from Newbury to the junction with the Thames at Kennet Mouth, near Reading. The purchase from Frederick Page cost £100,000, of which £70,000 was paid in cash with the balance paid back gradually. The purchase was authorised by the Kennet Navigation Act of June 1813, which enabled the company to raise the funds through the sale of 5,500 shares at £24 each. At the same <b>time</b> <b>work</b> was undertaken to improve the Avon Navigation, from Bristol to Bath, with the Kennet and Avon Canal Company purchasing a majority shareholding in the Avon Navigation in 1816.|$|E

5|$|The ships, {{named after}} provinces of France, were never {{completed}} due to shifting production requirements after {{the outbreak of}} war in 1914. The first four ships were sufficiently advanced in construction to permit their launching to clear the shipyards for other, more important work. Many of the guns built for the ships were instead converted {{for use by the}} Army. After the war, the French Navy considered several proposals to complete the ships, either as originally designed or modernized to account for lessons from the war. The weak French post-war economy, however, necessitated that the first four ships be broken up for scrap. The last ship, which was not significantly advanced at the <b>time</b> <b>work</b> halted, was converted into an aircraft carrier in the 1920s. She remained in service in various capacities until the 1960s. The ship was ultimately scrapped in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the cathedral}} was {{designed}} by French architects, it exhibits a number of differences from the cathedrals of northern France. Above all, it is essentially constructed of brick rather than stone. Brick could easily be produced locally but stone had to be imported from the distant quarries of Gotland. As bricks and mortar are {{not as strong as}} stone, the walls had to be thicker although the pillars needed to support the vaulted ceiling of the chancel were made of limestone (although those in the nave are of brick). The north transept portal is also built of limestone, no doubt as it was needed to support the rose window, also structured in limestone itself. While the chancel and the transept are clearly of French design, the nave which was built somewhat later displays German and Swedish characteristics. Constructed in about 1330, the rose window over the northeast portal is still entirely French. Nicolaus from Västerås, the Swede who directed work on the nave from the 1360s, appears to have slightly modified the original plans, adding confessional side-chapels and including a few features of German origin. It {{is interesting to note that}} cross-vaults were nevertheless installed, rather than star-shaped vaults which were more common at the <b>time.</b> <b>Work</b> on the western end of the building began in 1431 with the construction of the west portal which was influenced by the style of Vadstena Abbey. The towers, however, still exhibited features typical of 13th-century French architecture, indicating that the original plans were still in use at the time. Overall, despite minor differences, Uppsala Cathedral still reflects the style of the 13th-century cathedrals of northern France.|$|E
