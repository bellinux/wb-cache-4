40|$|AbstractDuring {{environment}} testing, {{the estimation}} of random vibration signals (RVS) is an important technique for the airborne platform safety and reliability. However, the available methods including extreme value envelope method (EVEM), statistical tolerances method (STM) and improved statistical tolerance method (ISTM) require large samples and typical probability distribution. Moreover, the frequency-varying characteristic of RVS is usually not taken into account. Gray bootstrap method (GBM) is proposed to solve <b>the</b> problem of <b>estimating</b> frequency-varying RVS with small samples. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> indexes are obtained including <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> interval, <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> uncertainty, <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> value, <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> error and estimated reliability. In addition, GBM is applied to <b>estimating</b> <b>the</b> single flight testing of certain aircraft. At last, in order to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> performance, GBM is compared with bootstrap method (BM) and gray method (GM) in testing analysis. The result shows that GBM has superiority for estimating dynamic signals with small samples and estimated reliability is proved to be 100 % at the given confidence level...|$|R

5|$|Because {{it would}} be {{utilized}} in both directions, {{the capacity of the}} proposed interstate loop line would be equivalent, it is said, to two 2-track lines or one 4-track line from New Jersey to New York City due to its having two crossings between New Jersey and New York. The loop was said to be able to carry 192,500 passengers per hour, or 4.62million daily passengers, had it been built. <b>The</b> <b>estimate</b> was based on the operation of 35 trains per hour in each direction, and each train would be eleven cars long and would carry 100 passengers per car. It was to be built as a multi-phase project, wherein the IRT and BMT would work together to build that system to New Jersey. Extensions of the IRT Flushing Line and BMT Canarsie Line were both considered; the Canarsie Line was to be extended to Hoboken near the Palisades, while the Flushing Line was to be extended to Franklin Street between Boulevard and Bergenline Avenues in Union City.
