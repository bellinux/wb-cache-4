25|$|In June 1990 {{the police}} {{received}} a tip about Pintarić having {{been seen in}} Prosenik Začretski, near Zabok. <b>They</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Rudolf Belina, owner of a nearby cottage. A couple of days later, he was visited and shot dead by Pintarić, who thought Belina had betrayed him to the authorities. Shortly after that, Pintarić murdered Barbara Šipek's neighbor for having killed one of her chickens. His fifth and final victim was Božo Habek, shot dead on 2 August 1990 simply for asking the already paranoid Pintarić if {{he was looking for}} somebody.|$|E
25|$|At , Itami confronted Austin Aries, {{following}} the latter's match with No Way Jose, exchanging blows before attacking Aries with a GTS. On October 12 at an NXT live event, Itami suffered a neck injury after a botched powerslam from Riddick Moss {{and would not}} be able to team with Kota Ibushi in the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic in which he was scheduled to compete in. In a video announcement published on October 18, Itami vowed to return to in-ring competition at NXT's first show in Japan on December 3. However, at the event, Itami did not compete but was instead in an in-ring segment alongside William Regal where <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the crowd. Itami made his televised return on April 19, 2017, where he confronted NXT Champion Bobby Roode, before slapping him and executing a GTS. This led to a match at , in which Itami was unsuccessful in winning the title from Roode. On the June 7 episode of NXT, furious after his loss to Roode, Itami faced Oney Lorcan, which ended in a no-contest after Itami performed three GTS on Lorcan until Kassius Ohno attempted to save Lorcan, teasing a heel turn and a feud between the pair. On the July 5 episode of NXT, Itami teamed with Ohno in a tag team match against Sanity (Killian Dain and Alexander Wolfe), but lost after Itami refused to tag in Ohno. On the July 26 episode of NXT, Itami faced Ohno in the main event, which ended after Itami intentionally disqualified himself with a low blow to Ohno before viciously attacking and laying him out after two GTSs, followed by a 3rd onto the steel steps, cementing his heel turn.|$|E
500|$|Korn {{launched}} a political campaign-style tour {{to promote the}} release of Follow the Leader. The tour took the group, on a chartered jet, all over North America to help promote Follow the Leader. <b>They</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> fans and answered questions during special [...] "fan conferences", which were organized at every stop along the tour route, and signed autographs.

500|$|As {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy, who plays William Bell, was {{unavailable}} {{to shoot the}} brief conversation with Blair Brown's Nina Sharp, the producers knew {{they wanted to do}} something a little more creative for the scene. <b>They</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> cartoonist Frank Miller and hired a special effects school to do all the modeling, which they accomplished based on photos of Nimoy, because the actor could not come in to have his head scanned; he did some voicework however. The finished scene included an animated version of Nimoy's head, shown through the same window as the one used in [...] "Peter".|$|E
500|$|To mix the tracks, a Sony Oxford Console was used. Audio {{engineer}} Mick Guzauski {{explained to}} SoundByte {{that he used}} the console's [...] "Automated EQ feature" [...] on the tracks. He {{said that he could}} [...] "tailor the frequency responses and dynamics within each song with optimum equalizer at every pitch and level." [...] For the Afanasieff tracks, the background vocals and overdubs were accomplished on the Oxford console at his Wally World StudioB, at San Rafael, California. Simpson's label-mate and Latin singer Marc Anthony is featured as a guest vocalist on the ballad [...] "There You Were". Simpson met Anthony at the taping of the TV special A Christmas in Washington in 2000. <b>They</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> each other, and proposed recording a song on both of their next albums. They sang the song {{side by side in the}} studio and the whole song was completed within six hours. [...] "Forever in Your Eyes" [...] was one of the first songs to be recorded for the album, and was produced by Rhett Lawrence. It was recorded at Sony Music Studios within two hours. Rodney Jerkins, who was acquainted with Mottola, produced two cuts on Irresistible. In an interview with Sony Music Japan, Simpson said that she never met Jerkins in person. He produced and recorded the songs' music and sent the tape to Columbia, from which [...] "Imagination" [...] and [...] "I Never" [...] were selected. Cory Rooney produced Simpson's vocals and Tony Maserati mixed the vocals. Initially, Simpson did not want to record [...] "What's It Gonna Be" [...] as she felt the line [...] "Are you gonna be a dog or a gentleman" [...] was a little awkward. However, due to her record label's persuasion, she recorded the song and ultimately became fond of it. In order to record the title track, Simpson traveled to Murlyn Music Studios, in Sweden. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was produced by Ric Wake; although he produced many songs for the album, only [...] "A Little Bit" [...] made the final cut. The Japanese version of the album contains a bonus track—the Hex Hector remix of [...] "Irresistible"—for which Simpson re-recorded her vocals.|$|E

Breslin rejected his story of Satanic cult accomplices, stating that [...] "when <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> David Berkowitz that night, he recalled everything {{step by step}} by step.

2500|$|Children who {{received}} supportive responses following disclosure had less traumatic symptoms and were abused for a shorter {{period of time}} than children who did not receive support. In general, {{studies have found that}} children need support and stress-reducing resources after disclosure of sexual abuse. Negative social reactions to disclosure {{have been found to be}} harmful to the survivor’s well being. One study reported that children {{who received}} a bad reaction from the first person they told, especially if the person was a close family member, had worse scores as adults on general trauma symptoms, post traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and dissociation. [...] Another study found that in most cases when children did disclose abuse, the person <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> did not respond effectively, blamed or rejected the child, and took little or no action to stop the abuse. Non-validating and otherwise non-supportive responses to disclosure by the child's primary attachment figure may indicate a relational disturbance predating the sexual abuse that may have been a risk factor for the abuse, and which can remain a risk factor for its psychological consequences.|$|E
