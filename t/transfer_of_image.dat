However, {{the openness of}} these networks poses {{a serious threat to}} the security of image information. The field of image encryption has drawn attention for this reason. In this paper, the concepts of 1 -dimensional DNA cellular automata and T-DNA cellular automata are defined, and the concept of reversible T-DNA cellular automata is introduced. An efficient approach to encryption involving reversible T-DNA cellular automata as an encryption tool and natural DNA sequences as the main keys is here proposed. The results of a simulation experiment, performance analysis, and comparison to other encryption algorithms showed this algorithm to be capable of resisting brute force attacks, statistical attacks, and differential attacks. It also enlarged the key space enormously. It meets the criteria for one-time pad and resolves the problem that one-time pad is difficult to save...|$|E

Building on the SPIN protocol for metadata negotiation, we designed SPIN-IT (Sensor Protocols for Information via Negotiation- Image Transfer), a protocol where wireless imaging devices use metadata queries to retrieve desired pictures.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} key {{determinants}} of positive consumer behaviour to sponsorships. Using the consumer {{decision making process}} and classical conditioning principles as an underpinning framework, this thesis examines consumer perceptions of a sponsor, sponsored property and sponsorship activity relative to a consumer’s intent to purchase a sponsor’s product or service. The purchase intent of consumers is analysed as an outcome of five significant constructs: event factors, sponsor factors, sponsorship factors, a pre-purchase response and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>image</b> values. Intent to purchase is evaluated as the antecedent to purchase, however, both economic and non-economic outcomes are considered in this study as pivotal to encouraging positive consumer behaviour. A multi-method approach involved the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data. Focus groups established the scope of research followed by the distribution of multi-item surveys {{to members of the}} public from regional and metropolitan areas of Victoria, Australia. By selecting Australian Rules Football and the Australian Tennis Open as the context for the empirical component of this study, a number of sponsors in key industries could be examined. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse survey data. The conceptual model and hypotheses were tested using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The results show that consumer attitudes and beliefs about a sponsor, and their perception of fit between a sponsor and sponsored property, have a strong bearing on their pre-purchase response. The strength of a pre-purchase response is determined by a consumer’s interest in, and favourability of a sponsor’s products or services. Image congruence and a positive sponsorship experience ensure a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>image</b> values occurs. This transfer is central to predicting a consumer’s intent to purchase, enhancing the possibility of actual purchase. Of the 696 survey respondents, half made an actual purchase of a sponsor’s product or service. This study posits solid sponsor and property collaboration assists effective sponsorship administration. Both parties must invest resources towards market research to facilitate the development and adherence of appropriate fit and congruence objectives. Image and image effects act as a mechanism from which consumers can construct meaningful evaluations of sponsorships and must also be considered. Most importantly, a holistic, consumer-centric approach to sponsorship examination offers practitioners a guide to effective sponsorship planning and execution...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{definition}} of the total variation norm for vector valued functions which {{can be applied to}} restore color and other vector valued images. The new TV norm has the desirable properties of (i) not penalizing discontinuities (edges) in the image, (ii) rotationally invariant in the image space, and (iii) reduces to the usual TV norm in the scalar case. Some numerical experiments on denoising simple color images in RGB color space are presented. 1 Introduction During gathering and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>image</b> data some noise and blur is usually introduced into the image. Several reconstruction methods based on the total variation (TV) norm have been proposed and studied for intensity (gray scale) images, see [9, 14, 21, 26, 29]. Since these methods have been successful in reducing noise and blur without smearing sharp edges for intensity images, it is natural to extend the TV norm to handle color and other vector valued images. Why do we need color restoration? It can be argued that si [...] ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRadio {{communication}} and observation services are critical {{at all levels}} of disaster management. Among the programmes to be introduced to reduce the impact of natural and human induced disasters, potential transfers from basic research in radio science to research in disaster management are examined. Two specific aspects are studied: (i) the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>image</b> processing techniques, developed in other contexts, to risk management; and (ii) the use of knowledge gathered on the effects of variations in the space environment on trans-ionospheric propagation, to gauge the interest of integrating those effects into the exploitation of communications and observation systems. Four families of image processing techniques are shown to be particularly useful to the disaster manager: zoning, counting of objects, roads and network detection, and damage assessment resulting from a series of different radiometric and geometric methods. A brief review of the effects of ionospheric variations on radio propagation up to a few GHz shows both the potential impacts of those variations on communication systems and the importance of introducing ionospheric corrections into several observation services...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} multiple Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architectures for real-time machine vision processing. The use of FPGAs for low-level processing represents an excellent tradeoff between software and special purpose hardware implementations. A library of modules that implement common low-level machine vision operations is presented. These modules are designed with gate-level hardware components that are compiled into the functionality of the FPGA chips. A common input/output interface is created for use in each of the modules, allowing the interconnection of several image processing modules in a parallel or pipelined manner. This new synchronous. unidirectional interface establishes a protocol for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>image</b> and result data between modules. This reduces the design complexity and allows several different low-level operations to be applied to the same input image. A method is developed to partition and compile the design into the hardware resources of multiple FPGA chips. Experimental results verify the efficiency of using common multiple FPGA architectures to implement real-time machine vision processing. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Modern {{microscope}} platforms {{are able}} to generate multiple gigabytes of image data in a single experimental session. In a routine research laboratory workflow, these data are initially stored on the local acquisition computer from which files need {{to be transferred to}} the experimenter's (remote) image repository (e. g., DVDs, portable hard discs or server-based storage) because of limited local data storage. Although manual solutions for this migration, such as OMERO - a client-server software for visualising and managing large amounts of image data - exist, this import process may be a time-consuming and tedious task. Findings We have developed ATOM, a Java-based and thus platform-independent add-on for OMERO enabling automated <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>image</b> data {{from a wide variety of}} acquisition software packages into OMERO. ATOM provides a graphical user interface and allows pre-organisation of experimental data for the transfer. Conclusions ATOM is a convenient extension of the OMERO software system.

40|$|Video-frame-rate millimetre-wave imaging has {{recently}} been demonstrated with a quality {{similar to that of}} a low-quality uncooled thermal imager. In this paper we will discuss initial investigations into the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>image</b> processing algorithms from more mature imaging modalities to millimetre-wave imagery. The current aim is to develop body segmentation algorithms for use in object detection and analysis. However, this requires a variety of image processing algorithms from different domains, including image de-noising, segmentation and motion tracking. This paper focuses on results from the segmentation of a body from the millimetre-wave images and a qualitative comparison of different approaches is presented. Their performance is analysed and any characteristics which enhance or limit their application are discussed. While it is possible to apply image processing algorithms developed for the visible-band directly to millimetrewave images, the physics of the image formation process is very different. This paper discusses the potential for exploiting an understanding of the physics of image formation in the image segmentation process to enhance classification of scene components and, thereby, improve segmentation performance.

40|$|Co-branding theory {{suggests}} that pairing an event with a destination will engender some <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>image</b> between the event and destination brands. The match-up hypothesis predicts that the direction and intensity of image transfer {{will depend on the}} quality of fit between event and destination brands. A 3 (activity level of city) x 3 (activity level of sport event) design was used to construct destination advertisements. The print advertisements were shown to a sample of 275 individuals who then rated the city and event on activity and evaluation scales. The presence of any sport event elevated city activity ratings, but event activity ratings were elevated only when the event was paired with a leisurely city. A mismatch of activity ratings negatively affected evaluation of a leisurely city, but the presence of any sport event elevated evaluation of an active city. Evaluation ratings mediated the event's effect on intention to visit the host city. Findings suggest that match-up between events and destinations is determined by priming of schema rather than by shared levels of a characteristic. Findings also suggest that familiarity with a brand may determine whether a paired brand's characteristic is assimilated or is a context for contrast. Implications for future research are discussed. destination branding destination image co-branding sport events match-up hypothesis...|$|E
30|$|If {{the guide}} star is bright and stable enough, i.e. if {{the size of}} light {{emitting}} particle is big enough and still not disturbing the physiology of the sample, some in vivo applications can be performed as well. For this purpose, the guide star image and image of the scene in its close vicinity can be captured continuously with the camera with short exposure times in tens of milliseconds range. Image data at video rate can be handled and processed online or offline with a dedicated computer. A big challenge of such an application would be the differentiation of the signals coming from the guide star and the structures of interest. The guide star can be labeled with a slightly different color and a synchronized filter wheel {{in front of the}} camera can enable the differentiation of the images. Since the scattering properties depend on the wavelength, the labeling of the guide star and the biological structure must be as similar as possible. Another possibility could be to label the structures of interest with switchable fluorophores which can be turned on and off depending on the wavelength and timing of the excitation laser. However, if the in vivo dynamics change the scattering properties within a few milliseconds or faster, this technique would most probably suffer from low signal. Additionally, fast <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>image</b> data would be challenging.|$|E
