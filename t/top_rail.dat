25|$|The {{earliest}} in {{records are}} those {{represented in the}} paintings of the Egyptian tombs, {{in which they are}} shown as single or double doors, each in a single piece of wood. Doors were once believed to be the literal doorway to the afterlife, and some doors leading to important places included designs of the afterlife. In Egypt, where the climate is intensely dry, there would be no fear of their warping, but in other countries it would be necessary to frame them, which according to Vitruvius (iv. 6.) was done with stiles (sea/si) and rails (see: Frame and panel): the spaces enclosed being filled with panels (tympana) let into grooves made in the stiles and rails. The stiles were the vertical boards, one of which, tenoned or hinged, is known as the hanging stile, the other as the middle or meeting stile. The horizontal cross pieces are the <b>top</b> <b>rail,</b> bottom rail, and middle or intermediate rails. The most ancient doors were made timber, such as those referred to in the Biblical depiction of King Solomon's temple being in olive wood (I Kings vi. 31-35), which were carved and overlaid with gold. The doors dwelt upon in Homer would appear to have been cased in silver or brass. Besides olive wood, elm, cedar, oak and cypress were used. A 5,000-year-old door has been found by archaeologists in Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|The nave arcades {{run through}} to {{corresponding}} chancel arcades separating {{the north and south}} chancel chapels from the chancel. The chancel three-bay north arcade is 14th-century Decorative, with piers quatrefoil in section separated by right-angled projections running full length, and with flat raised fillets along each face. The capital gadrooned (convex and concave) raised acabi mouldings follow the lateral line of the cusped piers. The 15th-century arcade arches springing from the piers are also of a continuous Decorative multi-faceted moulding with a flat under-face. The chancel south arcade is 15th-century. Its piers are Perpendicular, with polygonal piers and capitals and chamfered arches. The furthest east south arcade contains within it a supplementary Decorative arch springing from the piers, this of ogee form with multi-rounded moulding, topped with a twin run of decorative battlements leading to a flat topped finial; this arch was rebuilt in the 19thcentury. At each side within the westernmost chancel bays are 19th-century wooden choir stalls. Screens facing the stalls are of cusped ogee arches and quatrefoils in open fretwork moulding; the altar rail is of similar style. Behind the stalls are pews, originally belonging to the manor houses of Easton and Stoke Rochford. Between the aisles and chancel chapels at the north and south are 19th-century low wooden screens, with a run of seven double panels; plain below, those above with decorative insets, the central and outer of quatrefoils. Above the paneling runs open fretwork moulding of cusped ogee arches leading to quatrefoils between, below a <b>top</b> <b>rail.</b> Beneath the chancel east window is a 1911 stone reredos sculptured in relief, and painted, by Mrs. G. F. Watts. A raised central panel depicts the crucifixion of Christ with, at each side, three saints within triple-arched niches: the saints Hugh of Lincoln and Gilbert of Sempringham, and the Virgin Mary to the left; St John, Bishop King of Lincoln and St Christopher to the right. The base projection contains a scalloped bed-mould. A decorative frieze of serpentine foliage is set at the top. Above the reredos is the Perpendicular-style three-light east window with 19th-century stained glass.|$|E

500|$|Adams' {{first major}} public {{exhibition}} in New York {{was held on}} January 31, 1878, at the Union Square Billiard Rooms before a large audience; he performed there nightly for a week. Reporting {{on the first night}} of the event, The New York Times wrote:The intricacy of the various shots he played, as well as the marvelous accuracy with which they were executed, frequently roused the spectators to an unusual pitch of enthusiasm.... Many of Adams' shots are entirely new, never having been attempted before by any billiards expert. Among them may be mentioned the wonderful [...] "bottle" [...] shot with which last evening's exhibition was brought to a close. Two soda-water bottles were placed {{at the head of the}} left-hand rail, about a foot apart, a red ball being placed in the mouth of each bottle. A white ball was next placed against the right-hand rail, directly opposite the lower bottle. Everything being in readiness, Adams then took the remaining white ball in his hand, and masseing upon the ball in the mouth of the upper bottle, jumped his ball to the ball in the mouth of the other bottle, whence, falling upon the table it was carried by a reverse [...] "English" [...] to the middle of the <b>top</b> <b>rail,</b> whence it glided with unerring accuracy to the right-hand rail and caromed upon the first-mentioned white ball, its successful execution being greeted with great applause.|$|E

40|$|Managing the {{coefficient}} of friction at the wheel-rail interface through lubrication is an accepted practice in railway systems. The coefficient of friction between the <b>top</b> of the <b>rail</b> and the tread of the wheels is not addressed well, with the traction, braking and some steering forces causing signifi cant rail and wheel damage. <b>Top</b> of <b>rail</b> friction management uses friction modifiers to control {{the coefficient}} of friction on the <b>top</b> of the <b>rail</b> to within a defined range, and is being used in some North American rail networks with beneficial results.

2500|$|Woven {{mesh wire}} is safer but more {{expensive}} than strands of smooth wire. [...] It {{is more difficult to}} install, and has some visibility issues, but horses are less likely to become tangled in it or be injured if they run into it. [...] Adding a <b>top</b> <b>rail</b> of wood or synthetic material increases visibility of the fence and prevents it from being bent by horses reaching over it. [...] A strand of electric fence may also keep horses from pushing on a mesh fence. [...] Mesh fencing needs to be heavy-gauge wire, woven, not welded, and the squares of the mesh should be too small for a horse to put a foot through. [...] "Field fence" [...] or [...] "no-climb" [...] fence are safer designs than more widely woven [...] "sheep fence." [...] Chain link fence is occasionally seen, but horses can bend chain link almost as easily as a thinner-gauge wire, so the additional expense is often not justified by any gain over good-quality woven wire.|$|E

2500|$|In England that {{familiar}} style known as Elizabethan and Jacobean prevailed throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. At {{the present time}} hardly {{a home in the}} land has not its old oak chest carved with the familiar half circle or scroll border along the <b>top</b> <b>rail,</b> or the arch pattern on the panels. The court cupboards, with their solid or open under parts and upper cornice supported by turned balusters of extravagant thickness, are to be seen wherever one goes. And chairs, real as well as spurious, with solid backs carved in the usual flat relief, are bought up with an avidity inseparable from fashion. Four-post bedsteads are harder to come by. The back is usually broken up into small panels and carved, the best effect being seen in those examples where the paneling or the framework only is decorated. The dining-hall tables often had six legs of great substance, which were turned somewhat after the shape of a covered cup, and were carved with foliage bearing a distant resemblance to the acanthus. Rooms were generally panelled with oak, sometimes divided at intervals by flat pilasters and the upper frieze carved with scroll work or dolphins. But the feature which distinguished the period was the fire mantle. It always must be the principal object in a room, and the Elizabethan carver fully appreciated this fact. By carving the chimney breast as a rule to the ceiling and covering the surrounding walls with more or less plain paneling, the designer, by thus concentrating the attention on one point, often produced results of a high order. Caryatid figures, pilasters and friezes were among the customary details employed to produce good effects. No finer example exists than that lately removed from the old palace at Bromley-by-Bow to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The mantelshelf is [...] from the ground and consists of a deep quadrant mould decorated with flat scroll work of good design. The supporting pilasters on either side are shaped and moulded in the customary Jacobean manner and are crowned by busts with Ionic capitals on the heads. Above the shelf the large center panel is deeply carved with the royal coat of arms with supporters and mantling, and on either side a semicircular arched niche contains a figure in classic dress. The Elizabethan carver often produced splendid staircases, sometimes carving the newel posts with heraldic figures bearing coats of arms, etc. The newels of a staircase at Highgate support different types of Cromwellian soldiers, carved with great vivacity and life. But in spite of excellent work, as for example the beautiful gallery at Hatfield, the carving of this period did not, so far as England was concerned, compare with other epochs, or with contemporary work in other parts of Europe. Much of the work is badly drawn and badly executed. It is true that good decorative effects were constantly obtained at the very minimum of cost, {{but it is difficult to}} discover much merit in work which really looks best when badly cut.|$|E
