5|$|After his death, non-Mormon {{newspapers}} were almost unanimous in portraying Smith {{as a religious}} fanatic. Conversely, within Mormonism, Smith was memorialized first and foremost as a prophet, martyred to seal <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> his faith.|$|E

5|$|A few sculptures, {{including}} Epimetheus and Pandora, {{have been}} attributed to El Greco. This doubtful attribution is based on <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> Pacheco (he saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines, but these may have been merely models). There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, The Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who {{all said}} that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E

There was, however, some circumstantial evidence: an empty holster found by the police among Williams' possessions showed evidence of a revolver recently being inside it.

5|$|In {{the later}} {{days of the}} trial, Quisling's health suffered, {{largely as a result}} of the number of medical tests to which he was subjected, and his defence faltered. The prosecution's {{powerful}} final speech placed responsibility for the Final Solution being carried out in Norway at the feet of Quisling, using <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> German officials. The prosecutor Annæus Schjødt called for the death penalty, using laws introduced by the government-in-exile in October 1941 and January 1942.|$|E

Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual manufacturing error, found in the van and on Leach's body, which matched fibers from the jacket Bundy was wearing when he was arrested.|$|E
5|$|Taylor v. Illinois, , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court held that defense witnesses can be prevented from testifying under certain circumstances, even if that hurts the defense's case.

Texas.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators {{first told}} Justin, Germanus's eldest son, of their intentions. He, in turn, {{informed}} his father, who then held counsel with the comes excubitorum, Marcellus. In {{order to find}} out more of their intentions, Germanus met the conspirators in person, while a trusted aide of Marcellus, named Leontius, was concealed nearby and listened in. Marcellus then informed Emperor Justinian, and the conspirators were arrested, but treated with remarkable leniency. At first, Germanus and his sons too were suspected, until <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> Marcellus and the commanders Constantianus and Bouzes cleared them.|$|E

After sentencing Mary Surratt to hang, five jurors signed a letter recommending clemency, but Johnson refused to stop the execution; he later claimed he never saw the letter.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a growing public {{awareness}} in the U.S. of military activities in Laos. During October 1969, Senator Stuart Symington (D-MO) chaired hearings of the Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Security Agreements and Commitments Abroad. <b>The</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> subpoenaed witnesses revealed the history of U.S. involvement in the covert commitment to Laos.

5|$|Doc Holliday had a {{reputation}} as a gunman and had reportedly been in nine shootouts during his life, although it has only been verified that he killed three men. One well-documented episode occurred on July 19, 1879, when Holliday and his business partner, former deputy marshal John Joshua Webb, were seated in their saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Former U.S. Army scout Mike Gordon got into a loud argument with one of the saloon girls that he wanted to take with him. Gordon stormed from the saloon and began firing his revolver into the building. Before Gordon could get off his second shot, Holliday killed him. Holliday was tried for the murder but acquitted, mostly based on <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> Webb.|$|E

5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest to the type of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.|$|E
5|$|General Robert C. Oaks, USAF, Commander of United States Air Forces in Europe, {{immediately}} appointed an Air Force Regulation (AFR) 110-14 {{accident investigation}} board composed of a board president, 11 board members from the USAF and U.S. Army, three associate members from France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, four legal advisers, and 13 technical advisers. The board president was Major General James G. Andrus, USAF. An AFR 110-14 investigation's findings are publicly released and <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> <b>of</b> witnesses in the investigation can be used against them in military disciplinary proceedings. For this reason, after serious mishaps the USAF usually also conducts a separate safety investigation, in which the results are not publicly released and witness testimony is immune from prosecution. In this case, however, for unknown reasons the USAF decided not to conduct a safety investigation.|$|E

Three youths – Gavrilo Princip, Trifko Grabež, and Nedeljko Čabrinović – Bosnian Serb subjects of Austria-Hungary, living in Belgrade, testified at the Sarajevo trial that {{at about the same}} time (a little after Easter), they were eager to carry out an assassination and approached a fellow Bosnian Serb and former guerrilla fighter known to be well connected and with access to arms, Milan Ciganović, and through him Major Tankosić and reached an agreement to transport arms to Sarajevo and participate in the assassination.|$|E
