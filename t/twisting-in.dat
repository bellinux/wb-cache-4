40|$|The paper {{provides}} an experimental evaluation {{pertaining to the}} influence of steel self-tapping screw on its <b>twisting-in</b> specimens made of various materials and its twisting-out process. Main principles of the investigation methodology including description of  technological scheme of self-tapping screw electro-arc machining and specimens applied while executing the experiments and hardware measuring tools used for fixation of torque which has been applied to the self-tapping screw during its <b>twisting-in</b> in the specimen  and its twisting-out process have been presented in the paper. It has been established that the self-tapping screw electro-arc machining initiates formation of dimples (holes) which have solidified metal flows along their edges. The flows give a cutting ability to the screw and so they exert an influence on the conditions of screw’s interaction with the specimen during its <b>twisting-in</b> and twisting-out processes. The paper presents results of experimental investigations that demonstrate an impact of self-tapping screw electro-arc machining on its <b>twisting-in</b> in the specimens made of various materials and twisting-out procedure. In particular, it has been ascertained that torque value applied to the self-tapping screw with modified surface during <b>twisting-in</b> process is less in comparison with the self-tapping screw having an initial state of its surface {{and in the case of}} its twisting-out process the value is higher. In this respect difference between the indicated torque values is increasing when material hardness of the specimen becomes higher.   </p...|$|E
