The reduced kinetic mechanism (MeCH- 19), which is constructed based on GRI Mech. 2. 11, is verified by comparing with two detailed kinetic mechanisms; GRI Mech. 2. 11 and Miller & Bowman through the <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>DNS.</b> Important properties such as temperature, heat release rate, turbulent burning velocity and distributions of major species obtained from detailed and reduced kinetic mechanisms are compared and they show good agreements with each other. Since the availability of MeCH- 19 is verified by <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>DNS,</b> three-dimensional DNS is conducted using MeCH- 19. Numerical conditions of the DNS can be classified into thin reaction zones. Different from our previous DNSs of hydrogen-air flames, the distributions of temperature and heat release rate do not coincide and quite low heat release rate regions corresponding to the local extinction are observed. In the vicinities of these regions, flame elements are strongly stretching into two tangential directions. ...|$|E

A twodimensional configuration was considered that consists of two adjacent rooms separated by a lintel in which natural convection is induced through heating on their opposite sides and subjected to diffusion of a pollutant from one room to the other. Seven contributions are available. The comparison is carried out, in terms of local or global quantities, for the mean thermal and dynamic fields and for the unsteady diffusion of the pollutant from one room to the other.

40|$|In cold Cepheids {{close to}} the red edge of the {{classical}} instability strip, a strong coupling between the stellar pulsations and the surface convective motions occurs. This coupling is by now poorly described by 1 -D models of convection, the so-called "time-dependent convection models" (TDC). The intrinsic weakness of such models comes from {{the large number of}} unconstrained free parameters entering in the description of turbulent convection. A way to overcome these limits is to compute two-dimensional direct simulations (DNS), in which all the nonlinearities are correctly solved. <b>Two-dimensional</b> <b>DNS</b> of the convection-pulsation coupling are presented here. In an appropriate parameter regime, convective motions can actually quench the radial pulsations of the star, as suspected in Cepheids {{close to the}} red edge of the instability strip.

40|$|The Arctic Ocean {{has been}} a subject of {{increasing}} interest in recent years due to {{the reduction of the}} sea-ice thickness and spatial coverage and its implications for climate change. The future state of the Arctic is likely to be linked to vertical heat transport by microscale processes, specifically, double-diffusive convection. A series of realistic three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) were conducted to assess the vertical heat transport through thermohaline staircases in the Arctic region. Results revealed that vertical fluxes exceeded those of extant four-thirds flux laws by as much as a factor of two, and suggest that the 4 / 3 exponent requires downward revision. Results also showed that <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>DNS</b> can provide an accurate approximation of heat fluxes when the density ratio is sufficiently large. DNS results also reveal that the models with rigid boundaries result in heat flux estimates that are lower than those from models with periodic boundary conditions. Finally, the DNS-derived flux law was applied to Arctic data and results supported the conclusion that lab-derived flux laws significantly underestimate heat flux. All of these results suggest that vertical heat transport due to double-diffusive convection is a significant contributor to the measured reduction of Arctic sea-ice.

40|$|Differential {{diffusion}} {{alters the}} balance of reaction and diffusion in turbulent premixed combustion, affecting the performance and emissions of combustion devices. Modelling combustion devices with Probability or Filtered Density Function (PDF or FDF) methods provides an exact treatment for the change in composition due to chemical reaction, while molecular mixing has to be modelled. Previous PDF molecular mixing models do not account for differential diffusion in a manner which satisfies realizability requirements. A new approach for treating differential diffusion, which ensures realizability, is proposed for pairwise-exchange mixing models in general, and applied in the Interaction by Exchange with the Mean (IEM) model of Dopazo (1975), and in the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (EMST) model of Subramaniam and Pope (1998). The new differential diffusion models {{are referred to as}} IEM-DD and EMST-DD respectively. Results from two and three-dimensional DNS of turbulent premixed methane-air combustion show that mixing rates and conditional statistics of species mass fractions depend on species diffusivities and the combustion regime. Zero-dimensional PDF model results obtained for the <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>DNS</b> case show that the EMST-DD model best reproduces the features that characterize differential diffusion in the DNS. The essential feature of the EMSTDD model, which accounts for its success in turbulent premixed combustion, is that differential mixing rates are imposed within a model which mixes locally in composition spac...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations (DNS) {{are conducted}} of noise generated at an infinitely thin trailing edge (TE). The {{aim is to}} predict the far-field sound and the near-field hydrodynamics, providing an insight into the physical mechanisms of sound generation and potentially helping to validate acoustic theories. In particular, the DNS data are compared with Amiet's theory, where the farfield sound can be evaluated in closed form if the convecting surface pressure spectrum upstream of the TE is known. For the present investigation, Tollmien-Schlichting waves are introduced close to the inflow boundary. The disturbances propagate downstream producing pressure fluctuations at the TE. In conducting <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>DNS</b> the theoretical method requires modification {{to account for the}} radiation of the total pressure difference in two dimensions only, as opposed to the three dimensional sound radiation originally considered by Amiet. For DNS, a high-order accurate numerical method is chosen which is free of upwinding, artificial dissipation or any form of explicit filtering, and employs a novel boundary treatment. The modified theoretical analysis and a comparison between DNS and theoretical results are presented, scrutinizing the assumptions made in the derivation. Amiet's surface pressure jump transfer function is found to predict the scattered pressure field accurately. Directivity plots of DNS data show that viscous effects appear to smear individual lobes and that a strong downstream pointing lobe is present which is attributed to an additional wake source...|$|E
40|$|Measuring the {{velocities}} of premixed laminar flames {{with precision}} remains a controversial {{issue in the}} combustion community. This paper studies the accuracy of such measurements in two-dimensional slot burners and shows that while methane/air flame speeds can be measured with reasonable accuracy, the method may lack precision for other mixtures such as hydrogen/air. Curvature at the flame tip, strain on the flame sides and local quenching at the flame base can modify local flame speeds and require correc- tions which are studied using <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>DNS.</b> Numerical simulations also provide stretch, dis- placement and consumption flame speeds along the flame front. For methane/air flames, DNS show that the local stretch remains small so that the local consumption speed {{is very close to}} the unstretched premixed flame speed. The only correction needed to correctly predict flame speeds in this case is due to the finite aspect ratio of the slot used to inject the premixed gases which induces a flow acceleration in the measurement region (this correction can be evaluated from velocity measurement in the slot section or from an analytical solution). The method is applied to methane/air flames with and without water addition and results are compared to experimental data found in the literature. The paper then discusses the limitations of the slot-burner method to measure flame speeds for other mixtures and shows that it is not well adapted to mixtures with a Lewis number far from unity, such as hydrogen/air flames...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulation (DNS) results of autoignition in anon-premixed medium under an isotropic, homogeneous, and decaying turbulence are presented. The initial mixture consists of segregated fuel parcels randomly distributed within warm air, {{and the entire}} medium is subjected to a three-dimensional turbulence. Chemical kinetics is modeled by a four-step reduced reaction mechanism for autoignition of n-heptane/air mixture. Thus, this work overcomes the principal limitations of a previous contribution of the authors on <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>DNS</b> of autoignition with a one-step reaction model. Specific {{attention is focused on}} the differences in the effects of two- and three-dimensional turbulence on autoignition characteristics. The three-dimensional results show that ignition spots are most likely to originate at locations jointly corresponding to the most reactive mixture fraction and low scalar dissipation rate. Further, these ignition spots are found to originate at locations corresponding to the core of local vortical structures, and after ignition, the burning gases move toward the vortex periphery Such a movement is explained as caused by the cyclostrophic imbalance developed when the local gas density is variable. These results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} local ignition-zone structure does not conform to the classical stretched flamelet description. Parametric studies show that the ignition delay time decreases with an increase in turbulence intensity. Hence, these three-dimensional simulation results resolve the discrepancy between trends in experimental data and predictions from DNSs of two-dimensional turbulence. This qualitative difference between DNS results from three- and two-dimensional simulations is discussed and attributed to the effect of vortex stretching that is present in the former, but not in the latter...|$|E

The influence of variations in the initial temperature field imposed by changing the variance of temperature, the ignition-timing by changing the time at which the ignition source is superimposed, and the turbulence intensity and length scale on ignition of a lean iso-octane/air mixture is elucidated. The mean heat release rate increases more slowly and ignition delay decreases with increasing thermal stratification under homogeneous charge compression-ignition (HCCI) conditions since the present mean temperature lies far outside of the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime. The spark-ignition induces relatively short ignition delay under spark-assisted compression ignition (SACI) conditions while mildly spreading out the mean heat release rate. For SACI combustion, high turbulence intensity decreases the ignition delay more by increasing the turbulent flame area. Displacement speed and Damkohler number analyses reveal that {{the high degree of}} thermal stratification induces deflagration at the reaction fronts, and hence, the mean heat release rate is smoother subsequent to thermal runaway occurring at the highest temperature regions in the domain. For SACI combustion, the heat release rate occurs solely by deflagration prior to the occurrence of the maximum heat release rate and subsequently by mixed modes of deflagration and spontaneous ignition. These results suggest that thermal stratification provides smooth operation of HCCI engines and moreover, spark-ignition can precisely control the ignition timing for SACI combustion. close 9...|$|E
40|$|Stably {{stratified}} flows over {{a two-dimensional}} hill are investigated in a channel of finite depth using a three-dimensional {{direct numerical simulation}} (DNS). The present study follows on to our previous <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>DNS</b> studies of stably stratified flows over a hill in a channel of finite depth and provides a more realistic simulation of atmospheric flows than our previous studies. A hill with a constant cross-section in the spanwise (y) direction is placed in a 3 -D computational domain. As in the previous 2 -D simulations, to avoid {{the effect of the}} ground boundary layer that develops upstream of the hill, no-slip conditions are imposed only on the hill surface and the surface downstream of the hill; slip conditions are imposed on the surface upstream of the hill. The simulated 3 -D flows are discussed by comparing them to the simulated 2 -D flows with a focus on the effect of the stable stratification on the non-periodic separation and reattachment of the flow behind the hill. In neutral (K = 0, where K is a non-dimensional stability parameter) and weakly stable (K = 0. 8) conditions, 3 -D flows over a hill differ clearly from 2 -D flows over a hill mainly because of the three-dimensionality of the flow, that is the development of a spanwise flow component in the 3 -D flows. In highly stable conditions (K = 1, 1. 3), long-wavelength lee waves develop downstream of the hill in both 2 -D and 3 -D flows, and the behaviors of the 2 -D and 3 -D flows are similar {{in the vicinity of the}} hill. In other words, the spanwise component of the 3 -D flows is strongly suppressed in highly stable conditions, and the flow in the vicinity of the hill becomes approximately two-dimensional in the x and z directions...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} fluid-structure {{interaction}} (FSI) problem of elastic membrane aerofoils at low Reynolds numbers. The {{dynamics of the}} fluid and membrane coupled system is studied via direct numerical simulation (DNS) using a newly developed computational framework whose characteristics and validation are included in this report. A set of <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>DNS</b> were performed for varying Reynolds number, membrane elasticity and aerofoil geometry in order to investigate {{the effect of these}} relevant fluid and structural parameters on the behaviour of fluid-structure coupled system. Static and dynamic features of the system, and their effect in aerodynamic properties, are described and compared for the different parameter combinations. The case with highest Reynolds number, Re = 10; 000, and intermediate elasticity was chosen as a base case to further study the fluid-structure coupling mechanism, particularly at low angle of attack conditions. The dynamic behaviour was characterised via spectral analysis in the frequency and wavenumber-frequency domains, which allowed the propagating wave nature of the membrane vibrations and their effect on the surrounding pressure field fluctuations to be clarified. The membrane vibrations are found to introduce upstream-propagating pressure waves that seem to be responsible for a loss in aerodynamic efficiency compared to a rigid aerofoil. Stability aspects of the FSI problem are also investigated by performing numerical experiments to analyse the response of the system to initial flow perturbations. The solutions of the 2 D DNS are used as initial conditions for three-dimensional simulations, upon which initial perturbations in spanwise velocity are added. As the simulation is advanced in time the evolution of the perturbations is studied to determine the stability characteristics of the flow. Amplifications of the perturbations are found for Re > 10; 000. The coupling of the fully three-dimensional developed flow and the elastic aerofoil is also analysed with spectral techniques. Comparison of two- and three-dimensional results reveals that the three-dimensional flow development causes a decrease in the amplitude of the system fluctuations, but the same coupling mechanism found in the two-dimensional approach is also present in the three-dimensional case...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} thermal {{stratification}} on the ignition of a lean homogeneous n-heptane/air mixture at constant volume and high pressure is investigated by direct numerical simulations (DNS) {{with a new}} 58 - species reduced kinetic mechanism developed for very lean mixtures from the detailed LLNL mechanism (H. J. Curran et al., Combust. Flame 129 (2002) 253 – 280). <b>Two-dimensional</b> <b>DNS</b> are performed in a fixed volume with a two-dimensional isotropic velocity spectrum and temperature fluctuations superimposed on the initial scalar fields. The influence of variations in the initial temperature field, imposed by changing the mean and variance of temperature, and the ratio of turbulence to ignition delay timescale on multi-stage ignition of a lean n-heptane/air mixture is studied. In general, the mean heat release rate increases more slowly with increasing thermal stratification regardless of the mean initial temperature. Ignition delay decreases with increasing thermal stratification for high mean initial temperature relative to the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime. It is, however, increased with increasing thermal fluctuations for relatively low mean initial temperature resulting from a longer overall ignition delay of the mixture. Displacement speed and Damköhler number analyses reveal that {{the high degree of}} thermal stratification induces deflagration rather than spontaneous ignition at the reaction fronts, and hence, the mean heat release rate is smoother subsequent to thermal runaway occurring at the highest temperature regions in the domain. Chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA) also verifies that mixing counterbalances chemical explosion at the reaction fronts for cases with large temperature fluctuation. It is also found that if the ratio of turbulence to ignition delay timescale is short, resultant diminished scalar fluctuations cause the overall ignition to occur by spontaneous ignition. However, the overall effect of turbulence is small compared to the effect of thermal stratification. These results suggest that the critical degree of thermal stratification for smooth operation of homogeneous charge compression-ignition (HCCI) engines depends on both the mean and fluctuations in initial temperature which should be considered in controlling ignition timing and preventing an overly rapid increase in pressure in HCCI combustion...|$|E
