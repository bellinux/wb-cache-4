5|$|Helena, knowing Ruiz is soon {{scheduled}} to testify, makes {{a deal with}} Juan Obregón (Bratt), lord of the drug cartel, who forgives the Ayala family's debt and has Ruiz poisoned. Ayala is released, much to the dissatisfaction of Gordon, who is still angry over his partner's death. During a phone conversation between Ayala and Metzger, Ayala deduces that it was Metzger who originally informed on Ruiz. Evidently in a bid for power with another drug cartel in Mexico, Metzger accepted $3 million to inform on Ruiz to the FBI and facilitate the Ayala organization's downfall. Ayala says that Metzger was planning on taking over Ayala's empire completely. As Ayala hangs up the phone, Metzger looks up <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>two</b> hit men entering his office. Soon after Ayala's release, Gordon bursts into the Ayala home during his homecoming celebration. Bodyguards wrestle him to the ground, but Gordon is able to surreptitiously plant a listening bug under Ayala's desk. Gordon is forced from the property, with the satisfaction of knowing that {{there is now a}} new opportunity to trap Ayala.|$|E
5|$|In 1738, Zahir's forces {{captured}} the fortress at Jiddin and the villages in its political orbit, Abu Snan and Tarshiha. Jiddin had been ruled by Ahmad al-Husayn, whose family historically controlled it. The peasants under his rule {{complained that he}} governed oppressively and appealed to Zahir, who was known for treating the peasantry fairly, to relieve them of al-Husayn. Zahir, eager to expand his control toward the Mediterranean, accepted their requests and obtained permission from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al-Azm, to seize the fortress. Likewise, al-Husayn had also approached the governor, who, hoping <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>two</b> powerful local leaders weakened, gave al-Husayn his blessing as well. Zahir assembled a 1,500-strong force and defeated al-Husayn's forces near the fortress. He was then appointed multazim of Jiddin's subdistrict.|$|E
5|$|Swaminarayan strived to {{maintain}} good relationships {{with people of}} other religions, sometimes meeting prominent leaders. His followers cut across religious boundaries, including people of Muslim and Parsi backgrounds. Swaminarayan's personal attendants included Khoja Muslims. In Kathiawad, many Muslims wore kanthi necklaces given by Swaminarayan. He also {{had a meeting with}} Reginald Heber, Lord Bishop of Calcutta and a leader of Christians in India at the time. Bishop Heber mentions in his account of the meeting that about two hundred disciples of Swaminarayan accompanied him as his bodyguards mounted on horses and carrying Matchlocks and swords. Bishop Heber himself had about a hundred horse guards accompanying him (fifty horses and fifty muskets) and mentioned that it was humiliating for him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>two</b> religious leaders meeting at the head of two small armies, his being the smaller contingent. As a result of the meeting, both leaders gained mutual respect for one another.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins with}} a cold open in which Wes infiltrates and destroys the Team Snagem hideout before leaving the organization. Wes starts at the Outskirt Stand, a {{dilapidated}} train engine {{in the middle of}} the desert that has been converted into a shop. With Espeon and Umbreon, Wes's first opponent is a Trainer named Willie. Wes then leaves the Stand and heads to the oasis-esque Phenac City in time <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>two</b> men dragging a sack. After defeating them in battle, Wes unties the sack to find Rui, a girl with the ability to discern Shadow Pokémon. They meet the mayor, Es Cade, who seems very bothered about the Cipher problem, but seems to do nothing about it. Later, upon leaving Phenac Colosseum, three Snagem grunts find Wes and Rui. The grunts then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem, and an excellent Snagger. Wes then confronts one of the grunts, which results in the latter's defeat. Finding out that he is an expert at snagging Pokémon, Rui asks him to join forces with her in finding and snagging Shadow Pokémon.|$|E

25|$|In the men's race, {{the bike}} portion had several groups {{attempt to break}} away without success as a peloton of around 50 riders hit the second transition. On the run, just before the 5km point, a group of six at the front had been established. The six leaders {{included}} Brad Kahlefeldt, William Clarke, David Hauss, Javier Gómez, João Silva and Sebastian Rank. With 3km to go, reigning Hamburg champion Gómez tried to kick away from the rest, only <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>two</b> kilometers later Hauss, Clarke and Kahlefeldt move away from him. In the last twenty metres, it looked like Clarke {{was going to win}} before Kahefeldt surged past him for his first ITU World Series win. The top four all ran splits under 30 minutes as Kahefeldt became the seventh man to win a round of the Dextro Energy Triathlon Series. At the halfway point in the championship series, Gómez now led the overall standings with 2026 points, with Clarke and Hauss second and third on 1935 and 1905 respectively. Sven Riederer and Alexander Brukhankov completed the top five.|$|E

25|$|The Ji Gong {{mentioned}} above, {{better known}} as Ji Jike (姬際可) or Ji Longfeng (姬隆丰), {{is said to have}} trained in Shaolin Monastery for ten years as a young man and was matchless with the spear. As the story goes, he later traveled to Xongju Cave on Mount Zhongnan to receive a boxing manual written by Yue Fei, from which he learned Xingyi. However, some believe Ji actually created the style himself and attributed it to Yue Fei because he was fighting the Manchus, descendants of the Jurchens who Yue had struggled against. Ji supposedly created it after watching a battle between an eagle and a bear during the Ming dynasty. Other sources say he created it while training in Shaolin. He was reading a book and looked up <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>two</b> roosters fighting, which inspired him to imitate the fighting styles of animals. Both versions of the story (eagle / bear and roosters) state he continued to study the actions of animals and eventually increased the cadre of animal forms.|$|E

500|$|The Immaculate Collection, Madonna's first greatest-hits {{compilation}} album, {{was released}} in November 1990. It included two new songs, [...] "Justify My Love" [...] and [...] "Rescue Me". The album was certified diamond by RIAA and sold over 30 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist in history. [...] "Justify My Love" [...] reached {{number one in the}} U.S. becoming her ninth number-one Its music video featured scenes of sadomasochism, bondage, same-sex kissing, and brief nudity. The video was deemed too sexually explicit for MTV and was banned from the network.

500|$|Bono is {{credited}} as the album's sole lyricist. Thematically, the album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States against the band's deep {{fascination with the}} country, its open spaces, freedoms, and ideals. Anger is directed particularly at the perceived greed of the Ronald Reagan administration and its foreign policy in Central America. Bono said, [...] "I started <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>two</b> Americas, the mythic America and the real America", hence the album's working title, The Two Americas. Having toured the US extensively in the past, the group were inspired by the country's geography. As such, the desert, rain, dust, and water appear as lyrical motifs throughout the record. In many cases, the desert {{is used as a}} metaphor for [...] "spiritual drought". One track that chiefly represents these themes is [...] "In God's Country", which critic Barbara Jaeger interpreted as addressing America's role as the [...] "promised land". Clayton explained the impact of the desert imagery: [...] "The desert was immensely inspirational to us as a mental image for this record. Most people would take the desert on face value and think it's some kind of barren place, which of course is true. But in the right frame of mind, it's also a very positive image, because you can actually do something with blank canvas, which is effectively what the desert is." ...|$|E

500|$|On 2 January 2009, Boycott, {{along with}} 54 others, was {{inducted}} into the ICC Hall of Fame. On 9 August 2009, while commentating on the fourth Ashes Test at Headingley that season, he was invited to take part in an on-field ceremony to induct him into the Hall of Fame along with Ian Botham and the Yorkshire greats Wilfred Rhodes and Fred Trueman. Botham was also in attendance, along with Trueman's widow, Veronica, and Colin Graves who, as Yorkshire County Cricket Club chairman, accepted the honour on behalf of Rhodes. Boycott said: [...] "I {{would like to thank the}} ICC for awarding me this great honour and for also choosing Headingley as the venue. This ground holds so many wonderful memories for me and the Yorkshire public have always been my greatest supporters, so having this award on home soil in front of them makes it more special". Colin Graves included Boycott in his tribute to Rhodes when he said: [...] "It is a great honour to accept the cap on behalf of a Yorkshire legend. Wilfred Rhodes was an exceedingly gifted player and is rightly regarded as one of England's greatest all-rounders. I am also delighted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>two</b> other great Yorkshiremen and another great all-rounder inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame today".|$|E
500|$|Bryant and Scott {{turned in}} their script on March 1, 1977. It was {{rejected}} by Paramount and they departed the project in April 1977 because they found that Kaufman's and Roddenberry's ideas for the film repeatedly conflicted. They later said they were disappointed as they felt it had been [...] "absolutely a 'go' picture" [...] and that [...] "It {{was just one of}} those deals that happens at studios from time to time that fell down the middle." [...] Jeffrey Katzenberg informed the director on May 8 that the film was cancelled; it had an increased budget of $10 million at the time. This was some three weeks prior to the release of Star Wars. Several explanations for the cancellation have been put forth. One claims the studio felt that the production had taken too long and another science fiction film would not be successful so soon after Star Wars because the fans would not pay <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>two</b> science fiction films. Kaufmann later claimed that Paramount had attributed the cancellation to the success of Star Wars at the box office, but as Titans was cancelled prior to Star Wars release the box office could not have played a factor. Diller stated that it was cancelled because both treatments felt forced and different from the episodes of The Original Series. He instead suggested that they returned to the series format and therefore moved forward with a project that would become the never-completed [...] TV series Kaufmann went on to direct films such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and The Right Stuff (1983). Although the film was never made, it was later discussed by critics and writers. David Hughes included it in his 2008 book The Greatest Science Fiction Movies Never Made in the chapter about the planned Star Trek films of the 1970s.|$|E
