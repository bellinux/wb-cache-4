However, this <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage commonly faces problems due to juice degradation. The precise cause for this problem was ill defined but believed to be of microbial origin. In this research, the microbial population dynamics during <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage was described and we identified the causative degradation flora. Finally, optimal good storage practices were defined with {{the ultimate goal of}} preventing <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation. The <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> microflora has been thoroughly studied with both culture-based and culture-independent techniques, encompassing the application of 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries and T-RFLP analysis, providing a more comprehensive representation of the <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> microflora than the previous studies. The initial, heterogeneous microflora in freshly produced <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> evolved to the dominance (> 99 %) of Tetragenococcus halophilus during storage. Based on its high population density (106 – 107 cfu/ml), the ability to consume sucrose and the similar acidification pattern of experimentally infested <b>thick</b> <b>juice,</b> T. halophilus is proposed to be the key player in <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation. Remarkably, T. halophilus has thus far been associated only with high salt food products and our work is the first to associate it with high sugar matrices. In addition to T. halophilus, other bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Bacillus species were consistently present in lower steady concentrations of 103 cfu/ml. In {{order to be able to}} detect the different bacteria that may occur in <b>thick</b> <b>juice,</b> a DNA array was developed containing detector oligonucleotides for the genera Bacillus, Kocuria, Staphylococccus, and Tetragenococcus, and the species Aerococcus viridans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and T. halophilus.

However, <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage commonly faces problems due to microbial degradation. In this study {{the value of a}} commercial alkaline solution of hop β-acids (HBA) was assessed for prevention of microbial degradation of <b>thick</b> <b>juice.</b> The antimicrobial effect of different concentrations of HBA against juice degradation was tested in a pilot-scale <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage experiment. <b>Thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation, indicated as a decrease in pH, was generally accompanied by an increase in the count of fastidious bacteria (FB) on Columbia Agar with Sheep Blood (CAwSB), which were mainly identified as Tetragenococcus halophilus. Addition of HBA delayed juice acidification and the development of T. halophilus in a concentration-dependent manner. The susceptibility of T. halophilus to HBA was determined by plating degraded <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> (> 105 CFU/ml) on CAwSB plates with different concentrations of HBA (0 – 160 ppm). None of the HBA concentrations tested reduced the number of FB colonies formed, but increasing HBA concentrations extended the lag time of colony formation.

Recently, this halophilic bacterium also appeared as the dominant microflora during storage of sugar <b>thick</b> <b>juice,</b> an intermediate product of beet sugar production.

40|$|Sugar <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation: {{study of}} the {{microbial}} commuity dynamics {{and control of the}} causative microflora during storage Storing sugar extracts as <b>thick</b> <b>juice,</b> a form of sucrose syrup, is widely practiced in the sugar industry because it allows to spread sugar production over an entire season. However, <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage as currently practiced commonly faces problems due to juice degradation. The precise cause for this problem was ill defined but believed to be of microbial origin. The major challenge {{at the start of the}} research described inthis thesis was to describe the microbial population dynamics during <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage, in order to identify the causative degradation flora and to define improved good storage practices with the ultimate goal of preventing <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation. In the last two decades, major changes have occurred in how microbial ecologists study microbial communities. Limitations associated with traditional culture-based methods have driven the development of culture-independent techniques, which are primary based on the analysis of nucleic acids. In this research, <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> microflora has been thoroughly studied with molecular tools, encompassing the application of 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries and Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, providing a more comprehensive representation of the <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> microflora than the previous studies. The initial, heterogeneous microflora in freshly produced <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> evolved to the dominance (> 99 %) of Tetragenococcus halophilus during storage. Basedon its high population density (10 * 6  10 * 7 cfu/ml), the ability to consume sucrose and the similar acidification pattern of artificially infested sterile <b>thick</b> <b>juice,</b> T. halophilus is proposed to be the key player in <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation. Remarkably, T. halophilus has thus far been associated only with high salt food products and ourwork is the first to associate it with high sugar matrices. Therefore, different T. halophilus strains either from <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> or from high salt environments were compared in depth. Using a range of genetic typing methods and physiological tests including repetitive extragenic palindrome analysis (REP-PCR), random amplification of polymorphic DNA(RAPD), and determination of carbon utilization patterns (Biolog), clear differences were found between T. halophilus strains isolated from salt and sugar rich environments. Irrespective these differences,DNA-DNA hybridization grouped all strains within the species T. halophilus, except two isolates from sugar <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> that appear to represent two new species of Tetragenococcus. In addition to T. halophilus, other bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Bacillus species were consistently present, though in lower steady concentrations of 10 * 3 cfu/ml. In order to simultaneously detect the different bacteria that may occur in <b>thick</b> <b>juice,</b> a DNA array was developed containing detector oligonucleotides for the genera Bacillus, Kocuria, Staphylococccus and Tetragenococcus, and the species Aerococcus viridans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and T. halophilus.

Finally, best available storage practiceswere defined based on laboratory and pilot scale storage experiments using the independent variables solids content, pH, storage temperature and biocide concentration. In conclusion, this work has contributed to a better description of themicrobial population dynamics during <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage and degradation, and to the definition of improved storage practices that will be useful for the sugar industry.

Even under good storage practices, microbiological problems can sometimes occur. Improving control of these microflora-related problems requires greater understanding of microbial dynamics of <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to identify the microflora associated with <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation in order to define better process controls. Materials and Methods: Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analysis (CLA) (both targeting 16 S-rDNA) as well as classical culture-based methods were used to characterize bacterial communities present in non-degraded and heavily degraded <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> samples. Based on results obtained by these approaches, specific PCR primers were designed for routine detection of the most predominant species. Results and Discussion: Both CLA and T-RFLP revealed that Tetragenococcus halophilus was the most consistent and predominant taxon present in both degraded and non-degraded samples that were examined. Classical plating on rich medium confirmed the presence of this halophilic Tetragenococcus species. Other microorganisms were also detected in both types of samples, but none were present as consistently or nearly as abundantly as T. halophilus. These results report the first association of T. halophilus with a sugar-rich environment. Based on its high density, we believe that this organism potentially plays a role in <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation.

Even under good storage practices, microbiological problems may occur. Improving control of these microflora-related problems requires {{greater understanding of the}} microbial dynamics of <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was to}} map the population dynamics during storage and identify the microflora associated with <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation in order to define better process controls. Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analysis (CLA) (both targeting 16 S-rDNA) as well as classical culture-based methods were used to characterize bacterial communities present in non-degraded and heavily degraded <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> samples. Based on the results obtained by these approaches, a nylon membrane-based DNA array targeting 16 S rDNA sequences was developed for all bacterial species detected. For signal amplification, the target DNA was amplified using universal primers that anneal to conserved sequences flanking diagnostic domains, simultaneously labeled, and subsequently hybridized to the array. Detection was performed using the anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugate and CDP-Star substrate. Both CLA and T-RFLP demonstrated that Tetragenococcus halophilus was the most consistent and predominant taxon present in both degraded and non-degraded samples that were examined. Classical plating on rich medium confirmed the dominance of this halophilic Tetragenococcus species, but revealed also other osmophilic bacteria possibly pernicious during sugar production including Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Kocuria spp., Aerococcus viridans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and other Tetragenococcus species. In order to monitor the bacterial population dynamics during <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> storage, a specific <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> macro-array was developed covering these bacteria.

For the fermentation of cultivation medium based on <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> with starting sugar content of 20 and 25 g kg- 1 significant increase in ethanol content was attained during the whole fermentation process, resulting in 12. 51 and 10. 95 dm 3 m- 3 ethanol contents after 48 h, respectively. Other goals of this work were to investigate the possibilities for experimental results prediction using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and to find its optimal topology. A feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network was used to test the hypothesis. As input variables fermentation time and starting sugar content were used. Neural networks had one output value, ethanol content, yeast cell number or sugar content. There was one hidden layer and the optimal number of neurons was found to be nine for all selected network outputs. In this study transfer function was tansig and the selected learning rule was Levenberg-Marquardt. Results suggest that artificial neural networks are good prediction tool for selected network outputs. It was found that experimental results are in very good agreement with computed ones.

40|$|Most {{bacteria}} recovered so {{far from}} sugar <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> during storage represent strains of the species Tetragenococcus halophilus. Recently, several Gram-positive, non-motile, non-sporeforming cocci with other physiological and genetic traits were isolated from sugar <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> samples from different origins. In this study, representative isolates were investigated using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity between these isolates and their closest relative, Tetragenococcus muriaticus, was 97. 4 %. The level of DNA–DNA relatedness between isolate T 1 T, representing the newly found Tetragenococcus isolates, and T. muriaticus was 57 %. Isolate T 1 T had a DNA G+C content of 36. 7 mol%. Phylogenetic data and genomic and phenotypic features demonstrated that the isolates represent a novel species, for which the name Tetragenococcus osmophilus sp. nov. is proposed with T 1 T as the type strain (LMG 26041 T 5 DSM 23765 T). Additionally, T. halophilus isolates from high-salt and highsugar environments showed clear differences in several physiological and genetic characteristics like RAPD fingerprints and 16 S rRNA gene sequences. DNA–DNA hybridizations, however, showed 79 to 80 % relatedness between osmophilic and halophilic T. halophilus isolates, demonstrating that the different strains {{belong to the same}} species. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic differences observed, as well as the different origins of the strains and the industrial relevance of <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation, two subspecies of T. halophilus are described in this manuscript: T. halophilus subsp. halophilus subsp. nov. for the strains isolated from salt media and T. halophilus subsp. flandriensis subsp. nov. for the strains isolated from sugar-rich environments, which were first isolated in Flanders, Belgium. The type strains for the subspecies are IAM 1676 T (5 LMG 11490 T 5 DSM 20339 T) and T 5 T (5 LMG 26042 T 5 DSM 23766 T), respectively. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{inherent}} {{difficulties in}} diffuser and milling operations, coupled with variable cane quality and preparation, often result in unsteady draft and mixed juice {{supply to the}} juice preparation section. It is thus not uncommon for juice surges to cause erratic plant control that results in the sub-optimal operation of juice heating and clarification equipment being detrimental {{to the quality of}} juice supplied to the evaporator station. Different control techniques can be utilised to reduce the effects of surging, but the dynamics of the plant can prove overwhelming and result in frequent interventions by the production staff in an attempt to steady the controls. This paper presents an approach to juice surge management using plant modelling and predictive control techniques, which was developed and practically applied at the Gledhow sugar mill. In an attempt to simulate the plant behaviour, a model of the juice plant was developed in terms of juice flow rates and <b>juice</b> <b>tank</b> levels. This model was used as a tool to design a control system that utilises predictive, rule-based control. The control system’s objectives were to continually maximise evaporator throughput while minimising the effects of juice surging by adhering to preset constraints on variables such as syrup brix, juice flow rates and <b>juice</b> <b>tank</b> levels. The result was a fully automatic control system that required minimal intervention by production staff...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with heat integration of a conceptual hydrogen plant connected with a sugar factory. The sugar factory serves {{as a source of}} sucrose-containing <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> for the hydrogen plant, where this feedstock is processed to hydrogen. Moreover, this connection gives an opportunity to utilize waste heat from the sugar factory. Hydrogen is produced by two-stage fermentation, that is, thermophilic fermentation followed by photofermentation. The gas mixture obtained in the two process stages is supplied to the gas separation system, composed of absorbing and stripping columns for circulating amine solution, to separate hydrogen from carbon dioxide. Using Pinch Technology and considering sugar factory with its CHP plant as an energy source, the hydrogen plant is heat-integrated to minimise the energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|The {{philosophy}} {{of our research}} is built on the behaviour of non-sugar compounds from biomass during ethanolic fermentation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, industrially used to bioconvert sugar into ethanol under anaerobic conditions, assimilates some compounds present in the fermentable juice (proteins, amino acids, [...] .). But others compounds are not used by the yeast. They leave in the vinasse after ethanol distillation and are thus concentrated by the process. Our purpose is to discuss the behaviour of betaine, saponins and raffinose in sugar juices (raw <b>juice,</b> thin <b>juice,</b> <b>thick</b> <b>juice)</b> and in vinasse after ethanolic fermentation.

40|$|Tetragenococcus halophilus was {{originally}} isolated from extreme salt environments. Recently, this bacterium {{was also found}} in sugar <b>thick</b> <b>juice,</b> an intermediate product {{in the production of}} beet sugar having extreme properties such as 69 ° Bx (~aw 0. 82) and pH 9. T. halophilus strains were depicted as the most probable cause of <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> degradation, resulting in considerable economical losses in the sugar industry. Previous research revealed both physiological and genetic differences between T. halophilus strains isolated from salt- and sugar-rich environment, referred to as ‘halophilic’ and ‘osmophilic’ strains, respectively. It was therefore proposed to subdivide the species into two subspecies, T. halophilus subsp. halophilus isolated from salted food and T. halophilus subsp. flandriensis isolated from environments rich in sugar. In this study we report the draft genome assemblies of both subspecies. Both genomes comprise approximately 2. 6 Mbp, with a GC content of 37 %, and showed closest resemblance to the Enterococcus faecalis V 583 genome. Automated annotation of the genome sequences revealed 2440 predicted open reading frames. Preliminary comparison of both genomes revealed unique genes in the osmophilic strain, among which a gene involved in choline and betaine uptake and biosynthesis. Glycine betaine and its precursors choline and glycine betaine aldehyde have been found to confer a high level of osmotic tolerance in E. coli. To our knowledge, this is the first publication of a Tetragenococcus genome sequence. As relatively few strains belonging to the Enterococcaceae family are sequenced, both Tetragenococcus genomes provide valuable information for evolutionary and phylogenetic studies. Furthermore, genome comparison of the osmophilic and halophilic strain will provide new insights in the differences and commonalities regarding the adaptation to sugar- or salt-rich environmentsstatus: publishe...|$|R

Fermentation time and starting sugar content were usedas input variables, i. e. nodes. Neural network had one output node (ethanol content, yeast cell number or sugar content). The hidden layer had nine neurons. Garson's algorithm and connection weights were used for interpreting neural network. The inadequacy of Garson's algorithm {{can be seen by}} comparing with the results of regression analysis, which indicates that the influence of the fermentation time is higher.

Strain KD- 15 simultaneously converted glucose and lactose to ethanol within 48 h, in media containing 10. 0 % to 15. 0 % (w/v) total sugars from saccharified filtrate and whey. For efficient production of ethanol from 15. 0 % (w/v) total sugars, KD- 15 cells were collected after fermentation and inoculated into fresh media. Batch fermentation was successfully repeated at least ten times in medium composed of saccharified potato tubers mixed with whey. Yeast cells began to convert all the sugars to ethanol within 24 h, accompanied by cell propagation after the third batch. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with estimation of heat and power consumption in a conceptual plant to produce hydrogen from sucrose-containing or starchy biomass by fermentation. A hydrogen plant connected with a sugar factory {{is regarded as the}} basic option; the sugar factory serves as a source of sucrose-containing <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> for the hydrogen plant, where this feedstock is processed to hydrogen. As another option, a stand-alone hydrogen plant in which starch must initially be converted to fermentable glucose solution is considered. The values of key process parameters are assumed on the basis of preliminary experimental data. For both options of the hydrogen plant, heat consumption is estimated taking heat recovery in a heat exchanger network into account. Power consumption is estimated by calculating power needed for pumping of liquid and gaseous process media. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Expression of vis 1 is negatively associated with juice viscosity in diverse tomato genotypes. vis 1 exhibits DNA polymorphism among tomato genotypes, and the alleles vis 1 -hta (high-transcript accumulator; accession no.

Segregation of tomato lines heterogeneous for vis 1 alleles indicates that vis 1 influences pectin depolymerization and juice viscosity in ripening fruits. vis 1 is regulated by fruit ripening and high temperature and exhibits a typical {{heat shock protein}} chaperone function when expressed in bacterial cells.

40|$|Lignocellulosic biomass has {{received}} increasing attention as carbon source for microbial fermentations. Pretreatment of the biomass {{is needed to}} liberate sugars with intense treatments yielding higher sugar concentrations (which are economically preferred). However, these intense treatments also result {{in the formation of}} several undesired compounds in concentrations which may reduce the fermentation efficiency. The main inhibitors are solutes (osmostress), product stress (e. g. ethanol, lactic acid, dicarboxylic acid, [...] .), furans (5 -hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural), weak acids (acetic acid, levulinic acid, formic acid) and phenolic and aromatic compounds originating from the lignin fraction (e. g. vanillin). Microorganisms are therefore exposed to a new, challenging and diverse fermentation medium due to the large diversity of lignocellulosic biomass sources and hydrolysis conditions. It is therefore required to align the hydrolysate with a microorganism with the best characteristics in terms of tolerance to inhibitors and sugar consumption profile. In this study, we screened more than 50 yeast isolates isolated from plant nectar and beet sugar <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> for tolerance to weak acids, furans, osmostress and ethanol and compared it with an industrially used S. cerevisiae strain and natural strain (isolated from oak). Non-Saccharomyces yeasts showed better osmotolerance than S. cerevisiae. The species Candida bombi, Wickerhamomyces anomalus and Torulaspora delbrueckii also showed better hydroxymethylfurfural tolerance than S. cerevisiae. T. delbrueckii and Pichia kudriavzevii showed better furfural tolerance. Growth on 2 % xylose as sole carbon source was better for non-Saccharomyces yeasts, with W. anomalus reaching more than 20 % growth relative to 2 % glucose. As a case study, we performed bioethanol fermentations mimicking high gravity fermentations (25 % glucose) and artificial lignocellulose hydrolysates (with a myriad of inhibitors) using 5 selected isolates. Interestingly, among two tested S. cerevisiae strains, the natural strain isolated from an oak tree performed better than Ethanol Red, a S. cerevisiae strain which is currently commonly used in industrial bioethanol fermentations. Additionally, a W. anomalus strain isolated from sugar beet <b>thick</b> <b>juice</b> was found to have a comparable ethanol yield, but needed longer fermentation time. No xylose was fermented to ethanol. Other non-Saccharomyces yeasts yielded lower ethanol amounts. status: publishe...|$|R
