The criteria used for determining the outline of the flat-spin experiment program will be reproducibility and robustness of the manoeuvres, such that a qualitative comparison between experiment and simulation can be made.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the combination of}} Hybrid Automatic Retransmission Request (HARQ) processing with {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) data transmission. <b>The</b> <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> <b>twofold.</b> First, we evaluate a reliable throughput performance metric that composes MIMO as well as HARQ protocol parameters in a single expression. Due to its generic property, this metric can be used by higher layer protocols for traffic engineering in all IP next generation networks. Hence, it facilitates cross-layer design. In particular, we perform an information theoretic consideration by employing the conditional cutoff rate for MIMO transmission while the HARQ processing is described by the renewal-theory. In a second step, we illustrate the generic property of this metric by its straight forward application to a V-BLAST scheme with MMSE detection. The V-BLAST scheme performs a HARQ process per transmit antenna (per data stream) where each data stream is transmitted via a SIMO (single input multiple output) channel. As a result, this paper also indicate that the proposed metric gives hints on designing MIMO-HARQ systems and it can also be employed for packet data MIMO modelling. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{back-propagation}} {{algorithm is}} one of the most widely used training algorithms for neural networks. The training phase of a multilayer perceptron by using this algorithm can take very long time making neural networks difficult to accept. One approach to solve this problem consists in the parallelization of the training algorithm. There exists many different approaches, however most of them are well adapted to specialized hardware. The idea to use a network of workstations as a general purpose parallel computer is widely accepted. However, the communication overhead imposes restrictions in the design of parallel algorithms.

40|$|Abstract. Our {{approach}} to content negotiation is {{a framework of}} mobile agents, where the agents can migrate from user devices to negotiation servers {{in order to get}} more resources. We took this approach and now we introduce new features in the architecture.

Second, to rationalise network and device use spending only the necessary resources. Altogether, it is a new step in the direction marked by the use of mobile agents in mobile devices. This way, computation and bandwidth consumption can be moved out of mobile devices to network devices, where these resources are cheaper. Moreover, in contrast to direct browser-server content negotiation, our agent based negotiation framework provides independence between content negotiation and its consumption, i. e. content can be negotiated and experienced in different user devices, thus better adjusting to user preferences. All this would be especially relevant when third generation (3 G) mobile devices are widely available and more sophisticated multimedia content is available in mobile delivery contexts...|$|E
40|$|Visibility is {{studied and}} used in several fields: {{computer}} graphics, telecommunication, robotics [...] . For instance, in Computer-aided design (CAD) synthesis images are created by simulating light propagation in a scene. Visibility notions are then necessary to compute the visible objects from a point of view, and the shadow of those objects. In mobile robotics the visibility is used for path planning (visibility graph) and localization problems.

40|$|This article {{presents}} an activity-based approach {{for teaching and}} learning applied to Higher Education. <b>The</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> <b>twofold</b> – first to utilise advances of Knowledge Management in education and second to teach the students in Virtual Communities as a powerful modern model for Knowledge Management. According to the classics [Rheingold, 2000] in this field a virtual community (also known from the literature as e-community or online community) {{is a group of}} people (presumably remotely distributed) that interact via some form of remote communications such as letters, telephone, email, or Internet rather than face to face. In modern network environment we can see also online communities where members are available simultaneously. With regard to the used media in online communities could be differentiated text, audio, visual and multimedia communities. The concept of ‘sticky’ virtual community refers to ones where repeated interactions (visits to websites as common place) require particular features in design to support and retain interest. Regular change in content, ability to use as a reference site, superior linkage to other resources, efficient design and many other factors play a part. Virtual and online communities have also become a dominant form of communication between people who are engaged with computer-based work. A computer-mediated community (CMC) uses specific software to regulate the social substance of this interaction. Essential socio-technical change could arise from the liaison of heterogeneous Internet-based social networks. Dealing with social context needs to consider, also, psychological and other factors outside of basic technical design. Through the study of this activity, students will be trained to design, implement and develop virtual communities in a given area by using modern networking and communication tools and techniques. The {{article presents}} major elements and discusses expected learning outcomes, proposed learning and teaching strategy and determines areas of study.

The Simple View of Reading (Gough & Tunmer, 1986; Hoover &Gough, 1986) is a theoretical model that sets out to describe the processes that children need to develop to become proficient readers, that is word recognition or decoding processes and language comprehension processes. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the utility of the Simple View of Reading in a cohort of Irish children attending schools designated as socially disadvantaged. <b>The</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> <b>twofold.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to investigate predictors of reading accuracy, spelling and reading comprehension skills in this sample. <b>The</b> second <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to investigate whether or not these predictors varied with age. The sample comprised fifty-nine children attending two schools. Inclusion criteria were: children between the ages of 5 - 8 years; a sample of children within three ranges of reading abilities as rated by their teachers (teachers were asked to rate the children’s reading ability as above average, average or below average); and a minimum score of 80 on the British Picture Vocabulary Scales (BPVS) (Dunn et al., 1997) to be included. Reading accuracy (single word reading and passage reading), reading comprehension, and spelling were measured using three standardised tests i. e., Weschler Individual Attainment Test 11 UK, Teachers Version (WIAT, 11 UK -T) (Weschler, 2006), the York Assessment of Reading for Comprehension (YARC) (Snowling et al., 2009), and the Single Word Spelling Test (SWST), (Sacre & Masterson, 2000). Potential predictors of literacy skills, such as phonemic awareness and phonic knowledge skills, were measured using criterion-referenced tests. Vocabulary was also a potential predictor and was measured using the BPVS. There was mixed evidence for the Simple View of Reading. While phonic knowledge, phonemic knowledge and non-word reading were predictors of reading, other factors such as vocabulary were also predictors. Although vocabulary was a predictor of reading comprehension for the total sample, the picture was less clear when the effect of age was explored. To conclude, there was mixed evidence to support the Simple View of Reading.   Nonetheless, the findings were encouraging in that children were acquiring literacy skills. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the use of}} alternative codes for arithmetic operators. <b>The</b> <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> <b>twofold.</b> First, to investigate operand codes that yield simpler, i. e., power efficient, arithmetic modules. Second, to investigate signal encodings {{that lead to the}} reduction of the switching activity in the data buses. Although signal correlation is more relevant for address buses, where signal encoding has received much attention, in many cases correlation in the data buses is still very significant. By using lowswitching operand codes directly in the arithmetic modules, the process of encoding and decoding of the signals can be avoided. We propose a Hybrid encoding for the operators, which is a compromise between the minimal input dependency presented by the Binary encoding and the low switching characteristic of the Gray encoding. We present a methodology for the generation of arithmetic operators, such as adders and multipliers, using Hybrid encoded operands. The overall area, delay and power consumption under different word size operators are evaluated for both the Hybrid and Binary modules. The results show that power savings of up to 30 % in array multiplier modules are possible, with 33 % reduction in the switched capacitance in the buses. Additionally, a 17 % delay improvement is achieved, with an area penalty of 30 %. The Hybrid encoding can also be as easily used in address buses where the same 33 % savings can be obtained with low overhead transcoders...|$|E

The analysis of the theoretical notions discussed in the articles shows that the management of the hospital pharmacy departments stands on the concepts associated with the 'Modern era' of organizational theories. As a result, the hospital pharmacy management focuses on technical aspects. The reconsideration by structuration theory point out the strategic issues for hospital pharmacy practice underlie the interaction between the actors of the pharmacy department and the other stakeholders of the health system. A proper management of the hospital pharmacy department goes beyond the technical aspects. It should also target the development of strategic professional skills of the pharmacists. That said, a substantial work remains to be done to understand {{the ins and outs of}} the structuration of the pharmacy practice and the management of its strategic-professional aspects...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantification}} of {{the impact}} of crises on household welfare and socioeconomic outcomes is a fundamental input for the design of ex ante safety nets and ex post alleviation programs. Economic downturns have direct effects through employment and household income, but whether these and other impacts are permanent rather than transitory is harder to establish. This study of Argentina estimates the relationship between GDP growth and severe crises on poverty, youth unemployment, and a series of human capital related outcomes, such as infant and maternal health, and school enrollment and progression. The identification strategy relies on provincial variation in GDP, and on a difference in differences estimation from the severe 1999 - 2002 crisis. <b>The</b> <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> <b>twofold.</b> On the one hand, the study documents the effects of past episodes. On the other hand, it extrapolates past results to provide bounds for the impact of the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis in Argentina. Besides the expected and well-documented relationship between crises and poverty levels, the main finding of this study is a strong effect on infant mortality and low weight at birth. Moreover, there is an asymmetry in these effects: the negative impact of downturns is greater than the positive evolution during recoveries. The results for education variables are more ambiguous, and even counter-cyclical in some cases. The document discusses the implications of these estimates for the current episode. Overall, these results provide evidence of permanent effects of economic crises through lower levels of human capital, worsening health outcomes and increased mortality. ...|$|E
40|$|Scenario {{planning}} can be invaluable for {{empowerment and}} learning in resource dependent communities. Pre-existing scenario planning methods call for collaboration between community members, but when cultural norms prevented men, women, and youth from coming together {{in the community of}} Ukupseni in Panama, the authors and community sought to devise an alternative method. <b>The</b> research <b>objectives</b> <b>were</b> <b>twofold.</b> First, to develop an alternative scenario planning method that would facilitate learning among decision makers about community needs and perspectives, and second, to explore ways to direct desired futures. Instead of forecasting through community-wide collaboration and backcasting with the creation of one vision through consensus, forecasting used individual interviews to create scenarios and backcasting was conducted separately with each of the six community groups (older women, young women with children, young women without children, young men, older men including fishermen and lobster-catchers, and individuals with formal education) resulting in several visions. To unify the results, we created an organizational matrix that allowed the visions of different community groups to be compared. The organizational matrix allowed decision makers to observe that women and youth, the most marginalized members of the community, had convergent visions that were very different from men whose perspectives and knowledge are more often included in decision making...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} a Quality Function Deployment (QFD) currently in work {{the goal of}} which is to add definition and insight to the development of long term Highly Reusable Space Transportation (HRST). <b>The</b> <b>objective</b> here <b>is</b> <b>twofold.</b> First, to describe the process, the actual QFD experience as applies to the HRST study. Second, to describe the preliminary results of this process, in particular the assessment of possible directions for future pursuit such as promising candidate technologies or approaches that may finally open the space frontier. The iterative and synergistic nature of QFD provides opportunities in the process for the discovery of what is key in so far as it is useful, what is not, and what is merely true. Key observations on the QFD process will be presented. The importance of a customer definition as well as the similarity of the process of developing a technology portfolio to product development will be shown. Also, the relation of identified cost and operating drivers to future space vehicle designs that are robust to an uncertain future will be discussed. The results in particular of this HRST evaluation will be preliminary given the somewhat long term (or perhaps not?) nature of the task being considered...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} is brought forward for synchronization of a clustered network in this paper, <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> of which <b>is</b> <b>twofold.</b> <b>The</b> {{first one is}} to study cluster synchronization by analyzing the inner coupling matrices of the individual clusters instead of {{the one of the}} whole network. The other is to show that full synchronization can be ensured by several types of cluster synchronization, the partitions of which are connected together. Compared with the classical method for full synchronization, our approach reduces the network size to the cluster size and additionally obtains the thresholds for different types of cluster synchronization. As a numerical example, cluster and full synchronization in a special clustered network are investigated through our approach. It turns out that we obtain the same threshold for full synchronization as the one obtained by the classical method. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of our approach...|$|R
