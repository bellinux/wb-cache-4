By 1953 he had become Second Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine. After Anastas Mikoyan's resignation, Podgorny was voted into office as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. After Premier Alexei Kosygin's fall from favour Podgorny became the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union until his removal as head of state in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The central {{administration}} at Huế {{was divided into}} six ministries: Public affairs, finance, rites, war, justice and public works. Each was under a minister, assisted by two deputies {{and two or three}} councillors. Each of these ministries had around 70 employees assigned to various units. The heads of these ministries formed the Supreme Council. A treasurer general and a Chief of the Judicial Service assisted a governor general, {{who was in charge of}} a number of provinces. The provinces were classified into trấn and dinh. These were in turn divided into phủ, huyện and châu. All important matters were examined by the Supreme Council in the presence of Gia Long.

5|$|During the Song period, {{there was}} a great deal of {{organized}} labor and bureaucracy involved in the extraction of resources from the various provinces in China. The production of sulfur, which the Chinese called 'vitriol liquid', was extracted from pyrite and used for pharmaceutical purposes as well as for the creation of gunpowder. This was done by roasting iron pyrites, converting the sulphide to oxide, as the ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthenware furnace with a type of still-head to send the sulfur over as vapour, after which it would solidify and crystallize. The historical text of the Song Shi (History of the Song, compiled in 1345 AD) stated that the major producer of sulfur in the Tang and Song dynasties was the Jin Zhou sub-provincial administrative region (modern Linfen in southern Shanxi). <b>The</b> <b>bureaucrats</b> appointed to the region managed the industrial processing and sale of it, and the amount created and distributed from the years 996 to 997 alone was 405,000 jin (roughly 200 tons). It was recorded that in 1076 AD the Song government held a strict commercial monopoly on sulfur production, and if dye houses and government workshops sold their products to private dealers in the black market, they were subject to meted penalties by government authorities. Even before this point, in 1067 AD, the Song government had issued an edict that the people living in Shanxi and Hebei were forbidden to sell foreigners any products containing saltpetre and sulfur. This act by the Song government displayed their fears of the grave potential of gunpowder weapons being developed by Song China's territorial enemies as well (i.e. the Tanguts and Khitans).|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} a politician, an agent to the society, {{who wants to}} construct a dam that benefits the society. Due to various reasons such as lack of knowledge or time to construct and coordinate the construction work of the dam, the politician delegate these activities to its employee, a <b>bureaucrat.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> her self delegates the construction work of the dam to a contractor. The politician allocates a fixed budget to <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> so as to maximize the expected values the dam gives to the society. Given <b>the</b> budget, <b>bureaucrat</b> designs an incentive feasible menu of contract to <b>the</b> contractor. <b>The</b> <b>bureaucrat’s</b> contract specifies <b>the</b> quality of the dam constructed and the contingent transfer to the contractor. Satisfying the incentives and participation constraints of <b>the</b> contractor, <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> maximizes <b>the</b> expected value of the dam and the excess budget. The excess budget to <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> is <b>the</b> difference between the budget allocated to her and the contingent transfer she makes to <b>the</b> contractor. <b>Bureaucrat</b> values an excess budget by attaching a weight. Bureaucrat attaches larger weight to the excess budget values it more than those attach a lower weight. In order to judge the expected value of the dam under the contract offered by <b>bureaucrat,</b> I choose <b>the</b> standard second best contract as the benchmark. Comparing the contract offered by <b>bureaucrat</b> to <b>the</b> benchmark, I show that bureaucrat offers a contract that provides a better expected value of the dam to the society than the benchmark contract. Even though bureaucrat offers a better contract than the benchmark, the objective she involves in maximizing excess budget creates {{a problem for the}} politician and the society. Thus, I show that direct control by the politician can decrease <b>the</b> weight <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> attaches to <b>the</b> excess budget and provides a better expected value of the dam to the society. I also extend the model to a case in which the Politician’s objective function sets to internalize the pollution cost due to the construction of the dam so as to attain the socially minimum and efficient level of pollution. Assuming that the objective of <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> is not set in such way that she internalizes the pollution cost arises from the construction of the dam, I show that centralized contract by the politician can solve this difference in objectives between the politician and <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> and helps <b>the</b> politician to control <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} power of {{incentives}} in bureaucracies by studying contracts offered by a bureaucrat to her agent. <b>The</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> operates under a fixed budget, optimally chosen by a funding authority, and she can engage in policy drift, which we define as inversely related to her intrinsic motivation. Interaction between a fixed budget and policy drift results in low-powered incentives. We discuss how <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> may benefit from stricter accountability as it leads to larger budgets. Low-powered incentives remain even in an alternative centralized setting, where the funding authority contracts directly with the agent using <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> to monitor output...|$|R

25|$|The {{imperial}} {{factor was}} a double-edged sword: Rhodes {{did not want}} <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrats</b> of the Colonial Office in London to interfere in the Empire in Africa. He wanted British settlers and local politicians and governors to run it. This {{put him on a}} collision course with many in Britain, as well as with British missionaries, who favoured what they saw as the more ethical direct rule from London. Rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of South Africa against his future mining profits. The Colonial Office did not have enough funding for this. Rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of Britain: preventing the Portuguese, the Germans or the Boers from moving into south-central Africa. Rhodes' companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions, as exemplified by the Rudd and Lochner Concessions.|$|E

25|$|As income {{inequality}} has increased, {{the degree of}} House of Representatives polarization measured by voting record has also increased. The voting is mostly by the rich and for the rich {{making it hard to}} achieve equal income and resource distribution for the average population (Bonica et al., 2013). There is a little number of people who turn to government insurance with the rising wealth and real income since they consider inequality within the different government sectors. Additionally, there has been an increased influence by the rich on the regulatory, legislative and electoral processes within the country that has led to improved employment standards for <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrats</b> and politicians. Professors McCarty, Pool and Rosenthal wrote in 2007 that polarization and {{income inequality}} fell in tandem from 1913 to 1957 and rose together dramatically from 1977 on. They show that Republicans have moved politically to the right, away from redistributive policies that would reduce income inequality. Polarization thus creates a feedback loop, worsening inequality.|$|E
25|$|General Brusilov's initial {{orders were}} for Austrian laws {{to remain in}} effect and for Austrian {{officials}} to continue their duties – {{in the name of}} the Russian tsar instead of the Austrian emperor – as long as they would not be suspected of possible treason to the new Russian authorities. This policy proved difficult, because many Austrian officials had fled, and because the loyalty to Russia of those who remained was in doubt. Initially local Galician Russophiles were used to staff positions. However, in time the bureaucracy came to be staffed overwhelmingly by officlals transferred in from neighboring regions of the Russian Empire. As often happens in such reassignments, <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrats</b> of the neighboring regions took advantage of the opportunity to transfer out those with the least amount of ability, experience, education as well as those who caused trouble. As a result, in addition to understaffing the Russian administration in Galicia suffered from poor quality in personnel. Many of the transferees belonged to right-wing Russian nationalist parties who espoused anti-Semitism as well as hostility towards Ukrainians and Poles.|$|E

40|$|It is {{frequently}} assumed that <b>the</b> expertise of <b>bureaucrats</b> gives them policy-making power. This paper examines critically this proposition {{on the basis}} of a study of 52 regulations passed in six jurisdictions.

Expertise is primarily understood as either scientific expertise or policy expertise knowledge or experience of a specific policy area. In each tableau the significance of expertise as a source of influence can be questioned. Where "experts" have influence, it is because of their status rather than the content of their expertise. Max Weber himself was ambivalent about the importance of expertise and its role in strengthening bureaucratic power in policy-making is likely to have been exaggerated...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{emergence}} and interaction of {{red tape and}} corruption in a principal-bureaucrat-agent hierarchy. The principal is to provide the agent with a unit of a good that involves externalities so that market mechanisms fail to achieve first best. Red tape partially solves the problem. While imposing a cost on the agent, red tape also produces information about the agent’s type. Therefore the socially optimal level of red tape is not trivial. It is hard, however, to implement the social optimum if <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> in charge of red tape is corrupt. We consider two types of corruption. First, <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> may extort bribes from the agent in exchange for {{reducing the amount of}} red tape. Second, <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> may take bribes to conceal the information produced through red tape. The former kind of corruption tends to reduce red tape, while the latter provides incentives for excessive red tape: the more red tape, the more likely <b>the</b> <b>bureaucrat</b> can get <b>the</b> bribes ex post. We show that the latter effect prevails, and the equilibrium level of red tape is always above the social optimum. corruption; red tape; three-tier hierarchy...|$|R

500|$|For {{the next}} five years Playford was to remain a backbencher, and to involve himself {{relatively}} little in government matters.

A new member's maiden speech is traditionally heard politely without the interruption and heckling prevalent in Australian politics, but Playford's aggressive debut in parliament was not accorded this privilege as [...] "a casual visitor could have mistaken him" [...] for an opposition member.

Instead, the dissent believed that common English should be used to interpret statutes, and therefore, under the statue, Abramski was the [...] "person" [...] buying the gun, not Alvarez. Furthermore, the dissent did not think that the statute is [...] "rendered meaningless" [...] simply because one can buy a gun on behalf of another, just like it is not rendered meaningless when one gifts a gun. The dissent also wondered why the majority wouldn't agree that this is yet another loophole to a statute that has so many loopholes, and argued that perhaps it was congress' intent to only limit the actual person at the counter. The dissent also stated that even if the majority had the proper interpretation of the statute, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity. Regarding the Section 924 charges, the dissent explained that the statute clearly lists what the dealer is required to maintain on record, and that {{the answer to the question}} of whether he is the actual buyer is not on the list.
