5000|$|A triple-click is {{the action}} of {{clicking}} a computer mouse button three times quickly without moving the mouse. Along with clicking and double-clicking, triple-clicking allows three different actions {{to be associated with}} the same mouse button. Criticism of the double-click mechanism is even more valid for triple-clicks. [...] However, few applications assign critical actions to a <b>triple</b> <b>click.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{critical}} element to playing the bones is {{not trying to}} force them to make contact with one another through finger manipulation but allowing their momentum to do the work. By moving the hand {{back and forth across the}} chest, with just enough force on the bones to keep them from falling out of the hand, a patient learner can produce a <b>triple</b> <b>click.</b> This [...] "click-it-y" [...] sound is the essential ingredient to playing the bones. A double-click can be produced by the same movement of the hand with the addition of a bit of pressure to the bones to suppress the third click. Once these elemental triple and double figures have been mastered, they can be combined to create complex combinations of rhythmic sounds. The effect is further enhanced by the use of two pairs of bones, one in each hand. A skilled practitioner can produce a wide variety of percussive sounds reminiscent of those made by a tap dancer.|$|E

30|$|Future {{work should}} also {{consider}} {{details of the}} switch device. Different patients are able to use different muscles to control a switch device. A person who uses eye blinks (Bauby, 1997), a sip-puff headset, or manipulates EEG signals (Serby, Yom-Tov & Inbar, 2005) may produce very different error probabilities than what is reported here and thus would require different keyboard designs. Future work should also explore easier methods of estimating and modeling a user’s ability to use the switch device. Koester & Simpson (2014) simply measured how well users could trigger single, double, and <b>triple</b> <b>clicks</b> of the switch device. Such an approach would be much faster than the empirical approach used here. Likewise, Simpson, Koester and LoPresti (2007) proposed that an appropriate cursor duration is one that generates a ratio of the user’s reaction time and the cursor duration equal to 0.65. If true in general, then it should be easy to model error probabilities. Regardless of the empirical method, once the error probabilities for a user’s ability with a switch device are identified and modeled, the optimization algorithm described here can be readily applied.|$|R
