50|$|Small {{molecule}} drug conjugates or SMDCs {{are built}} with three modules: a <b>targeting</b> <b>ligand,</b> a linker and a drug payload. The targeting ligands consist of low molecular weight, high-affinity ligands that are precisely linked to potent drugs. The linkers {{are designed to}} be stable in the bloodstream and then release the active drug from the <b>targeting</b> <b>ligand</b> when the SMDC is taken up by the diseased cell. The drug payloads are highly active molecules that are too toxic to be administered in their untargeted forms at therapeutic dose levels. This modular approach allows varying targeting ligands, linker systems and drug payloads and generate SMDCs for different diseases.The most advanced SMDC is vintafolide, a derivative of the anti-mitotic chemotherapy drug vinblastine which is chemically linked to folic acid.|$|E

40|$|The {{successful}} use {{of targeted}} radionuclide therapy {{in the treatment}} of solid tumours may be limited by radioresistance, which necessitates delivery of a high dose of radioactivity. Nanoparticle (NP) -based delivery systems possess a large surface area for attachment of radioisotopes and so offer a solution to this challenge. However, tumour uptake may be limited by rapid hepatic clearance of NP via the mononuclear phagocyte system. Liver uptake is further compounded when epidermal growth factor (EGF) is used as a <b>targeting</b> <b>ligand,</b> as EGF-tagged NP bind the EGF receptor (EGFR), which is expressed to a moderate extent by hepatocytes. This report describes an indium- 111 (111 In) -labelled PEGylated EGF-tagged gold (Au) NP (111 In-EGF-Au-PEG) and an effective strategy of coadministration of <b>targeting</b> <b>ligand</b> to address these issues. Direct attachment of EGF to the surface of Au NP did not compromise surface coating with long-chain PEG. In vitro experiments showed that 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG targets EGFR-positive cancer cells (MDA-MB- 468) : > 11 % of radioactivity was internalised after incubation for 4 h. In in vivo studies accumulation of NP was observed in MDA-MB- 468 xenografts and tumour uptake was enhanced by the coadministration of 15 µg of the unlabelled <b>targeting</b> <b>ligand,</b> EGF, to block hepatic EGFR. Uptake was 3. 9 % versus 2. 8 % injected dose/g (%ID/g) of tumour tissue with and without unlabelled EGF, respectively. Coadministration of EGF reduced liver uptake by 25. 95 % to 7. 56 %ID/g.

40|$|Abstract. After endocytosis, lysosomally <b>targeted</b> <b>ligands</b> {{pass through}} a series of endosomal compartments.

Using this approach, unnatural amino acids {{have been successfully}} incorporated with high translational efficiency and fidelity. In this study, CHARMM-based molecular docking and free energy calculations were used to evaluate rational design of specific protein–ligand interactions for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. A series of novel unnatural amino acid ligands were docked into the p -benzoyl- L -phenylalanine tRNA synthetase, which revealed that the binding pocket of the enzyme does not provide sufficient space for significantly larger ligands. Specific binding site residues were mutated to alanine to create additional space to accommodate larger <b>target</b> <b>ligands,</b> and then mutations were introduced to improve binding free energy. This approach was used to redesign binding sites for several different <b>target</b> <b>ligands,</b> which were then tested against the standard 20 amino acids to verify target specificity.

40|$|Molecular imaging is an {{emerging}} field {{that seeks to}} combine the mechanistic detail of biochemical assays with the the broad phenotypic data obtained from non-invasive medical imaging. A cornerstone of molecular imaging {{is the ability to}} chemically attach a contrast-inducing payload to a <b>targeting</b> <b>ligand,</b> a protein that binds tightly and specifically to the targeted cell population. There are currently many approaches to bioconjugation. Chemical approaches have broad applicability, but lack the site-specificity and efficiency desired for contrast agent generation. Enzymatic techniques are quantitative, efficient, and site-specific, but often have limited scope and can add significant bulk to the <b>targeting</b> <b>ligand</b> or require additional downstream purification steps. In this work, we create a novel bioconjugation and protein purification technique, Sortase-Tag Expressed Protein Ligation (STEPL). By fusing the active domain of S. aureus Sortase A to the <b>targeting</b> <b>ligand</b> as part of a greater chimeric protein, we are able to combine protein purification and the C-terminal bioconjugation of that protein into a single step. Using a mass-action kinetics model, we prove that this results in a modular, efficient system capable of producing high-purity conjugated protein. We then use the system to generate contrast agents for fluorescent and magnetic imaging studies. The modularity of the STEPL system allows us to create an array of monospecific and bispecific <b>targeting</b> <b>ligand</b> dimers, linked by two different spacer regions. The dimers 2 ̆ 7 binding properties are probed and they are used to successfully bind and label cells, with the bispecific proteins enhancing contrast of a cell line that is positive for both targets.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of Doxil® on the market nearly 20 years ago, a number of nanomedicines {{have become part of}} treatment regimens in the clinic. With the exception of antibody–drug conjugates, these nanomedicines are all devoid of <b>targeting</b> <b>ligands</b> and rely solely on their physicochemical properties and the (patho) physiological processes in the body for their biodistribution and targeting capability. At the same time, many preclinical studies have reported on nanomedicines exposing <b>targeting</b> <b>ligands,</b> or ligand-targeted nanomedicines, yet none of these have been approved at this moment. In the present review, we provide a concise overview of 13 ligand-targeted particulate nanomedicines (ligand-targeted PNMs) that have progressed into clinical trials. The progress of each ligand-targeted PNM is discussed based on available (pre) clinical data. Main conclusions of these analyses are that (a) ligand-targeted PNMs have proven to be safe and efficacious in preclinical models; (b) the vast majority of ligand-targeted PNMs is generated for the treatment of cancer; (c) contribution of <b>targeting</b> <b>ligands</b> to the PNM efficacy is not unambiguously proven; and (d) <b>targeting</b> <b>ligands</b> do not cause localization of the PNM within the target tissue, but rather provide benefits in terms of target cell internalization and target tissue retention once the PNM has arrived at the target site. Increased understanding of the in vivo fate and interactions of the ligand-targeted PNMs with proteins and cells in the human body is mandatory to rationally advance the clinical translation of ligand-targeted PNMs. Future perspectives for ligand-targeted PNM approaches include the delivery of drugs that are unable or inefficient in passing cellular membranes, treatment of drug resistant tumors, targeting of the tumor blood supply, the generation of targeted vaccines and nanomedicines that are able to cross the blood–brain barrier...|$|R
40|$|Specific {{interactions}} between receptors and their <b>target</b> <b>ligands</b> {{in the presence}} of non-target ligands are crucial for biological processes such as T cell ligand discrimination.

40|$|Abstract: The {{rational}} {{design of}} a nanoplatform in drug delivery {{plays a crucial role}} in determining its targeting specificity and efficacy in vivo. A conventional approach relies on the surface conjugation of a nanometer-sized particle with two functionally distinct types of molecules, one as a <b>targeting</b> <b>ligand,</b> and the other as a therapeutic agent to be delivered to the diseased cell.

In this review, we evaluate the validity of this new strategy by using methotrexate, which displays multifunctional mechanisms of action. Methotrexate binds to the folate receptor, a surface biomarker frequently overexpressed in tumor cells, and also inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme critical for cell survival and division. Thus we describe a series of fifth generation poly(amido amine) dendrimers conjugated with methotrexate, and discuss several lines of evidence supporting the efficacy of this new platform strategy based on surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, enzyme activity assays, and cell-based studies with folate receptor (+) KB cancer cells...|$|E
