5|$|Communally {{roosting}} birds, the dusky woodswallow has {{a variety}} of chattering calls which are used in certain situations. The most distinctive of <b>these</b> <b>calls</b> is perhaps the one which is used when a predator or intruder approaches, which consists of a harsh mobbing call to warn others.|$|E
5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes {{as a prelude}} to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. <b>These</b> <b>calls</b> can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E
5|$|One of Bart's early {{hallmarks}} was his prank {{calls to}} Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe {{and asks for}} a gag name. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. <b>These</b> <b>calls</b> were apparently based {{on a series of}} prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings, though Groening has denied any causal connection.|$|E

5|$|Ruffed lemurs use alarm {{calls that}} {{differentiate}} between ground and aerial predators. For instance an abrupt roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian predator, and a pulsed squawk or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground predator. When sounding <b>these</b> <b>calls,</b> such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} {{produces}} {{a variety of}} vocalizations, {{the most common of}} which are the tremolo, the yodel, the wail, and the hoot. Each of <b>these</b> <b>calls</b> communicates a distinct message. The frequency at which it vocalizes has been shown to vary based on time of day, weather, and season. It is most vocally active between mid-May and mid-June. The wail, yodel, and tremolo calls are sounded more frequently at night than during the day; calls have also been shown to occur more frequently in cold temperatures and when there is little to no rain.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} call is {{emitted by}} a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and {{is accompanied by a}} vibration of the body. Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. All of <b>these</b> <b>calls</b> are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed. A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases the frog.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{factors that}} affect the BFO are a {{translation}} made at the ground station between the reception and processing of the signal (which is monitored and can be factored in) and a fixed bias in the aircraft and satellite oscillators due to drift and ageing (which can be calibrated by measures recorded when the aircraft's location and speed were known). At 2:40 and 6:14, ground-to-aircraft phone calls were made that were unanswered by the cockpit but acknowledged by the SDU. The signals associated with <b>these</b> <b>calls</b> could not be analysed to generate a BTO value, but BFO values of these signals can {{be considered in the}} analysis with the other BTO and BFO data.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two years}} later the people of Fenton voted in favour of {{incorporation}} of the borough, while further meetings in Stoke and Burslem came out against incorporation but reiterated calls for {{the appointment of a}} stipendiary magistrate. Later the same year, a further call for better policing was made at a meeting chaired by the Duke of Sutherland. <b>These</b> <b>calls</b> were heard and in 1839 two acts of Parliament were passed, the Staffordshire Potteries Stipendiary Justice Act (2 & 3 Vict. c.15) and the Staffordshire Potteries Improvement and Police Act (2 & 3 Vict. c.xliv). This legislation created boards of commissioners with the same powers given to Hanley and Burslem by the 1825 acts. Following these amendments to local policing and justice, the discussion of co-operation and federation between the various townships was subdued for several decades.|$|E
5|$|Red wattlebirds are noisy animals, {{producing}} {{a range of}} raucous calls. Pairs of birds appear to duet, particularly at food sources, with the male {{producing a}} loud cackle and the female a whistling call. The male's cackle is loudest between 1and 3kHz frequency. A guttural-sounding call, it has been variously described as having a squawking, coughing or hiccuping sound. Males cackle when foraging by themselves, when with other birds, or when declaring their territory to other birds. The whistling call consists of up to five rapid whistles {{that may or may}} not ascend in tone and are repeated 3–4 times. Both sexes commonly utter a single chock note that may be harsh and guttural or have 4–5 harmonics. This is thought to be a contact call. <b>These</b> <b>calls</b> all carry over long distances.|$|E

5|$|Beginning about 6:45, {{many members}} of the public began calling NBC network and {{affiliate}} switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if Heidi would start on time. <b>These</b> <b>calls</b> jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that Heidi would start on time. The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.|$|E
5|$|In the past, jackals {{competed with}} tigers and leopards, feeding on {{the remains of}} their kills and, in one case, on a dead tiger. Leopards once hunted jackals, but today the tiger is extinct in the jackal's range, and the leopard is rare. The jackal's {{competitors}} are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. Wolves dominate jackals, and jackals dominate foxes. In Europe, the range of wolves and jackals is mutually exclusive, with jackals abandoning their territory {{with the arrival of}} a wolf pack. One experiment used loudspeakers to broadcast the calls of jackals, and this attracted wolves at a trotting pace to chase away the perceived competitors. Dogs responded to <b>these</b> <b>calls</b> in the same way while barking aggressively. Unleashed dogs have been observed to immediately chase away jackals when the jackals were detected. The jackal's recent expansion throughout eastern and western Europe has been attributed to the extermination of the local wolf populations. The present diffusion of the jackal into the northern Adriatic hinterland is in areas where the wolf is absent or very rare.|$|E
5|$|The {{antelope}} is shy and elusive. When alarmed, {{it stands}} motionless and may nervously leap {{away from the}} danger or even sprint. It often conceals itself in tall grasses to escape predators. The use of alarm calls to alert others is not common because the antelope tries to avoid the attention of predators. However, in extreme cases, <b>these</b> <b>calls</b> {{may be used to}} warn predators that they have been identified. Adults mark vegetation in their territories with a colourless secretion of preorbital glands, that soon condenses to form a white film. They maintain multiple latrine sites where piles of their pellet droppings are formed by regular use. Latrine sites can be confused with those of the barking deer but the pellets are longer and larger in four-horned antelopes. Submissive display consists of shrinking the body, lowering the head and pulling the ears back. Predators of four-horned antelopes include tigers, leopards, and dholes.|$|E

5|$|Woodpeckers do {{not have}} such {{a wide range of}} songs and calls as do {{passerine}} birds, and the sounds they make tend to be simpler in structure. Calls produced include brief high-pitched notes, trills, rattles, twittering, whistling, chattering, nasal churrs, screams and wails. <b>These</b> <b>calls</b> are used by both sexes in communication and are related to the circumstances of the occasion; these include courtship, territorial disputes and alarm calls. Each species has its own range of calls, which tend to be in the 1 to 2.5 kHz range for efficient transmission through forested environments. Mated couples may exchange muted, low-pitched calls, and nestlings often issue noisy begging-calls from inside their nest cavity. The wrynecks have a more musical song and in some areas, the song of the newly arrived Eurasian wryneck is considered to be the harbinger of spring. The piculets either have a song consisting of a long descending trill, or a descending series of two to six (sometimes more) individual notes, and this song alerts ornithologists to the presence of the birds, as they are easily overlooked.|$|E
25|$|The first calls, routine reports {{stating the}} weather as cloudy and overcast, were {{received}} at 2:45 {{and just before}} 5am on July 2. <b>These</b> <b>calls</b> were broken up by static, {{but at this point}} the aircraft would still be a long distance from Howland.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the fall}} of Tripoli when forces of the NTC had largely taken control of Libya, there were calls for al-Megrahi to be extradited to the United States. <b>These</b> <b>calls</b> were {{dismissed}} by the Scottish government and the NTC in Libya {{until such time as}} a decision can be made by the new elected government".|$|E
25|$|<b>These</b> <b>calls</b> for {{a militia}} {{continued}} to grow with the Wairau Affray. The calls eventually lead to a bill being introduced to the Legislative Assembly in 1844.
