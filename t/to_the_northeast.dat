5|$|Irene {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter, Florida early on October 16, {{still as a}} Category1 hurricane. It turned to the north, {{remained}} a hurricane despite little convection, then turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>northeast</b> {{in response to an}} approaching upper-level trough. Just offshore, Irene moved parallel to the coastlines of South Carolina and North Carolina on October 17. On October 18, as it interacted with very warm ocean waters and the upper level trough, Irene rapidly intensified, reaching peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) with a pressure of 952mbar, a Category 2 hurricane. Despite its strength, the circulation was very asymmetrical, and the convection was not particularly organized. The hurricane continued to accelerate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>northeast,</b> steadily weakening until becoming extratropical on October 19 to the south of Newfoundland. The extratropical storm continued <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>northeast</b> until becoming absorbed by another, larger extratropical storm late that same day.|$|E
