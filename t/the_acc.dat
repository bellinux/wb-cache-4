5|$|The {{impetus for}} {{federation}} {{did not extend}} to the administration of cricket, however. <b>The</b> <b>ACC</b> continued to attract criticism for being ineffectual and {{at a meeting of}} the Victorian Cricket Association in July 1898, Trott (in his capacity as a delegate for the South Melbourne club) tabled a motion that Victoria secede from <b>the</b> <b>ACC.</b> Although the proposal was defeated by a single vote, Trott was one of twelve Test players who signed a letter to <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> secretary calling for the disbanding of the organisation.

5|$|After poor {{attendance}} in <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> Championship Game at Jacksonville {{for the second}} straight year, ACC officials and representatives of the conference's member schools elected not to extend the Gator Bowl Association's contract to host the game.

5|$|Following the {{absorption}} of Virginia Tech and Miami into <b>the</b> <b>ACC,</b> questions arose about how an 11-team league could fairly select participants in the conference championship game. A divisional structure involving two six-team divisions competing for two championship-game slots would not be possible. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> could not continue to select its champion via round-robin play since there were now 11 teams and only seven or eight conference games available per team. Even the NCAA's addition of a 12th game to the regular season did little to relieve the conference's problem. Prior to the 2004college football season, <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> requested a waiver to the NCAA's rule requiring conferences to have 12-plus teams before having a conference championship game. Before the season began, however, the NCAA rejected the ACC's application, and the league had to use a semi-round-robin format to select a champion during the 2004 football season. After that season, the inclusion of Boston College as the ACC's 12th team solved the problem of enabling <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> to have a championship football game.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ACC</b> Championship Game {{traditionally}} {{matches the}} winner of the Coastal and Atlantic Divisions of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Prior to 2005, no championship game existed. The idea for a championship game originated with the league's 2004expansion, which added former Big East members Miami, Virginia Tech, and (in 2005) Boston College. A request to the National Collegiate Athletic Association by conference officials to hold a championship game following the 2004 season was rejected because <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> lacked the requisite 12teams, and so the league's first championship game had to wait until after Boston College's addition, which had been delayed at the school's request. With the addition of Boston College, <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> consisted of 12 teams, allowing it to hold a conference championship game under NCAA rules.

40|$|Background: The {{anterior}} cingulate cognitive division (ACcd) plays {{a central}} role in attentional processing by: 1) modulating stimulus selection (i. e., focusing attention) and/or 2) mediating response selection. We hypothesized that ACcd dysfunction might therefore contribute to producing core features of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), namely inattention and impulsivity. ADHD subjects have indeed shown performance deficits on the Color Stroop, an attentional/cognitive interference task known to recruit <b>the</b> <b>ACcd.</b> Recently, <b>the</b> Counting Stroop, a Stroop-variant specialized for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), produced ACcd activation in healthy adults. In the present fMRI study, the Counting Stroop was used to examine the functional integrity of <b>the</b> <b>ACcd</b> in ADHD. Methods: Sixteen unmedicated adults from two groups (8 with ADHD and 8 matched control subjects) performed the Counting Stroop during fMRI. Results: While both groups showed an interference effect, the ADHD group, in contrast to control subjects, failed to activate <b>the</b> <b>ACcd</b> during <b>the</b> Counting Stroop. Direct comparisons showed ACcd activity was significantly higher in the control group. ADHD subjects did activate a frontostriatal-insular network, indicating ACcd hypoactivity was not caused by globally poor neuronal responsiveness. Conclusions: The data support a hypothesized dysfunction of <b>the</b> <b>ACcd</b> in ADHD. Biol Psychiatry 1999; 45...|$|R
