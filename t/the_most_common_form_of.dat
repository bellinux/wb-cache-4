There are {{different}} types of adoption; embryo adoption when a couple is having trouble conceiving a child and instead choose to have their sperm and egg conjoined outside the womb, international adoption where couples adopt children that come from foreign countries, and private adoption which is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> adoption.

5|$|Despite {{the common}} {{period in which}} castles rose to {{prominence}} in Europe, their form and design varied from region to region. In the early 11thcentury, the motte and keep– an artificial mound surmounted by a palisade and tower– was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> castle in Europe, everywhere except Scandinavia. While Britain, France, and Italy shared a tradition of timber construction that was continued in castle architecture, Spain more commonly used stone or mud-brick as the main building material.|$|E

5|$|Printed pattern {{books were}} not easily obtainable, and a sampler or {{embroidered}} record of stitches and patterns was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> reference. 16th-century English samplers were stitched {{on a narrow}} band of fabric and totally covered with stitches.

5|$|Ticks {{are small}} arachnids, {{part of the}} order Parasitiformes. Along with mites, they {{constitute}} the subclass Acari. Ticks are ectoparasites (external parasites), living by feeding on the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians.

Ticks are widely distributed around the world, especially in warm, humid climates.|$|E
5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a {{urinary tract infection}} each year. They are more common in women than men.

5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and {{play a vital role}} in ammonia oxidation.|$|E
5|$|During the Postclassic period, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> human {{sacrifice}} was heart extraction, {{influenced by the}} method used by the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico; this usually {{took place in the}} courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the pyramid. Depending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet. The officiating priest would then remove his ritual attire and dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that symbolized the rebirth of life. Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{new types}} of burials and more {{imposing}} ones have been unearthed, which display {{a great variety of}} luxurious objects. Among the various burial types, the shaft grave became <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> elite burial, a feature that gave the name to the early period of Mycenaean Greece. Among the Mycenaean elite, deceased men were usually laid to rest in gold masks and funerary armor, and women in gold crowns and clothes gleaming with gold ornaments. The royal shaft graves next to the acropolis of Mycenae, in particular the Grave Circles A and B signified the elevation of a native Greek-speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long-distance sea trade.|$|E

From the Great Commentarys description, the Neo-Confucian Zhu Xi reconstructed a method of yarrow stalk divination that is still used throughout the Far East. In the modern period, Gao Heng attempted his own reconstruction, which varies from Zhu Xi in places. Another divination method, employing coins, became widely used in the Tang dynasty and is still used today. In the modern period, alternative methods such as specialized dice and cartomancy have also appeared.|$|E
5|$|Unlike England, Scotland had no towns {{dating from}} Roman occupation. From {{the twelfth century}} there are records of burghs, {{chartered}} towns, which became major centres of crafts and trade. and {{there is evidence of}} 55 burghs by 1296. There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade and {{until the end of the}} period barter was probably <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> exchange. Nevertheless, craft and industry remained relatively undeveloped before the end of the Middle Ages and, although there were extensive trading networks based in Scotland, while the Scots exported largely raw materials, they imported increasing quantities of luxury goods, resulting in a bullion shortage and perhaps helping to create a financial crisis in the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding {{the arrival of the}} unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E

5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E

5|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is a congenital {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, {{which can lead to}} the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E
