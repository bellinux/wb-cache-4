40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} agronomic strategies on the nutritional quality of head lettuce was investigated. The factors included were irrigation type, fertiliser input type and level. The assessed ingredient parameters were nitrate, lutein, ß-carotene and polyphenols. Hygiene {{was described by}} total aerobic bacterial count and number of coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae. Lettuce treated with mineral nitrogen fertiliser (calcium ammonium nitrate) displayed a higher nitrate content than lettuce treated with organic manures (fresh farmyard manure (FYM), rotten FYM (fermented nettle extract). Nitrate concentration in lettuce tended to increase with increasing amounts of fertiliser, independent of fertiliser type. Fertiliser type and level also affected the carotenoid content. Rapidly available nitrogen from mineral fertiliser gave higher lutein levels compared with slowly released nitrogen. Similar results were observed for ß-carotene.

An appropriate management of the potassium fertilisation is suggested as a way of improving the quality of the Cynara biomass for solid fuel applications. In this work a factorial experiment was designed involving two types of fertilisers, KCl and K 2 SO 4, and two K rates, in order to study the effect of potassium fertilisation on the composition and thermal behaviour of Cynara biomass. The results proved that the potassium content of Cynara biomass increases with the potassium fertilisation.

The main {{aim of this study}} was to identify and develop Best Management Practices to control NPS pollution in the Simiyu Catchment. The SWAT model was used to stimulate and assess the Best Management Practices Scenario for the catchment. The catchment was divided into seven (7) sub-basins. The results show that there was no intensive use of artifical fertilisers in the catchment and manure is the major <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> in use. Simulation was done for the period 2000 to 2005. High nutrient concentration was observed in Sub-basin 6; 0. 558 - 0. 779 kgN/ha/yr than in Sub-basin 7; 0. 018 - 0. 115 kgN/ha/yr, despite the larger area of coverage by the latter. This is also irrespective of the fact that Sub-basin 7 covers a larger area, 3, 426. 52 km 2 compared to Sub-basin 6 (72. 97 km 2) and Sub-basin 4 (618. 16 km 2).

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{pathways}} of nitrogen (N) loss from agricultural systems is represented by ammonia (NH 3) volatilisation. At the global scale, soil application of livestock manures and N-fertilisers {{represents one of the}} main sources of this atmospheric pollutant. A literature review was carried out over 78 field trials in order to collect and summarise the research on NH 3 emission from land application of manure and N-fertiliser in Italy. Data availability proved to be still limited in terms of coverage of the national territory, representativeness of the measurement method used, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and application strategies explored. Coherently with their importance as NH 3 emission sources, livestock manures and urea have been the most assessed materials. From a methodological perspective, the measurements were mostly performed on non-representative scales and the collected data present large weaknesses due to lacking information on the variables that regulate losses of this gas to the atmosphere. The measured emission factors (EFs) have proved to be consistent with the ranges reported by international literature, showing appreciable differences in magnitude among manures and synthetic N-fertilisers and among different field management practices. This is supported by the ALFAM model estimation, which has also shown a strong dependency upon the simulated measurement methods. The reviewed EFs for the different type of fertilisers were compared with the values used by the European and Italian emission inventories. Despite the agreement between these values, our analysis emphasized that the reviewed EFs cannot be regarded as representative for the national territory, mainly because of inconsistencies in the measurement methods...|$|E

40|$|In {{simulation}} models for water movement and nutrient transport, uptake {{of water and}} nutrients by roots forms an essential part. As roots are spatially distributed, prediction of root growth and root distribution is crucial for modelling water and nutrient uptake. In a preceding paper, De Willigen et al. (2002; Plant and Soil 240, 225 ¿ 234) presented an analytical solution for describing root length density distribution as a diffusion-type process. In the current paper, we present a numerical model that does the same, but which is more flexible with respect to where root input can occur. We show that the diffusion-type root growth model can describe well observed rooting patterns. We used rooting patterns for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> crops: maize, gladiolus, eastern white cedar, and tomato. For maize, we used data for two different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> application: broadcast and row application. In case of row application, roots extend more vertically than horizontally {{with respect to the}} broadcast application situation. This is reflected in a larger ratio of diffusion coefficients in vertical versus horizontal direction. For tomato, we considered tomatoes grown on an artificial rooting medium, i. e. rockwool. We have shown that, in principle, the model can be extended by including reduction functions on the diffusion coefficient in order to account for environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Current {{deposition}} schemes used in atmospheric {{chemical transport}} models do not generally account for bi-directional exchange of ammonia (NH 3). Bi-directional exchange schemes, which {{have so far}} been applied at the plot scale, can be included in transport models, but need to be parameterised with appropriate values of the ground layer compensation point (χ g), stomatal compensation point (χ s) and cuticular resistance (R w). We review existing measurements of χ g, χ s as well as R w and compile a comprehensive dataset from which we then propose generalised parameterisations. χ s is related to Γ s, the non-dimensional ratio of [NH 4 +] apo and [H +] apo in the apoplast, through the temperature dependence of the combined Henry and dissociation equilibrium. The meta-analysis suggests that the nitrogen (N) input is the main driver of the apoplastic and bulk leaf concentrations of ammonium (NH 4 apo, NH 4 bulk). For managed ecosystems, {{the main source of}} N is fertilisation which is reflected in a peak value of χ s a few days following application, but also alters seasonal values of NH 4 apo and NH 4 bulk. We propose a parameterisation for χ s which includes peak values as a function of amount and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> application which gradually decreases to a background value. The background χ s is based on total N input to the ecosystem as a yearly fertiliser application and N deposition (N dep). For non-managed ecosystems, χ s is parameterised based solely on the link with N dep. For R w we propose a general parameterisation as a function of atmospheric relative humidity (RH), incorporating a minimum value (R w(min)), which depends on the ratio of atmospheric acid concentrations (SO 2, HNO 3 and HCl) to NH 3 concentrations. The parameterisations are based mainly on datasets from temperate locations in northern Europe making them most suitable for up-scaling in these regions (EMEP model for example). In principle, the parameterisations should be applicable to other climates, though {{there is a need for}} more underpinning data, with the uncertainties being especially large for tropical and subtropical conditions...|$|E
40|$|Fertiliser and manure {{application}} are important sources of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from agricultural soils. The current default IPCC emission factor of 1. 0 % {{is independent of}} the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and manure, and application time, method and rate. However, in the IPCC Tiered system {{it is possible to}} use more specific emission factors that better reflect the actual fertiliser and manure management in a given country or region. The first and primary aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the combination of cattle slurry injection with fertiliser application, which is common practice in intensively managed grasslands in the Netherlands and neighbouring countries, warrants an adjusted emission factor. A second aim was to evaluate whether alternative emission factors, based on N uptake and N surplus, respectively, give more insight in the N 2 O emission rates of various fertilisation strategies. In a 2 -year field experiment on sandy soil in the Netherlands we measured the annual N 2 O emission from grasslands receiving repeated simultaneous applications of fertiliser and cattle slurry. The N 2 O fluxes and N uptake by grass were measured from plots receiving calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) at four application rates, either with or without additional application of liquid cattle slurry, applied through shallow soil injection. The average emission factor for fertiliser-only treatments was 0. 15 %. The annual N 2 O emissions were similar for treatments receiving only fertiliser or only cattle slurry. In the first experimental year, application of cattle slurry increased the emission factor for fertiliser to 0. 35 %, but the second year showed no effect of cattle slurry on the emission from fertiliser. With regard to the first objective, we conclude that these results do not conclusively justify an adjusted emission factor for combined application of fertiliser and cattle slurry. To minimise risks however, it is sensible to avoid simultaneous application of fertiliser and cattle slurry. The N 2 O emission factor expressed as percentage of kg N uptake by grass was consistently higher after combined application of fertiliser and cattle slurry (0. 29 %), compared to fertiliser-only (0. 17 %). With regard to the second objective we conclude that an emission factor based on N uptake expresses the relatively inefficient N supply of cattle slurry to crop growth better than the traditional emission factor based on N application...|$|E
40|$|The Ludlow Tuart Forest is {{the only}} {{remaining}} tall tuart forest {{in the world and}} one of the rarest ecosystems on earth. Tuart forests are of immense value for conserving biodiversity and protecting ecosystem function, as well as providing important cultural, social and economic values. However, these areas have been impacted upon by various disturbances including logging, grazing, clearing and weed and pathogen invasion, which have resulted in changes in vegetation structure and composition. This is concerning to scientists, land managers and the public and has resulted in a growing desire to develop techniques to restore these forests. This study investigated techniques for establishing tuart forest species in degraded tuart forests, including: the creation of ashbeds; and the addition of nutrients, chelating agents and water sources. Restoration trials were undertaken with the assistance from a number of community-based programs aimed to facilitate participation in a number of phases of the restoration process. These included provenance seed collection, planting and monitoring. Trials indicated that creation of conditions that mimic natural disturbances has a positive influence on seedling survival and growth. Significant levels of survival and growth can also be produced through the use of plant treatments such as specific <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and chelating agents. This study has shown that together with a range of plant and site treatments community engagement can be successfully captured to assist in the establishment and on-going monitoring of restoration trials.

The experiment involved 7 treatments. Nitrogen rates in treatments 1 – 7 were the following: 1) 90 [*]kg N/ha – Urea; 2) 72 [*]kg N/ha – Urea; 3) 54 [*]kg N/ha – Urea; 4) 90 [*]kg N/ha – Urea + UI; 5) 72 [*]kg N/ha – Urea + UI; 6) 54 [*]kg N/ha – Urea + UI; 7) unfertilised control. Each treatment was repeated 4 times. Both fertilisers (Urea, Urea + UI) were reflected irregularly in the contents of N, P, K, Ca, Mg in the potato biomass and were based on the weather of the year, rate <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and analysed plant organ (tuber, top). In both years the contents of N, K, Ca and Mg were higher in the tops. The P content was balanced both in the tops and tubers. Some changes in the chemical composition were observed particularly in the case of nitrogen. In 2010 the nitrogen content was higher in tubers (1. 44 – 1. 65 % N) after the application of both of the higher rates of urea + UI than after the application of urea alone (1. 30 – 1. 34 % N). In 2011 the N content in tops decreased to 2. 97 – 3. 26 % N when the highest rate of N was applied in both fertilisers, as against the other treatments (3. 60 – 4. 09 % N).

40|$|Bauxite-processing residue sand (BRS) is {{the primary}} growth medium used to {{rehabilitate}} Alcoa's residue storage areas (RSAs) in south-west Western Australia. This material is typically coarse-textured, highly saline, highly alkaline, extremely sodic, and deficient in plant nutrients. To develop appropriate fertiliser strategies for optimising rehabilitation performance, a fundamental understanding of the surface charge and nutrient retention properties of BRS is essential. The contribution of permanent (sp) and variable (sv) charge to the overall magnitude and sign of the surface charge, and ammonium (NH 4) and phosphorus (P) sorption, {{as a function of}} pH were studied. Samples of BRS were obtained from Alcoa's Kwinana (KW), Pinjarra (PJ), and Wagerup (WG) Refineries. Each sample exhibited predominantly variable charge (sv 蠸- 12 cmol/kg at pH 12), and negligible permanent negative charge (sp 蠰. 2 cmol/kg). The point of zero net charge (PZNC) was observed at pH 6. 96, 6. 89, and 5. 98 for the KW, PJ, and WG samples, respectively. These values are consistent with those reported for soils dominated by Fe and Al oxides and hydroxides but containing negligible organic matter. Solution and adsorbed NH 4 decreased with increasing pH (pH 7 - 11) for BRS. It was suggested that ammonia volatilisation was a major loss pathway for NH 4 applied to BRS. Phosphorus sorption decreased with increasing pH for each BRS. It was suggested that the presence of competing anions (i. e. carbonate) and increasing negative surface charge density were the major causes for this behaviour.

40|$|One of the {{critical}} success factors for soilless culture is the sequestration of FeIII-ions, making Fe available for plant roots. Chelates are used primarily, but other compounds, like polyphosphates are also able to bind Fe-ions. A new group of Fe-polyphosphates have recently been developed by Prayon chemical company. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the utility of these products in nutrients solutions for soilless systems using cucumber as test crop. Three different poly-phosphate formulations were compared with Fe-DTPA as reference, at two pH levels: low pH (5. 2 - 5. 6) and high pH (6. 4 - 6. 8). The plants were grown in substrate-free nutrient solution for six weeks, starting from the seedling stage. The first test was conducted in spring with 25 µmol Fe l- 1 and the second test in summer with 15 µmol Fe l- 1. In the first experiment, no differences in biomass production were found. Light chlorosis symptoms appeared throughout the growing season at all treatments, tending to be less at the reference treatment with high pH. Fe contents in plant tissue were lower at the high pH treatments for both the reference and the polyphosphate treatments, whilst the Fe contents were significantly higher at low pH with the polyphosphate treatments. In the second experiment the biomass production for all treatments was significantly lower at the high pH, the lowest for the polyphosphate treatments. Chlorosis was closely related with the biomass production and was most severe in the polyphosphate treatments at high pH. Fe contents in the tissue were not different among treatments at low pH, but at high pH these were clearly lower for the polyphosphate treatments compared to the reference. Interestingly, tip-burn symptoms, commonly ascribed to Ca deficiency, were observed and were significantly more severe in the reference treatments than at the polyphosphate treatments.

The {{object of}} this study is to evaluate recent advances in the use of anhydrous and aqua ammonia as nitrogenous fertilisers, with emphasis on the prospects and needs there are for their usage in New Zealand. There is at present a large dependence on New Zealand made organic and imported artificial fertilisers which are mostly low analysis materials. These nitrogenous fertilisers, with their low nitrogen content, have a high cost per pound of nitrogen. Anhydrous and aqua ammonia are high analysis materials whose use could prove worthwhile in this country on the grounds of economy and practicability. An appraisal of these prospects would appear to offer advantages in the development of horticulture (and agriculture) in New Zealand. Part I deals with the aspects of nitrogen in the soil and in plants. This introduces the trends in nitrogenous <b>fertilisers</b> and usage <b>of</b> the various forms, particularly anhydrous and aqua ammonia. Also dealt with is the history <b>of</b> nitrogenous <b>fertilisers.</b> Part II illustrates the usage of ammonia as a fertiliser. The manufacture, use for crops, equipment and basic economics are discussed, with a view to demonstrating that anhydrous and aqua ammonia fertilisers have been shown to be both efficient and very economical fertilisers overseas.

However, the demand-supply gap <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in India has increased in recent times, thereby leading to increased dependency on imports. Indian imports, which were about 2 million tonnes in early part of 2000, increased to 10. 2 million tonnes <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in 2008 - 09. In view <b>of</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in agricultural growth and the possibility of an emerging demand-supply gap, there is need to forecast future demand. The paper begins with an overview <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> consumption trends and then identifies important determinants <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> demand and develops projects demand scenarios for fertilisers in India in 2020 - 21. India is the second largest consumer <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in the world after China, consuming about 26. 5 million tonnes. However, average intensity <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use in India remains much lower than most countries in the world but is highly skewed, with wide inter-regional, inter-state, and inter-district variations. The results show that non-price factors such as irrigation, high yielding varieties, were more important than price factors in influencing demand for <b>fertilisers.</b> <b>Of</b> the two price policy instruments, affordable fertiliser prices and higher agricultural commodity prices, the former is more powerful in influencing fertiliser demand. The paper suggests that in order to ensure self-sufficiency in agricultural production in the country, availability <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> at affordable prices should be prioritized over higher output prices.

Here, we have studied the technical feasibility of using composting to transform AL into commercial organic amendments and fertilisers. For this, six piles of 20 t each, prepared by mixing AL and either poultry (PM) or sheep manure (SM), were composted. In addition, Fe and P-enriched acidic mineral amendments were added {{at the beginning of}} the process in order to reduce alkalinisation and nitrogen losses. As composting proceeded, substantial organic matter degradation, progressive humification, increases of pH and germination indices and decreases in fats and water-soluble organic fractions were detected. Also, the addition of the mineral amendments was effective with regard to reducing the pH, water-soluble organic carbon and polyphenols, hemicellulose fraction and nitrogen losses. According to the Spanish legislation for fertiliser production (PRE/ 630 / 2011), the composts obtained were suitable for preparing commercial organic amendments and fertilisers within categories such as AL Compost, Humic Organic Amendment, Compost Organic Amendment and NPK Organic Fertiliser. Also, by mixing with organic and/or mineral fertilisers, the composts were optimal substrates for the production <b>of</b> 19 <b>types</b> <b>of</b> Organo-mineral <b>Fertilisers,</b> either as solid or liquid formulations.

40|$|The {{application}} <b>of</b> nitrogen (N) <b>fertilisers</b> to crops {{grown on}} tile-drained fields {{is required to}} sustain most modern crop production, but it poses a risk to the aquatic environment since tile drains facilitate rapid transport pathways with no significant reduction in nitrate. To maintain the water quality of the aquatic environment {{and the provision of}} food from highly efficient agriculture in line with the EU's Water Framework Directive and Nitrates Directive, field-scale knowledge is essential for introducing water management actions on-field or off-field and producing an optimal differentiated N-regulation in future. This study strives to provide such knowledge by evaluating on 11 years of nitrate-N concentration measurements in drainage from three subsurface-drained clayey till fields (1. 3 – 2. 3 ha) representing approximately 71 % of the surface sediments in Denmark dominated by clay. The fields differ in their inherent hydrogeological field settings (e. g. soil-type, geology, climate, drainage and groundwater table) and the agricultural management of the fields (e. g. crop <b>type,</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> N <b>fertilisers</b> and agricultural practices). The evaluation revealed three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> clayey till fields characterised by: (i) low net precipitation, high concentration of nitrate-N, and short-term low intensity drainage at air temperatures often below 5 °C; (ii) medium net precipitation, medium concentration of nitrate-N, and short-term medium-intensity drainage at air temperatures often above 5 °C; and (iii) high net precipitation, low concentration of nitrate-N and long-term high intensity drainage at air temperatures above 5 °C. For each type, on-field water management actions, such as the selection <b>of</b> crop <b>types</b> and introduction <b>of</b> catch crops, appeared relevant, whereas off-field actions only seemed relevant for the latter two field types given the temperature-dependent reduction potential of nitrate off-field. This initial well-documented field-scale knowledge from fields that are representative of large areas in Denmark is a first step towards establishing a differentiated N-regulation for clayey till areas. Additionally, it provides a unique starting point by identifying important parameters for future mapping of catchment-scale variations in nitrate concentrations and fluxes...|$|R

Even with improved formulations using effective adjuvants, foliar fertilisers must be regarded as supplements to overcome deficiencies in micronutrients, and to boost macronutrients at critical physiological stages, rather than as substitutes for soil-applied fertilisers...|$|R

A linear constraint is introduced to optimise the allocation of limited funds to fertiliser on several farm blocks, each of which represents a different land and/or stock class. The optimal constrained maintenance application <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> to each block is calculated, and an heuristic approach to this equilibrium is suggested.

India is the second largest consumer <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in the world after China, consuming about 26. 5 million tonnes. However, average intensity <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use in India remains much lower than most {{countries in the world}} but is highly skewed, with wide inter-regional, inter-state, and inter-district variations. By 2020, fertiliser demand in the country is projected to increase to about 41. 6 million tones and is expected to grow at a faster rate in eastern and southern region compared with north and west. To meet the increasing <b>fertiliser</b> requirements <b>of</b> the country, a conducive and stable policy environment, availability of raw materials, capital resources, and price incentives will play a critical role.
