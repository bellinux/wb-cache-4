5|$|In 1960 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Derick Heathcoat-Amory, {{insisted on}} retiring.

In terms of ability and experience the obvious candidate to take over from Lloyd at the Foreign Office was Home, but by 1960 there was an expectation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> Secretary would {{be a member of}} the House of Commons. The post had not been held by a peer since Lord Halifax in 1938–40; Eden had wished to appoint Salisbury in 1955, but concluded that it would be unacceptable to the Commons.|$|E

Two days later, Beshear announced the reversal of the state police's new policy, saying he was not informed of it and believed {{it was the wrong}} thing to do.

5|$|In fact, {{if such a}} {{strategy}} of financing development from outside the home country is undertaken, it creates a number of problems. For example, the foreign investors may carelessly misuse {{the resources of the}} underdeveloped country. This would in turn limit that economy's ability to diversify, especially if natural resources were plundered. This may also create a distorted social structure. Apart from this, there is also a risk <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption. People would try to imitate Western consumption habits and thus a balance of payments crisis may develop, along with economic inequality within the population.|$|E
5|$|Silvestre de Sacy {{eventually}} gave up {{work on the}} stone, but he was to {{make another}} contribution. In 1811, prompted by discussions with a Chinese student about Chinese script, Silvestre de Sacy considered a suggestion made by Georg Zoëga in 1797 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> names in Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions might be written phonetically; he also recalled that as early as 1761, Jean-Jacques Barthélemy had suggested that the characters enclosed in cartouches in hieroglyphic inscriptions were proper names. Thus, when Thomas Young, foreign secretary of the Royal Society of London, wrote {{to him about the}} stone in 1814, Silvestre de Sacy suggested in reply that in attempting to read the hieroglyphic text, Young might look for cartouches that ought to contain Greek names and try to identify phonetic characters in them.|$|E

Willing to sacrifice himself for Stannis's sake, Cressen puts poison in a cup and asks Melisandre to drink from it after he has done so. While he dies almost immediately, the priestess swallows the entire cup unaffected.|$|E

This in turn means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> firm's best response is to cut output, although not proportionally (hence, the market price falls).

5|$|As the {{situation}} deteriorated, the Brazilian government mobilized army units from {{other regions of}} the Empire. On 1 January 1865, one brigade (composed of two infantry battalions and one artillery battalion) with 1,700 men from the Brazilian province of Rio de Janeiro disembarked and occupied the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos. Paranhos, along with Tamandaré, met Flores in Fray Bentos and decided to launch a combined attack against Montevideo. It was apparent that the Paraguayans would take too long to reach Uruguay and no help would come from Urquiza and his Argentine Federalists. Increasingly isolated, Aguirre hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> powers could intervene, but when, on 11 January, he asked the diplomatic corps in Montevideo whether they would provide military assistance to him and his government, none responded positively. João Propício Mena Barreto sailed from Fray Bentos on 14 January with the Brazilian infantry, bound for a landing near the mouth of the Santa Lucía River near Montevideo. On the way, he occupied the Uruguayan town of Colonia del Sacramento, garrisoning it with 50 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|U.S. diplomats were {{concerned}} that the move {{would be seen as}} a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process in which he was a candidate. The Americans felt that a legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice. Ambassador G. Frederick Reinhardt informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing a level playing field for the opposition, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being a facade. The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum as an exercise in democracy for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, as they saw it as an opportunity to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, as they saw a republican model as being more robust.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{maintaining}} the British claim, the British Government considered {{a transfer of}} sovereignty {{less than two years}} before the outbreak of war.

This led to the British Government maintaining a position that the right to self-determination of the islanders was paramount.
