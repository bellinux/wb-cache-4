5|$|The last squeaky {{wheel in}} the City Council had been greased.

5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.|$|E
2500|$|The line did however assist German {{construction}} in Jerusalem in the 1890s, {{allowing them to}} bring more construction materials more quickly. By {{the start of the}} 20th century, the German Colony became an attractive spot for those seeking superior transportation. In addition, it improved public health in Jerusalem considerably, and allowed further expansion, as it allowed the import of large quantities of fresh water into the city from other aquifers. Paul Cotterell wrote that [...] "The coming of the railway {{had a profound effect on}} Jerusalem. In the first decade of the line's existence the population of the city almost doubled, which is all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> when considering that Jerusalem at this period produced hardly enough wine, vegetables or cattle for its own needs." ...|$|E
6000|$|She was <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> and startled when, one Sunday {{evening in}} spring, Mr. Hargrave {{came to her}} as she sat in her own parlour, saying, [...] "Madam, you will be amazed, but under the circumstances, the parson and myself being both here, Mr. Belamour trusts you will not object to the {{immediate}} performance of the ceremony." ...|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary audiences did not realise that Paganini had retuned his instrument, {{and were}} thus all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> {{at what he}} {{appeared}} able to play. (<b>The</b> <b>more</b> musically adept {{members of the audience}} would have recognised the distinctive sound of a violin's open string, and would have observed that this fell on the keynote of work (E-flat), and would have therefore realised that Paganini had re-tuned his violin.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{her eyes}} fell upon him and their hands met {{she was the}} one who had the right to be <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazed.</b> She had thought him {{handsome}} before; he was glorious now. Arrayed in fashionable, well-fitting clothes, wearing only a mustache, and with his hair properly cut, he was a vision of manly beauty. Instantly, without any volition on her part, her heart went out to him; she knew that it belonged to him.|$|R
6000|$|He didn't argue it. He {{smiled and}} said [...] "Tut!" [...] and placidly catalogued her with, [...] "You're the pluckiest girl I've ever seen, and it's all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> because you're not a motion-picture Tomboy, but {{essentially}} exquisite----" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{memory of}} her serene self-possession made her self-surrender of the night all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> to him. [...] "It is cold and empty where I dwell," [...] she had said. This meant that she loved him--longed for him--it could mean nothing else. Her love had begun during their ride on the lagoon, in their delicious drowse on the grass. It had been deepened by their {{afternoon}} of sweet companionship at tennis and over their books; then came the walk in the moonlight and her acceptance of his caress in the dusky place in the path--all were preparatory to this final wondrous visit and confession.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Munro justly {{insists on}} [...] "the {{absolute}} necessity of correctly recording {{the facts and}} relics brought to light by excavations." [...] {14a} An excavator should be an engineer, or {{be accompanied by a}} specialist who can assign exact measurements for the position of every object discovered. Thus Dr. Munro mentions the case of a man who, while digging a drain in his garden in Scotland, found an adze of jade and a pre-historic urn. Dr. Munro declares, with another expert, that the jade adze is [...] "a modern Australian implement," [...] which is <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> as I am not aware that the Australians possess any jade. The point is that the modern Australian adze was not, as falsely reported, in the pre- historic urn. {14b} ...|$|E
60|$|It thus {{became evident}} to these men of {{business}} that the merchant kept the two departments quite separate, {{in order to}} ascertain the distinct profits on each. They were <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> at this when they considered that the shipwright work must necessarily be a mere driblet, altogether unworthy the attention of one so wealthy. But that which amazed them most of all was, that such a man, in such circumstances, could waste his time in doing with his own hands {{the work of an}} ordinary mechanic--thus (as they concluded) entailing on himself the necessity of devoting much of the night to his more lucrative concern.|$|R
60|$|He {{was equally}} {{good in the}} morning: he had risen early to hunt up some {{information}} which Sir Miles wanted, and the clearness and readiness with which he had found it were wonderful. The guest was delighted with him; gave him a warm invitation to Oakstead, and on being left alone with Mrs. Ponsonby, whom he had formerly known, expressed his admiration of his friend's son--as a fine, promising young man, of great ability and originality, and, what was still more remarkable, of most simple, natural manners, perfectly free from conceit. He seemed <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazed,</b> when he found, what he would hardly believe, that Fitzjocelyn was twenty-one, and had nearly finished his university education.|$|R
5000|$|... "Based on {{constancy}} or {{rarity of}} occurrence." [...] <b>The</b> sun is <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> than a comet, {{but because we}} see and feel {{the warmth of the}} sun daily and the comet rarely, the latter commands our attention.|$|R
6000|$|This is bad enough. But {{after all}} {{one might say}} {{this is only the}} {{mechanical}} side of education. True: but one searches in vain in the Oxford curriculum for any adequate recognition of the higher and more cultured studies. Strange though it seems to us {{on this side of the}} Atlantic, there are no courses at Oxford in Housekeeping, or in Salesmanship, or in Advertising, or on Comparative Religion, or on the influence of the Press. There are no lectures whatever on Human Behaviour, on Altruism, on Egotism, or on the Play of Wild Animals. Apparently, the Oxford student does not learn these things. This cuts him off from a great deal of the larger culture of our side of the Atlantic. [...] "What are you studying this year?" [...] I once asked a fourth year student at one of our great colleges. [...] "I am electing Salesmanship and Religion," [...] he answered. Here was a young man whose training was destined inevitably to turn him into a moral business man: either that or nothing. At Oxford Salesmanship is not taught and Religion takes the feeble form of the New Testament. The more one looks at these things <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> it becomes that Oxford can produce any results at all.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was still}} so wide awake at dawn {{that he got}} up, slipped on tennis shoes, trousers, and a sweater, and in silence crept downstairs and out through the study window. It was just light; there was a smell of grass. 'Fleur!' he thought; 'Fleur!' It was mysteriously white out of doors, with nothing awake except the birds just {{beginning}} to chirp. 'I'll go down into the coppice,' he thought. He ran down through the fields, reached the pond just as the sun rose, and passed into the coppice. Bluebells carpeted the ground there; among the larch-trees there was mystery--the air, as it were, composed of that romantic quality. Jon sniffed its freshness, {{and stared at the}} bluebells in the sharpening light. Fleur! It rhymed with her! And she lived at Mapleduram--a jolly name, too, on the river somewhere. He could find it in the atlas presently. He would write to her. But would she answer? Oh! She must. She had said [...] "Au revoir!" [...] Not good-bye! What luck that she had dropped her handkerchief! He would never have known her but for that. And the more he thought of that handkerchief, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> his luck seemed. Fleur! It certainly rhymed with her! Rhythm thronged his head; words jostled to be joined together; he {{was on the verge of}} a poem.|$|E
60|$|On {{returning}} to the Heyst bungalow, rapid as if on wings, Ricardo found Lena waiting for him. She was dressed in black; and at once his uplifting exultation was replaced by an awed and quivering patience before her white face, before the immobility of her reposeful pose, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> to him who had encountered the strength of her limbs and the indomitable spirit in her body. She had come out after Heyst's departure, and had sat down under the portrait {{to wait for the}} return of the man of violence and death. While lifting the curtain, she felt the anguish of her disobedience to her lover, which was soothed by a feeling she had known before--a gentle flood of penetrating sweetness. She was not automatically obeying a momentary suggestion, she was under influences more deliberate, more vague, and of greater potency. She had been prompted, not by her will, but by a force that was outside of her and more worthy. She reckoned upon nothing definite; she had calculated nothing. She saw only her purpose of capturing death--savage, sudden, irresponsible death, prowling round the man who possessed her, death embodied in the knife ready to strike into his heart. No doubt it had been a sin to throw herself into his arms. With that inspiration that descends at times from above for the good or evil of our common mediocrity, she had a sense of having been for him only a violent and sincere choice of curiosity and pity--a thing that passes. She did not know him. If he were to go away from her and disappear, she would utter no reproach, she would not resent it; for she would hold in herself the impress of something most rare and precious--his embraces made her own by her courage in saving his life.|$|E
60|$|Patience was <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> by a {{visit from}} the Miller Luck and his son. The son was a fine looking young man of three or four and twenty, who had about three years before married a farmer's daughter, and had lost her at the birth of her second child. There he stood, almost as bashful as Stead himself could have been under the circumstances, while his father paid the {{astonished}} Patience the compliment of declaring that they had put their heads together, and made up their minds that there was no wench in those parts so like to be a good mother to the babes, nor so thrifty a housewife as she; and, that, though there were plenty of maids to be had who could bring something in their hands, her ways were better than any portion she could bring.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> bishop was <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> than ever. Had he {{seen his}} father? [...] "No," [...] he replied; {{he had not}} yet had the pleasure: he hoped he might; and, as he said so, he {{resolved}} to bear heavy on that fat, immovable rector, if ever he had the power of doing so.|$|R
60|$|After {{all this}} was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what belonged to the {{navigation}} of my boat; for though he knew very well how to paddle the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and a rudder, and was <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> {{when he saw me}} work the boat to and again in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail gibed, and filled this way or that way, as the course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed: however, with a little use, I made all these things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, except that as to the compass I could make him understand very little of that: on the other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy seasons; and then nobody cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea.|$|R

50|$|Robinson {{also hit}} one of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> shots ever, in the 1995 {{national}} semifinal game against Lipscomb (Tenn.), banking in a game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer while {{parallel to the floor}} and draped by three defenders.|$|E
50|$|The last squeaky {{wheel in}} the City Council had been greased.

5000|$|Reading The Cards is a magic {{effect in}} which the magician shows the bottom card of the deck to the audience, announcing its name. He then puts the deck {{behind his back and}} brings it forward again, showing a {{different}} card on the bottom, and announces the name of the new bottom card. <b>The</b> trick becomes <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> as <b>more</b> cards are [...] "read", and is even <b>more</b> impressive if <b>the</b> audience is allowed to shuffle the deck first.|$|R
5000|$|The review {{aggregator}} Rotten Tomatoes {{reports a}} 100 percent critical rating (based on 20 reviews; all certified [...] "fresh", with an [...] "average rating" [...] of 8 out of 10). In 2005, Slant Magazine praised Angels with Dirty Faces for being Warner's [...] "best gangster movie". Awarding {{four out of}} four stars, Jeremiah Kipp said: [...] "Rocky Sullivan embodies all the qualities we love about bad guys." [...] Cagney [...] "offers a real intensity {{and a sense of}} playfulness," [...] even as he shoots [...] "fellow gangsters" [...] dead. The final, [...] "climactic" [...] scene of [...] "cowardice is unparalleled in gangster movies, and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> Cagney begs and screams, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> are <b>amazed</b> at how he reduces the hero worship of gangsters to nothing. film marks Cagney’s finest hour in a career filled with great performances." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{dare not}} dwell upon the hours that followed: they fled all too fast; and {{presently}} the moon out-topped the eastern range, {{and my father}} and Mr. Aspinwall set forth, side by side, on their nocturnal journey. My mother, though still bearing an heroic countenance, had hastened to shut herself in her apartment, thenceforward solitary; and I, {{alone in the dark}} house, and consumed by grief and apprehension, made haste to saddle my Indian pony, to ride up to the corner of the mountain, and to enjoy one farewell sight of my departing father. The two men had set forth at a deliberate pace; nor was I long behind them, when I reached the point of view. I was <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> to see no moving creature in the landscape. The moon, as the saying is, shone bright as day; and nowhere, under the whole arch of night, was there a growing tree, a bush, a farm, a patch of tillage, or any evidence of man, but one. From the corner where I stood, a rugged bastion of the line of bluffs concealed the doctor's house; and across the top of that projection the soft night wind carried and unwound about the hills a coil of sable smoke. What fuel could produce a vapour so sluggish to dissipate in that dry air, or what furnace pour it forth so copiously, I was unable to conceive; but I knew well enough that it came from the doctor's chimney; I saw well enough that my father had already disappeared; and in despite of reason, I connected in my mind the loss of that dear protector with the ribbon of foul smoke that trailed along the mountains.|$|R
5000|$|Clif Allperti states {{regarding}} Nollan's incredibly prolific output, [...] "This {{large body}} of work is all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> when I take my experience with Boris Karloff: A Gentleman's Life into account... it's as exhaustively-researched a biography as you're going to find on the market, not just about Karloff, but any subject." ...|$|E
5000|$|He was {{considered}} a pioneer mover of Maranao literature. He wrote:"The Moro people of Lake Lanao have amazingly rich literature, all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> since it exists only in {{the memories of the}} people and had just begun to be recorded in writing. It consists of lyric and poetry with the epic greatly predominating." ...|$|E
50|$|Starting in January, slush {{funds were}} {{uncovered}} at Washington, UCLA, Southern California, and California. The slush funds {{were used to}} pay recruits, players, and ringers. Some of the funds had been in operation since the 1920s, making Oregon State's accomplishments from the 1920s to the 1950s all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing.</b> Southern California, UCLA, and Washington were all put on multi-year probation.|$|E
50|$|They beat Qatari club, Al Arabi in {{the first}} round, with a 4-3 {{aggregate}} score. They were then placed in group B, finishing second there, despite very poor results. In the semi-finals, {{which took place in}} Bahrain, they went up against a powerful Japanese side Yomiuri. They defeated the team in extra-time by a score of 2-1. Pas was now in the final, where they would meet Saudi club, Al-Shabab. On 22 January 1993, in Manama, Bahrain; Pas Tehran defeated Al-Shabab 1-0, becoming Asian champions. What made <b>the</b> feat even <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> was that most of Pas' players were paid amateur level salaries, they stayed at a very poor hotel, and arrived very late to Bahrain. The chances of the team doing well in the tournament was considered so small that the Iranian Football Federation didn't even bother to send a representative.|$|R
60|$|I {{soon found}} a way to {{convince}} him, that I would do him no harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did: and while he was wondering and looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again, and by and by I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sit upon a tree within shot; so, to let Friday understand a little what I would do, I called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk: I say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let him see I would make him fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly I fired, and bid him look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall; he stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all that I had said to him; and I found he was <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazed,</b> because he did not see me put any thing into the gun; but thought there must be some wonderful fund of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any thing near or far off; for the astonishment this created in him was such, as could not wear off for a long time; and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun; as for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for several days over; but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards learnt of him, was to desire it not to kill him.|$|R
50|$|We're {{introduced}} to young man Nikita Shindou as he's {{making his way}} through Akihabara, which is his main haunt and {{the place where he}} gets all his bishōjo games, which he plays in his room all alone in the dark. Keeping them a secret from his sister who just moved in a few months ago after their parents had died, Nikita loves playing up the characters having sex with each other and manipulating them as he can. To his surprise on his way home though, he comes across a park he hadn't remembered before and sees a beautiful woman there, one that reminds him strikingly of an older Sheeta from Laputa: Castle in <b>the</b> Sky! Even <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> is that she comes into his room in some sort of dream sequence not too much later and keeps calling him Pazu and the two fool around quite a bit only for it to end up as a dream.|$|R
50|$|Chris Kamara got Bradford City {{promoted}} via the Division 2 play offs just 6 {{months after}} taking over as manager. The feat was all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> considering they lost 0-2 {{at home to}} Blackpool in the 1st leg of the play off semi final. A 3-0 victory in the 2nd leg saw Bradford City reach Wembley for the first ever time defeating Notts County 2-0 in the final with goals from 19-year-old local boy Des Hamilton and Kamara's first signing Mark Stallard.|$|E
50|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster.

50|$|The Bears {{overcame the}} Tigers {{in a classic}} 3 leg quarter-final, and breezed past the league winning Sheffield Sharks {{to set up a}} final against the Manchester Giants. The Bears got off to a slow-start in the game, but in the end out-thought and out-fought the Giants to secure a 77-73 victory. The team had created {{basketball}} history by winning at Wembley {{for the third time in}} a row (the 'Three-Peat'); all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazing</b> from a position of seventh seeds.|$|E
60|$|But <b>the</b> tapu is <b>more</b> often <b>the</b> {{instrument}} of wise and needful restrictions. We {{have seen it}} as the organ of paternal government. It serves besides to enforce, in the rare case of some one wishing to enforce them, rights of private property. Thus a man, weary of the coming and going of Marquesan visitors, tapus his door; {{and to this day}} you may see the palm-branch signal, even as our great- grandfathers saw the peeled wand before a Highland inn. Or take another case. Anaho is known as 'the country without popoi.' The word popoi serves in different islands to indicate the main food of the people: thus, in Hawaii, it implies a preparation of taro; in the Marquesas, of breadfruit. And a Marquesan does not readily conceive life possible without his favourite diet. A few years ago a drought killed the breadfruit trees and the bananas in the district of Anaho; and from this calamity, and the open-handed customs of the island, a singular state of things arose. Well- watered Hatiheu had escaped the drought; every householder of Anaho accordingly crossed the pass, chose some one in Hatiheu, 'gave him his name'--an onerous gift, but one not to be rejected--and from this improvised relative proceeded to draw his supplies, for all the world as though he had paid for them. Hence a continued traffic on the road. Some stalwart fellow, in a loin-cloth, and glistening with sweat, may be seen {{at all hours of the}} day, a stick across his bare shoulders, tripping nervously under a double burthen of green fruits. And on the far side of the gap a dozen stone posts on the wayside in the shadow of a grove mark the breathing-space of the popoi-carriers. A little back from the beach, and not half a mile from Anaho, I was <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>amazed</b> to find a cluster of well-doing breadfruits heavy with their harvest. 'Why do you not take these?' I asked. 'Tapu,' said Hoka; and I thought to myself (after the manner of dull travellers) what children and fools these people were to toil over the mountain and despoil innocent neighbours when the staff of life was thus growing at their door. I was <b>the</b> <b>more</b> in error. In the general destruction these surviving trees were enough only for the family of the proprietor, and by the simple expedient of declaring a tapu he enforced his right.|$|R
