500|$|After being heavily {{recruited}} by several colleges around the country, Solo attended the University of Washington from 1999 to 2002 where she majored in speech communications. With the Huskies, she switched permanently to goalkeeper under {{the lead of}} head coach Lesle Gallimore and goalkeeper coach and former national team player, Amy Griffin. Solo described the transition in her memoir, [...] "In high school, I had been the forward who won games. It was a huge mental adjustment to learn that {{my job was to}} save games. To anticipate what was needed. Before, I would stand in goal, the ball would come <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I'd use my athletic ability to make the save. But thanks to Amy's tutelage and my time with the national team, I was becoming a much better tactical goalkeeper. I learned how to read my opponents' runs toward goal, how to position my defenders, how to see the angles... The intellectual side also made goalkeeping so much more interesting. It wasn't just ninety minutes of waiting for my defense to make a mistake. It was ninety minutes of tactics and strategy. The personality traits that had been shaped by my childhood—resilience and toughness—were assets at the position." ...|$|E
2500|$|Years later, in his autobiography, Brando remarked: [...] "Tony Quinn, whom I admired professionally {{and liked}} personally, played my brother, {{but he was}} {{extremely}} cold to me while we shot that picture. During our scenes together, I sensed a bitterness <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> if I suggested a drink after work, he either turned me down or else was sullen and said little. Only years later did I learn why." [...] Brando related that, to create on-screen tension between the two, [...] "Gadg" [...] (Kazan) had told Quinn—who {{had taken over the}} role of Stanley Kowalski on Broadway after Brando had finished—that Brando had been unimpressed with his work. After achieving the desired effect, Kazan never told Quinn that he had misled him. It was only many years later, after comparing notes, that Brando and Quinn realized the deception.|$|E
2500|$|Carson {{often made}} jokes {{at the expense}} of other celebrities. In 1980, Carson backed out of a deal to acquire the Aladdin Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, and a {{competing}} group led by Wayne Newton successfully bought the property. According to lawyer Henry Bushkin, Carson became annoyed that he was often portrayed by the media as having [...] "lost" [...] the deal and reacted by telling jokes on his show about Newton, who had spent a great deal of effort building a masculine image. This created something of a high-profile feud between Carson and Newton. Years later, Newton appeared on Larry King Live, declaring that [...] "Johnny Carson is a mean-spirited human being. And there are people that he has hurt that people will never know about. And for some reason at some point, he decided to turn that kind of negative attention <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> I refused to have it." [...] Newton has often told of personally confronting Carson; after the final straw, Newton barged into his office at the studio and threatened to beat him up unless the jokes stopped. They did.|$|E

6000|$|Despairing cries float ceaselessly <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> day <b>and</b> night, The sad {{voice of}} Death--the call of my nearest lover, putting forth, [...] alarmed, uncertain, [...] "The Sea I am quickly to sail: come tell me, Come {{tell me where}} I am speeding--tell me my destination." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is all so horrible," [...] said Grace, bending {{back her}} head, so that as I glanced over my {{shoulder}} I could see her firm white neck through the laces as she stared upward at the streak of blue sky so far above. Then she turned her face <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> again, <b>and</b> it seemed to my excited fancy that it had grown ethereal.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned the}} book <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{pointed to a}} slip of paper which {{occupied}} the lower half of a page.|$|E
60|$|I {{reached out}} and swept the {{considerable}} sum <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and,</b> pocketing it, I too rose, ready for what might come.|$|E
60|$|I {{passed out}} of the restaurant, and ascended to my own room. There I drew {{a sheet of paper}} <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> wrote.|$|E
6000|$|... "And that is {{just why}} it is so hard, Evan. He is Great Heart. You named him well. Listen--you watch him now. He is as gentle as he said he would be that night--gentle <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> I mean. <b>And</b> more. You watch him--" ...|$|R
60|$|As I wandered {{about the}} plaza lost in my gloomy forebodings Tars Tarkas {{approached}} {{me on his}} way from the audience chamber. His demeanor <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> was unchanged, <b>and</b> he greeted <b>me</b> as though we had not just parted a few moments before.|$|R
60|$|As I wend to {{the shores}} I know not, As I list to the dirge, {{the voices of}} men and women wrecked, As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me, As the ocean so mysterious rolls <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> closer <b>and</b> closer, I too but signify, at the utmost, a little washed-up drift, A few sands and dead leaves to gather, Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift.|$|R
6000|$|The manikin {{smiled a}} smile of {{malicious}} content and security, puffed a whiff of smoke contemptuously <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> said, with a still more elaborate drawl: ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked toward}} the open door. I arose and closed it. When I had resumed my seat he drew his chair closer to me, leaned <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> said: ...|$|E
6000|$|She stopped quaking. She paused, {{and there}} was moment of silence. She turned her face over her {{shoulder}} <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> said, without even a smile in her voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be careful!" [...] exclaimed Alfred. [...] "Sit down. You {{will have}} the canoe upset in a moment. Hold your rod steady and keep the line taut. That's right. Now lead him round <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b> There," [...] <b>and</b> {{grasping}} the line he lifted a fine rock bass {{over the side of}} the canoe.|$|R
6000|$|... 2 [...] As I wend to {{the shores}} I know not, [...] As I list to the dirge, {{the voices of}} men and women wreck'd, [...] As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me, [...] As the ocean so mysterious rolls <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> closer <b>and</b> closer, [...] I too but signify at the utmost a little wash'd-up drift, [...] A few sands and dead leaves to gather, [...] Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift.|$|R
6000|$|... "Soon's ever I woke, next morning, I looked {{round to}} thank Tom, for his blanket was over me. He was sitting as I left him, {{his hand on}} my pillow, his face <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> so quiet <b>and</b> happy-looking I couldn't believe he was gone. But he was, and I have had no mate since." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me queerly. I saw her lips {{trembling}} and the tears swimming up in her eyes. She swayed <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I caught her in my arms.|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned her}} {{beautiful}} eyes up <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> {{for a moment}} did not speak. Then she said: [...] "And they got you out? And {{you are in your}} right mind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{me all the}} story," [...] the {{commodore}} said, motioning <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{without delay}} I gave him a full account of what we had done, save that then I said nothing regarding Elias Macomber.|$|E
60|$|He was the {{one whose}} spear had so nearly transfixed <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> was evidently {{the leader of the}} band, as I had noted that they seemed to have moved to their present {{position}} at his direction. When his force had come to a halt he dismounted, threw down his spear and small arms, and came around the end of the incubator <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> entirely unarmed <b>and</b> as naked as I, except for the ornaments strapped upon his head, limbs, and breast.|$|R
60|$|The day {{was bright}} when I {{was awakened by}} a chilly feeling: a strong breeze was blowing over me. I sprang to my feet. There was quite a heavy sea; the vessel was rolling <b>and</b> {{pitching}} beneath <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> not far away, not more than a mile, La Fidélité was coming straight <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b> Lightly laden, <b>and</b> with {{a great part of}} her hull high out of water, the high wind was driving her before it, while my vessel, her bow to the breeze, was moving at a much slower rate.|$|R
60|$|There {{was further}} clamor, but I {{scarcely}} heard it, and I longed that {{the floor of}} the hall might open beneath me. Still, there was clearly no escape, and I stood up under the lamplight, noticing, as one often notices trifles at such times, how like a navvy's my right hand was as it trembled a little on the white tablecloth. A sea of faces were turned <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> expectantly, <b>and</b> I pitied their owners' disappointment, but I saw only four persons plainly--my uncle, and Alice, who flashed an encouraging glance at me, Colonel Carrington looking up with a semi-ironical smile, and Grace. I could not tell what her expression meant.|$|R
6000|$|He obeyed at once, and, as {{he slowly}} urged up the unruly sash, the {{handsome}} profile was again turned <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> again I was possessed by my first impression so strongly that I involuntarily said,-- ...|$|E
60|$|I {{drew the}} book <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{stood looking at}} the four names, all written in the same hand--rather a big, and rather a bad one: Trent, Brown, Hardy, and (instead of Ah Wing) Jos. Amalu.|$|E
60|$|The dog looked up, {{then moved}} slowly <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> stood, head {{bowed to the}} floor, shaking in every muscle as I patted him; and when I turned, I saw him crawl back to her feet.|$|E
60|$|Then as {{she turned}} <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> evidently with a word of {{explanation}} on her lips, her eyes suddenly widened as they rested upon <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> with a little exclamation she started <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ARVN armored column {{proceeded}} down Provincial Road 6C <b>toward</b> Plei <b>Me,</b> <b>and</b> was ambushed at {{two places}} at 17:30 hours on 23 October. The leading {{elements of the}} convoy responded effectively to the PAVN assault, but the ARVN suffered heavy casualties in the second attack toward {{the rear of the}} convoy. Both attacks were repelled by U.S. airpower, and by morning the PAVN had given up the attack and withdrawn westward. Fearing another attack, General Vinh Loc remained in place on October 24, but proceeded onward to Plei Me with only minor resistance on October 25. The PAVN withdrew westward that same evening after suffering heavy casualties from U.S. bombing and the siege of Plei Me was lifted.|$|R
60|$|As I strolled up, {{both men}} {{came out of}} the hotel. Wright saw <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> making an almost {{imperceptible}} sign to Sampson, he walked <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe turned <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I {{produced}} the case. The manager seized it eagerly, opened it, {{turned on the}} electric light and closed the case again with a great sigh of relief. He held out his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not love}} you," [...] she cried. [...] "Oh, {{please do not}} make me hate you. You are {{the only one who}} has shown {{kindness}} <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I want to like you, but I cannot love you." ...|$|E
60|$|The colonel stood {{watching}} the procedure. Presently his eyes fell upon me, {{and he spoke}} to a young officer at his side. The latter stepped <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> motioned me to follow him. I did so, and was led back to the colonel.|$|E
60|$|Now, in {{its proper}} place, I omitted to mention, that shortly after {{descending}} from the rigging, and while Samoa was rehearsing his adventures, dame Annatoo had stolen below into the forecastle, intent upon her chattels. And finding {{them all in}} mighty disarray, {{she returned to the}} deck prodigiously, excited, and glancing angrily <b>toward</b> Jarl <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> showered a whole torrent of objurgations into both ears of Samoa.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} <b>me</b> long <b>and</b> earnestly and I {{thought that she}} was {{softening}} <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|He pointed {{behind me}} with an aspect of such pale dismay, that I involuntarily glanced over my {{shoulder}} and started as if I had seen a veritable ghost; for, peering from the gloom of that inner room, I saw a shadowy face, with dark hair all about it, and a glimpse of scarlet at the throat. An instant showed {{me that it was}} only Robert leaning from his bed's-foot, wrapped in a gray army-blanket, with his red shirt just visible above it, and his long hair disordered by sleep. But what a strange expression was on his face! The unmarred side was <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> fixed <b>and</b> motionless as when I first observed it,--less absorbed now, but more intent. His eye glittered, his lips were apart like one who listened with every sense, and his whole aspect reminded me of a hound to which some wind had brought the scent of unsuspected prey.|$|R
