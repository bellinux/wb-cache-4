At this intersection, M-25 turns north on 24th Avenue to Lakeshore Road then runs parallel to the Lake Huron shoreline.|$|E
5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the modern gay liberation movement, {{a number of}} demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations {{to the exclusion of}} homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E

The same year the king dubbed him knight of the Order of the Polar Star, the first civilian in Sweden to become a knight in this order. He was then seldom seen not wearing the order's insignia.|$|E

5|$|The {{establishment}} of universally accepted conventions for {{the naming of}} organisms was Linnaeus' main contribution to taxonomy—his work marks <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> consistent use of binomial nomenclature. During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed {{what became known as}} the Linnaean taxonomy; the system of scientific classification now widely used in the biological sciences. A previous zoologist Rumphius (1627–1702) had more or less approximated the Linnaean system and his material contributed to the later development of the binomial scientific classification by Linnaeus.|$|E
5|$|The {{match is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most dramatic conclusions to a league season in the history of the English game.

There are also two rural highways that spur off Great Eastern Highway.

5|$|Cuarón {{wanted to}} do {{tracking}} shots, {{in part because the}} producers wanted to film it like an IMAX-style Discovery Channel documentary. Like his previous films, Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage as <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> his work on Gravity. Instead, he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos. He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the movie. Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible to feel as deep as possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling.|$|E

5|$|New Forest ponies are raced in {{an annual}} {{point to point}} meeting in the Forest, usually on Boxing Day, {{finishing}} at a different place each year. The races {{do not have a}} fixed course, but instead are run across the open Forest, so competitors choose their own routes around obstructions such as inclosures (forestry plantations), fenced paddocks, and bogs. Riders with a detailed knowledge of the Forest are thus at an advantage. The location of the meeting place is given to competitors on the previous evening, and <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the race is revealed once riders have arrived at the meeting point.|$|E
5|$|Rail {{connectivity}} in Mangalore {{was established}} in 1907. Mangalore was also <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> India's longest rail route. The city has two railway stations—Mangalore Central (at Hampankatta) and Mangalore Junction (at Kankanadi). A railway track, built through the Western Ghats, connects Mangalore with Hassan. The broad gauge track connecting Mangalore to Bangalore via Hassan was opened to freight traffic in May 2006 and passenger traffic in December 2007. Mangalore is also connected to Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, and Kollam through the Southern Railway and to Mumbai, Bhatkal, Karwar, Gujarat, Ajmer and Goa via the Konkan Railway.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of schools and religious, {{cultural}} and sporting facilities including sailing and wind surfing and golf.

The town is <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the South West Coast Path National Trail, the nation's longest long-distance countryside walking trail. The Minehead Railway was opened in 1874 and closed in 1971 but has since been reopened as the West Somerset Railway.|$|E
40|$|Prompted by an {{overlap in}} our transcriptions of the MOUTH and GOAT vowels in New Zealand English (NZE), we {{conducted}} an acoustic {{analysis of these}} diphthongs in samples of NZE for three age groups and two speaker sex groups. In addition, we considered {{the realization of the}} CURE vowel, since <b>the</b> <b>start</b> and end <b>points</b> <b>of</b> this diphthong appeared to overlap with <b>the</b> end and <b>start</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> MOUTH and GOAT. We conclude that although there is overlap in MOUTH and GOAT, our initial confusion of these vowels in transcription reflects our reliance on monophthongal phoneme target values for <b>start</b> and end <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diphthongs, and that a closer phonetic analysis allows better discrimination of the vowels, which should be reflected in our choice of transcription symbols. We conclude also that while the endpoint of the CURE vowel does indeed overlap with <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> MOUTH and GOAT, <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> CURE lies between the endpoints of the other two. 1...|$|R

5|$|Kagame {{was born}} to a Tutsi family in {{southern}} Rwanda. His mother was younger sister to King Ndahindurwa's wife. When he was two years old, the Rwandan Revolution ended centuries of Tutsi political dominance; his family fled to Uganda, where he {{spent the rest of}} his childhood. In the 1980s, Kagame fought in Yoweri Museveni's rebel army, becoming a senior Ugandan army officer after Museveni's military victories carried him to the Ugandan presidency. Kagame joined the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which invaded Rwanda in 1990; leader Fred Rwigyema died early in the war and Kagame took control. By 1993, the RPF controlled significant territory in Rwanda and a ceasefire was negotiated. The assassination of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed {{a little more than a}} million Tutsi and moderate Hutu combined. Kagame resumed the civil war, and ended the genocide with a military victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{model of}} the Millennium Monument was <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the Peristyle appearance in Chicago. To this day, {{it is said to}} not compare to the once “commanding presence” that once stood in its place, before being demolished and replaced with an underground parking garage. The new monument was downsized by approximately 15% to accommodate a wheel-chair ramp for the disabled in a tight space. It also includes a “classical” take on the original, incorporating a fountain {{at the base of the}} limestone, Doric, column monument. The monument, despite being relatively small in comparison to the rest of Grant Park, makes its presence known as the central focus to shape Wrigley Square and the surrounding landscape. Wrigley Square is unique for its fountain that, unlike Buckingham Fountain, which is fenced off, remains open with a circular ledge to allow park-goers the freedom to sit next to the open water to enjoy the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|When the Indian flag is flown on Indian {{territory}} {{along with}} other national flags, the general rule is that the Indian flag should be <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> all flags. When flags are placed in a straight line, the rightmost flag (leftmost to the observer facing the flag) is the Indian flag, followed by other national flags in alphabetical order. When placed in a circle, the Indian flag is the first point and is followed by other flags alphabetically. In such placement, all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag. Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another. In addition to being the first flag, the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically. When placed on crossed poles, the Indian flag should {{be in front of}} the other flag, and to the right (observer's left) of the other flag. The only exception to the preceding rule is when it is flown along with the flag of the United Nations, which may be placed to the right of the Indian flag.|$|E
