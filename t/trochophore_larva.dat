5|$|While all {{molecular}} phylogeny studies {{and half the}} combined studies until 2008 conclude that brachiopods are lophotrochozoans, they could not identify which lophotrochozoan phylum were the closest relatives of brachiopodsâ€”except phoronids, which are a sub-group of brachiopods. However, in 2008 two analyses found that brachiopods' closest lophotrochozoan relatives were nemertines. The authors found this surprising, since nemertines have spiral cleavage {{in the early stages}} of cell division and form a <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva,</b> while brachiopods have radial cleavage and a larva that shows no sign of having evolved from a trochophore. Another study in 2008 also concluded that brachiopods are closely related to nemertines, casting doubt on the idea that brachiopods are part of a clade Lophophorata of lophophore-feeding animals within the lophotrochozoans.|$|E

40|$|Synopsis The larval {{stages of}} polychaete annelids are often {{responsive}} to light and can possess one to six eyes. The early <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae</b> of the errant annelid Platynereis dumerilii {{have a single}} pair of ventral eyespots, whereas older nectochaete larvae have an additional two pairs of dorsal eyes that will develop into the adult eyes. Early Platynereis trochophores show robust positive phototaxis starting {{on the first day of}} development. Even though the mechanism of phototaxis in Platynereis early <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae</b> is well understood, no photopigment (opsin) expression has yet been described in this stage. In late <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae,</b> a rhabdomeric-type opsin, r-opsin 1, expressed in both the eyespots and the adult eyes has already been reported. Here, we identify another Platynereis rhabdomeric opsin, r-opsin 3, that is expressed in a single photoreceptor in the eyespots in early trochophores, suggesting that it mediates early larval pho-totaxis. We also show that r-opsin 1 and r-opsin 3 are expressed in adjacent photoreceptor cells in the eyespots in later stages, indicating that a second eyespot-photoreceptor differentiates in late <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae.</b> Using serial transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we identified and reconstructed both photoreceptors and a pigment cell in the late larval eyespot. We also characterized opsin expression in the adult eyes and found that the two opsins co-express there in several photoreceptor cells. Using antibodies recognizing r-opsin 1 and r-opsin 3 proteins, we demonstrate that both opsins localize to the rhabdomere in all six eyes. In addition, we found that r-opsin 1 mRNA is localized to, and translated in, the projections of the adult eyes. The specific changes we describe in opsin transcription and translation and in the cellula...|$|R
50|$|Trochophores {{exist as}} a larval form within the trochozoan clade, which include the entoprocts, molluscs, annelids, echiurans, sipunculans and nemerteans. Together, these phyla make up part of the Lophotrochozoa; it is {{possible}} that <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae</b> were present in the life cycle of the group's common ancestor.|$|R
5|$|Molluscs are {{generally}} regarded {{members of the}} Lophotrochozoa, a group defined by having <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae</b> and, {{in the case of}} living Lophophorata, a feeding structure called a lophophore. The other members of the Lophotrochozoa are the annelid worms and seven marine phyla. The diagram on the right summarizes a phylogeny presented in 2007.|$|R
50|$|After 24 hours, a fertilized egg {{gives rise}} to a <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva.</b> At 48 hours, the <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva</b> becomes a metatrochophore larva. Both trochophore and metatrochophore swim with a ring of cilia in the water and are {{positively}} phototactic. The metatrochophore has, beside the larval eyes, already the anlagen for the more complex adult eyes of the adult worm. A day later, at 72 hours after fertilization, the metatrochophore larva becomes a nectochaete larva. The nectochaete larva already has three segments, each with a pair of parapodia bearing chaetae, which serve for locomotion. The nectochaete larva can switch from positive to negative phototaxis. After five to seven days, the larvae start feeding and develop on their own speed, depending on food supply. After three to four weeks, when six segments have formed, the head is formed.|$|E
50|$|Although {{some species}} hatch {{directly}} into the adult form, many have a <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva,</b> which metamorphoses into the adult after anything from a day to a month, depending on species. In a few species, the trochophore does not develop {{directly into the}} adult, but into an intermediate pelagosphaera stage, that possesses a greatly enlarged metatroch (ciliated band).|$|E
50|$|A rhabdomeric {{photoreceptor}} cell {{forms with}} a pigment cell a simple eye. A pair of these eyes mediate phototaxis {{in the early}} Platynereis dumerilii <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva.</b> In the later nectochaete larva, phototaxis is mediated by the more complex adult eyes. The adult eyes express at least three opsins: Two rhabdomeric opsins and a Go-opsin. The three opsins there mediate phototaxis all the same way via depolarization, even so a scallop Go-opsin is known to hyperpolarize.|$|E
50|$|The fertilized eggs {{typically}} hatch into <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae,</b> which float {{among the}} plankton, and eventually metamorphose into the adult form by adding segments.

5|$|While {{analyses}} by {{molecular phylogeny}} {{are confident that}} members of Lophotrochozoa are {{more closely related to}} each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. The Lophotrochozoa are generally divided into: Lophophorata (animals that have lophophores), including Phoronida and Brachiopoda; Trochozoa (animals many of which have <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae),</b> including molluscs, annelids, echiurans, sipunculans and nemerteans; and some other phyla (such as Platyhelminthes, Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and Rotifera).|$|R
50|$|Another {{example is}} the <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva</b> of Platynereis dumerilii, where the larval eye was ablated and the larvae was not phototactic, anymore. However phototaxis in the nectochaete larva of Platynereis dumerilii is not {{mediated}} by the larval eyes, because the larva is still phototactic, even if the larval eyes are ablated. But if the adult eyes are ablated, then the nectochaete is not phototactic anymore and thus phototaxis in the nectochaete larva is mediated by the adult eyes.|$|E
5000|$|Riftia develop from a free-swimming, pelagic, {{non-symbiotic}} <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva,</b> which enters juvenile (metatrochophore) development, becoming sessile {{and subsequently}} acquiring symbiotic bacteria. [...] The symbiotic bacteria, on which adult worms depend for sustenance, are {{not present in}} the gametes, but are acquired from the environment via the digestive tract. The digestive tract transiently connects from a mouth {{at the tip of}} the ventral medial process to a foregut, midgut, hindgut and anus. After symbionts are established in the midgut, it undergoes substantial remodelling and enlargement to become the trophosome, while the remainder of the digestive tract has not been detected in adult specimens.|$|E

500|$|During the spring, {{favorable}} food supplies, adequate light, and optimum {{water temperature}} provide conditions for breeding and early growth.

50|$|The {{buttercup}} lucine becomes {{sexually mature}} at {{a length of}} about 1.7 cm. Spawning takes place all year round in Florida with peaks of activity in mid winter and mid summer. As in other bivalve molluscs, gametes are liberated into the sea and fertilisation is external. The eggs hatch into planktonic <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae</b> which later develop into veliger larvae. After a period of further development, these settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis into juveniles.|$|R
50|$|The egg has a tough spiny coat, {{and usually}} hatches {{to release a}} free-swimming <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva,</b> typical of many other mollusc groups. In a few cases, the trochophore remains within the egg (and is then called lecithotrophic - {{deriving}} nutrition from yolk), which hatches to produce a miniature adult. Unlike most other molluscs, there is no intermediate stage, or veliger, between the trochophore and the adult. Instead, a segmented shell gland forms {{on one side of}} the larva, and a foot forms on the opposite side. When the larva is ready to become an adult, the body elongates, and the shell gland secretes the plates of the shell. Unlike the fully grown adult, the larva has a pair of simple eyes, although these may remain for some time in the immature adult.|$|E
50|$|Platynereis dumerilii nectochate larvae {{can switch}} between {{positive}} and negative phototaxis. Phototaxis there is mediated by two pairs of more complex pigment cup eyes. These eyes contain more photoreceptor cells that are shaded by pigment cells forming a cup. The photoreceptor cells do not synapse directly onto ciliated cells or muscle cells but onto inter-neurons of a processing center. This way the information of all four eye cups can be compared and a low resolution image of four pixels can be created telling the larvae where the light is coming from. This way the larva {{does not need to}} scan its environment by rotating. This is an adaption for living {{on the bottom of the}} sea the life style of the nectochaete larva while scanning rotation is more suited for living in the open water column, the life style of the <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva.</b> Phototaxis in the Platynereis dumerilii nectochate larva has a broad spectral range which is at least covered by three opsins that are expressed by the cup eyes: Two rhabdomeric opsins and a Go-opsin.|$|E
30|$|Some of {{the field}} {{collected}} organisms only produce viable gametes for {{a certain period of}} the year, which limits their use in routine toxicity testing. Furthermore, it is noted that sea urchins require 5 to 10 Â min for fertilization, 1 Â h for first cleavage, 24 Â h for blastula and gastrula, and 48 Â h for <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva</b> (Qiu, Tremblay, & Bourget, 2002). In contrast H. elegens requires 2 to 3 Â min for fertilization, 30 Â min for first cleavage, and approximately 12 Â h for distinguishable <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva</b> Vijayaragavan, 2009). Therefore, the advantages of developing bioassays using H. elegans embryos are more clear and accurate.|$|E
50|$|Scyllaea pelagica is a hermaphrodite. Two {{individuals}} {{come together}} to exchange sperm through their genital openings and fertilisation is internal.

40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism technique to investigate DNA methylation profiles in different tissues and in the early-development stages of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata (P. fucata). Methylation levels in adductor muscle, digestive gland, axe foot, heart, and gill ranged from 11. 71 to 14. 71 %, and significant differences (P < 0. 05) between methylation levels in different tissues were observed. The DNA methylation levels of sperm, egg cells, two-cell embryos, morula embryos, <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae</b> and D-shaped larvae were 13. 51, 11. 80, 12. 14, 12. 60, 14. 65 and 13. 18 %, respectively. Development stages of two-cell embryos, morula embryos, <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae</b> and D-shaped larvae indicated a higher number of identical DNA methylation status loci in the egg, compared {{to that in the}} sperm. It is probable that DNA methylation patterns of the progeny are mainly influenced by the egg, while the sperm may become increasingly important during the process of early embryo development. The observed differences in methylation levels in the tissues and the development stages of P. fucata suggest that DNA methylation may act as an epigenetic regulator during tissue differentiation, individual growth, and development...|$|R
50|$|Although {{many species}} can {{reproduce}} asexually and use similar mechanisms to regenerate after severe injuries, sexual reproduction is the normal method in species whose reproduction has been studied.

40|$|SUMMARY Nemerteans {{have been}} alleged {{to belong to}} a protostome clade called the Trochozoa that includesmollusks, annelids, sipunculids, echiurids, and kamptozoans and is {{characterized}} by, among other things, the <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva.</b> The trochophore possesses a prototroch, a preoral belt of specialized ciliary cells, derived from the trochoblast cells. Nemertea is the only trochozoan phylum for which presence of the <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva</b> possessing a prototroch had never been shown. However, so little is known about nemertean larval development that comparing it with development of other trochozoans is difficult. Development in the nemertean clade Pilidiophora is via a highly specialized planktonic larva, the pilidium, and most of the larval body is lost during a drastic metamorphosis. Other nemerteans (hoplonemerteans and palaeonemerteans) lack a pilidium, and their development i...|$|E
40|$|Hox genes encode {{a set of}} {{evolutionarily}} conserved transcription {{factors that}} regulate anteroposterior patterning mechanisms in insects and vertebrates and are expressed along this axis {{in a range of}} bilaterians. Here we present the developmental expression of a Scr/Hox 5 gene in the gastropod mollusc Haliotis. In Haliotis, embryogenesis yields a non-feeding <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva</b> that subsequently develops into the veliger larva, which possesses many of the characteristics of the adult body plan. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis reveals that this gene, which is called Hru-Hox 5, is first expressed in the <b>trochophore</b> <b>larva.</b> Hru-Hox 5 transcript prevalence increases continually through larval development until metamorphic competence develops in the veliger and then again over the first four days of metamorphosis. In situ hybridization reveals that larval expression of Hru-Hox 5 is restricted primarily to the primordial and newly formed branchial ganglia, located between the anterior cerebral-pleuropedal ganglionic complex and the posterior visceral ganglia. The expression of Hru-Hox 5 in the central region of the abalone CNS is similar to that observed for its orthologue (Lox 20) in the leech, suggesting that Hox 5 genes were used, along with other Hox genes, to pattern the CNS of the ancestral spiralian lophotrochozoan...|$|E

50|$|This worm can {{reproduce}} asexually by fragmentation, and can regenerate {{body parts}} after being damaged. Reproduction {{can also be}} by sexual means. Most worms are either male or female and the gametes mature in the coelom before being released into the water column. Some specimens, particularly larger ones, have {{both male and female}} gametes and a study concluded that this was consistent with sequential hermaphroditism. Fertilization is external, and after a short time in the plankton, the <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae</b> settle out and grow into adult worms.|$|R
500|$|Fertilization {{is usually}} external. Typically, a short stage lasts {{a few hours}} or days before the eggs hatch into <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae.</b> These later develop into veliger larvae which settle on the seabed and undergo {{metamorphosis}} into juveniles that are sometimes (for example {{in the case of}} oysters) known as [...] "spat". In some species, such as those in the genus Lasaea, females draw water containing sperm in through their inhalant siphons and fertilization takes place inside the female. These species then brood the young inside their mantle cavity, eventually releasing them into the water column as veliger larvae or as crawl-away juveniles.|$|R
50|$|Also {{included}} {{are two of}} the most successful animal phyla, the Mollusca and Annelida. The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes animals such as snails, clams, and squids, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as earthworms and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of <b>trochophore</b> <b>larvae,</b> but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented. Now, this is generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla.|$|R
