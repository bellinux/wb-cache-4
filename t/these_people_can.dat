The player controls Link from a flip-screen overhead perspective as he travels in the overworld, a large outdoor map with varied environments. Link begins the game armed {{only with a}} small shield, but a sword becomes available to Link after he ventures into a cave that is accessible from the game's first map screen. Throughout the game, various characters aid Link by giving or selling equipment and clues. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be found in caves scattered throughout the overworld; some are readily accessible, while others are hidden behind obstacles such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls.|$|E

Talismans used by <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> {{be broken down into}} three main categories: talismans carried or worn on the body, talismans hung upon or above the bed of an infirm person, and medicinal talismans. This third category can be further divided into external and internal talismans. For example, an external amulet can be placed in a bath.|$|R

This is the [...] "problem drinker", whose drinking creates social and personal problems.

2500|$|Section 36 removes {{limits on}} who {{can act as}} a conveyancer, and allows any individual, {{corporation}} or employee of a corporation to act as a conveyancer if they or the corporation is suitably qualified.

According to Haddon, none of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be labelled as having a disability. Haddon added that he [...] "slightly regret" [...] that the term Asperger's syndrome appeared {{on the cover of}} his novel. In 2010, in an interview with The Independent, he was described as [...] "now thoroughly irritated that the word Asperger's appeared on subsequent editions of the novel, because now everyone imagines that he is an expert and he keeps getting phone calls asking him to appear at lectures." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{implications}} of Hegel’s Philosophy of World History with respect to colonialism. For Hegel, freedom can be recognized and practised only in classical, Christian and modern Europe; therefore, the world’s other <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> acquire freedom only if Europeans impose their civilization upon them. Although this imposition denies freedom to colonized peoples, this denial is legitimate for Hegel {{because it is the}} sole condition on which <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> gain freedom in the longer term. The article then considers whether Hegel’s basic account of freedom can be extricated from his Eurocentric and pro-colonialist interpretation of the course of history. The article argues that matters are more complicated because that interpretation has significant connections with Hegel’s conception of freedom as self-determination...|$|R
2500|$|Ethnic Macedonians self-identify as [...] "Macedonians" [...] (Macedonian: Македонци, Makedonci) in {{an ethnic}} sense {{as well as}} in the {{regional}} sense. They are the second largest ethnic group in the region. Because of their primarily Slavic origin they are also known as [...] "Macedonian Slavs" [...] and [...] "Slav Macedonians" [...] (Greek: Σλαβομακεδόνες, [...] "Slavomakedones"). They form the majority of the population in the Republic of Macedonia where according to the 2002 census, approximately 1,300,000 people declared themselves as Macedonians. According to the latest Bulgarian census held in 2001, there are 3,117 people declaring themselves ethnic Macedonians in the Blagoevgrad Province of Bulgaria (Pirin Macedonia). The official number of ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria is 5,071. A relatively small number of ethnic Macedonians exist among the Slavic-speakers of Greek Macedonia. There has not been a census in Greece on the question of mother tongue since 1951, when the census recorded 41,017 Slavic-speakers, mostly in the West Macedonia periphery of Greece. The linguistic classification of the Slavic dialects spoken by <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be either Bulgarian or Macedonian, although the people themselves call their language [...] "Slavic". Most of these people declare themselves as ethnic Greeks (Slavophone Greeks), although there are small groups espousing ethnic Macedonian and Bulgarian national identities. In the 1989 Albanian census, approximately 5,000 Albanian citizens declared themselves Macedonians.|$|E

But while they rested Bes and I and Karema, {{with some of the}} generals consulted together long and earnestly. For in truth we knew not what to do. But a league away lay the town of Amada beset by hundreds of thousands of the Easterns so that none could come in or out, and within its walls were the remains of Pharaoh's army, not more than twenty thousand men, all told, if what we heard were true. On the Nile also was the great Grecian and Cyprian fleet, two hundred vessels and more, though as we could see {{by the light of the}} setting sun the most of these were made fast to the western bank where the Egyptians could not come at them.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} the capital was {{electrified}} by a royal ordinance, disbanding all the National Guards of Paris! A more infatuated, or, if it were intended to punish the disaffected, a more unjust decree, could not easily have been issued. It was telling {{the great majority of}} the very class which forms the true force of every government that their rulers could not confide in them. As confidence, by awakening pride, begets a spirit in favour of those who depend on it, so does obvious distrust engender disaffection. But the certainty that Louis XVI. lost his throne and his life for the want of decision, has created one of those sweeping opinions here of the virtue of energy, that constantly leads the rulers into false measures. An act that might have restrained the France of 1792, would be certain to throw the France of 1827 into open revolt. The present generation of Frenchmen, in a political sense, have little in common with even the French of 1814, and measures must be suited to the times in which we live. As well might one think of using the birch on the man, that had been found profitable with the boy, as to suppose <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be treated like their ancestors.|$|E
