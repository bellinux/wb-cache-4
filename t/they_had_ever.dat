5|$|According to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's {{performance}} in the final Test at The Oval {{was one of the}} best <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen from any player. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, surprising most observers. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
5|$|Burnley used 23 {{different}} players {{during the}} season and had nine different goalscorers. Their top scorer was Scottish forward Joe Anderson, with 31competitive goals, including 25 in the league. Eight new players were signed by Burnley {{during the course of}} the season, and nine were released. Match attendances were the highest <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been at Turf Moor, with an average gate of over 30,000. The highest attendance of the campaign was a crowd of 42,653, who saw Burnley beat Bolton Wanderers 3–1 on 26February 1921; the lowest was 22,000, for the match against Sunderland on the final day of the season.|$|E

5|$|Leek {{were chosen}} {{to be among the}} founder members of the new Northern Premier League Division One in 1987 and in 1989–90 won the Division One title to gain {{promotion}} to the Premier Division, the highest level at which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> played. In the same season they progressed through eight rounds of the FA Trophy, including a quarter-final win over Darlington, that season's Conference champions, to reach the final at Wembley Stadium but were defeated 3–0 by Barrow.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Celtic found {{themselves}} drawn with AC Milan, Ajax and again Barcelona {{in the group}} stage. The campaign was dismal, winning only once with a 21 home win over Ajax, and slumping to a 61 rout away against Barcelona in the final group match. That game saw Celtic concede the most goals <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> done in a single European tie, and equalled their previous heaviest defeat in Europe, a 5–0 loss to Artmedia Bratislava.|$|E
5|$|Tropic Thunder held {{an early}} {{screening}} at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, {{two weeks before}} it officially premiered on August 11, 2008, at the Mann Village Theatre in Westwood, California and two days before its wide release. Members of several disability groups picketed before the premiere, protesting at the portrayal of mental retardation shown in the film. The groups revealed {{that it was the}} first time that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> protested together at an event. As a result of the protest, the normally unobstructed views of the red carpet leading to the premiere were blocked off by 10-foot (3-m)-high fences and there was an increase in the number of security personnel present. No protests were held at the United Kingdom's September premiere.|$|E

5|$|At 12, Westenra {{entered a}} {{professional}} recording studio to record Walking in the Air, a demo album originally created {{for friends and}} family. At first, her parents paid for 70 copies; soon after, 1,000 more were cut for sale, hand-out, and publicity. After finishing her album, Westenra and her sister Sophie busked in Christchurch, giving away {{a few of the}} original 70 albums (at the behest of passersby) and selling some of the latter 1000. The pair drew large crowds, and one woman asked the girls if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> recorded anything. The woman, a journalist with Canterbury Television, asked Westenra to appear on air. Gray Bartlett, the director of a concert promotion company, saw the show and became interested in working with Westenra. Shortly after, she was offered a recording deal with Universal Records New Zealand. On that label, Westenra, who in the meantime was attending Burnside High School, released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as well as My Gift to You, a CD of Christmas music. Following the success of her albums, she was offered and later received lessons from Dame Malvina Major.|$|E
5|$|GameSpot editor Jeff Gerstmann {{opened his}} review by calling Burnout 3: Takedown {{one of the}} best racing games of all time, noting that it stood out among contemporaries in the diverse and {{expanding}} genre. He felt the quality of the game was high enough to recommend it to gamers who were impartial to driving games. Edge magazine regarded Burnout 3 to be Criterion's finest work to date; they thought the studio had demonstrated their proficiency by revising the series structure and dynamic. They were also mindful of how Burnout 3s offered a fun and exhilarating experience while other developers were prioritising realism in their games. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer wrote that the addition of significant gameplay mechanics had helped craft one of the most addictive racing games ever made. GamesTM awarded it a perfect score; they proclaimed that Burnout 3 was without a doubt the greatest racing game ever made and described playing it as the most fun <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> had in the genre. GameSpy reviewer Miguel Lopez, who also awarded the game a perfect score, remarked that it was possibly the best arcade racer ever made.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August 2007, Sunderland celebrated 10 {{years at}} the Stadium of Light with a draw against Juventus, and {{prepared}} for the oncoming season by spending nearly £40million on new players for the squad, whilst also breaking the British transfer record for a goalkeeper with the £9million transfer of Craig Gordon. Sunderland's season took off with a victory at home against Tottenham, as Michael Chopra scored in the last minute. After a derby victory over Middlesbrough, and with teams below failing to win, Sunderland secured their Premier League status for the 2008–09 season. On 25 October 2008, Sunderland defeated rivals Newcastle United 2–1 at the Stadium of Light, their first home win over them since 1980, {{and the first time}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> defeated them at that ground. on 4 December 2008, Keane left Sunderland after a run of defeats in the Premier League. First-team coach Ricky Sbragia took over as caretaker manager, and on 27 December 2008 Sbragia took the job on a permanent basis, signing an 18-month contract. Despite promising early results, the team continued to struggle and narrowly avoided relegation from the Premiership {{on the last day of}} the season, after which Sbragia resigned from his post.|$|E

5|$|The great {{accomplishment}} of the Hortensian Law {{was in that}} it deprived the Patricians of their final weapon over the Plebeians. Therefore, the new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy replaced the old Patrician aristocracy, and the last great political question of the earlier era had been resolved. As such, no important political changes occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC. This entire era was dominated by foreign wars, which eliminated the {{need to address the}} flaws in the current political system, since the patriotism of the Plebeians suppressed their desire for further reforms. However, this era created new problems, which began to be realized {{near the end of the}} 2nd century BC. For example, the nature of Rome's military commanders changed. Roman soldiers of earlier eras fought short wars, and then returned to their farms. Since their generals did the same thing, the soldiers came to view their generals as being nothing more than fellow citizen-soldiers. Now, however, wars were becoming longer and of a larger scale. Thus, this period saw a growing affinity between the average citizen and his general, while the generals acquired more power than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> held before.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or types of cancer. When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E
