25|$|The {{last two}} decades have also seen {{a revival of the}} Beat poetry spoken word tradition, {{in the form of the}} poetry slam, which was born of the Nuyorican {{movement}} led by New York–based Puerto Rican poets Pedro Pietri, Giannina Braschi, and Miguel Piñero. Chicago construction worker Marc Smith turned urban poetry performance into audience-judged competitions in 1984. Poetry slams emphasize a style of writing that is topical, provocative and easily understood. Poetry slam opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new generation of writers and spoken word performers, including Alix Olson, Apollo Poetry, Taylor Mali, and Saul Williams, and inspired hundreds of open mics across the country.|$|E

25|$|In Sweden {{during this}} period the Protectionist Party had been established, gaining ground in 1885–1886 due to {{downward}} price pressure on Swedish crops, especially barley. Demands for duties on imported foodstuffs to benefit Swedish farmers were opposed by pro free-trade prime minister Robert Themptander. Events took an unexpected turn. The disqualification of Stockholm's 22 pro free-trade members of the democratically elected Lower House on a technicality (one member's non-payment of 11.58 kr in taxes a few years previously) and the appointment, in their place, of 22 protectionist members tipped {{the balance of power}} and brought about Themptander's resignation, opening <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new leader.|$|E
25|$|The MFA overthrew the Lisbon {{government}} in {{protest against the}} authoritarian political regime and the ongoing African colonial wars, specially the particularly demanding conflict in Portuguese Guinea. The revolutionary Portuguese government removed the remaining elements of its colonial forces and agreed to a quick handover of power to the nationalist African movements. This put an immediate end to the independence war against Portugal, but opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bitter armed conflict among the independentist forces and their respectives allies. Holden Roberto, Agostinho Neto, and Jonas Savimbi met in Bukavu, Zaire in July and agreed {{to negotiate with the}} Portuguese as one political entity, but afterwards the fight broke out again.|$|E

According to John Oller's biography, Jean Arthur: The Actress Nobody Knew (1997), Arthur developed a kind of stage fright punctuated with bouts of psychosomatic illnesses. A prime example was in 1945, when she was cast in {{the lead of the}} Garson Kanin play, Born Yesterday. Her nerves and insecurity got the better of her and she left the production before it reached Broadway, opening <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> then-unknown Judy Holliday to take the part.|$|E

500|$|NdegéOcello's 1993 {{debut album}} Plantation Lullabies was later {{credited}} {{as the beginning}} of neo soul; according to Renee Graham of The Boston Globe, it was [...] "arguably the first shot in the so-called 'neo-soul' movement", The success of Tony! Toni! Toné!'s 1993 album Sons of Soul was also viewed as a precursor to the soul music revival in the mid-1990s. Cheo Hodari Coker said in 1997 that the album [...] "largely sparked the soul music revival that has opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new generation of singers who build on the tradition of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder". Allmusic editor Leo Stanley wrote that by the release of Tony! Toni! Toné!'s follow-up album House of Music in 1996, [...] "their influence was beginning to be apparent, as younger soul singer-songwriters like Tony Rich and Maxwell began reaching the R charts. Like Tony! Toni! Toné!, Rich and Maxwell relied on traditional soul and R values of songwriting and live performances, discarding the synth-heavy productions of the late '80s and early '90s". Malcolm Venable of Vibe cited the early work of hip hop group The Roots, who used live instrumentation, as a precursor to neo soul's commercial breakthrough in the mid-1990s.|$|E

500|$|When Jason Takes Manhattan {{failed to}} perform {{successfully}} {{at the box}} office, Sean Cunningham decided {{that he wanted to}} reacquire the rights to Friday the 13th and start working with New Line Cinema on Freddy vs. Jason, as New Line owned the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. The concept of a fight between Freddy and Jason was not new, since Paramount had approached New Line about filming a crossover years before the latter had gained the licensing rights to Friday the 13th. At that time, both companies wanted the license to the other's character so that they could control the making of the film. Negotiations on the project were never finalized, which led Paramount to make The New Blood. After Jason Takes Manhattan was released in 1989, the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto, who sold them to New Line. Before Cunningham could start working on Freddy vs. Jason, Wes Craven returned to New Line to make New Nightmare. This effectively put Freddy vs. Jason on hold, but allowed Cunningham the chance to bring Jason back into the spotlight with Jason Goes to Hell. The ninth installment [...] "turned a healthy profit", though it was only intended to open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> crossover with Freddy Krueger rather than to start a new series for New Line. Ultimately, the film series would go through another sequel before that would happen. Cunningham's [...] "frustration" [...] with the delayed development of the Freddy vs. Jason project forced him to create another sequel {{in an effort to keep}} the franchise in the minds of audiences. Based on Jason Takes Manhattans concept of taking Jason away from Crystal Lake, the 10th film would put the titular character in space. The film suffered from the loss of its biggest supporter, President of Production Michael De Luca, when he resigned from his position. Lack of support forced the finished film to sit for two years before finally being released on April 26, 2002, and it would go on to become the lowest-grossing film in the franchise at the domestic box office. It also held the distinction of having the largest budget of any of the previous films at that time.|$|E

[...] The music video for [...] "Across the Universe", originally used to promote I Am Sam, was directed by Len Wiseman and released through V2 Records.

2500|$|Jefferson's [...] "old-fashioned" [...] {{sound and}} {{confident}} musicianship {{made it easy}} to market him.

He stuck to no musical conventions, varying his riffs and rhythm and singing complex and expressive lyrics in a manner exceptional at the time for a [...] "simple country blues singer."

In 1987 the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Louisiana act was also unconstitutional, because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. At the same time, it stated its opinion that [...] "teaching a variety of scientific theories {{about the origins of}} humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction," [...] leaving open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> handful of proponents of creation science to evolve their arguments into the iteration of creationism that later {{came to be known as}} intelligent design.|$|E

[...] Beam brought an innovative approach to all the media he worked in. [...] "Technically Beam is regarded as an innovator for his intentional blurring of diverse art practises, thereby enabling certain methodologies and techniques to acquire new contexts. His innovative techniques, in fact, have been emulated by a new generation of artists-Native and not." [...] "He evolved his own unique techniques as needed in photo-etching and photo based painting, to name a few, and his passionate discourse on all things political and practical inspired many people." [...] A major retrospective of his work, mounted by the National Gallery of Canada, is on exhibition, having started October 22, 2010, thus recognizing Beam as one of Canada's most important artists. The exhibition is curated by Greg A.
