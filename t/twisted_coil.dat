40|$|A {{simple method}} to {{evaluate}} the thickness distribution of the deposition layer formed on the first wall is proposed using an innovative measurement concept of the optical reflection coefficient, which is measured as the RGB (red, green, blue) value using a compact color analyzer. Analysis of the samples exposed to plasmas during an experimental campaign shows {{the relationship between the}} thickness of the deposition layer and the reflection coefficient, which is followed by the single layer model. The reflection coefficient clearly indicates the thickness of the deposition layer between 10 and 100 nm. The reflection coefficients of stainless steel plates on the helically <b>twisted</b> <b>coil</b> in one of the 10 toroidal sections of the vacuum vessel in the Large Helical Device (LHD) are measured. There is almost no deposition layer on the inner side of the torus, however, the deposition layer reaches a thickness of over 100 nm on the first wall near the divertor region. On the outer side of the torus, almost the entire area is covered by the deposition layer. Reflection coefficient measurements indicate that approximately 60 % of the area on the measured coil can is coated with a deposition layer over 10 nm thick, which suggests that this area plays a role in the wall retention...|$|E

30|$|The {{reviewed}} work on twist-spun CNT artificial muscles {{demonstrates the}} extremely high torsional and tensile muscle performance {{than can be}} obtained by the use of twisted, non-coiled and <b>twisted,</b> <b>coiled</b> CNT yarns. The liquid-electrolyte-based twisted, non-coiled muscles (1) generate highly reversible torsional rotation (250 °/mm of muscle length), which is 1000 times that for prior-art muscles, as well as a 590 revolutions/minute maximum rotation rate that was maintained for 30 full rotations and (2) a gravimetric peak torsional power output similar to that of large, high-power electric motor [1]. While the demonstrated use of these muscles for microfluidic circuits might become practical, the need for an electrolyte bath and associated confinement system is problematic (especially since it dramatically increases system weight and volume).|$|R
40|$|Chirality is {{a central}} theme in nature: from themolecular level (the single left- or {{right-handed}}amino acid) up to the supramolecular level (the right-handed double helix of DNA or the <b>twisting</b> <b>coil</b> of sea shells). Now chemists,like Kenneth Raymond and colleagues,are expanding the natural set of supramolecular chiral structures by using a modular synthetic approach 1. This growing interest in supramolecular chirality stems {{not only from the}} relevance of such studies to the chiral bias inherent to life,but also from the potential technological applications,such as the separation of optical isomers for the pharmaceutical or food industries. Molecular chirality originates from the non-symmetric arrangement of chemical groups covalently linked to an atomic centre,which is therefore not easily subject to dissociation.

40|$|AbstractThe x-ray {{coordinates}} of β-barrel transmembrane proteins {{from the}} porins superfamily and relatives {{are used to}} calculate the mean tilt of the β-strands and their mean local <b>twist</b> and <b>coiling</b> angles. The 13 proteins examined correspond to β-barrels with 8 to 22 strands, and shear numbers ranging from 8 to 24. The results are compared with predictions from the model of Murzin, Lesk, and Chothia for symmetrical regular barrels. Good agreement is found for the mean strand tilt, but the twist angles are smaller than those for open β-sheets and β-barrels with shorter strands. The model is reparameterised to account for the reduced twist characteristic of long-stranded transmembrane β-barrels. This produces predictions of both <b>twist</b> and <b>coiling</b> angles that are in agreement with the mean values obtained from the x-ray structures. With the optimized parameters, the model can then be used to determine <b>twist</b> and <b>coiling</b> angles of transmembrane β-barrels from measurements of the amide band infrared dichroism in oriented membranes. Satisfactory agreement is obtained for OmpF. The strand tilt obtained from the x-ray coordinates, or from the reparameterised model, can be combined with infrared dichroism measurements to obtain information on the orientation of the β-barrel assembly in the membrane...|$|R

Incorporation of themuscle in applications {{that rely on}} feedback creates the need for deflection and force sensing.

To this end, we characterize the relation between electrical impedance on the one hand, and deflection, force, and temperature {{on the other hand}} for the Joule-heated version of this muscle. Investigation of the theoretical relations provides potential fit functions that are verified experimentally. Using these fit functions results in an average estimation error of 0. 8 %, 7. 6 %, and 0. 5 %, respectively, for estimating deflection, force, and temperature. This indicates the suitability of this self-sensing principle in the Joule-heated <b>twisted</b> and <b>coiled</b> polymer muscle. </p...|$|R
