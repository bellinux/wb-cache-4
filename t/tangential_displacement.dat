40|$|Nondestructive {{evaluation}} of the structural integrity of shaft and tunnel concrete linings {{is the focus of}} this thesis. A nondestructive testing system was assembled based on the principle of miniature seismic reflection (MSR). The MSR system consists of spherical tip impactors and a pair of vertical and <b>tangential</b> <b>displacement</b> transducers. Mechanical impact causes generation of stress P- and S-waves in the test object. The elastic waveforms undergo multiple reflections between {{the top and bottom of}} the testing layer. The surface displacements are captured by a vertical and <b>tangential</b> <b>displacement</b> transducer. The signals are transformed from time domain waveforms to frequency spectra. The vertical displacement transducer is sensitive to normal surface displacements and the highest amplitude peak on the computed frequency spectrum is related to the resonance of the P-wave between the top and the bottom layer. Similarly, the <b>tangential</b> <b>displacement</b> transducer is sensitive to the horizontal surface displacements, and the maximum peak value in the generated frequency spectrum corresponds to the resonance of the S-wave between the two layers of the testing object. Thus, knowing the thickness of the given layer, as well as the measured frequencies, allows P- and S-wave velocities to be calculated. Alternatively, if the thickness is unknown, the time-distance graph of the primary surface wave arrivals can be used to calculate the P-wave velocities and, subsequently, the thickness of the layer. The MSR response depends on the material properties of the testing object. The elastic wave velocities can be used to calculate directly the dynamic elastic properties of the test object. In this study, simulated fractures and steel reinforcement bars were detected and located using the reflected P-waves. In addition, the changes in elastic properties of various types of concrete mixes were monitored for a 28 -day curing period. The MSR elastic constants were then compared with dy...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{tangential}} drive (Tdrive) polysilicon, {{linear actuator}} is presented which produces large magnitude tangential motion by flexing a microstructure in an essentially straight line with moderate input voltage. These devices have been designed, fabricated, and successfully tested to have substantial displacements even for static positioning. The working {{principle of the}} T-drive is that the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between a fixed bar and a free bar are converted to large amplitude tangential motion by the parallelogram flexural suspension of the free bar. Operating devices are capable of tangential displacements as great as 32 pm. This displacement is stable and easily varied, since the <b>tangential</b> <b>displacement</b> can be controlled by adjusting the potential between the fixed electrode and the traversing bar. Static displacements are detectable for voltages as low as 15 VDC. Typical T-drives have free bars 200 m long, 12 pn wide, with flexural suspensions 450 pn long and 2 pm wide.

Subjects adjusted {{the magnitude of}} slow <b>tangential</b> and oblique <b>displacements</b> of a cylindrical, flat-ended 1 mm diameter probe glued to the skin in order to match the perceived intensity of a reference displacement that indented the skin normal to the surface. At both the forearm and finger pad, subjects chose <b>tangential</b> <b>displacements</b> with magnitudes only 0. 3 to 0. 6 -times {{the magnitude of the}} normal stimulus, indicating significantly higher sensitivity to <b>tangential</b> <b>displacements</b> (p< 0. 005). These findings are in rough agreement with a basic analysis of how normal and tangential loads transmit energy to mechanoreceptors at different depths in the tissue. Based on measurements of the mechanical impedance of the skin to normal and <b>tangential</b> <b>displacements,</b> these results were also expressed in terms of forces. At the forearm, subjects were more sensitive to tangential forces than normal force. However, at the fingerpad, sensitivity to tangential forces was lower than sensitivity to normal force, due to the approximately five-fold greater stiffness of the fingerpad to tangential traction. These results provide guidance for development of tactile displays: (1) When an actuator is limited primarily in terms of peak displacement (e. g., the maximum strain of a ceramic peizoelectric actuator) then tangential stimulation is a superior choice for both body sites we tested. (2) When an actuator is limited primarily in terms of peak force (e. g., the stall torque of a DC micromotor) tangential stimulation is the superior choice for the hairy skin, but normal stimulation is the better choice on the fingerpad.

40|$|Modelling of elastic {{deformations}} {{in materials}} containing frictional cracks of known configuration is possible via modern finite element methods. However, {{it is necessary}} to define boundary conditions at crack faces considered as additional (internal) boundaries. The classical Coulomb friction law for flat contact surfaces does not provide explicitly the desired load-displacement relationship. Indeed, once the threshold condition is reached, the <b>tangential</b> <b>displacement</b> becomes undefined. Therefore we use another approach in which contact displacements are considered as arguments and not functions. This has been done for contact between rough surfaces. Surface relief engenders a partial slip regime (absent for flat faces) and makes it possible to express the <b>tangential</b> <b>displacement</b> as a sum of partial slip and total sliding components. The partial slip regime corresponds to the Hertz-Mindlin problem of contact between two spheres with friction, except that its solution should be extended for rough surface geometries and arbitrary loading histories. We build up this extension using the previously developed method of memory diagrams and finally obtain a semi-analytical load-displacement solution to the contact problem. The algorithm has been integrated into the COMSOL solid mechanics unit. We present several examples produced by our numerical code and also provide nonlinear analysis. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{positioning}} {{mechanisms are}} required for the proper and effective functioning of high-tech mechatronic systems. The tribological behaviour of sliding contacts in such mechanisms {{plays an important role}} in the performance of these systems. The geometrical changes of the surfaces, where geometry is defined as a multi asperity contact, will influence the frictional behaviour. This thesis focuses on the pre-sliding and sliding behaviour of contacts with the aim of determining the parameters which influence the errors in positioning accuracy. The single asperity contact is the first step in understanding the pre-sliding behaviour between two elements. It is from this model that the <b>tangential</b> <b>displacement</b> is calculated, based on an applied normal load and the coefficient of friction. The normal load can be constant, either increasing or decreasing; this will depend on the operating conditions within the application. Adhesion {{plays an important role in}} a single asperity contact, whilst for a multi asperity contact adhesion can often be ignored. This thesis introduces the test setup, which consists of a confocal height sensor for surface roughness measurement and a confocal Raman spectroscopy setup for chemical changes in the contact. Using this setup, it is possible to analyse the formation of chemical transfer layers as well as any geometrical changes in the wear track. The single asperity contact model shows good agreement with the experimental work performed for silicon and silica against glass. With respect to high and low contact pressures, (< 100 MPa) the Mindlin theory can be used to predict pre-sliding behaviour. However, at very low loads the adhesion starts to significantly affect the results. The pre-sliding behaviour of multi asperity contact, so rough surfaces, can be described on the basis of results obtained from theoretical calculations and experiments. The calculation of the <b>tangential</b> <b>displacement</b> for rough surfaces is presented in this thesis. The main assumption in the model presented is that rough surfaces can be modelled as a set of Hertzian contacts, where each asperity has its own radius and summit height. One asperity with a maximum value of <b>tangential</b> <b>displacement</b> will determine when a multi asperity contact starts sliding. The asperities will have no mutual influence apart from sharing the total tangential and normal load. Calculations for different applied loads, surface roughness and autocorrelation lengths show that roughness plays an important role in the preliminary displacement. In the design of surfaces for positioning accuracy, parameters such as surface roughness, applied normal load and tangential load should be taken into account. Textured surfaces give better results to minimize drift as compared to random rough surfaces. A surface composed of asperities with large radii gives less variation in the <b>tangential</b> <b>displacement</b> and, as a result, less drift...|$|E

Quasi-static tests at several preloads and <b>tangential</b> <b>displacements</b> conditions were conducted to validate Valanis model parameters previously obtained from numerical simulations. The present findings provided detailed information about the evolution of the aforementioned Valanis parameters with bolt preload.
