5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{discovery}} of post-translational circular permutations and <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible genetic mechanism for evolving circular permutants, {{it was not}} until 1995 that the first circularly permuted pair of genes were discovered. Saposins are a class of proteins involved in sphingolipid catabolism and antigen presentation of lipids in humans. Chris Ponting and Robert Russell identified a circularly permuted version of a saposin inserted into plant aspartic proteinase, which they nicknamed swaposin. Saposin and swaposin were the first known case of two natural genes related by a circular permutation.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, in {{an effort}} to improve her in-ring skills, Stock {{relocated}} to Monterrey, Mexico to face the female wrestlers there. At <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> promoter, Stock began working while wearing a mask. She also took on the ring name Dark Angel, on the advice of Eddie Watts. She initially found it difficult to work with the wrestlers in Mexico, as she did not speak Spanish and could not communicate with them throughout the match. On October 17, she defeated Simply Luscious to win the Lucha Libre Femenil Juvenil Championship.|$|E

5|$|Born in Jakarta, Aristo became {{interested}} in films from a young age, {{though he did not}} consider a career in the industry until after graduating from university. At <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend, he wrote his first screenplay, Tak Pernah Kembali Sama. With feedback on the script from director Rudy Soedjarwo and after a period reading old, successful scripts, Aristo– at the time a film reviewer for a magazine– was able to befriend Hanung Bramantyo, who asked him to write a script about brownies. The resulting film, a critical success, led to Aristo receiving numerous requests for screenplays, including several adaptations of novels. In 2010, he released his directorial debut, Jakarta Maghrib.|$|E
5|$|A fan of {{professional}} wrestling {{from an early}} age, James attended a professional wrestling school in the Washington, D.C. area at <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend. She made her professional debut on the independent circuit in 1999, as a valet for KYDA Pro Wrestling under the ring name Alexis Laree, a name created {{as the result of}} a combination of her stage name from when she was a dancer and her middle name. Laree went on to manage several male wrestlers, including managing Tommy Dreamer to win the KYDA Pro Heavyweight Championship. In March, she wrestled in her first match, an intergender tag team match with Jake Damian against American Mike Brown and Candie. She trained to improve her wrestling abilities by attending training camps such as the Funking Conservatory, a workshop run by Dory Funk Jr., and an Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) dojo. She also started competing for Maryland Championship Wrestling (MCW), where she trained at camps run by Ricky Morton and Bobby Eaton. Beginning in 2002, she also made appearances for Ring of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Rymkus {{was born}} in Royalton, Illinois, {{the son of a}} Lithuanian {{immigrant}} coal miner who owned a small grocery store. After his father was shot and killed outside the grocery store, Rymkus and his family moved to the Back of the Yards neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. With family finances tight, he took a number of odd jobs, including working as a laborer and delivering newspapers and groceries. At <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend, Rymkus attended Tilden Tech, now known as Tilden High School, and began to display talent as a lineman on the school's football team. He blocked a kick and scored a touchdown in a game at Chicago's Soldier Field in 1936 against rival Austin High, a play he later said was the most memorable of his high school career. Rymkus won seven letters at Tilden playing on the football, track and wrestling teams. As a senior, he defeated Rudy Mucha to win the Chicago prep-school wrestling title.|$|E

25|$|Two chance events helped spark Johnson's {{interest}} {{in politics and}} social questions, and convert him from a conventional business tycoon to a radical reformer. The first was reading, on <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> train conductor, Henry George's Social Problems, in which the political philosopher expounded his belief that poverty and misery were a result of society's newly created wealth becoming locked up in increasing land values, and advocating a Single Tax on land in place of wastefully taxing the productive activity of capital and labor.|$|E

25|$|Although he was {{a member}} of the European Parliament, Farage campaigned to leave the EU as a key figurehead for the British exit from the EU in 2016.

Jean-Claude Juncker promptly told all UKIP members to leave the Parliament. Farage also made <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> future second referendum in an interview with the Daily Mirror if Brexit lost but the result was closer than 52-48.|$|E
25|$|Likewise Isenkrahe's {{violation}} of the energy conservation law is unacceptable, and Kelvin's application of Clausius' theorem leads (as noted by Kelvin himself) {{to some sort of}} perpetual motion mechanism. <b>The</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secondary re-radiation mechanism for wave models attracted the interest of JJ Thomson, but was not taken very seriously by either Maxwell or Poincaré, because it entails a gross {{violation of}} the second law of thermodynamics (huge amounts of energy spontaneously being converted from a colder to a hotter form), {{which is one of the}} most solidly established of all physical laws.|$|E
25|$|At <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend—Eric Tomkins—Mannock {{decided to}} join the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). Mannock was {{initially}} reticent, concerned his age and physical condition would hinder him. His early departure from two other services may also have encouraged questions about his reliability. Mannock acquired all the newspapers he could {{for information on the}} air war. In so doing, he came across an article on the man who was to {{have a profound effect on}} him: Albert Ball. Ball was the first fighter pilot to be given any publicity and his exploits inspired Mannock to join. In June Mannock was promoted to second lieutenant and on 14 August 1916 he arrived at the No. 1 School of Military Aeronautics in Reading.|$|E
25|$|In 1668 he {{published}} his Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language.

There had been for some years a Thames Ironworks Juniors side (formed in 1892) that had amassed 75 victories from 81 matches, providing a solid grounding of young talent, along with several former Castle Swift players such as David Furnell, Johnny Stewart, George Sage, John Woods, George Gresham and Walter Parks (some of whom were employees of the ironworks) to create a starting eleven.|$|E
25|$|Detail {{in other}} colours, like white or red, were applied at this point. The relief line was {{probably}} drawn with a bristle brush or a hair, dipped in thick paint. <b>The</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hollow needle seems somewhat unlikely. The application of relief outlines was necessary, as the rather liquid glossy clay {{would otherwise have}} turned out too dull. After the technique's initial phase of development, both alternatives were used, so as to differentiate gradations and details more clearly. The space between figures {{was filled with a}} glossy grey clay slip. Then, the vases underwent triple-phase firing, during which the glossy clay reached its characteristic black or black-brown colour through reduction, the reddish color by a final re-oxidation. Since this final oxidizing phase was fired using lower temperatures, the glazed parts of the vase did not re-oxidize from black to red: their finer surface was melted (sintered) in the reducing phase, and now protected from oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Schumann {{resonance}} amplitude {{records show}} significant diurnal and seasonal variations which in general coincide {{in time with}} the times of the day-night transition (the terminator). This time-matching seems to support <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> significant influence of the day-night ionosphere asymmetry on Schumann resonance amplitudes. There are records showing almost clock-like accuracy of the diurnal amplitude changes. On the other hand, there are numerous days when Schumann Resonance amplitudes do not increase at sunrise or do not decrease at sunset. There are studies showing that the general behavior of Schumann resonance amplitude records can be recreated from diurnal and seasonal thunderstorm migration, without invoking ionospheric variations. Two recent independent theoretical {{studies have shown that the}} variations in Schumann resonance power related to the day-night transition are much smaller than those associated with the peaks of the global lightning activity, and therefore the global lightning activity plays a more important role in the variation of the Schumann resonance power.|$|E
