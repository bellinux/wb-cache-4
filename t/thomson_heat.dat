40|$|We have {{observed}} how thermoelectric effects {{that result in}} asymmetric melting of silicon wires are suppressed for increasing electric current density (J). The experimental results are investigated using numerical modeling of the self-heating process, which elucidates the relative contributions of the asymmetric thermoelectric <b>Thomson</b> <b>heat</b> (∼J) and symmetric Joule heating (∼J 2) that lead to symmetric heating for higher current levels. These results are applied in modeling of the self-heating process in phase-change memory devices. While, phase-change memory devices show a clearly preferred operation polarity due to thermoelectric effects, nearly symmetric operation can be achieved with higher amplitude and shorter current pulses, {{which can lead to}} design of improved polarity-invariant memory circuitry. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{measurements}} of small (metallic) Ettingshausen coefficient (P) was developed. The {{influence of the}} dominating thermal effects, the Joule and <b>Thomson</b> <b>heats,</b> was eliminated making use of the odd symmetry of the Ettingshausen temperature gradient in respect with reversing of {{the direction of the}} magnetic field and electrical current. The method was applied to La_ 2 -xSr_xCuO_ 4 (x= 0. 03 0. 35) high-T_c superconductor in normal state. We have found that in the whole composition range the Ettingshausen coefficient is of the order of 10 ^- 7 m^ 3 K/J which is characteristic of typical metals. The coefficient changes sign from positive to negative near x≈ 0. 07. Weak variation of P is in contrast to the behavior of other transport coefficients for La_ 2 -xSr_xCuO_ 4, as the thermoeletric power or the Hall coefficient, which have been reported in literature to change their values by more than two orders of magnitude with Sr doping.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{effects are}} envisioned to reduce {{programming}} currents in nanopillar phase change memory cells. However, {{due to the}} inherent symmetry in such a structure, the contribution due to thermoelectric effects on programming currents is minimal. In this work, we propose a hybrid phase change memory structure which incorporates a two-fold asymmetry specifically aimed to favorably enhance thermoelectric effects. The first asymmetry is introduced via an interface layer of low thermal conductivity and high negative Seebeck coefficient, such as, polycrystalline SiGe, between the bottom electrode contact and the active region comprising the phase change material. This results in an enhanced Peltier heating of the active material. The second one is introduced structurally via a taper that results in an angle dependent <b>Thomson</b> <b>heating</b> within the active region. Various device geometries are analyzed using 2 D-axis-symmetric simulations to predict the effect on programming currents {{as well as for}} different thicknesses of the interface layer. A programming current reduction of up to 60 % is predicted for specific cell geometries. Remarkably, we find that due to an interplay of Thomson cooling in the electrode and the asymmetric heating profile inside the active region, the predicted programming current reduction is resilient to fabrication variability.

50|$|However, in 1862, John Tyndall, {{in one of}} {{his many}} {{excursions}} into popular science and many public disputes with Thomson and his circle, gave a lecture at the Royal Institution entitled On Force in which he credited von Mayer with conceiving and measuring the mechanical equivalent of <b>heat.</b> <b>Thomson</b> and Tait were angered, and an undignified public exchange of correspondence took place {{in the pages of the}} Philosophical Magazine, and the rather more popular Good Words. Tait even resorted to championing Colding's cause in an attempt to undermine von Mayer.|$|R
40|$|The {{thermoelectric}} {{mechanism of}} the asymmetrical velocity of normal zone propagation in superconductors, relative to {{the direction of the}} transport current is suggested. The difference of the normal-superconducting interface velocities parallel and anti-parallel to the current direction due to this mechanism is of the order of 1 - 50 cm s 1 for different metals. The thermoelectric effect (<b>Thomson</b> <b>heat)</b> has a hysteresis which occurs opon destruction (or restoration) of superconductivity in the sample with respect to the transport current. Asymmetry of the normal zone propagation velocity in superconductors A. VI. Gurevich and R. G.

40|$|Thermoelectric effects play an {{important}} role in phase change memory (PCM), where phase transition and atomic migration are accelerated by temperature. A deep understanding of thermoelectric effects may allow a physics-based design of the cell structure and materials to optimize programming speed/energy and reliability. In this work we study the polarity-dependence of PCM characteristics, including crystallization, melting, electrical switching/holding, and ion migration. These characteristics show slower kinetics at negative voltage, which we attribute to thermoelectric effects of electrically-induced heating. We demonstrate a universal correlation of positive/negative kinetics, which we reproduce by modelling <b>Thomson</b> and Peltier <b>heating</b> in the PCM device...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the effect}} of {{longitudinal}} vortex generators (LVGs) {{on the performance of}} a large-scale thermoelectric power generator (TEG) with a plate-fin heat exchanger is investigated. The fluid-thermal-electric multi-physics coupled model for the TEG is established on the COMSOL® platform, in which the Seebeck, Peltier, <b>Thomson,</b> and Joule <b>heating</b> effects are taken into account. The equivalent thermal-electrical properties of the TE module are used in the numerical simulation.

40|$|Extensive in situ thermal {{measurements}} using Peltier Interface Demarcation (PID) during {{directional solidification}} of eutectic Bi/MnBi were carried out. Observations indicate that significant thermal transients occur throughout the sample {{as a result}} of the Peltier pulsing. The contributions of the Peltier, <b>Thomson,</b> and Joule <b>heats</b> were separated and studied as a function of pulse intensity and polarity. The Joule and the combined Peltier and Thomson thermal contributions were determined as a function of time during and after the current pulses, close to the solid/liquid interface.

The laser induced plasma in air {{produced}} by 6 ns, 532 nm Nd:YAG pulses with 25 mJ energy was studied using the Thomson scattering method and plasma imaging techniques. Thomson scattering spectra were registered at delay times ranging from 150 ns to 1 μs after the breakdown pulses. The electron density and temperature, as determined {{in the core}} of the plasma plume, were found to decrease from 7. 4 × 1017 cm− 3 to 1. 0 × 1017 cm− 3 and from 101 000 K to 22 700 K, respectively.

40|$|Features of the DEGRA 2 {{computer}} code for simulating {{the operations of}} a spacecraft thermoelectric generator are described. The code models the physical processes occurring during operation. Input variables include the thermoelectric couple geometry and composition, the thermoelectric materials' properties, interfaces and insulation in the thermopile, the heat source characteristics, mission trajectory, and generator electrical requirements.

40|$|With {{developing}} {{interest in}} power generation applications of thermoelectrics and the growing influence of advanced materials on thermoelectric device fabrication, there is an increased demand for better understanding of module-level behavior. Likewise, novel module geometries are being explored for higher performance and require sophisticated modeling methods. In addition to new geometrical design, transport phenomena, such as <b>Thomson</b> <b>heating</b> and contact resistances, aggravate the complexity of modeling thermoelectric modules (TEMs) and thus limit design capability. Typically, these effects are either approximated (or in some cases neglected entirely) with little exploration in to {{the validity of the}} underlying assumptions associated with the approximation. As such, standard models are often predicated on assumptions that cannot be made beyond very limited operating regimes. Consequently, most TEM analysis generally utilizes simplistic methods of modeling on a module-level scale, which introduce inaccuracies that must be redressed. Particularly with larger temperature gradients, typically negligible effects could begin to impact overall system performance. Material property temperature-dependency, combined with leakage effects, leave much to be desired of the simple property-average-based models. Additionally, one-dimensional (1 -D) models neglect the contribution of three-dimensional (3 -D) module facets that can significantly impact TEM performance. To compound the analytical issue, complex material technologies are emerging that will require robust models for module design. With burgeoning focus in using thermoelectrics for waste heat recovery in automobiles, industrial processes and power plants, new application and commercial development of high temperature TEMs is imminent. However, modeling design and optimization of TEMs has been piecemeal at best. Hence, it is imperative that a comprehensive model be developed for TEMs that addresses some of the analytical problems stemming from over-simplification. The primary intention of this work is to develop and validate a comprehensive model that {{can be used as a}} TEM design tool and to quantify the error in the simple 1 -D analytical models. The scope of this work is multifaceted. First, several models are developed, implemented and compared to each other as design tools that are useful for determining material performance and also for optimizing TEM performance. An improved 1 -D analytical model, a unique asymptotic model and a comprehensive 3 -D finite element (FE) model are created and established. These models are compared to each other for both validation and for quantification of error in the analytical models. Secondly, the quantification of error in 1 -D analytical models based on module parameters, called error mapping, can be used as a design tool in and of itself to either identify regimes where a 1 -D model is inaccurate (and thus establish when 3 -D FE modeling is required), or as a corrective factor to a 1 -D model. Thirdly, an experimental test stand is developed for device characterization, to be used either for system-level integration or for future model validation. Finally, the Thomson effect is analytically explored and detailed, and its contribution to the overall performance of a TEM is quantified. The role of the Thomson effect in previous analyitical models is nebulous, but has been elucidated in this thesis both with derivation and the development of the asymptotic model, which is the first analytical solution to the non-linear thermoelectric governing equations. Ultimately, this thesis defines the advantages and limitations of current TEM models, quantifies their error and provides several new design tools that can be used for material selection, module optimization and system-level design. These new design tools will provide new leverage to advance thermoelectrics as a robust power generation technology at a time when such capability is critical...|$|R
40|$|In {{support of}} the {{development}} of a zero gravity pressure control capability for liquid hydrogen, testing was conducted at the Marshall Space Flight Center using the Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (MHTB) to evaluate the effects of helium pressurant on the performance of a spray bar thermodynamic vent system (TVS). Fourteen days of testing was performed in August - September 2005, with an ambient heat leak of about 70 - 80 watts and tank fill levels of 90 %, 50 %, and 25 %. The TVS successfully controlled the tank pressure within a +/- 3. 45 kPa (+/- 0. 5 psi) band with various helium concentration levels in the ullage. Relative to pressure control with an "all hydrogen" ullage, the helium presence resulted in 10 to 30 per cent longer pressure reduction durations, depending on the fill level, during the mixing/venting phase of the control cycle. Additionally, the automated control cycle was based on mixing alone for pressure reduction until the pressure versus time slope became positive, at which time the Joule-Thomson vent was opened. Testing was also conducted to evaluate thermodynamic venting without the mixer operating, first with liquid then with vapor at the recirculation line inlet. Although ullage stratification was present, the ullage pressure was successfully controlled without the mixer operating. Thus, if vapor surrounded the pump inlet in a reduced gravity situation, the ullage pressure can still be controlled by venting through the TVS Joule <b>Thomson</b> valve and <b>heat</b> exchanger. It was evident that the spray bar configuration, which extends almost {{the entire length of the}} tank, enabled significant thermal energy removal from the ullage even without the mixer operating. Details regarding the test setup and procedures are presented in the paper. ...|$|R
