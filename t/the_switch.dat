40|$|SiC Schottky Barrier diodes (SiC SBD) {{are known}} to oscillate/ring in the output {{terminal}} when used as free-wheeling diodes in voltage-source converters. This ringing is due to RLC resonance among the diode capacitance, parasitic resistance, and circuit stray inductance. In this paper, a model has been developed for calculating <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> energy of SiC diodes {{as a function of}} <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> rate (dIDS/dt of the commutating SiC MOSFET) and temperature. It is shown that the damping of the oscillations increases with decreasing temperature and decreasing dIDS/dt. This in turn determines <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> energy of <b>the</b> diode, which initially decreases with decreasing dIDS/dt and subsequently increases with decreasing dIDS/dt thereby indicating an optimal dIDS/dt for minimum <b>switching</b> energy. <b>The</b> total <b>switching</b> energy of <b>the</b> diode can be subdivided into three phases namely <b>the</b> current <b>switching</b> phase, <b>the</b> voltage <b>switching</b> phase, and <b>the</b> ringing phase. Although <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> energy in <b>the</b> current <b>switching</b> phase decreases with increasing <b>switching</b> rate, <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> energy of <b>the</b> voltage and ringing phase increases with <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> rate. <b>The</b> model developed characterizes the dependence of diode's switching energy on temperature and dIDS/dt, hence, can be used to predict the behavior of the SiC SBD...|$|R

On release, the 3DS version suffered from multiple technical problems, including issues with logging in, frequent maintenance periods, disconnection issues, poor sound quality, and the game's native text font being too small for the 3DS screen. The negative feedback caused Square Enix to temporarily stop shipments so they could fix the issues.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the optimal {{tracking}} problem for <b>switched</b> systems, where <b>the</b> control input, <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> times and <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> index are all design variables.

The optimal control and the corresponding cost function obtained depend on <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> signal.

The gradient formula of the cost function is derived. Then the discrete filled function is used in the third stage to search for <b>the</b> optimal <b>switching</b> index. On this basis, a computational method, which combines a gradient-based method, a local search algorithm and a filled function method, is developed for solving this problem.
