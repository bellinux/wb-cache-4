50|$|The ring domain is an {{important}} element of ubiquitin E3 ligases, which catalyse protein ubiquitination. Ubiquitin is a small regulatory protein found in all tissues that directs proteins to compartments within the cell. BRCA1 polypeptides, in particular Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains are dispersed <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> cell nucleus, but at the start of DNA replication they gather in restrained groups that also contain BRCA2 and BARD1. BARD1 is thought {{to be involved in the}} recognition and binding of protein targets for ubiquitination. It attaches to proteins and labels them for destruction. Ubiquitination occurs via the BRCA1 fusion protein and is abolished by zinc chelation. The enzyme activity of the fusion protein is dependent on the proper folding of the ring domain.|$|R
