Establish <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> zone speed-limit model by considering the relevant factors of driver's field of vision and transportation distance of visual cognition and then speed-limit programs are proposed according to <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> area speed-limit model.

30|$|The {{presence}} of <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> sign influenced vehicle speed (−[*] 1.5  km/h), {{and so did}} the measure point (−[*] 0.9  km/h) and the wildlife fence (−[*] 29.7  km/h) (Table 2). Also, there was an interaction effect between <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> sign and <b>the</b> wildlife fence (2.5  km/h). The slight speed reduction due to <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> sign is discernible in Fig. 4, where the red line is slightly below the blue line after the sign, but the effect is not very clear. <b>The</b> <b>warning</b> sign and its location, along with large interindividual variations, dominates the resulting MARS model.
