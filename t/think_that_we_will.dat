We have to deal with {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E

2500|$|While {{emphasizing}} unity {{within the}} Muslim community, Warith Deen Mohammed called upon the American Muslim community {{to establish a}} new school of fiqh, a code of conduct for the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. He told ISLAMICA magazine in 2008 that he felt that the madhhab—the schools of thought within fiqh—were geographically influenced and should be regionally developed, suggesting that [...] "I think we are gradually getting a sense of madhabs in America, especially those like me. We are getting a sense of madhabs. And with the coming generation I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be getting a much stronger sense of it. It is coming more and more." ...|$|E

60|$|I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> <b>will</b> {{take the}} story simply {{as it stands}} we shall see easily enough. For it is all simple and natural enough.

6000|$|... "Now this is {{all about}} the Bears, and also it is all about the order of flesh eaters, or Carnivora. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> next <b>we</b> <b>will</b> see what <b>we</b> can find out about a certain little friend of yours, who, though he eats flesh, is {{not a member of the}} flesh-eating order at all, but belongs to an order of which he is the only member in this country.

But that {{for which they}} look is not there, and we take the back trail to Circle City.|$|R
6000|$|... "Somewhat," [...] I answered. [...] "Yet my foster-son and I {{have seen}} strange things and lived.

6000|$|... "Well, well, Dame, then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> content {{ourselves}} with {{a run in}} the hoy down to Margate.

6000|$|... "For my own part," [...] the Duke continued, [...] "I {{have advised}} {{the police to}} turn their {{attention}} to the south of France. I have already said that I {{do not believe that the}} Duchess would encourage so monstrous an action, but the lad had the most wrong-headed opinions, and it is possible that he may have fled to her, aided and abetted by this German. I <b>think,</b> Dr. Huxtable, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> now return to the Hall." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "A mere form," [...] {{repeated}} Ramiro, [...] "of course.

Does he {{know whether the}} sheriff has fairly {{made up his mind}} to have a reading desk or a deacon’s pew under the pulpit?” “I have not heard my cousin speak on that subject, lately,” replied Marmaduke. “I <b>think</b> it’s likely <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> have a pretty dull court on't, from what I can gather.

2500|$|Peter Jackson, {{producer}} of the remake that later began, said in 2006 that [...] "It is not our intention to offend people. But really {{you are in a}} no-win, damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't scenario: [...] If you change it, everyone's going to whinge and whine about political correctness. And if you don't change it, obviously you are offending a lot of people inadvertently. [...] We haven't made any decisions about what we'll do." [...] Stephen Fry, writer for the remake, was asked to provide several alternative names for the dog, and came up with several suggestions. [...] Executive producer David Frost rejected them all, saying [...] "Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, so I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> what <b>we</b> <b>will</b> call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this is the one I want." [...] Jackson's assistant contradicted this a week later, however, saying [...] "To stay true to the story, you can't just change [...] We have not made any decisions yet. The script is still being written; and that decision will be made closer to the time." ...|$|R
5000|$|The British Channel 4 {{screened}} the censored American {{version in}} July 2007, {{in which the}} dialogue was dubbed so as to call the dog [...] "Trigger", this screening took place just after the planned remake was announced. For the remake, Peter Jackson has said no {{decision has been made}} on the dog's name, but is in a [...] "no-win, damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't scenario", as changing the name could be seen as too much political correctness, while not changing the name could offend people. Further, executive producer Sir David Frost was quoted in The Independent as stating: [...] "Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, so I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> what <b>we</b> <b>will</b> call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this is the one I want." [...] In September 2007, as part of the BBC Summer of British Film series, The Dam Busters was shown at selected cinemas across the UK in its uncut format. The original, uncensored, version was also shown on 1 and 5 January 2013, by the British broadcaster Channel 5. It was the version, distributed by Studio Canal, containing shots of the bomber flying into a hill.|$|R
60|$|After these stories, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> {{all agree}} that when we meet a {{procession}} of bears, be they black, white, or grizzly, we will be very wise {{to give them the}} right of way, and to endeavor to drive from our minds, as far as possible, such ideas of the animals as we may have derived from those individuals which we have seen in rural menageries, nimbly climbing poles, or sedately drinking soda-water.|$|E

"It iss {{a curious}} fact, Taniel," [...] {{said the old}} man, with a pleased look, [...] "that it wass in this fery room in the old hoose that wass burnt, and {{about the same time}} of the year, too, that you would be speakin' to me about this fery thing.

'Indeed,' said Summertrees, 'you will, do no such thing; for, in {{the first}} place, do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> deliver up the poor fellow {{into the hands of}} the Philistines, when, on the contrary, my only reason for {{furnishing}} you with the clue I am to put into your hands, is to settle the matter amicably on all sides?

40|$|Our goal in {{this work}} is to give an {{algorithmic}} method to find solutions of a LSS. To accomplish this objective, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> give a geometric description {{of the problem and}} use some geometric tools to transform the equation and the manifold (the "ambient space") into a new set of equations, each one being an explicit ODE. When this is accomplished, one may apply Picard's theorem to these new systems to obtain the solutions. It is important to notice that (as many other theoretical results) Picard's theorem proves the existence of a solution but does not give an explicit method to nd it. Usually, in problems which require to find explicit solutions, numerical methods are used. There also exist numerical methods for solving LSS, so one may <b>think</b> <b>that</b> (since <b>we</b> <b>will</b> use numerical methods anyway to find the explicit solution) we could use them directly instead of wasting time implementing a method that will still depend on numerical approximations. The main point of using alternative methods for this kind of problem is (beyond the theoretical value of the algorithm) that, while numerical methods for explicit ODEs are usually accurate (in the sense that it is easy to control the error of the calculations), numerical approximations for an arbitrary LSS require (as it is explained in [RR 02]) numerical inversions of quasi-singular matrices; these operations are numerically unstable. Therefore, the desingularization procedure studied here may allow to transform a numerically unstable problem into a new stable one...|$|R

To remove our [...] "direful apprehensions {{that he will}} drain us of our {{gold and}} silver by his coinage:" [...] This little {{arbitrary}} mock-monarch most graciously offers to [...] "take our manufactures in exchange."
