5|$|The Canoe River train crash {{occurred}} on November 21, 1950, near Valemount in eastern British Columbia, Canada, when a westbound <b>troop</b> <b>train</b> and the eastbound Canadian National Railway (CNR) Continental Limited collided head-on. The collision killed 21people: 17Canadian soldiers {{en route to}} the Korean War and the two-man locomotive crew of each train.|$|E
5|$|Within {{days of the}} crash, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), as {{the provincial}} police for British Columbia, began an investigation. The site of the crash was under the {{jurisdiction}} of the RCMP detachment in Prince George, British Columbia, and any charges would be laid there. The CNR suspended all trainmen involved in passing the order to the <b>troop</b> <b>train</b> and held an internal inquiry at Kamloops. The Board of Transport Commissioners announced that a public inquiry would be held at Edmonton in December 1950.|$|E
5|$|Atherton {{was arrested}} for {{manslaughter}} on January 9, 1951, in Saskatoon and was taken to Prince George by the RCMP. After his dismissal by the CNR, Atherton was staying with his parents at Zealandia, where his father was CNR station agent. The manslaughter charge concerned the death of Henry Proskunik, fireman aboard the <b>troop</b> <b>train.</b> Bail was set at $5,000, and Magistrate P.J. Moran required any sureties to appear before him, {{making it difficult for}} Atherton's connections in Saskatchewan to obtain his release. Atherton was released from custody on January 24, as Prince George furniture store owner Alex Moffat and local CNR employee William Reynolds each posted sureties valued at $2,500.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1962, United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara visited South Vietnam and {{was taken}} on an {{inspection}} tour of the country, accompanied by Diệm and Thảo. Perhaps because Thảo divulged the tour details to Vietcong guerrillas, each of McNamara's stopovers was punctuated by bloody attacks on nearby ARVN installations. For example, when McNamara was in Bình Dương Province, five government soldiers were killed. As he flew from Đà Lạt north to Đà Nẵng near the Demilitarized Zone, he was greeted by a Vietcong bombing of a southbound <b>troop</b> <b>train,</b> which killed 27 and wounded 30 Civil Guard members.|$|E
5|$|On November 21, 1950, a {{westbound}} <b>troop</b> <b>train,</b> Passenger Extra 3538 West—consisting of the S-2-a class 2-8-2 {{steam locomotive}} 3538 and 17cars, {{about half of}} which had wood bodies with steel underframes—was travelling from Camp Shilo, Manitoba to Fort Lewis, Washington. It was carrying 23officers and 315men of 2nd Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (RCHA) for deployment to the Korean War, a movement dubbed Operation Sawhorse. The train was moving through the Rocky Mountains on the CNR transcontinental mainline. CNR Train No.2, the eastbound Continental Limited, consisted of the U-1-a class 4-8-2 steam locomotive 6004 and eleven all-steel cars and was en route from Vancouver to Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin arrived off Songjin, Korea on 15 March and {{concentrated}} her gunfire on enemy railway transport. Early that morning, she destroyed a communist <b>troop</b> <b>train</b> trapped outside a destroyed tunnel. That afternoon, she received the first direct hit in her history, {{when one of}} four shells from a North Korean 152mm gun battery struck the shield of a starboard 40mm mount; Although little material damage resulted, three men were injured. Wisconsin subsequently destroyed that battery with a full 16-inch (406mm) salvo before continuing her mission. After lending a hand to support once more the 1st Marine Division with her heavy rifles, the battleship returned to Japan on 19 March.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{theories}} are possible, either that a) a hospital train was formed using these eleven carriages, or {{that when the}} A/BPL fleet was divided into <b>Troop</b> <b>Trains</b> during World War II, each [...] "nine or ten-car" [...] train was allocated one hospital carriage for injured <b>troops.</b> The <b>Troop</b> <b>Trains</b> allowed the Army Movement Control to plan troop movements without the railway department worrying about having to shuffle or acquire normal passenger stock. Originally, the <b>troop</b> <b>trains</b> ran primarily to Albury, Tocumwal, Serviceton and Bairnsdale. Later, {{it is known that}} they ran to Terowie and Port Pirie on the South Australian Railways network.|$|R

5|$|Believing {{that the}} 4th Division {{was still at}} Camp Greene, Middleton wired there {{to find out that}} the unit was already on its way overseas. He caught a train for New York, and when he arrived on 28 April 1918, he found his {{division}} at Camp Mills on Long Island, living in tents and awaiting transport. Middleton was given command of the First Battalion, 47th Infantry Regiment, and departed New York with his regiment aboard the Princess Matokia on 11 May in a convoy of fourteen ships. Three days out of France, a fleet of destroyers met the convoy and escorted it to the port city of Brest where they arrived on 23 May. There the division unloaded and organized for several days, subsequently loading onto a <b>troop</b> <b>train</b> to arrive at Calais on 30 May.|$|E

25|$|These failures, {{combined}} with Signalman Meakin forgetting {{the presence of}} the local train which was standing in clear view of his signalbox, allowed the acceptance of the southbound <b>troop</b> <b>train</b> and the clearing of the signals for it to run through to Gretna, thereby causing the collision (at 6.49).|$|E

25|$|In Fingal (or north County Dublin), {{about 60}} Volunteers mobilised near Swords. They {{belonged to the}} 5th Battalion of the Dublin Brigade (also known as the Fingal Battalion), and were led by Thomas Ashe and his second in command, Richard Mulcahy. Unlike the rebels elsewhere, the Fingal Battalion {{successfully}} employed guerrilla tactics. They set up camp and Ashe split the battalion into four sections: three would undertake operations while the fourth was kept in reserve, guarding camp and foraging for food. The Volunteers moved against the RIC barracks in Swords, Donabate and Garristown, forcing the RIC to surrender and seizing all the weapons. They also damaged railway lines and cut telegraph wires. The railway line at Blanchardstown was bombed to prevent a <b>troop</b> <b>train</b> reaching Dublin. This derailed a cattle train, which had been sent ahead of the <b>troop</b> <b>train.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>troop</b> <b>train</b> had {{consisted}} of 21 vehicles; all were {{consumed in the}} fire, apart from the rear six, which had broken away during the impact and rolled back along the line a short distance. The fire also affected four coaches from the express train and some goods wagons. Such was {{the intensity of the}} fire that all the coal in the locomotive tenders was consumed.|$|E

25|$|The {{division}} left Le Havre on 16 June 1945 {{aboard the}} SS Brazil, arriving at Camp Shanks on 24 June. After a 30-day leave, the division reassembled at Fort Bragg, crossed the US by <b>troop</b> <b>train</b> and on 1 September embarked aboard the USS Grundy for redeployment to the Pacific, arriving at Cebu, Philippine Islands, 16 September, and then sailing to Japan for occupation duty. Arriving at Yokohama on 25 September 1945, the division relieved the 43rd Infantry Division and established its headquarters at Mitsugahara Airfield in Kumagaya. By December the 97th had reached its maximum deployment through six prefectures: Saitama, Gunma, Nagano, Niigata, Fukushima, and Tochigi.|$|E
25|$|In April 1942, {{the two men}} stole {{weapons and}} grenades and also a motor-boat from the south west of England. They landed in France, where they {{attempted}} to cut a railway line using a hand grenade,, say that King and Cuthbertson attacked, or attempted to derail, a <b>troop</b> <b>train.</b> among other activities. After three days, King and Cuthbertson stole a French motor boat to return to England. This failed and they were adrift in the Channel for twelve days until picked up by an Air Sea Rescue Service launch. states {{that the two men}} were 15 days adrift and that they were picked up by a Royal Navy destroyer. They were initially treated as spies.|$|E
25|$|There {{were four}} steam {{locomotives}} hauling the three passengers trains {{directly involved in}} the collisions, the express train having been double headed. All were designs built for the Caledonian Railway. The two locomotives that collided head-on in the first impact (when the <b>troop</b> <b>train</b> hit the local train) were both written off and scrapped. The local train's locomotive had been No. 907 of the Cardean Class (4-6-0 wheel arrangement). The troop train's locomotive was No. 121 of the 139 Class (4-4-0). The two locomotives of the express train which hit the wreckage a minute later, were subsequently repaired and returned to traffic - No. 140 of the Dunalastair IV Class and No. 48 of the 43 Class (both 4-4-0).|$|E
