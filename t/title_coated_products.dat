40|$|Abstract. Due to {{oxidation}} and decarburization during {{heat treatment}} prior to hot stamping, various <b>coating</b> <b>products</b> {{have been developed}} in the last decades. Press-Hardened Steel (PHS) components for passenger cars are generally coated by aluminized or galvanized (GI) coatings. The aluminized coating presents a good formability at high temperature and permits forming and quenching components in the same press tools with a so called direct hot stamping method. Due to a strong cracking in the base material during direct hot stamping induced by liquid-metal embrittlement (LME), galvanized <b>coated</b> <b>products</b> must be pre-formed at low temperature and undergo heat treatment in separate press units. Moreover, the oxide scale formed on GI parts must be removed by abrasive blasting, whereas aluminized parts can be directly painted after hot forming. However, higher performance in corrosion resistance has been observed for galvanized parts, in particular in cosmetic and cut-edge corrosion. This increase {{is linked to the}} sacrificial effect or cathodic protection provided by the layer containing zinc. Daimler AG is investigating the possibility of improving performance of PHS body parts in terms of suitability for direct hot stamping and corrosion protection by developing new coating materials. In the following article, the main particularities and challenges involved in both current <b>coating</b> <b>products</b> will be introduced. The development of specific press tools for this study, as well as the corresponding simulation of hot forming will be presented. Finally, the hot forming behaviour and anticorrosive properties of both current products will be presented...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{compendial}} pH 6. 8 {{phosphate buffer}} to assess dissolution of enteric <b>coated</b> <b>products</b> {{gives rise to}} poor in vitro-in vivo correlations because of the inadequacy of the buffer to resemble small intestinal fluids. A more representative and physiological medium, pH 6. 8 bicarbonate buffer, was developed to evaluate the dissolution behaviour of enteric coatings. The bicarbonate system was evolved from pH 7. 4 Hanks balanced salt solution to produce a pH 6. 8 bicarbonate buffer (modified Hanks buffer, mHanks), which resembles the ionic composition and buffer capacity of intestinal milieu. Prednisolone tablets were coated {{with a range of}} enteric polymers: hypromellose phthalate (HP- 50 and HP- 55), cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS-LF and HPMCAS-MF), methacrylic acid copolymers (EUDRAGIT® L 100 - 55, EUDRAGIT® L 30 D- 55 and EUDRAGIT® L 100) and polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP). Dissolution of coated tablets was carried out using USP-II apparatus in 0. 1 M HCl for 2 h followed by pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer or pH 6. 8 mHanks bicarbonate buffer. In pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer, the various enteric polymer <b>coated</b> <b>products</b> displayed rapid and comparable dissolution profiles. In pH 6. 8 mHanks buffer, drug release was delayed and marked differences were observed between the various coated tablets, which is comparable to the delayed disintegration times reported in the literature for enteric <b>coated</b> <b>products</b> in the human small intestine. In summary, the use of pH 6. 8 physiological bicarbonate buffer (mHanks) provides more realistic and discriminative in vitro release assessment of enteric coated formulations compared to compendial phosphate buffer...|$|R
