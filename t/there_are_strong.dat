In many cultures, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>strong</b> social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E
5|$|Ecology surged {{in popular}} and {{scientific}} interest during the 1960â€“1970s environmental movement. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>strong</b> historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called euthenics) and brought about changes in environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has emerged}} as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>strong</b> indications the theory is incomplete. The problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime singularities remain open. Observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics. Even taken as is, general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration. Mathematical relativists seek {{to understand the nature of}} singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein's equations, while numerical relativists run increasingly powerful computer simulations (such as those describing merging black holes). In February 2016, it was announced that the existence of gravitational waves was directly detected by the Advanced LIGO team on September 14, 2015. A century after its introduction, general relativity remains a highly active area of research.|$|E

5|$|The {{centre of}} Aarhus {{was once a}} pagan burial site until Aarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built upon it {{during the reign of}} Frode, King of Jutland, around 900. In the 900s an earth rampart for the defence of the early city was constructed, {{encircling}} the settlement, much like the defence structures found at Viking ring fortresses elsewhere. The rampart was later reinforced by Harald Bluetooth, and together with the town's geographical placement, this suggests that Aros was an important trade and military centre. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>strong</b> indications of a former royal residence from the Viking Age in Viby, a few kilometres south of the Aarhus city centre.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that ancestors of the fisher migrated to North America during the Pliocene era between 2.5 and 5 million years ago. Two extinct mustelids, M. palaeosinensis and M. anderssoni, {{have been found in}} eastern Asia. The first true fisher, M. divuliana, has only been found in North America. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>strong</b> indications that M. divuliana is related to the Asian finds, which suggests a migration. M. pennanti has been found as early as the Late Pleistocene era, about 125,000 years ago. There are no major differences between the Pleistocene fisher and the modern fisher. Fossil evidence indicates that the fisher's range extended farther south than it does today.|$|E
5|$|Unlike unique {{sciences}} such as mathematics, the perspective, activity, or {{discipline of}} design is not {{brought to a}} generally accepted common denominator. The historical beginnings of design are complex {{and the nature of}} design is still the subject of ongoing discussion. In design, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>strong</b> differentiations between theory and practice. The fluid nature of the theory allows the designer to operate without being constrained by a rigid structure. In practice, decisions are often referred to as intuition. In his Classification of Design (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes. Design management operates in and across all three classes: product (e.g. industrial design, packaging design, service design), information (e.g. graphic design, branding, media design, web design), and environment (e.g. retail design, exhibition design, interior design).|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} review of radiation therapy trials in several turnout types {{was performed by}} The Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU). The procedures for evaluation of the scientific literature are described separately (Acta Oncol 2003; 42 : 357 - 365). This synthesis {{of the literature on}} radiation therapy for breast cancer is based on data from 29 randomized trials, 6 meta-analyses and 5 retrospective studies. In total, 40 scientific articles are included, involving 41204 patients. The results were compared with those of a similar overview from 1996 including 285982 patients. The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows: <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> evidence for a substantial reduction in locoregional recurrence rate following postmastectomy radiation therapy to the chest wall and the regional nodal areas. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> evidence that postmastectomy radiation therapy increases the disease-free survival rate. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> conflicting data regarding the impact of postmastectomy radiotherapy upon overall survival. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> evidence that breast cancer specific survival is improved by postmastectomy radiotherapy. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> evidence for a decrease in non-breast cancer specific survival after postmastectomy radiotherapy. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> some evidence that overall survival is increased by optimal postmastectomy radiation therapy. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> evidence that postmastectomy radiotherapy in addition to surgery and systemic therapy in mainly node-positive patients decreases local recurrence rate and improves survival. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> moderate evidence that the decrease in non-breast cancer specific survival is attributed to cardiovascular disease in irradiated patients. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> conflicting data whether breast conservation surgery plus radiotherapy is comparable to modified radical mastectomy alone in terms of local recurrence rate. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> evidence that breast conservation surgery plus radiotherapy is comparable to modified radical mastectomy alone in terms of disease-free survival and overall survival. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> evidence that postoperative radiotherapy to the breast following breast conservation surgery results in a statistically and clinically significant reduction of ipsilateral breast recurrences followed by diminished need for salvage mastectomies. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> evidence that the omission of postoperative radiotherapy to the breast following breast conservation surgery has no impact on overall survival. In one meta-analysis including three randomized studies a survival advantage is demonstrated by Bayesian statistics. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> evidence that the addition of a radiation boost after conventional radiotherapy to the turnout bed after breast conservation surgery significantly decreases the risk of ipsilateral breast recurrences but has no impact on overall survival after short follow-up. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> evidence for the use of postoperative radiotherapy to the breast following breast conservation surgery for DCIS (ductal breast cancer in situ). Radiotherapy leads to a clinically and statistically significant reduction of both non-invasive and invasive ipsilateral breast recurrences. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> insufficient evidence to define the optimal integration of systemic adjuvant therapy and postoperative radiotherapy. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> limited data on radiotherapy-related morbidity in breast cancer.
