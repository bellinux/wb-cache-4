40|$|Background: Fractures of the {{clavicle}} {{are common}} injuries and mostly treated non-operatively. Nearly always the fracture is clinically united within {{three to four}} weeks and functional recovery should be completed within two months. Traditionally thinking has been that operative treatment is indicated exceptionaly and that delayed surgery is less successful. In retrospective comparative study authors have asked – whether delay of surgery in middle-third clavicular fractures negatively affects functional results and – whether after delayed surgery complications are more frequent. Patients and methods: Thirty-seven of 733 fractures of the clavicle were treated operatively. Among these, 11 were fresh Allman <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> fractures (early <b>procedure),</b> 9 delayed- or non-unions and one malunion (late procedure). All fractures were fixed with plates and screws. In none of the reconstructive procedures composite bone grafting was performed, twice spongiotic bone graft and twice morsilized calus grafts were used. DASH and Constant scores were used for outcome evaluation. Results: Twenty-one of 22 patients were evaluated (one foreign turist missed) on average 21 month after surgery. Average DASH scores for early operated patients were 14. 4 and for late operated 18. 5; an average Quich DASH were 16. 4 and 20. 5 respectively. Average Constant scores were 85. 6 and 76. 0.  Statistically differences are not important. Three patients had early complications (two from early, one from late group).

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the GTPase activity of the Ras proteins {{is thought to be}} a key element of signal transduction. Ras proteins have intrinsic GTPase activity and are active in signal transduction when bound to GTP but not following hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Three cellular Ras GTPase-activating proteins (Ras-gaps) which increase the GTPase activity of wild-type (wt) Ras but not activated Ras in vitro have been identified: <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and <b>type</b> II GAP and <b>type</b> <b>I</b> NF 1. Mutations of wt Ras resulting in lowered intrinsic GTPase activity or loss of response to cellular Ras-gap proteins are thought to be the primary reason for the transforming properties of the Ras proteins. In vitro assays show <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and <b>type</b> II GAP and the GAP-related domain of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> NF 1 to have similar biochemical properties with respect to activation of the wt Ras GTPase, and it appears as though both <b>type</b> <b>I</b> GAP and NF 1 can modulate the GTPase function of Ras in cells. Here we report the assembling of a full-length coding clone for <b>type</b> <b>I</b> NF 1 and the biological effects of microinjection of Ras and Ras-gap proteins into fibroblasts. We have found that <b>type</b> <b>I</b> GAP, <b>type</b> II GAP, and <b>type</b> <b>I</b> NF 1 show markedly different biological activities in vivo. Coinjection of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> GAP or <b>type</b> <b>I</b> NF 1, but not type II GAP, with wt Ras abolished the ability of wt Ras to induce expression from an AP- 1 -controlled reporter gene.

MethodsWe studied how two structurally distinct forms of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen, monomer versus polymerized fibrils, affect cell proliferation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and expression of G 1 -phase regulatory proteins in cultured rat mesangial cells (MCs). To analyze the possible involvement of collagen-binding integrins in <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen-derived growth signals further, distribution patterns of integrin chains were examined by immunocytochemistry. ResultsPolymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen completely prevented the increase of DNA synthesis and cell replication induced by 5 % fetal calf serum (FCS) or 25 ng/mL platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in MCs on monomer <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen. Protein expression of cyclins D 1 and E was markedly down-regulated in MCs plated on polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen for eight hours in 5 % FCS, as compared with MCs on monomer <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen. Incubation with 5 % FCS reduced expression of the cdk-inhibitor protein p 27 Kip 1 on monomer but not on polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen. Moreover, polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen markedly reduced cyclin E-associated kinase activity in the presence of 5 % FCS. Polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen diminished the PDGF-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p 42 /p 44 MAPK, but did not affect phosphorylation of PDGF β-receptors. In MCs plated on monomer <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen, α 1, α 2, and β 1 integrin chains were recruited into focal contacts. However, on polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen, α 2 and β 1, but not α 1, integrin chains were condensed into focal contacts. ConclusionsThe growth-inhibitory effect of polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen is characterized by rapid changes of expression and/or activation of MAPK and G 1 -phase regulators and could result from the lack of α 1 β 1 integrin signaling in MCs on polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen.

To evaluate the phylogenic distribution and evolutionary history of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs, 13 genomes were searched using BLASTn program, and a phylogenetic tree of vertebrate <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs was constructed. In the present study, an IFNδ-like gene in the human genome was identified, refuting the concept that humans have no IFNδ genes, and other mammalian IFN genes were also identified. In the phylogenetic tree, the mammalian IFNβ, IFNɛ, and IFNκ formed a clade separate from the other mammalian <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs, while piscine and avian IFNs formed distinct clades. Based on this phylogenetic analysis and the various characteristics of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs, the evolutionary history of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs was further evaluated. Our data indicate that an ancestral IFNα-like gene forms a core from which new IFNs divided during vertebrate evolution. In addition, the data suggest how the other <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs evolved from IFNα and shaped the complex <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN system. The promoters of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs were conserved among different mammals, as well as their genic regions. However, the intergenic regions of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN clusters were not conserved among different mammals, demonstrating a high selection pressure upon <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs during their evolution.|$|R

The larger form represents collagen molecules (as shown by immunoblotting experiments), and (or) <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen with aminoterminal propeptide or intact procollagen molecules. The smaller form, {{the exact nature of}} which is not known, is quantitatively the principal antigenic form and is derived from degradation of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen. The concentration of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen in serum is increased mainly in cirrhotic patients, with or without active liver disease, but also somewhat in alcoholic patients without cirrhosis.

40|$|Many pathogens, {{including}} viruses, bacteria, and protozoan parasites, suppress cellular immune responses through {{activation of}} <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN signaling. Recent {{evidence suggests that}} immune suppression and susceptibility to the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, is mediated by <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN; however, {{it is unclear how}} <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN suppresses immunity to blood-stage Plasmodium parasites. During experimental severe malaria, CD 4 (+) Th cell responses are suppressed, and conventional DC (cDC) function is curtailed through unknown mechanisms. Here, we tested the hypothesis that <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN signaling directly impairs cDC function during Plasmodium infection in mice. Using cDC-specific IFNAR 1 -deficient mice, and mixed BM chimeras, we found that <b>type</b> <b>I</b> TEN signaling directly affects cDC function, limiting the ability of cDCs to prime IFN-gamma-producing Th 1 cells. Although <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN signaling modulated all subsets of splenic cDCs, CD 8 (-) cDCs were especially susceptible, exhibiting reduced phagocytic and Th 1 -promoting properties in response to <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs. Additionally, rapid and systemic IFN-alpha production in response to Plasmodium infection required <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN signaling in cDCs themselves, revealing their contribution to a feed-forward cytokine-signaling loop. Together, these data suggest abrogation of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN signaling in CD 8 - splenic cDCs as an approach for enhancing Th 1 responses against Plasmodium and other <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN-inducing pathogens...|$|R
