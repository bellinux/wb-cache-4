5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> the frequency distributions are nothing more than an effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison between them is unlikely to be enlightening.|$|E

5|$|Presociality is when animals exhibit {{more than}} just sexual {{interactions}} {{with members of the}} same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} {{of the area}} began in 1892 and continued over the next 15 years, uncovering {{the extent of the}} settlement and publishing <b>the</b> <b>results.</b> <b>From</b> 1892 until 1899 Bulleid worked with labourers for six months of each year and spent the other six months describing and cataloguing the finds. He then left the site to complete his medical studies and returned in 1904 with Harold St George Gray to continue the excavation until 1907. The curator of the Taunton museum of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, Gray had been trained in archaeological techniques by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers.|$|E
5|$|The points {{system in}} the 1905 Tour de France had been {{successful}} enough in reducing cheating, so the Tour organisers used it again in the 1906 Tour de France, with a few changes: whereas in 1905, time differences still had some effect on the points distribution, in 1906 time differences were unimportant, and points were only given for {{the order in which}} the cyclists finished. The winner of the stage received one point, the second rider two points, et cetera. After the eighth stage, only 16 cyclists were remaining, and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> the first eight stages were recalculated, with only the remaining cyclists, and the points were redistributed among the remaining riders in accordance with their positions in those stages.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of the season finales, fights on The Ultimate Fighter are sanctioned by the Nevada Athletic Commission as exhibition matches and do not count for or against a fighter's professional record. This is done to keep <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> going public before the air date. However, going into the semi-final stage of each series, fights are scheduled for the full professional three rounds, as opposed to two rounds (with the possibility of a sudden victory round) for all stages prior. Though officially exhibition fights, the UFC chooses to record the results of semi-final matchups. For example, the seventh season winner Amir Sadollah has one more win on his UFC record than on his official record due to his victory in his season's semi-final round.|$|E
