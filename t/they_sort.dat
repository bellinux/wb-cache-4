500|$|Following his {{involvement}} with this episode, Campbell was considered as a possible contender {{for the role of}} John Doggett, a character that would appear in the eighth season. Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role. Due to a contractual obligation, Campbell could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think <b>they</b> <b>sort</b> of remembered me from that. It was nice to be involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] The character was eventually portrayed by actor Robert Patrick.

500|$|Alex Timbers {{developed}} {{the concept and}} directed the play, while Kyle Jarrow wrote the accompanying book, music, and lyrics. [...] Timbers and Jarrow were classmates together at Yale University. [...] The script for the play is published by Samuel French, Inc. [...] Jarrow was motivated to write the script {{by what he saw}} as a shift in religious teachings – from an old model involving hell and retribution, to a new system of thought promising money or peace. [...] Jarrow commented on Timbers' idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: [...] "I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I learned is that <b>they</b> <b>sort</b> of turn you into a child by appealing to that part of you that wants {{to be taken care of}} and given answers. [...] And so it all began to make sense to me." [...] He said Scientology would be [...] "an especially interesting topic for a theater piece" [...] because of its criticism of psychiatry, relative newness compared to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and practice of requiring [...] "that the follower take courses which cost significant amounts of money." ...|$|E
500|$|The Chinese {{had long}} taken an {{interest}} in examining the human body. For example, in 16 AD the Xin Dynasty usurper Wang Mang called for the dissection of an executed man, to examine his arteries and viscera in order to discover cures for illnesses. Shen also took interest in human anatomy, dispelling the long-held Chinese theory that the throat contained three valves, writing, [...] "When liquid and solid are imbibed together, {{how can it be}} that in one's mouth <b>they</b> <b>sort</b> themselves into two throat channels?" [...] Shen maintained that the larynx {{was the beginning of a}} system that distributed vital qi from the air throughout the body, and that the esophagus was a simple tube that dropped food into the stomach. Following Shen's reasoning and correcting the findings of the dissection of executed bandits in 1045, an early 12th-century Chinese account of a bodily dissection finally supported Shen's belief in two throat valves, not three. [...] Also, the later Song Dynasty judge and early forensic expert Song Ci (1186–1249) would promote the use of autopsy in order to solve homicide cases, as written in his Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified.|$|E

500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, [...] "I really did prepare {{the thing and}} went in and I worked hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then <b>they</b> <b>sort</b> of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason {{we asked you to}} come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here. We’re serious about this and I’ve really thought this out. I promise you this will be a great character {{and it will be a}} big part of the show.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Hoping to {{continue}} the series, Carter introduced a new central character to replace Mulder: Doggett. More than 100 actors auditioned for the role, with only about ten considered by the producers. Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees, and Phillips, Bochner and Bruce Campbell were considered for the role. In particular, Campbell, following his involvement with the sixth season episode [...] "Terms of Endearment", was considered, but, due to a contractual obligation, could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think <b>they</b> <b>sort</b> of remembered me from that. It was nice {{to be involved in}} that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed him out of the role". In the end, the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. Reportedly, Patrick was cast {{due to the fact that}} his featured role in [...] (1991) would attract a great 18- to 35-year-old male demographic to the show. In fact, Fox executives reported a 10 percent overall increase in the demographic, solely due to Patrick's casting.|$|E
500|$|Night of the Blood Beast was one {{of several}} films {{produced}} by B movie filmmaker Roger Corman and his brother, Gene Corman. The two also partnered together in making Hot Car Girl (1958), Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) and The Premature Burial (1962). Jerome Bixby, the science fiction screenwriter who wrote It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), was originally approached for the job, but Bixby was working on another project and recommended his close friend Martin Varno for the job. Varno, the son of veteran actor Roland Varno, was 21 years old at the time. He met with Roger and Gene Corman, who discussed with him what Varno called [...] "some sort of a weird idea for the picture". They offered Varno a couple hundred dollars for the job, which was below the minimum compensation rates known as [...] "scale", but Varno {{was not part of the}} Writers Guild of America at the time and did not know about the guidelines. He accepted the offer and signed a contract. Although Varno had a rough idea it would be a low-budget film, he said the Cormans set no specific guidelines for him: [...] "I gave them the impression that I knew pretty much what I was doing, and <b>they</b> <b>sort</b> of got the idea that I wasn't going to use 50,000 extras and things." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reiss {{studied at}} Harvard University. Reiss has stated that, as an institution, he hates Harvard, {{explaining}} that [...] "I had an epiphany on my third day there: This place {{would be just}} as good as a summer camp where you met other people, networked, and learned from them. I feel the education I got there was distant and useless and uncaring. I feel <b>they</b> <b>sort</b> of squandered my youth and my father’s savings." [...] Reiss studied English, but disliked the course and was rejected from a creative writing class. Reiss focused his attention on comedy, performing in talent shows and writing. In Holworthy Hall at Harvard, Reiss met fellow freshman Al Jean; they befriended one another and collaborated their writing efforts for the humor publication Harvard Lampoon. Reiss became co-president of the Harvard Lampoon, alongside Jon Vitti. Jeff Martin, another writer for the Lampoon, said Reiss and Jean [...] "definitely loomed large around the magazine. They were very funny guys and unusually polished comedy writers for that age. We were never surprised that they went on to success." [...] Jean has also stated that the duo spent most of their time at the Lampoon, adding that [...] "it was practically my second dorm room." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{expected}} a less personal {{treatment for the}} film and were at times uncomfortable with {{the extent to which}} Guggenheim probed into their history. Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, [...] "I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers. My process strips layers away. Rock stars are more comfortable creating an aura and mystique." [...] Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, [...] "They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make and they let me make the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. I think part of it is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, <b>they</b> <b>sort</b> of let me have a free hand." [...] Bono said that it was the least involved the band had ever been in a U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, [...] "They were over the moon. They loved it." [...] The only request the band made was that the film should be shortened in length, and Guggenheim agreed.|$|E
