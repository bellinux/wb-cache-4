5|$|In {{depressed}} {{people who}} experience symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue, bupropion {{has been found}} to be more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in alleviating <b>these</b> <b>symptoms.</b> There appears to be a modest advantage for the SSRIs over bupropion in the treatment of anxious depression.|$|E
5|$|Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations are anxiety, depression, {{a reduced}} display of {{emotions}} (blunted affect), egocentrism, aggression, and compulsive behavior, {{the latter of}} which can cause or worsen addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and hypersexuality. Difficulties in recognizing other people's negative expressions have also been observed. The prevalence of <b>these</b> <b>symptoms</b> is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, <b>these</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{are among the most}} distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts are more common than in the general population. Often individuals have reduced awareness of chorea, cognitive and emotional impairments.|$|E
5|$|Small {{children}} with {{moderate to severe}} TBI may have some of <b>these</b> <b>symptoms</b> but have difficulty communicating them. Other signs seen in young children include persistent crying, inability to be consoled, listlessness, refusal to nurse or eat, and irritability.|$|E

5|$|Alterations in the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of <b>these</b> <b>symptoms</b> can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes {{become more}} prevalent. Common manifestations are wandering, {{irritability}} and labile affect, leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving. Sundowning can also appear. Approximately 30% {{of people with}} AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (anosognosia). Urinary incontinence can develop. <b>These</b> <b>symptoms</b> create stress for relatives and carers, which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term care facilities.|$|E

40|$|Pathological {{gambling}} (PG), {{as defined}} until {{recently in the}} DSM-IV, shares many clinical characteristics with substance use disorders (SUDs), such as craving and loss of control. Moreover, an increasing body of literature also revealed neurobiological similarities between PG and substance-related addictions. Further, specific treatments for SUD are also effective in pathological gamblers. These observations resulted in a recent change in the diagnostic classification of PG in DSM- 5 : maladaptive gambling behavior is now subsumed as 'gambling disorder' (GD) under the category 'substance-related and addictive disorders'. On the basis of similarities in clinical characteristics between GD and SUDs, this article proposes 3 main clusters of diagnostic criteria: 'loss of control', 'craving/withdrawal' and 'neglect of other areas in life'. <b>These</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters can then {{be related to the}} experimental paradigms commonly used in the neuroscience of addiction, including neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies. In this paper, we present the neurobiological evidence for PG by focusing on key functional magnetic resonance imaging studies related to <b>these</b> 3 <b>symptom</b> clusters. It is concluded that <b>these</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters provide a useful framework for systematic comparisons of new evidence in GD and SUDs in the futur...|$|R
5|$|High {{levels of}} {{molybdenum}} {{can interfere with}} the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). <b>These</b> <b>symptoms</b> can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatric {{problems}} due to Wilson's {{disease may}} include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms are commonly seen {{in conjunction with}} neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own. <b>These</b> <b>symptoms</b> are often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes. Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely made when only psychiatric symptoms are present.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, <b>these</b> <b>symptoms</b> may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of AML {{are caused by}} replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. <b>These</b> <b>symptoms</b> include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified, but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>symptoms</b> may {{be severe}} enough to warrant hospitalisation. Treatment is supportive; {{antispasmodic}} medicines may lessen colicky abdominal cramps, and activated charcoal may be administered early on to bind residual toxin.

5|$|Though {{dopamine}} agonists {{are less}} effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, {{they are usually}} effective enough to manage <b>these</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{in the first years}} of treatment. Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD but, along with other complications, become more common with older age at onset. Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for younger onset PD, and levodopa is preferred for older onset PD.|$|E
5|$|Abdominal pain(38.1%), lack of fecal {{production}} or constipation(21.1%), nausea(17.0%), diarrhea(8.2%), bloating(4.1%), and dental decay(3.4%) are also described as common symptoms in day-to-day life. <b>These</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{are not necessarily}} prevalent during regurgitation episodes, and can happen at any time. Weight loss is often observed (42.2%) at an average loss of 9.6kilograms, and {{is more common in}} cases where the disorder has gone undiagnosed {{for a longer period of}} time, though this may be expected of the nutrition deficiencies that often accompany the disorder as a consequence of its symptoms. Depression has also been linked with rumination syndrome, though its effects on rumination syndrome are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion-induced {{psychosis}} {{may develop}} in select populations, or worsen a pre-existing psychotic syndrome. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion. In most cases <b>these</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{can be reduced}} or eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment or adding antipsychotic medication. However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an antipsychotic, may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. Psychotic symptoms are associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion, a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, concomitant medications, for example, lithium or benzodiazepines, old age, or substance abuse.|$|E

5|$|Hospice {{care in the}} United States is a {{type and}} {{philosophy}} of end-of-life care which focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient's symptoms. <b>These</b> <b>symptoms</b> can be physical, emotional, spiritual or social in nature. The concept of hospice {{as a place to}} treat the incurably ill has been evolving since the 11th century. Hospice care was introduced to the United States in the 1970s in response to the work of Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom. This part of health care has expanded as people face a variety of issues with terminal illness. In the United States, it is distinguished by extensive use of volunteers and a greater emphasis on the patient's psychological needs in coming to terms with dying.|$|E
5|$|Little {{comprehensive}} {{data regarding}} rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness {{and are often}} misdiagnosed due {{to the number of}} symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus, such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa. <b>These</b> <b>symptoms</b> include the acid-induced erosion of the esophagus and enamel, halitosis, malnutrition, severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of bulimia.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{organizations}} have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardize the diagnostic process, {{especially in the}} early stages of the disease. The most widely known criteria come from the UK Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders and the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The Queen Square Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement (bradykinesia) plus either rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. Other possible causes of <b>these</b> <b>symptoms</b> need to be ruled out. Finally, three or more of the following supportive features are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, tremor at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to levodopa for at least five years, clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of dyskinesias induced by the intake of excessive levodopa.|$|E
