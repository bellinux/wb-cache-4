5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity {{despite the lack of}} a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with <b>the</b> <b>collaborative</b> potential of networked communication.|$|E
5|$|Collaborations is a four-disc {{compilation}} box set by Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar {{and former}} Beatle George Harrison. Released in October 2010 on Dark Horse Records, it compiles two studio albums originally issued on that label – the long-unavailable Shankar Family & Friends (1974) and Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from India (1976) – and Chants of India, first issued on Angel Records in 1997. Although all three albums were originally Shankar releases, for which Harrison {{served in the}} role of music producer and guest musician, both Shankar and Harrison are credited as artists on the box set. Each of <b>the</b> <b>collaborative</b> projects represents a departure from Shankar's more typical work as a sitarist and performer of Hindustani classical ragas, with the box set showcasing his forays into, variously, jazz and rock, Indian folk and orchestral ensembles, and devotional music.|$|E

5|$|In the Peloponnesian War, {{which had}} ended in 404 BC, Sparta had enjoyed {{the support of}} nearly every {{mainland}} Greek state and the Persian Empire, and in the months and years following that war, {{a number of the}} island states of the Aegean had come under its control. This solid base of support, however, was fragmented in the years following the war. Despite <b>the</b> <b>collaborative</b> nature of the victory, Sparta alone received the plunder taken from the defeated states and the tribute payments from the former Athenian Empire. Sparta's allies were further alienated when, in 402 BC, Sparta attacked and subdued Elis, a member of the Peloponnesian League that had angered the Spartans {{during the course of the}} Peloponnesian War. Corinth and Thebes refused to send troops to assist Sparta in its campaign against Elis.|$|E
5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire <b>the</b> <b>collaborative</b> culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E

It was a {{practical}} extension of <b>the</b> <b>collaborative</b> atmosphere of The Five during the 1860s and 1870s, when they heard each other's compositions in progress and worked on them together, and {{was an effort to}} save works that would otherwise either have languished unheard or become lost entirely. This work included the completion of Alexander Borodin's opera Prince Igor, which Rimsky-Korsakov undertook with the help of Glazunov after Borodin's death, and the orchestration of passages from César Cui's William Ratcliff for its first production in 1869. He also completely orchestrated the opera The Stone Guest by Alexander Dargomyzhsky three times—in 1869–70, 1892 and 1902. While not a member of The Five himself, Dargomyzhsky was closely associated with the group and shared their musical philosophy.|$|E
