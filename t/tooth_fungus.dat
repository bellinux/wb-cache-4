5|$|Despite vast {{differences}} in appearance and morphology, A.vulgare {{is related to}} such varied taxa as the gilled fungi of Lentinus, the poroid genus Albatrellus, the coral-like Clavicorona, and fellow <b>tooth</b> <b>fungus</b> Hericium. The relationship {{of all of these}} taxa—members of the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales—has been demonstrated through molecular phylogenetics.|$|E
500|$|The fruit bodies {{typically}} have a funnel-shaped cap {{with a white}} edge, although the shape can be highly variable. Young, moist fruit bodies can [...] "bleed" [...] a bright red fluid that contains a pigment known to have anticoagulant properties similar to heparin. The unusual appearance of the young fruit bodies has earned the species several descriptive common names, including strawberries and cream, the bleeding Hydnellum, the bleeding <b>tooth</b> <b>fungus,</b> the red-juice tooth, and the Devil's tooth. Although Hydnellum peckii fruit bodies are readily identifiable when young, they become brown and nondescript when they age.|$|E
500|$|Hydnellum ferrugineum, {{commonly}} known as the mealy tooth or the reddish-brown corky spine fungus, is a species of <b>tooth</b> <b>fungus</b> in the family Bankeraceae. A widely distributed species, it is found in north Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. The fungus fruits on the ground singly or in clusters in conifer forest, usually in poor (low nutrient) or sandy soil. Fruit bodies are somewhat top-shaped, measuring [...] in diameter. Their velvety surfaces, initially white to pink, sometimes exude drops of red liquid. The lower surface of the fruit body features white to reddish-brown spines up to 6mm long. Mature fruit bodies become dark reddish brown in color, and are then difficult to distinguish from other similar Hydnellum species. H.ferrugineum forms a mat of mycelia in the humus and upper soil where it grows. The presence of the fungus changes the characteristics of the soil, making it more podzolized.|$|E
50|$|Deflexula is a genus of <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi</b> in {{the family}} Pterulaceae.|$|R

5000|$|Hydnum rufescens, {{commonly}} known as the terracotta hedgehog, is an edible basidiomycete of the family Hydnaceae. It belongs to the small group of mushrooms {{often referred to as the}} <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi,</b> which produce fruit bodies whose cap undersurfaces are covered by hymenophores resembling spines or teeth, and not pores or gills.|$|R
50|$|Hericium americanum, {{commonly}} known as the bear's head <b>tooth</b> <b>fungus,</b> is an edible mushroom in the <b>tooth</b> <b>fungus</b> group. It was described as new to science in 1984 by Canadian mycologist James Herbert Ginns.|$|E

5000|$|... <b>tooth</b> <b>fungus</b> or hydnoid fungus - {{underside}} of the fruiting body composed of spines or teeth ...|$|E
5000|$|The hydnoid fungi are a {{group of}} fungi in the Basidiomycota with basidiocarps (fruit bodies) {{producing}} spores on pendant, tooth-like or spine-like projections. They are colloquially called <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi.</b> Originally such fungi were referred to the genus Hydnum ("hydnoid" [...] means Hydnum-like), but it is now known that not all hydnoid species are closely related.|$|R
50|$|The pileus is the {{technical}} {{name for the}} cap, or cap-like part, of a basidiocarp or ascocarp (fungal fruiting body) that supports a spore-bearing surface, the hymenium. The hymenium (hymenophore) may consist of lamellae, tubes, or teeth, {{on the underside of}} the pileus. A pileus is characteristic of agarics, boletes, some polypores, <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi,</b> and some ascomycetes.|$|R
5000|$|The pileus area {{index is}} the {{technical}} {{name for the}} size of what {{is commonly known as}} the [...] "cap" [...] of a fungal fruiting body. It was coined by Asher Tarivona Mutsengi, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. It is particularly characteristic of agarics, boletes, and some polypores, <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi,</b> and ascocarps.|$|R

5000|$|Mycoleptodonoides is a genus of <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi</b> in {{the family}} Meruliaceae. The genus was {{circumscribed}} by M.I. Nikolajeva in 1952. Mycoleptodonoides species have fruitbodies with caps with [...] "teeth" [...] on the underside. It has a monomitic hyphal system with generative hyphae containing clamp connections. Spores are small and smooth, and non-reactive with Melzer's reagent (non-amyloid).|$|R
50|$|Hydnellum aurantiacum is an {{inedible}} fungus, {{commonly known}} as the orange spine or orange Hydnellum for its reddish orange or rusty red colored fruit bodies. Like other <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi,</b> it bears a layer of spines rather than gills {{on the underside of the}} cap. Due to substantial declines in sightings, this species is listed as critically endangered in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Mycobonia is a genus of <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi</b> in {{the family}} Polyporaceae. It was once placed {{in the family}} Gloeophyllaceae, but Phylogenetic {{analysis}} and some microscopic characters place Mycobonia within the Polyporaceae, even making it synonymous with Polyporus. Mycobonia was circumscribed by French mycologist Narcisse Théophile Patouillard in 1894, with M. flava (then classified as a species of Hydnum) as the type species.|$|R

50|$|Kenneth A. Harrison (1901 - November 5, 1991) was a Canadian mycologist. He was {{for many}} years a plant {{pathologist}} at {{what is now the}} Atlantic Food and Horticulture Research Centre in Nova Scotia. After retirement, he contributed to the taxonomy of the Agaricomycotina, particularly the <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi</b> of the families Hydnaceae and Bankeraceae, in which he described several new species.|$|R
50|$|Bankera is a genus of four {{species of}} <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi</b> {{in the family}} Bankeraceae. The genus was first {{circumscribed}} in 1951 by William Chambers Coker and Alma Holland Beers, but this publication was invalid {{according to the rules}} of botanical nomenclature. It was later published validly by Zdeněk Pouzar in 1955. The type species is B. fuligineoalba. The genus is ectomycorrhizal with gymnosperms, usually with trees from the pine family.|$|R
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the scientific literature by Carl Linnaeus under the name Hydnum auriscalpium in his 1753 Species Plantarum. Linnaeus placed three other <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi</b> in the genus Hydnum: H.imbricatum, H.repandum, and H.tomentosum. In 1821, Samuel Frederick Gray considered H.auriscalpium to be sufficiently distinct from the other Hydnum species to warrant {{the creation of a}} new genus, Auriscalpium, to contain it. In the process, its name was changed to Auriscalpium vulgare.|$|R
50|$|Sarcodon illudens is {{a species}} of <b>tooth</b> <b>fungus</b> in the family Bankeraceae. It was {{described}} in 1976 by Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus, from collections made in France.|$|E
50|$|Hydnellum crustulinum is a <b>tooth</b> <b>fungus</b> in {{the family}} Bankeraceae. Found in Punjab, India, it was {{described}} as new to science in 1971 by Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus.|$|E

50|$|After his {{retirement}} in 1966, Harrison began studying the mushroom-producing species of the Agaricomycotina more avidly. Collections forays throughout Nova Scotia, in the Great Smoky Mountains, New Mexico, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Pacific Northwest led to him describing several new species in the genera Steccherinum, and <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi</b> in Hydnellum, Sarcodon, Phellodon. Harrison died in Kentville, Nova Scotia, in 1991. The Department of Biology at Acadia University has a mycology laboratory named in his honour.|$|R
50|$|The Cantharellales are {{an order}} of fungi in the class Agaricomycetes. The order {{includes}} not only the chanterelles (Cantharellaceae), but also some of the <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi</b> (Hydnaceae), clavarioid fungi (Aphelariaceae and Clavulinaceae), and corticioid fungi (Botryobasidiaceae). Species within the order are variously ectomycorrhizal, saprotrophic, associated with orchids, or facultative plant pathogens. Those of economic importance include edible and commercially collected Cantharellus, Craterellus, and Hydnum species as well as crop pathogens in the genera Ceratobasidium and Thanatephorus (Rhizoctonia).|$|R
50|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the scientific literature by Carl Linnaeus under the name Hydnum auriscalpium in his 1753 Species Plantarum. Linnaeus placed three other <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi</b> in the genus Hydnum: H. imbricatum, H. repandum, and H. tomentosum.

50|$|Hydnellum papuanum is a <b>tooth</b> <b>fungus</b> in {{the family}} Bankeraceae. Found in Papua New Guinea, it was {{described}} as new to science in 1971 by Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus.|$|E
50|$|Hydnellum scrobiculatum, {{commonly}} known as the ridged tooth, is a <b>tooth</b> <b>fungus</b> in the family Bankeraceae. Widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, it is found in Asia, Europe, and North America.|$|E
50|$|Metuloidea murashkinskyi is {{a species}} of <b>tooth</b> <b>fungus</b> in the family Steccherinaceae. It is found in Europe and Asia, where it causes a white rot on the wood of {{deciduous}} trees.|$|E
50|$|This {{group also}} {{includes}} a number of russuloid hypogeous fungi, polypores such as Bondarzewia, some <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi</b> (e.g. Auriscalpium vulgare), and club fungi e.g. Artomyces. Basidiospores in this group are typically ornamented with amyloid warts or reticulation but a few exceptions are known, e.g. Heterobasidion annosum. The genus Clavicorona was often treated in the Russulales, but its type species, C. taxophila is in the Agaricales. The remaining species are retained in the Russulales in the genus Artomyces.|$|R
500|$|Hydnellum is a genus of <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi</b> in {{the family}} Bankeraceae (order Thelephorales). Widely {{distributed}} in the Northern Hemisphere, the genus contains around 40 species. The fruitbodies of its members grow by slowly enveloping nearby bits of grass and vegetation. There is great variability {{in the form of}} Hydnellum fruitbodies, which are greatly influenced by environmental conditions such as rainfall and humidity, drying winds, and temperature. [...] They are too tough and woody to eat comfortably. Several species have become the focus of increasing conservation concern following widespread declines in abundance.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{mushrooms}} are not gilled, so the term [...] "mushroom" [...] is loosely used, and giving a full {{account of their}} classifications is difficult. Some have pores underneath (and are usually called boletes), others have spines, such as the hedgehog mushroom and other <b>tooth</b> <b>fungi,</b> and so on. [...] "Mushroom" [...] {{has been used for}} polypores, puffballs, jelly fungi, coral fungi, bracket fungi, stinkhorns, and cup fungi. Thus, the term is more one of common application to macroscopic fungal fruiting bodies than one having precise taxonomic meaning. Approximately 14,000 species of {{mushrooms are}} described.|$|R
