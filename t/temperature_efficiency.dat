The effects LHC which are usually ignored in the heat wheel design play a relatively {{significant role in the}} heat wheel with high <b>temperature</b> <b>efficiency</b> and short depth in flow direction. The correlation developed by Shah, Kays and London is applied to predict the <b>temperature</b> <b>efficiency</b> and to investigate the impacts of the LHC.

The influence of the depth of the heat wheel, the airflow rates on the LHC and <b>temperature</b> <b>efficiency</b> were analysed. It was found that the heat wheel has difficulty to achieve a high <b>temperature</b> <b>efficiency</b> (85 %) due to the effects of LHC. There is an optimal depth design for heat wheel in the flow direction to recovery maximum thermal energy with low pressure loss with considering the LHC effects.

40|$|Heating {{of supply}} air and drive energy to fans and pumps predominate the energy use of HVAC systems in non-residential {{buildings}} in cold, dry climates. Hence heat recovery {{and the effect}} on fan energy is of interest whereas recovery of cooling and moisture is less of an issue. This study looks at dedicated outdoor air systems with a run-around loop heat recovery or an enthalpy wheel heat recovery. In nonresidential buildings heat recovery with full capacity is used only during {{a part of the}} year but it still causes a pressure drop in the air round. In this situation the most energy efficient system with the highest <b>temperature</b> <b>efficiency</b> if one considers the If the value of electricity, compared to the value of heat, handling unit all year is not always the one penalty in fan energy is taken into account, the <b>temperature</b> <b>efficiency</b> might be even less important. In this case-study the enthalpy wheel with the lowest <b>temperature</b> <b>efficiency</b> was the most energy efficient choice on a system level. The same applies for the run-around loop systems, where the run-around loop with the lower <b>temperature</b> <b>efficiency</b> gave the better result. In the case of run-around loop systems there are different strategies for capacity control of the liquid flow to obtain optimal operation. Common alternatives are constant flow with variable temperature by means of a shunt group and variable flow by means flow control of a variable power is used compared to of two-way valve. A more energy efficient way is direct speed pump. In direct flow control a much smaller pump valve control. Shunt groups, in particular, result in pump power that is constant and unaffected by the real demand. Calculations based on measurements on a run-around loop system with direct flow control during three months show that the pump power after optimizing the flow can be reduced by 80 %...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} dealt with direct contact heat {{exchange}} characteristics between ice water slurry (average ice particle diameter : 3. 10 mm) and hot air bubbles. The hot air bubbles ascending in the layer fluidized the ice water slurry layer, and the bubbles were cooled down directly by the ice water slurry. The following results {{were obtained from the}} experiment. In case of ice water slurry layer, the hot air bubbles fluidized the layer in earlier stage and heat exchange performance was higher than using only ice particles layer. The maximum <b>temperature</b> <b>efficiency</b> increased as Reynolds number Re increased because fluid in the layer became active and kept at the fixed value in the region of Re >__= 900. Dehumidity efficiency increased as modified Stefan number and Re increased since the heat capacity of inlet air and heat transfer coefficient increased. Some empirical correlations for <b>temperature</b> <b>efficiency,</b> dehumidity efficiency and the completion time of latent cold heat release were derived in terms of various nondimensional parameters. 近年、電力需要の急増傾向に対応すべく、夜間電力を利用した氷蓄熱システムの開発が盛んに行われ、ビル用空調を初めとして一般業務用空調にも製品として展開されてきている。その中で、蓄熱槽内にて氷と熱交換した冷水を利用側空調へ搬送させて冷房運転を行う水搬送方式に替わって、氷水スラリーを直接、利用側空調機へ搬送する氷水搬送技術の研究開発が行われている。このシステムは氷の潜熱を直接、利用側へ供給することにより、冷水搬送方法と比較して単位流量当たりの冷熱輸送能力が格段に増大するため、配管口径の縮小や輸送動力の低減が図れるものである。さらに、氷水スラリー搬送技術に加えて、搬送された氷水スラリーを冷房熱源として二重管式熱交換器の内管に流動させ、その外管に温水を流して採冷熱する方法や、角氷を充填層へ搬送して空気と直接接触熱交換させる採冷熱方法が提案されている。また、各種潜熱蓄冷熱材を被熟媒体とし、空気泡を熱媒体として両者を直接接触させて熱交換する直接接触熱交換に関する研究も行われている。上記直接接触熱交換では、噴射空気泡により潜熱蓄冷熱材が流動するため、潜熱蓄冷熱材の温度場が均一となり、潜熱蓄冷熱材と空気泡との熱交換が比較的均一に進行するという利点がある。しかしながら、氷水と空気との直接接触型潜熱放冷特性に関する研究が少ないのが現状である。氷水と空気との直接接触型放冷方式では、空気は氷水により冷却されるだけでなく、空気に含まれる水蒸気が氷水により凝縮されるため、冷却と除湿を同時に行える効果が期待できる。本研究は均一な氷水スラリー層を対象として、氷水スラリー層下部に多数の円形ノズルを均一に配列した分散板を設置し、そこから温空気を層内に噴射し、発生した空気泡と氷水スラリーとを直接接触熱交換させた場合の氷の融解挙動および通過空気の熱交換特性について実験的に検討するものである。その際の現象は粒状氷と水との混合割合や通過空気流速等を変化させることによりさまざまに変化させることが可能である。本研究では実験因子である流入空気温度、湿度、空気流量および氷質量充填率が、熱交換後の空気温度、湿度および潜熱放冷完了時間に及ぼす影響について実験的に検討し、これらの相関関係を実験式の形でまとめることを狙いとする...|$|E

This study {{is related to}} low temperature damage that can arise mid-season during the panicle development phase. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether low temperature experienced by the root, panicle, or foliage is responsible for increased spikelet sterility. In temperature-controlled glasshouse experiments, water depth, and water and air temperatures, were changed independently to investigate the effects of low temperature in the root, panicle, and foliage during microspore development on spikelet sterility. The total number of pollen and number of engorged pollen grains per anther, and the number of intercepted and germinated pollen grains per stigma, were measured. Spikelet sterility was then analysed in relation to the total number of pollen grains per spikelet and the efficiency with which these pollen grains became engorged, were intercepted by the stigma, germinated, and were involved in fertilisation. There was a significant combined effect of average minimum panicle and root temperatures on spikelet sterility that accounted for 86 % of the variation in spikelet sterility. Total number of pollen grains per anther was reduced by low panicle temperature, but not by low root <b>temperature.</b> Whereas engorgement <b>efficiency</b> (the percentage of pollen grains that were engorged) was determined by both root and panicle <b>temperature,</b> germination <b>efficiency</b> (the percentage of germinated pollen grains relative to the number of engorged pollen grains intercepted by the stigma) was determined only by root <b>temperature.</b> Interception <b>efficiency</b> (i. e. percentage of engorged pollen grains intercepted by the stigma), however, was not affected by either root or panicle <b>temperature.</b> Engorgement <b>efficiency</b> was the dominant factor explaining the variation in spikelet sterility.
