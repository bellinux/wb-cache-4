5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>people</b> who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E

In the 1990s, a play about Royce's life was written by Felix Mitterer, titled In der Löwengrube (English: In the Lion's Den). It premiered at the Volkstheater in Vienna on January 24, 1998.|$|E

Today, Turks of Armenian and Kurdish ethnicity coexist in peace. The PKK leadership has recognized the Armenian Genocide and apologized for Kurdish involvement. There have also been seminars held by Armenian and Kurdish groups to discuss both the genocide and Turkey.|$|E

25|$|The end {{of history}} is, alas, also {{the end of the}} dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for {{disposing}} of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>people</b> who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E
25|$|Most authors, though, {{focus on}} the {{short-term}} outcome of the operation. They argue that, for all its impressive statistics, Operation Cedar Falls failed to achieve its primary goal: Whereas it did deal a serious blow to the Vietcong, communist forces swiftly reestablished their dominant position in the Iron Triangle. Moreover, the saturation bombing and artillery fire {{as well as the}} forced deportation of 6,000 civilians are considered tactics which, in addition to being morally highly questionable, were militarily counterproductive as well. While writing from completely different, if not opposed, political points of view, both journalist Stanley Karnow and political scientist Guenter Lewy cite the deportations of Operation Cedar Falls {{as an example of a}} larger military strategy which deliberately displaced hundreds of thousands of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>people</b> the US claimed to defend and thus alienated them from the South Vietnamese regime and their American allies.|$|E

25|$|In 1946 {{he went to}} University of the Witwatersrand (more {{commonly}} known as Wits University) in Johannesburg {{with the help of}} a Government loan and grant, where he first befriended fellow students and future anti-apartheid political activists Nelson Mandela and Joe Slovo. He joined the United Party and assisted in the 1948 election. However, as a result of the National Party victory, he was determined to become more active and was elected Chairman of the United Party branch at the university. He argued that the National Party's victory in 1948 was reversible and anyone who opposed them should concentrate on defeating them. In an interview in 1991, Schwarz said on the National Party victory that “To me, they were the people who had supported Germany during the war. As a young man, it was very objectionable to me that <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>people</b> I had been fighting against were the people that the National Party had supported.” He was also president of the university's ex-servicemen's league and chair of the Law Students Council. He stood as a candidate for treasurer of the Students Representative Council and refrained from voting for himself which he considered to be unethical. When the votes were counted, it was announced that Schwarz had lost by one vote.|$|E

500|$|Joseph {{arrived in}} New York on July 7, 1888, and later that month preached his inaugural Sabbath sermon at Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. The speech {{attracted}} a huge crowd, with over 1,500 men {{crowded into the}} sanctuary, and thousands more outside. The police had to call extra reinforcements to control the throng, and to escort Joseph into the synagogue. Though he had been chosen, in part, for his [...] "fabulous skills as an orator", his speaking style and sermons, which had been so beloved in Europe, did not impress New York audiences.

Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson however replied that United had been pressurised to make the decision, which aimed to solidify England's 2006 FIFA World Cup bid: [...] "The Government are saying that we should be in the FA Cup, but they are <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>people</b> that were saying originally that {{we have to go to}} Brazil.

500|$|During {{the guerrilla}} war, Ian Smith {{referred}} to Mugabe as [...] "the apostle of Satan". George Shire expressed {{the view that}} there was [...] "a strong racist animus" [...] against Mugabe within Zimbabwe, and that this had typically been overlooked by Western media representations of the country. Mugabe has himself been accused of racism; John Sentamu, the Uganda-born Archbishop of York in the United Kingdom, called Mugabe [...] "the worst kind of racist dictator," [...] for having [...] "targeted the whites for their apparent riches". They have been denounced as racist against Zimbabwe's white minority. Tutu stated that Mugabe became [...] "increasingly insecure, he's hitting out. One just wants to weep. It's very sad." [...] South African President Nelson Mandela was also critical of Mugabe, referring {{to him as a}} politician who [...] "despise <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>people</b> who put [...] in power and think it's a privilege to be there for eternity".|$|E
500|$|Further {{criticism}} followed. Tod was {{an officer}} of the British imperial system, at that time the world's dominant power. Working in India, he attracted the attention of local rulers who were keen to tell their own tales of defiance against the Mughal empire. He heard what they told him but knew little of what they omitted. He was a soldier writing about a caste renowned for its martial abilities, and he was aided in his writings by <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>people</b> whom he was documenting. He had been interested in Rajput history prior to coming into contact with them in an official capacity, as administrator of the region in which they lived. These factors, says Freitag, contribute to why the Annals were [...] "manifestly biased". Freitag argues that critics of Tod's literary output can be split into two groups: those who concentrate on his errors of fact and those who concentrate on his failures of interpretation.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Che {{was going}} to be made in English and was met with a strong {{interest}} in financing; however, when {{the decision was made to}} make it in Spanish and break it up into two films, the studios' pay-TV deals, which were for English-language product only, [...] "disappeared", according to Bickford, [...] "and, at that point, nobody wanted to step up". The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time where you go make a movie in another culture, that you shoot in the language of that culture. I'm hoping the days of that sort of specific brand of cultural imperialism have ended". Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was very frustrating to know that this is a zeitgeist movie and that some of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>people</b> who told me how much they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup. Spain's Telecinco/Moreno Films supplied the rest of the budget.|$|E
