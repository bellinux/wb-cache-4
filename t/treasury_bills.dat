40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that macroeconomic variables affect Stock market returns using <b>Treasury</b> <b>bill</b> rate as a measure of interest rate. The study examines the joint impact of  interest rates and <b>Treasury</b> <b>bill</b> rate on  stock market returns on Ghana Stock Exchange over the period between January 1995 and December 2011. Using Johansen’s Multivariate Cointegration Model and Vector Error  Correction Model the study establish that there is cointegration between Interest rate, <b>Treasury</b> <b>bill</b> rate and stock market returns indicating long run relationship. On the basis of the Multiple Regression Analysis (OLS) carried out by Eviews 7 program, the results show that <b>Treasury</b> <b>bill</b> rate and interest rate both have a negative relationship with stock market returns but  are not  significant. These results lend support to the idea that interest rate and <b>Treasury</b> <b>bill</b> rate has both  negative  relationship  but  weak predictive  power on stock market returns independently. The study conclude that interest rate and <b>Treasury</b> <b>bill</b> rate jointly impact on stock market returns in the long run. Understanding the effects of both  Treasury bill rate and interest rate dynamics on stock market returns will help investors, fund  and portfolio managers and firms make better investment decisions. </p...|$|R

40|$|First, the non-stationarity {{properties}} of the conditional variances in the GARCH(1, 1) model are analysed using the concept of infinite persistence of shocks. Given a time sequence of probabilities for increasing/decreasing conditional variances, a theoretical formula for quasi-strict non-stationarity is defined. The resulting conditions for the GARCH(1, 1) model are shown to differ from the weak stationarity conditions mainly used in the literature. Bayesian statistical analysis using Monte Carlo integration is applied to analyse both stationarity concepts for the conditional variances of the US 3 -month <b>treasury</b> <b>bill</b> rate. Interest rates {{are known for their}} weakly non-stationary conditional variances but, using a quasi-strict stationarity measure, it is shown that the conditional variances are likely to be stationary. Second, the level of the <b>treasury</b> <b>bill</b> rate is analysed for non-stationarity using Bayesian unit root methods. The disturbances of the GARCH model for the <b>treasury</b> <b>bill</b> rate are t-distributed.

Imposing normally distributed disturbances leads therefore to underestimation of the non-stationarity in the level of the <b>treasury</b> <b>bill</b> rate...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} risk facing {{agents in}} a monetary economy arises from inflation uncertainty: in the U.

The costs of such uncertainty are likely to be even higher for multi-year contracts, since we estimate that a 1 % unexpected inflation this year implies an upward revision of 0. 43 % for expected inflation for the forthcoming year and 1 % for the years beyond that. The prospect of hedging inflation risk exposure using conventional financial instruments is bleak, as has been widely documented. We develop a theoretical case for <b>Treasury</b> <b>bill</b> futures as a inflation risk hedge by jointly assuming that (1) the Fisher Hypothesis applies to <b>Treasury</b> <b>bill</b> yields, (2) the Unbiased Expectations Hypothesis (UEH) applies to futures prices, and (3) inflation is an autoregressive process. Our empirical analysis shows that <b>Treasury</b> <b>bill</b> futures can reduce single-period inflation risk by about 30 - 40 %. The expected cost of using such futures is close to zero, since we find that the Unbiased Expectations Hypothesis for <b>Treasury</b> <b>bill</b> futures cannot be rejected.

25|$|In {{its role}} as the central bank of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and {{efficiency}} of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the U.S. Treasury keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems U.S. government securities such as savings bonds and <b>Treasury</b> <b>bills,</b> notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's coin and paper currency. The U.S. Treasury, through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways. During the Fiscal Year 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6 billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note.|$|E
