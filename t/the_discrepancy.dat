5|$|Amazon {{lost three}} in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded. <b>The</b> <b>discrepancy</b> in losses during the action is likely due to the extreme difficulty the French crew had in aiming their guns given their ship's instability in heavy seas.|$|E
5|$|The {{discoveries of}} the high-radii planets HAT-P-33b and HAT-P-32b, {{along with that}} of WASP-17b, contributed to the {{question}} of what factors, besides temperature, contribute to the large radii of these inflated planets. <b>The</b> <b>discrepancy</b> lies in planet WASP-18b, which is far hotter than the newly discovered HAT planets and WASP-17b, but has a far smaller radius.|$|E
5|$|Though the sagas {{agree that}} Olaf Tryggvason had only 11 {{ships in the}} battle, some of them quote a verse by Halldórr the Unchristian saying that Olaf had 71 ships when he sailed from the south.

40|$|Results from a {{study to}} {{identify}} and characterize discrepancies between validation tests and high-fidelity analyses of compression-loaded panels are presented. First, potential sources of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancies</b> in both <b>the</b> experimental method and corresponding high-fidelity analysis models were identified. Then, a series of laboratory tests and numerical simulations were conducted to quantify <b>the</b> <b>discrepancies</b> and develop test and analysis methods to account for <b>the</b> <b>discrepancies.</b> <b>The</b> results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>discrepancies</b> between <b>the</b> validation tests and high-fidelity analyses {{can be attributed to}} imperfections in the test fixture and specimen geometry; test-fixture-induced changes in specimen geometry; and test-fixture-induced friction on the loaded edges of the test specimen. The results also show that accurate predictions of the panel response can be obtained when these specimen imperfections and edge conditions are accounted for in the analysis. The errors in the tests and analyses, and the methods used to characterize these errors are presented...|$|R

40|$|Various {{discrepancies}} {{have been}} defined in uniform designs, such as centered L 2 -discrepancy, wrap-around L 2 -discrepancy and discrete <b>discrepancy.</b> Among them <b>the</b> discrete <b>discrepancy</b> can explore relationships among uniform designs, fractional factorial designs, and combinational designs. However, <b>the</b> discrete <b>discrepancy</b> is mainly good for two-level factorial designs. In this paper, a new <b>discrepancy</b> based on <b>the</b> Lee distance, Lee discrepancy, is proposed and its computational formula is given. <b>The</b> Lee <b>discrepancy</b> can expand <b>the</b> relationships between <b>the</b> discrete <b>discrepancy</b> and some criteria for factorial designs with multiple levels. Some lower bounds of <b>the</b> Lee <b>discrepancy</b> for symmetrical and asymmetrical designs are given, and some connections between <b>the</b> Lee <b>discrepancy</b> and <b>the</b> generalized minimum aberration are considered. Finally, relationships between <b>the</b> Lee <b>discrepancy</b> and majorization framework are also considered. ...|$|R
5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848, as he {{believed}} the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> between the paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E
5|$|Even before Neptune's discovery, some {{speculated that}} one planet alone {{was not enough}} to explain <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy.</b> On 17 November 1834, the British amateur {{astronomer}} the Reverend Thomas John Hussey reported a conversation he had had with French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to George Biddell Airy, the British Astronomer Royal. Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him, and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen, director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, about the subject. Hansen's opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of Uranus, and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus.|$|E

25|$|In addition, it is {{now known}} that <b>the</b> <b>discrepancies</b> between <b>the</b> {{predicted}} and observed positions of Uranus and Neptune were not caused by the gravity of an unknown planet. Rather, they were due to an erroneous value for the mass of Neptune. Voyager 2s 1989 encounter with Neptune yielded a more precise value of its mass, and <b>the</b> <b>discrepancies</b> disappear when using this value.|$|R
5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. <b>The</b> <b>discrepancy</b> is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E
5|$|Mercury's orbit, however, did {{not match}} that {{predicted}} by Newton's Law of Gravitation. Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) that would explain the discrepancies; however no such planet could be found. When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) {{he turned his attention}} to the problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy.</b> This was the first time that Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be inexact.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of rudimentary and nonfunctional clavicles in ceratopsians, {{it was assumed that}} these shoulder bones were reduced in all dinosaurs that did not have true furculae. Robert Bakker (1987) suggested that this would have allowed the shoulder blades to swing with the forelimbs in quadrupedal dinosaurs, increasing their functional forelimb length. This would have reduced <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> of length between fore- and hindlimbs in a quadrupedal Massospondylus. However, a recent discovery shows that Massospondylus possessed well-developed clavicles that were joined in a furcula-like arrangement, acting like a clasp between the right and left shoulder blades and prohibiting any rotation of these bones. This discovery indicates that the clavicle reduction is limited to the evolutionary line leading to the ceratopsians. It also indicates that the furcula of birds is derived from clavicles.|$|E

5|$|Such issues made {{attempts}} to codify the compositions {{in a uniform}} manner impossible. An example of this could be found among the Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name for one of the rhythmic modes associated with kangungudan but it has also been used as a term designating a “new” style. Another example concerns <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades ago are now considered “old” even though this is considered a tradition spanning many centuries. These differences could sometimes make discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within it a bit confounding.|$|E
5|$|The {{measurements}} use highly polished {{spheres of}} silicon {{with a mass}} of one kilogram. Spheres are used to simplify the measurement of the size (and hence the density) and to minimize {{the effect of the}} oxide coating that inevitably forms on the surface. The first measurements used spheres of silicon with natural isotopic composition, and had a relative uncertainty of 3.1. These first results were also inconsistent with values of the Planck constant derived from watt balance measurements, although the source of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> is now believed to be known.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, {{progress}} on the project has been stalled by disagreements between the Wolkoffs {{and the town of}} Islip over the amount the Wolkoffs will spend for the transportation piece of the project, and between the family and labor unions over wages and health care. The town of Islip has stated that the Wolkoffs agreed to spend $75million (2011USD) for the infrastructure improvements; however, the family stated in a September 2011 letter that they would only commit to $27million (2011USD) and that they never agreed to the original figure. Gerald Wolkoff thought that <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> stemmed from his belief that transportation should be funded by the government, not from private sources, as his project would generate tax revenue for the government. Despite the issues surrounding the project, the Heartland project received $2.5million from the State of New York for roadway improvements in December 2011. The funding was part of a $101million (2011USD) package given to Long Island for various economic improvements.|$|E

Two models of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancies</b> are presented: (a) unbiased reporting with inaccurate reporters having a large variance, and (b) biased reporting with inaccurate reporters having a large bias (either positive or negative). Estimation methods are least squares regression and maximum likelihood. A numerical illustration is given, using data of the international trade in services. It is shown how to judge the two models empirically. For an updated�version, see CPB Discussion Paper 216. �...|$|R
5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} number of troops {{deployed}} by the belligerents vary considerably. Croatian forces have been estimated from under 100,000 to 150,000, but most sources put the figure at about 130,000 troops. ARSK troop strength in the Sectors North and South was estimated by the HV prior to Operation Storm at approximately 43,000. More detailed HV estimates of the manpower by individual ARSK corps indicated 34,000 soldiers, while Serb sources quote 27,000 troops. <b>The</b> <b>discrepancy</b> is usually reflected in literature as an estimate of about 30,000 ARSK troops. The ARBiH deployed approximately 3,000 troops against the ARSK positions near Bihać.

5|$|However, the {{hypothesis}} of LDR is in contradiction to some embryological studies on birds which show that, from five developmental sites, the digits that develop are the three middle digits (II, III, IV). This inconsistency has {{been a matter of}} debate for almost 200 years, and has been used by Alan Feduccia to support the controversial hypothesis that birds are descended not from theropods but from some other group of archosaurs which had lost the first and fifth digits. To explain <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> between morphological and embryological data in the context of bird origins, an alternative scenario to LDR was developed by Tony Thulborn and Tim Hamley in 1982. In this scenario, the digits I and V of theropods were reduced in the process of Bilateral Digit Reduction (BDR), with the remaining digits developing to resemble the former digits I-III. Limusaurus was initially considered as evidence for the BDR hypothesis due to it - and other ceratosaurians - having a reduced first digit, with researchers hypothesizing that a similar pattern of reduction occurred among the tetanurans (the sister group of the ceratosaurians).|$|E
5|$|The Washington Post {{columnist}} Dana Milbank {{wrote in}} his 2010 book Tears of a Clown, that Beck had been baited by Eiland-Hall to confirm {{the importance of the}} United Nations.

The case was cited by Jude A. Thomas in a 2011 article published in the John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law. In a discussion of the conflicts between freedom of speech and trademark, Thomas noted that panels of the UDRP have concluded website operators had fair use over domain names even in cases where the name in question was exactly the same as that trademarked by the individual filing the complaint to the WIPO.|$|E
