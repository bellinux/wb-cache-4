25|$|On {{the first}} floor are located the parlor, the library, two dining rooms, and the kitchen. One of the dining rooms {{is located in the}} western wing, off of the hallway, and was used {{primarily}} used by the family for smaller meals like breakfast or tea. The kitchen is also in the wing, directly adjacent to the dining room. The other dining room, located in the front western side of the main house, was used only for formal dinners and as the sitting room where the men would converse after dinner. The fireplace in the room was enclosed in marble when Buchanan bought Wheatland and had a furnace installed. Across the hall, {{on the other side of}} the main house is the parlor, where the women guests would congregate after dinner. The library is located off the hallway in the east wing. The woodwork, doors, a bookcase, and a bookshelf built into the wall were grained to resemble oak. The shelves in <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf</b> no longer exist; but, the backboard of <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf</b> is visible, as is the plaster wall made to resemble wood. Two mahogany bookcases, flanking the fireplace in the library, were furnished by Jenkins and having been sold to each successive owner by the previous one. The library was primarily used by Buchanan as the place to meet with guests.|$|E

[...] Skinner says: [...] "Well, the kids have to learn about TekWar sooner or later," [...] {{referencing}} William Shatner's series of science fiction novels. Other books in <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf</b> include Sexus by Henry Miller, Hop on Pop by Dr. Seuss, The Satanic Verses ("Junior Illustrated Edition") by Salman Rushdie, 40 Years of Playboy by Hugh Hefner, Steal This Book by Abbie Hoffman, and The Theory of Evolution by Charles Darwin.|$|E
500|$|Her books shaped lesbian {{identity}} for lesbians and heterosexuals alike, but Bannon was mostly unaware of their impact. She stopped writing in 1962. Later, {{she earned a}} doctorate in linguistics and became an academic. She endured a difficult marriage for 27years and, as she separated from {{her husband in the}} 1980s, her books were republished; she was stunned to learn of their influence on society. They were released again between 2001 and 2003 and were adapted as an award-winning Off-Broadway production. They are taught in Women's and LGBT studies courses, and Bannon has received numerous awards for pioneering lesbian and gay literature. She has been described as [...] "the premier fictional representation of US lesbian life in the fifties and sixties", and {{it has been said that}} her books [...] "rest on <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf</b> of nearly every even faintly literate Lesbian".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 2005, Bong found Jean-Marc Rochette's French graphic novel series Le Transperceneige at a graphic novel shop near Hongik University and {{finished}} reading the entire series while {{standing in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf</b> where he found it. He was fascinated by ideas of people struggling on the train for survival, and how every section is classified in social stratification. Bong showed the series to his friends, fellow director Park Chan-wook and producer Lee Tae-hun, who loved it as well. Although Bong praised the original graphic novel, he soon realized that a film like Snowpiercer needed an original take. Bong stated, [...] " [...] I {{had to come up with}} a completely new story and new characters in order to create a new, dynamic Snowpiercer that was packed with cinematic exhilaration." ...|$|E
6000|$|Without answering, {{she went}} to <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf</b> and took down a folded sheet of paper. [...] "Here is a letter I got yesterday," [...] she explained, as she handed it to him.|$|E
60|$|On {{arriving}} at the study, his first act was to remove a boot {{from the top of}} the pile in the basket, place it in the small cupboard under <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf,</b> and lock the cupboard. Then he flung himself into a chair and panted.|$|E
60|$|MAZZINI [benevolently]. Ellie is very naughty, Mr Hushabye. Of {{course she}} does not really think that. [He goes to <b>the</b> <b>bookshelves,</b> and {{inspects}} <b>the</b> titles of the volumes].|$|R

60|$|He got up {{and went}} to the {{cupboard}} which filled the space between the stove and <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf.</b> From this resting-place he extracted a great pile of manuscript and dumped it down on the table with a bang which caused a good deal of Jackson's tea to spring from its native cup on to its owner's trousers.|$|E
6000|$|She {{rose and}} began to wander about the room. William rose also, and {{stood in front of}} the fire, muttering, [...] "Oysters, oysters--your basket of oysters!" [...] but though he looked vaguely here and there, as if the oysters might be on the top of <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf,</b> his eyes {{returned}} always to Katharine. She drew the curtain and looked out among the scanty leaves of the plane-trees.|$|E
60|$|The {{sight that}} met {{his eyes when}} he opened the door did nothing to soothe him. The floor was a sea of clothes. There were coats on the chairs, {{trousers}} on the bed, shirts on <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf.</b> And {{in the middle of his}} welter stood Archie, with a man who, to Mr. Brewster's heated eye, looked like a tramp comedian out of a burlesque show.|$|E
50|$|The {{reading room}} of the library, was founded in 1750. <b>The</b> <b>bookshelves</b> and {{interior}} architecture were by Gaetano Barbieri, and the ceiling was decorated by Giuseppe Facchinetti, Giacomo Filippi and Alessandro Turchi.|$|R
60|$|These stiff-paper roofs {{are one of}} {{our great}} inventions. We get thick, stiff paper at twopence a sheet and cut it to the sizes we need. After the game is over, we put these roofs inside one another and stick them into <b>the</b> <b>bookshelves.</b> <b>The</b> roof one folds and puts away will live to roof another day.|$|R
6000|$|I gave up by going, decidedly, to the smoking-room, {{where several}} men had {{gathered}} and where Obert, a little apart from them, was in charmed communion with <b>the</b> <b>bookshelves.</b> They are wonderful, everywhere, at Newmarch, <b>the</b> <b>bookshelves,</b> but {{he put a}} volume back as he saw me come in, and a moment later, when we were seated, I said to him again, as a recall of our previous passage, [...] "Then you could tell what I was talking about!" [...] And I added, to complete my reference, [...] "Since you thought Mrs. Server was the person whom, when I stopped you, I was sorry to learn from you I had missed." ...|$|R
6000|$|After tea {{she stood}} hesitating at <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf.</b> He took [...] "Tartarin de Tarascon". Again {{they sat on}} the bank of hay {{at the foot of the}} stack. He read a couple of pages, but without any heart for it. Again the dog came racing up to repeat the fun of the other day. He shoved his muzzle in the man's chest. Paul fingered his ear for a moment. Then he pushed him away.|$|E
60|$|He {{remembered the}} books of poetry upon his shelves at home. He had bought them in his {{bachelor}} days and many an evening, {{as he sat in}} the little room off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down from <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf</b> and read out something to his wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so the books had remained on their shelves. At times he repeated lines to himself and this consoled him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The charlatan {{is always}} the pioneer. From the astrologer came the astronomer, from the alchemist the chemist, from the mesmerist the {{experimental}} psychologist. The quack of yesterday is the professor of tomorrow. Even such subtle and elusive things as dreams will in time be reduced to system and order. When that time comes the researches of our friends on <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf</b> yonder {{will no longer be}} the amusement of the mystic, but the foundations of a science." ...|$|E
50|$|The Air University Press {{printed books}} on QAF {{subjects}} that {{were distributed to}} airmen worldwide. There were so many books {{that they are still}} easy to find upon <b>the</b> <b>bookshelves</b> of veterans and the libraries of airbases in 2016.|$|R
50|$|The {{library is}} built using {{recycled}} and locally sourced products. <b>The</b> <b>bookshelves</b> were even reused from a CASE’S previous project. The cladding inside was {{collected from the}} surrounding area, only high quality wood was bought from a nearby markets.|$|R
50|$|The {{so-called}} Dominikanerräume {{are part}} of the library's showrooms which are not open to public. They are so called because of <b>the</b> <b>bookshelves</b> from Bamberg's Dominican monastery that were brought to the library during the secularisation when the monastery was closed down.|$|R
60|$|They {{shook hands}} without more words. And {{presently}} Peter walked out, and James, with a guilty {{look over his}} shoulder, took down Sandy MacBean's great work from <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf</b> and began to study the photograph of the short approach-shot showing Mr. MacBean swinging from Point A, through dotted line B-C, to Point D, his head the while remaining rigid at the spot marked with a cross. He felt a little guiltily that he had stolen a march on his friend, and that the contest {{was as good as}} over.|$|E
6000|$|But when {{he opened}} the door of the chart-room he saw his captain reading a book. Captain MacWhirr was not lying down: he was {{standing}} up with one hand grasping the edge of <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf</b> and the other holding open before his face a thick volume. The lamp wriggled in the gimbals, the loosened books toppled from side to side on the shelf, the long barometer swung in jerky circles, the table altered its slant every moment. In the midst of all this stir and movement Captain MacWhirr, holding on, showed his eyes above the upper edge, and asked, [...] "What's the matter?" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the front}} room upstairs, where the dinner is laid out, there {{is a picture of}} Muffborough Castle; of the Earl of Muffborough, K.X., Lord-Lieutenant for Diddlesex; an engraving, from an almanac, of Saint Boniface College, Oxon; and a sticking-plaster {{portrait}} of Hugby when young, in a cap and gown. A copy of his 'Sermons to a Nobleman's Family' is on <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf,</b> by the 'Whole Duty of Man,' the Reports of the Missionary Societies, and the 'Oxford University Calendar.' Old Hugby knows part of this by heart; every living belonging to Saint Boniface, and the name of every tutor, fellow, nobleman, and undergraduate.|$|E
5000|$|Described by a {{reviewer}} as [...] "a {{thumbnail sketch}} biography {{of each of}} the infantry commanders {{who took part in the}} battle, from the brigade level up. ...should find a home on <b>the</b> <b>bookshelves</b> of those readers whose special interest is Gettysburg." ...|$|R

60|$|Through the curtained {{windows of}} the {{furnished}} apartment which Mrs. Horace Hignett had rented for her stay in New York rays of golden sunlight peeped in like the foremost spies of some advancing army. It was a fine summer morning. The hands of the Dutch clock in the hall pointed to thirteen minutes past nine; those of the ormolu clock in the sitting-room to eleven minutes past ten; those of the carriage clock on <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf</b> to fourteen minutes to six. In other words, it was exactly eight; and Mrs. Hignett acknowledged the fact by moving {{her head on the}} pillow, opening her eyes, and sitting up in bed. She always woke at eight precisely.|$|E
60|$|John {{nodded and}} withdrew. Walter Dene {{locked the door}} after him carefully, as he often did when writing sermons, and then lit a cigar, which was also a not {{infrequent}} concomitant of his exegetical labours. After that he walked once or twice {{up and down the}} room, paused a moment to look at his parchment-covered Rabelais and Villon on <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf,</b> peered out of the dulled glass windows with the crest in their centre, and finally drew a curious bent iron instrument out of his waistcoat pocket. With it in his hands, he went up quietly to his uncle's desk, and began fumbling at the lock in an experienced manner. As a matter of fact, it was not his first trial of skill in lock-picking; for Walter Dene was a painstaking and methodical man, and having made up his mind that he would get at and read his uncle's will, he took good care to begin by fastening all the drawers in his own bedroom, and trying his prentice hand at unfastening them again in the solitude of his chamber.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, my dear sir, I {{remembered the}} old coin perfectly, having been so very {{particular}} in my drawing and measurement; {{and the moment}} I clapped eyes on the other one yesterday, I said to my good friend Harbourne, here: 'Harbourne,' said I, 'somebody's been changing your Wulfric in the case over yonder for another specimen.' 'Changing it!' said Harbourne: 'not a bit of it; clipping it, you mean.' 'No, no, my good fellow,' said I: 'do you suppose I don't know the same coin again when I see it, and at my time of life too? This is another coin, not the same one clipped. It's bigger across than the old one from there to there.' 'No, it isn't,' says he. 'But it is,' I answer. 'Just you look in my [...] "Northumbrian and Mercian" [...] {{and see if it}} isn't so.' 'You must be mistaken,' says Harbourne. 'If I am, I'll eat my head,' says I. Well, we get down the 'Numismatist' from <b>the</b> <b>bookshelf</b> then and there; and sure enough, it turns out just as I told him. Harbourne turned as white as a ghost, I can tell you, as soon as he discovered it. 'Why,' says he, 'I've sent a poor young fellow off to Portland Prison, only three or four months ago, for stealing that very Wulfric.' And then he told me all the story. 'Very well,' said I, 'then the only thing you've got to do is just to go and call on him to-morrow, and let him know that you've had it proved to you, fairly proved to you, {{that this is not the}} original Wulfric.'" ...|$|E

50|$|At {{the library}} at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, teams needed to search <b>the</b> <b>bookshelves</b> for a marked book. They {{then had to}} use a stencil to outline certain letters {{in the book that}} would reveal a password, which they could use to get their next clue.|$|R
