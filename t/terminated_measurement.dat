40|$|In {{order to}} qualify a {{subscriber}} loops for xDSL transmission, basic parameters like transfer function, scattering parameter S 11 and characteristic impedance should be known. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present a test methodology for measurements of these basic parameters. The characteristic impedance is measured by open/short method and it is compared with the <b>terminated</b> <b>measurement</b> method defined in IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) 611156 - 1. Transfer function and scattering parameter S 11 of DSL loop are also measured on a real cable. The methodology is based on measurements of a 0. 4 mm, 10 pairs, balanced twisted-pair cable of 1400 m of length. In order to improve the analysis of results, we compared the measurements from real cable with results from wireline simulators. The measurement of parameters of xDSL copper loop is done in an infrastructure set up in the LABIT (Technological Innovation in Telecommunications Lab) at UFPA (Federal University of Para), that consist of a wireline simulators, a precision impedance analyzer, and a network analyzer. The results show a difference between the measurements performed with real cables and wireline simulators for transfer function parameter. Characteristic impedance obtained by both methods presented quite similar results...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of high-energy cosmic rays above {{a few hundred}} TeV is realized by the observation of extensive air-showers. By using the multi-detector setup of KASCADE-Grande, energy spectrum, elemental composition, and anisotropies of high-energy cosmic rays in the energy range from below the knee up to 2 EeV are investigated. In addition, the large high-quality data set permits distinct tests {{of the validity of}} hadronic interaction models used in interpreting air-shower measurements.

50|$|The end point, {{which occurs}} {{when there are}} no more {{chloride}} ions with which silver ions may react, is detected by a pair of silver microelectrodes in the solution, which is connected in series with a microammeter. The increasing concentration of silver ions creates a current between the microelectrodes, activating a switch that shuts off power to the main electrodes and the timer, <b>terminating</b> the <b>measurement.</b> The duration of the titration is the titration time , which is proportional to the amount of silver ions released, and hence to the amount of chloride in the assay solution.|$|R

Quantum algorithms may also be stated in other models of quantum computation, such as the Hamiltonian oracle model.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this thesis has been to {{experimentally}} study the secondary electron emission of diamond films; to identify materials and process parameters producing a high performance dynode for novel fast imaging photomultiplier designs. Material investigations and performance measurements were made to measure the effect of film thickness, substrate, surface termination, dopant concentration and crystallinity; {{in order to identify}} the optimum parameters for dynode manufacture and performance. In addition, a novel gain structure for two dimensional imaging using a diamond-coated image charge dynode in combination with a transparent mesh, was investigated by simulation and experimentally. Experimental work involved 65 CVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition) diamond samples on silicon, molybdenum, niobium substrates or free standing, micro- nano- crystalline and hydrogen or cesium terminated. The secondary electron (SE) yield was found to be far lower than the results found in the literature. Several hypotheses regarding the sample’s low SE yield measured have been considered, for example charge mobility could be reduced due to grain boundaries, high amounts of boron impurities, surface contamination and/or low electron affinity. The main cause identified, after bad quality films was the negative electron affinity of the surface produced when hydrogen <b>terminated.</b> <b>Measurements</b> have indicated that the majority of samples were not fully hydrogen terminated and thus could not produce the potentially high SE yield. The hydrogen termination has also shown to desorb under beam irradiation causing a problem of repeatability of the measurements. However, despite the poor results an interesting phenomenon has been measured: three time domains were observed on the SE yields during beam irradiation. These three processes correspond to different phases of trapping holes, electrons and hydrogen desorption. They have helped to better understand what happens during the process of secondary electron emission of diamond and could be used to determine the initial yield independent of the termination lost when modelling...|$|R

The <b>measurements</b> <b>terminated</b> when agreed-upon environmental protocols ended. The decade-long deployment of the acoustic source showed that the observations are sustainable on even a modest budget. The transmissions have been verified to provide an accurate measurement of ocean temperature on the acoustic paths, with uncertainties that are far smaller than any other approach to ocean temperature measurement.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} noninertial {{cavitation}} that occurs beyond the zone {{close to the}} horn tip to which the inertial cavitation is confined. The noninertial cavitation is characterized by collating the data {{from a range of}} measurements of bubbles trapped on a solid surface in this noninertial zone. Specifically, the electrochemical measurement of mass transfer to an electrode is compared with high-speed video of the bubble oscillation. This gas bubble is shown to be a “noninertial” event by electrochemical surface erosion measurements and “ring-down” experiments showing the activity and motion of the bubble as the sound excitation was <b>terminated.</b> These <b>measurements</b> enable characterization of the complex environment produced below an operating ultrasonic horn outside of the region where inertial collapse can be detected. The extent to which solid boundaries in the liquid cause the frequencies and shapes of oscillatory modes on the bubble wall to differ from their free field values is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} importance of entropy and direct combustion noise in turbopropulsion systems and the parameters upon which these noise sources depend were studied. Theory and experiment were employed to determine that at least with the apparatus used here, entropy noise can dominate combustion noise {{if there is a}} sufficient pressure gradient <b>terminating</b> the combustor. <b>Measurements</b> included combustor interior fluctuating pressure, near and far field fluctuating pressure, and combustor exit plane fluctuating temperatures, as well as mean pressures and temperatures.

40|$|This thesis explores {{methods for}} low {{frequency}} measurements of both linear and non-linear systems, {{as well as}} methods for combining individual limited frequency range measurements to calculate the full range impulse response of linear systems. Some of the advantages that a successful development of such methods will cause, are more effective subwoofer measurements and better signal-to-noise ratio properties of building acoustics measurements. It is impossible to terminate the stimulus of sine sweep measurements at frequencies below the Nyquist frequency without introducing damaging errors, like the effects of noise blow-up, to the measurement results. The main focus of the work has been {{to find ways to}} avoid or remove these errors. It was found that measuring the impulse response of a system using three frequency bands to cover the total frequency range can be done effectively and with very satisfying results. However, if octave band limited frequency range measurements shall be used, the time variance influence will limit the measurement correctness. Accurate techniques for both linear and non-linear low frequency measurements were found, using a new deconvolution technique that removes the noise blow-up effects caused by <b>terminating</b> the <b>measurement</b> sweep at low frequencies. Finally, great possibilities of controling and adjusting the signal-to-noise ratio properties were obtained by using limited frequency range measurements with individually calculated time durations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Rather {{than make}} a {{classification}} decision (pass/fail, below basic/basic/proficient/advanced) {{for an individual}} after administering a fixed number of items, {{it is possible to}} sequentially select items to maximize information, update the estimated classification probabilities and then evaluate whether there is enough information to <b>terminate</b> testing. In <b>measurement</b> this is frequently called adaptive or tailored testing. In statistics, this is called sequential testing. Much of the research on adaptive testing has centered on the use of Item Response Theory as the underlying model. While very attractive and widely used, IRT is fairly complex and relies on several fairly restrictive assumptions. Decision theory provides an alternative underlying model for sequential testing and was probably first applied as an adaptive procedure for educational testing by Ferguson (1969). Key articles in the mastery testing literature of the 1970 s employed decision theory (Hambleton and Novick, 1973; Huynh, 1976; van de...|$|R
40|$|Acute seizure (AS) {{activity}} {{in old age}} has an increased predisposition for evolving into temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Furthermore, spontaneous seizures and cognitive dysfunction after AS activity are often intense in the aged population than in young adults. This {{could be due to}} an increased vulnerability of inhibitory interneurons in the aged hippocampus to AS activity. We investigated this issue by comparing the survival of hippocampal GABA-ergic interneurons that contain the neuropeptide Y (NPY) or the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) between young adult (5 -months old) and aged (22 -months old) F 344 rats at 12 days after three-hours of AS activity. Graded intraperitoneal injections of the kainic acid (KA) induced AS activity and a diazepam injection at 3 hours after the onset <b>terminated</b> AS-activity. <b>Measurement</b> of interneuron numbers in different hippocampal subfields revealed that NPY+ interneurons were relatively resistant to AS {{activity in}} the aged hippocampus in comparison to the young adult hippocampus. Whereas, PV+ interneurons were highly susceptible to AS activity in both age groups. However, as aging alone substantially depleted these populations, the aged hippocampus after three-hours of AS activity exhibited 48 % reductions in NPY+ interneurons and 70 % reductions in PV+ interneurons, in comparison to the young hippocampus after similar AS activity. Thus, AS activity-induced TLE in old age is associated with far fewer hippocampal NPY+ and PV+ interneuron numbers than AS-induced TLE in the young adult age. This discrepanc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a one-port method for estimating model parameters of VNA calibration standards. The method involves measuring the standards through an asymmetrical passive network connected in direct mode {{and then in}} reverse mode, and using these measurements to compute the S-parameters of the network. The free parameters of the calibration standards are estimated by minimizing a figure of merit based on the expected equality of the S-parameters of the network when used in direct and reverse modes. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated through simulations, and real measurements are used to estimate the actual offset delay of a 50 -Ω calibration load that is assigned zero delay by the manufacturer. The estimated delay is 38. 8 ps with a 1 σ uncertainty of 2. 1 ps for this particular load. This result is verified through <b>measurements</b> of a <b>terminated</b> airline. The <b>measurements</b> agree better with theoretical models of the airline when the reference plane is calibrated using the new estimate for the load delay. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables.

40|$|The first kicker {{concept design}} [1] for beam {{deflection}} was constructed to allow stripline plates to be driven; thus directing, or kicking, the electron beam into two subse-quent beam lines. This quad-driven stripline kicker is an eight port electromagnetic network {{and consists of}} two actively driven plates and two <b>terminated</b> plates. Electro-magnetic <b>measurements</b> performed on the bi-kicker [2] and quad-kicker were designed to determine: (1) the qual-ity of the fabrication of the kicker, including component alignments; (2) quantification of the input feed transition regions from the input coax to the driven kicker plates; (3) identification of properties of the kicker itself without involving {{the effects of the}} electron beam; (4) coupling between a line current source and the plates of the kicker; and (5) the effects on the driven current to simulate an electron beam through the body of the kicker. Included in this are the angular variations inside the kicker to examine modal distributions. The goal of the simulated beam was to allow curved path and changing radius studies to be per-formed electromagnetically. The cold test results pro-duced were then incorporated into beam models [3]. ...|$|R

40|$|Two LHC {{injection}} kicker magnet systems must {{produce a}} kick of 1. 3 T. m {{each with a}} flattop duration of 4. 25 mu s or 6. 5 mu s, a rise time of 900 ns, and a fall time of 3 mu s. The ripple in the field must be less than +or- 0. 5 The electrical circuit of the complete system has been simulated with PSpice. The model includes a 66 kV resonant charging power supply (RCPS), a 5 Omega pulse forming network (PFN), a terminated 5 Omega kicker magnet, and all known parasitic quantities. Component selection for the PEN was {{made on the basis}} of models in which a theoretical field ripple of less than +or- 0. 1 as attained. A prototype 66 kV RCPS was built at TRIUMF and shipped to CERN. A prototype 5 Omega system including a PFN, thyratron switches, and terminating resistors, was built at CERN. The system (without a kicker magnet) was assembled as designed without trimming of any PFN component values. The PFN was charged to 60 kV via the RCPS operating at 0. 1 Hz. The thyratron timing was adjusted to provide a 30 kV, 5. 5 mu s duration pulse on a 5 Omega <b>terminating</b> resistor. <b>Measurement</b> data is presented for the prototype PFN, connected to resistive terminators. A procedure has been developed for compensating the probe and oscilloscope amplifier calibration errors. The top of the 30 kV pulse is flat to +or- 0. 3 after an initial oscillation of 600 ns total duration. The post-pulse period is flat to within +or- 0. 1 after approximately 600 ns from the bottom of the falling edge of the pulse. A calculation was performed in which a measured 27. 5 kV pulse with a 5. 5 mu s flattop was fed into a PSpice model of a kicker magnet with a 690 ns delay length. The resultant predicted kick rise time, from 0. 2 to 99. 8, is 834 ns and the fall time 2. 94 mu s, for a field pulse with a flattop of 4. 69 mu s and a ripple of less than +or- 0. 2 (12 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|Background Successful {{cannulation}} of {{the common}} bile duct (CBD) remains the benchmark for ERCP. Use of a pancreatic duct (PD) stent to facilitate biliary cannulation has been described, {{although the majority of}} patients require precut sphincterotomy to achieve CBD cannulation. Objective To report the performance characteristics of using a PD stent in conjunction with physician-controlled wire-guided cannulation (WGC) to facilitate bile duct cannulation. Design Retrospective cohort. Setting Two tertiary care, academic medical centers. Patients All undergoing ERCP with native papillae. Intervention In cases of difficult biliary access in which the PD is cannulated, a pancreatic stent is placed. After this, physician-controlled WGC is attempted by using the PD stent to direct the sphincterotome into the biliary orifice. If cannulation is unsuccessful after several minutes, a precut sphincterotomy is performed over the PD stent or the procedure is <b>terminated.</b> Main Outcome <b>Measurements</b> Frequency of successful bile duct cannulation and precut sphincterotomy. Results A total of 2345 ERCPs were identified, 1544 with native papillae. Among these, CBD and PD cannulation failed in 16 (1. 0 %) patients, whereas 76 (4. 9 %) patients received a PD stent to facilitate biliary cannulation. Successful cannulation was achieved in 71 (93. 4 %) of 76 patients, 60 (78. 9 %) of whom did not require precut sphincterotomy. Complications included mild post-ERCP pancreatitis in 4 (5. 3 %) and aspiration in 1 (1. 3 %). Precut sphincterotomy was complicated by hemorrhage, controlled during the procedure in 2 (13. 3 %) of 15.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a second season of field measurements undertaken {{to characterize the}} seasonal ice decay of landfast first year sea ice. The project was conducted from 14 May to 28 June 2001. The depth of the snow cover and the thickness, temperature and salinity of the ice were measured on a near-daily basis during that time. The ice thickness between mid-May and early June ranged from 1. 30 to 1. 45 m. A borehole jack assembly {{was used to measure}} the in situ confined compressive strength (borehole strength) of the ice from 14 May to 11 June. More than one hundred borehole jack tests were conducted at ice depths 0. 3, 0. 6, 0. 9 and 1. 2 m. No significant ice ablation occurred during the time that the borehole jack tests were conducted. Strength measurements from the two, sequential years of testing indicated that the ice underwent four well-defined stages of strength reduction. Stage I extended from 14 May to 20 May during which the ice lost from 25 to 30 % of its strength. Stage II occurred from 20 May to 3 June and was characterized by two weeks of stable ice strength measurements. Stage III occurred from 3 June to 2 July, during which the ice further lost 65 to 80 % of its strength. The final stage, Stage IV, extended from early to late July (at which point <b>measurements</b> <b>terminated).</b> During Stage IV, strength throughout the full ice thickness reached a stable value of 2 to 3 MPa. Strength measurements showed that ice characterized by Stage IV had only 80 to 90 % of its full winter strength. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
