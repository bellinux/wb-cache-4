He also predicted that scientific progress would end soon.|$|E
5|$|Purnell, Parsons, Tibbets, Spaatz, and LeMay met on Guam {{that same}} day to discuss {{what should be done}} next. Since there was no {{indication}} of Japan surrendering, they decided to proceed with dropping another bomb. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have it ready by August 11, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if the bomb could be readied by August 9. Parsons agreed <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
25|$|The USSR {{seemed to}} have {{completed}} {{the formation of a}} monolithic Soviet bloc and concluded the partition of Europe, which appeared to vindicate and certainly crystallized the pessimistic, darkest appraisals of Soviet power in the West by people who felt certain that it was folly <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business with Moscow. Because its impact was equally profound in Western Europe as in the United States, it helped unify Western countries against the Communist bloc. It gave an air of prescience to the French and Italian governments for having forced their local Communists out of their governments a year earlier.|$|E

500|$|Plans for {{a sequel}} to The Expendables were in place before the film's release in August 2010; Stallone said, [...] "I have an idea ready to go...I'm going <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} that's quite radical". In an interview in August 2010 he noted {{that he did not}} have a new script yet, but [...] "It's plotted out in my mind's eye." [...] On April 18, 2011, Stallone confirmed that he would not be repeating his directing duties in The Expendables, making a list of directors to serve as his replacement. In April 2011, the film was given a scheduled release date of August 17, 2012 and a teaser poster for the film was released at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. In June 2011, Simon West was confirmed as director.|$|E
500|$|Valery Krylov, {{advisor to}} Anatoly Karpov and a {{specialist}} in the [...] "psycho-physiological rehabilitation of sportsmen", believed Fischer suffered from schizophrenia. Psychologist Joseph G Ponterotto, from second-hand sources, concludes that [...] "Bobby did not meet all the necessary criteria to reach diagnoses of schizophrenia or Asperger syndrome. The evidence is stronger for paranoid personality disorder." [...] Magnús Skúlason, a chess player and a psychiatrist and head doctor of Sogn Mental Asylum for the Criminally Insane, befriended Fischer {{toward the end of}} Fischer's life. From Endgame, Fischer's 2011 biography by Frank Brady: Skulason was not [...] "Bobby's psychiatrist", as has been implied in the general press, nor did he offer Bobby any analysis or psychotherapy. He was at Bobby's bedside as a friend, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything he could for him. Because of his training, however, he couldn't fail to take note of Bobby's mental condition. [...] "He definitely was not schizophrenic", Skulason said. [...] "He had problems, possibly certain childhood traumas that had affected him. He was misunderstood. Underneath I think he was a caring sensitive person." ...|$|E
5000|$|Clark {{was finally}} {{released}} in mid-July, and Whitesell was called back {{up for the}} third time in the season to replace him on July 16. Asked what he had been told by Diamondbacks management, Whitesell responded: [...] "I just know that ... the first base job for 2010 is up for the taking, so I'm going to get a fair opportunity." [...] He added that his game plan was <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> [...] "relax and let the game come to me, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> too much, and let your mind take you six different ways at once — where you just relax, and know it's the same game you've been playing the whole time, the game will come to you, and success will come." ...|$|R

500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, Parker and Stone {{received}} feedback that audiences felt [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] was especially unkind to Struthers. Although {{they did not}} speak to her themselves, the duo received word that Struthers was {{a fan of the}} show until [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] aired, after which she was very upset and reportedly reacted emotionally over her portrayal. Struthers was particularly saddened by the fact that her character steals food from the same starving children she had been working to help. Parker and Stone were slightly remorseful when they learned of her reaction and have said they did not have anything against Struthers personally. Nevertheless, Struthers was portrayed in an even less flattering way in the third season episode [...] "Starvin' Marvin in Space" [...] as a Jabba the Hutt-like creature. In a DVD commentary track, Parker said of Struthers, [...] "Dude, you're really setting yourself up if you're going to be that fat and go on the air talking about [...] ... We don't think she's a bad person, she's probably nice <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, but cut down on the Twinkies a little bit before going on the air." ...|$|E

[...] He informs Billy that fifteen years have passed on Earth since the former barker's suicide, and {{suggests}} that Billy can get himself into heaven if he helps his daughter, Louise. [...] He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her (instrumental ballet: [...] "Billy Makes a Journey"). Louise has grown up to be lonely and bitter. [...] The local children ostracize her because her father was a thief and a wife-beater. [...] In the dance, a young ruffian, much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as too young. [...] The dance concludes, and Billy is anxious to return to Earth and help his daughter. [...] He steals a star to take with him, as the Starkeeper pretends not to notice.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell explained how the season would interact with Agent Carter saying, [...] "Agent Carter {{seems to be}} about SSR pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics, and it gives {{us an opportunity to}} return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that SSR stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we’re going <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart." [...] Ultimately, the opening scene of [...] "Shadows" [...] serves as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter with the inclusion of Atwell as Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including the then unconfirmed involvement of Howard Stark, who is mentioned in the scene, as well as Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

500|$|Talking on how {{the season}} would {{interact}} with Agent Carter, Bell said, [...] "Here's what I think is interesting.

The episode [...] "Making Friends and Influencing People" [...] names Hydra's ability to brainwash people as the Faustus Method, named for the character who appears, as Johann Fennhoff, in Agent Carter, played by Ralph Brown.|$|E
