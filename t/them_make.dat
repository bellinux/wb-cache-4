5|$|Ofotbanen {{lost their}} license from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate on 7October 2008. This was because Ofotbanen had not {{documented}} necessary accounts for 2007, nor provided evidence of necessary liquidity. On 24October, {{the company was}} declared bankrupt. Rail Management subsequently established the new company Ofotbanen Drift, and stated {{that the cause of}} the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let <b>them</b> <b>make</b> a private placement of NOK10 million.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help <b>them</b> <b>make</b> the best decision based on their own values.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} bankruptcy, Rail Management {{established}} a new company, Ofotbanen Drift AS, {{to take over}} the estate in bankruptcy. They also stated that the cause of the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let <b>them</b> <b>make</b> a private placement of NOK 10 million. The new company received an operation and safety licence from the inspectorate in January 2009, and plans to start operation again in February. On 9 April 2010, the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate withdrew Ofotbanen's operating certificate because it was not economically sound to operate. The company filed for bankruptcy in May, after the Norwegian Tax Administration could not claim NOK700,000 in due taxes.|$|E
5|$|Special Stages are {{entered by}} finding giant rings hidden in secret passageways: the player {{is placed in}} a 3D {{environment}} and must turn all {{of a number of}} blue spheres red by running through them, but must avoid all red spheres, including formerly blue ones. Yellow spheres bounce the player long distances, and white spheres with red stars on <b>them</b> <b>make</b> the player walk backwards in the opposite direction. Completing a Special Stage earns the player a Chaos Emerald; collecting all seven Emeralds allows the player to turn into Super Sonic or Super Knuckles, more powerful versions of the characters.|$|E
5|$|By 2November, all owners, {{except the}} two {{environmental}} organizations the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, had sold their shares to NSB. The two environmental organizations owned 7 of 40,000 {{shares of the}} company. At the general meeting the same day, the company was liquidated, even though the two organizations opposed. Prior to the meeting, the other minority owners had held a tactics meeting to discuss what to do. Several municipalities were concerned that they would lose even more money {{if they did not}} sell. The other minority owners agreed to cover the costs of the two environmental organizations, and let <b>them</b> <b>make</b> the principal stand to oppose the liquidation.|$|E

5|$|Sometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in Central Park. Gekko {{physically}} assaults Bud as he berates him for {{his role}} with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping <b>them</b> <b>make</b> a case against Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building downtown to answer for the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence. Carl tells him he did right in saving the airline. The film ends with Bud going up {{the steps of the}} courthouse, knowing that while he is likely going to prison and his career is ruined, he now has a clear conscience.|$|E
5|$|The game {{starts with}} a {{character}} creation screen where the player can choose items for their playable character, such as their physical appearance, race and creed. The player can choose to play {{as one of the}} eleven available classes: fighter, barbarian, paladin, ranger, wizard, druid, monk, priest, rogue, chanter and cipher. Each of <b>them</b> <b>make</b> the gameplay different; for example, the cipher can use the soul of an enemy in order to attack them, and druids can shapeshift into a beast and cast spells. The protagonist's class can also influence the number of available dialogue options. The player may adventure with up to five other characters {{out of a total of}} eight that they can pick up on their travels. These are fleshed out characters with unique personalities and appearances. Additionally, the protagonist can hire party members which the player creates in local taverns, but at a monetary cost.|$|E

25|$|The Boston and Lowell {{was faced}} with a new problem; it had a {{reputation}} for speed which made it very popular and highly competitive with stagecoaches. Many people wanted to go not only from Lowell to Boston but to places in between. The Boston and Lowell ordered another locomotive and cars for local passenger rail in 1842, and had <b>them</b> <b>make</b> six stops along the route. Passenger rail proved to be almost as profitable as freight.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, Burns and Allen adopted two children, Sandra Jean and Ronald Jon, after {{discovering}} {{they could not}} conceive on their own.

Ronnie eventually joined the cast of his parents' television show, playing George and Gracie's son, a serious drama student who disdained comedy. Sandy, by contrast, made only occasional appearances on the show (usually as a telephone operator, waitress, secretary, or clerk,) and left show business to become a teacher.|$|E

25|$|The Indians {{released}} him during spring training and {{he signed with}} the New York Mets on March 25, 1999. Hershiser made 32 starts with the Mets and was 13–12 with a 4.58 ERA. He served as a mentor to the young pitchers on the Mets staff and helped <b>them</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs by allowing just one run in 5 1/3 innings in a 2–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the last game of the season. He pitched out of the bullpen in the playoffs as the Mets lost to the Braves in the 1999 National League Championship Series.|$|E
25|$|Two {{charge states}} of this defect, neutral N-V0 and {{negative}} N-V−, are known from spectroscopic studies using optical absorption, photoluminescence (PL), {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR) and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), which {{can be viewed as}} a hybrid of PL and EPR; most details of the structure originate from EPR. A nitrogen atom has five valence electrons. Three of them covalently bond to the carbon atoms and two remain non-bonded and are called a lone pair. The vacancy has three unpaired electrons. Two of <b>them</b> <b>make</b> a quasi covalent bond and one remains unpaired. The overall symmetry, however, is axial (trigonal C3V); one can visualize this by imagining the three unpaired vacancy electrons continuously exchanging their roles.|$|E

Atomic chose to pursue a 2x profit margin on their flowers (Harry M. wanted a 3x profit margin, but Hannah and Gbemi ignored him), while Kinetic went for a 3x margin. Despite Atomic getting two business deals and a separate £150 sale by Harry M., helping them to a profit of £450.96, Kinetic's higher margins helped <b>them</b> <b>make</b> a profit of £463.52.|$|E
