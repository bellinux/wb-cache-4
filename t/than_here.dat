25|$|On June 23, 2013, Talk a Good Game {{opened on}} the UK R Albums Chart at number seven, besting {{previous}} album Here I Am (2011) by one chart position. However, on the UK Albums Chart, Talk a Good Game failed to match Here I Ams peak position of forty-three, only managing to debut at number eighty. As a result, it became Rowland's lowest charting album in the UK to date. In the US, Talk a Good Game debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number four, having sold 68,000copies; it became Rowland's third top-ten album, though sold 9,000copies fewer <b>than</b> <b>Here</b> I Am. Talk a Good Game also debuted at number four on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums, failing to match Here I Ams peak of number one. In its second week, the album dropped to number 11. As of December 2013, Talk a Good Game has sold 215,000 copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The reviewers {{generally}} {{praised the}} music in the episode. Votta wrote that [...] "musically this episode {{was one of the}} season's overall strongest", though Flandez made reference to the [...] "humdrum holiday songs". Sullivan pointed out that it was [...] "about the songs and only the songs", and Kubicek felt it was a [...] "blatant" [...] attempt to sell Christmas albums. Chaney noted that the opening number, [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", [...] "sounded much more vibrant and fresh with Mercedes" [...] on lead, Futterman called it [...] "utterly joyful", and it was the favorite song of the episode for Martin and Stanhope. Votta declared that [...] "Amber Riley shines throughout the episode, but none more <b>than</b> <b>here</b> where she commands attention", and Sullivan called it a [...] "nice rendition" [...] that was nevertheless presented with [...] "some incredibly awkward cuts from the original song".|$|E
500|$|Recent {{assessments}} of the album have been mostly positive, with AllMusic and Blender giving the album five stars, their highest ratings. AllMusic's Steve Huey compared the album to Here Come the Warm Jets, writing [...] "not quite as enthusiastic as Here Come the Warm Jets, Taking Tiger Mountain is made accessible through Eno's mastery of pop song structure". Douglas Wolk of Blender had rated it more highly <b>than</b> <b>Here</b> Come the Warm Jets, calling it [...] "more immediately likeable". Select gave the album a {{four out of five}} rating, calling it [...] "excellent" [...] and described the songs [...] "Mother Whale Eyeless", [...] "Put A Straw Under Baby" [...] and [...] "Third Uncle" [...] as highlights. Chris Jones of BBC Music called Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) [...] "a work of genius because it didn't know the meaning of repetition" [...] and [...] "merely took Warm Jets and refined it into a smoother lump of oddness." ...|$|E

500|$|In this list, {{an island}} {{is defined as}} [...] "land that is {{surrounded}} by seawater on a daily basis, but not necessarily at all stages of the tide, excluding human devices such as bridges and causeways". Haswell-Smith (2004) uses [...] "an Island {{is a piece of}} land or group of pieces of land which is entirely surrounded by water at Lowest Astronomical Tide and to which there is no permanent means of dry access". [...] This consciously excludes bridged islands, which most other sources include.|group=Note}} A complication relating to membership of this list is that there are various descriptions of the scope of the Hebrides, the large group of islands that lie off Scotland's west coast. The Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland describes the Inner Hebrides as lying [...] "east of The Minch", which would include any and all offshore islands. There are various islands that lie in the sea lochs such as Eilean Bàn and Eilean Donan that might not ordinarily be described as [...] "Hebridean" [...] but no formal definitions exist and for simplicity they are included in the List of Inner Hebrides rather <b>than</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As we briefly lay {{aside the}} {{problems}} and the promises confronting our nation today to memorialize the supreme tragedy of {{more than forty years}} ago, there is no more appropriate location in which to do this <b>than</b> <b>here</b> in the Capitol Rotunda. [...] This Rotunda is the symbol of all that the unspeakable crimes of the Holocaust tried to eliminate: human rights, individual liberties, the independence of nations living in freedom.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{positive}} review, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that the}} album emphasizes [...] "the wily lothario of yore" [...] in response to [...] "Usher fans disappointed by the change in direction his wedding inspired". Andrew Rennie of Now wrote, [...] "his sixth album proves that his ability to make grown-up hits is stronger than ever." [...] Billboards Gail Mitchell called it [...] "a more cohesive collection" [...] <b>than</b> <b>Here</b> I Stand, [...] "centered on the different sides that comprise the artist".|$|E

2500|$|The Burial of the Count of Orgaz is {{regarded}} as the first completely personal work by the artist. There are no longer any references to Roman or Venetian formulas or motifs. He has succeeded in eliminating any description of space. There is no ground, no horizon, no sky and no perspective. Accordingly, there is no conflict, and a convincing expression of a supernatural space is achieved. According to Harold Wethey, the supernatural vision of Gloria (“Heaven”) above and the impressive array of portraits represent all aspects of this extraordinary genius's art. Wethey also asserts that [...] "El Greco's Mannerist method of composition is nowhere more clearly expressed <b>than</b> <b>here,</b> where all of the action takes place in the frontal plane".|$|E
