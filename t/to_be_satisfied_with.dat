25|$|Activity theory, in {{contrast}} to disengagement theory, implies that the more active elderly people are, {{the more likely they}} are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> life. The view that elderly adults should maintain well-being by keeping active has had a considerable history and since 1972, this has come to be known as activity theory. However, this theory may be just as inappropriate as disengagement for some people as the current paradigm on the psychology of ageing is that both disengagement theory and activity theory may be optimal for certain people in old age, depending on both circumstances and personality traits of the individual concerned. There are also data which query whether, as activity theory implies, greater social activity is linked with well-being in adulthood.|$|E

25|$|Ethical {{vegetarian}} {{concerns have}} become more widespread in developed countries, particularly because of the spread of factory farming, more open and graphic documentation of what human meat-eating entails for the animal, and environmental consciousness. Some proponents of meat-eating argue that the current mass demand for meat has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> a mass-production system, regardless of the welfare of animals. Less radical proponents argue that practices like well-managed free-range rearing and the consumption of hunted animals, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could satisfy the demand for mass-produced meat. Reducing the worldwide massive food waste would also contribute to reduce meat waste and therefore save animals. Indeed, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, {{about a third of}} the food for human consumption is wasted globally (around 1.3 billion tons per year).|$|E

Nepal won the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three held in Bermuda and qualified for the 2014 World Cup Qualifier.

25|$|Although queen {{selection}} {{is not fully}} understood, workers clearly {{have an important role}} in the queen elimination process. Workers often test queens, and depending on the queens’ response, the workers may remove them from the colony. It has been suggested that workers discriminate between queens based on their relative fertility. Workers seem to identify the more fecund queens through various behavioral tests and dismiss any queens with inhibited ovaries. Queen size could be an additional determinant in queen selection. Since size differences between queens and workers increase as the colony ages, smaller queens could be eliminated to create this morphological gap. This selection process also correlates with the fact that a colony’s queen population decreases as the colony ages. Colonies begin to gain more queens once they have reached a minimum queen population. The new queens usually reproduce in the old colony, which lowers relatedness. Swarming occurs afterwards, frequently during the queen-reduction cycle. The dissociation between queen cycle and the colony cycle allows worker interests <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> respect to the timing of queen and male production, without sacrificing the ability to initiate new colonies at appropriate times. Workers prefer this selective pattern of queen emergence because they are three times more closely related to their sisters than to other brothers on single-queen colonies. Workers are equally related to the nieces and nephews that make up most of the brood on multiple-queen colonies.|$|E

Henrik Bertilsson became Allsvenskan's top goalscorer in 1993 with 18 goals, sharing the top spot with Trelleborgs FF's Mats Lilienberg, this helped the club to a 5th place. The club ended up in 7th place in 1994 and Henrik Bertillson left for French FC Martigues, it went better for the youth squad as they reached the final in the youth championship, but Djurgårdens IF proved to strong and won with 1–0. 1995 became a hard year for Halmstads BK supporters to forget as they {{for the first time ever}} won Svenska Cupen and the club ended up in 3rd place, winning Lilla Silvret, but it was the home match against Parma F.C. in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup that drew most attention as Halmstads BK won with 3–0 on Gamla Ullevi in Gothenburg, however the returned ended with a major defeat, 4–0 to Parma. Tom Prahl took over as manager in 1996 and lead the team to a 7th place in Allsvenskan and in the first round of the UEFA Cup Newcastle United proved the stronger team.

When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth-season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, [...] "That's a Peter Roth issue" [...] (chief executive of Warner Bros. Television). To which Roth responded, [...] "We have no plans to give viewers closure this season because we expect the series to continue". In late January 2012, Fox and Warner Bros. Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show. Before the announcement of the fifth season, Wyman and Pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for the end of the fourth season should the show be cancelled; Wyman stated [...] "We want to take care of the fans.
