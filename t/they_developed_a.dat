5|$|In 1898, Bresslau met {{her future}} husband, Albert Schweitzer at a wedding. Shortly thereafter, <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> {{relationship}} that included separation, independence, and non-exclusive behaviors. This allowed both {{to develop their}} lives while enjoying each other's companionship, conversation, and virtues. The one thing that united the pair was their shared ideology: {{to take care of}} others.|$|E
5|$|Madonna became {{interested}} in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> number of songs for the album, but {{the basis of the}} development was Pharrell Williams' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to her this was not intentional and happened while she {{was in the process of}} developing the album.|$|E

A casting call advertisement in Backstage magazine was prepared by the directors and Donahue, Williams, and Leonard were cast. The film entered production in October 1997, with the principal photography taking place in Maryland for eight days. About twenty hours of footage was shot and was edited down to eighty-two minutes.|$|E

After establishing a fanbase with their 2001 debut The Unraveling, Rise Against wanted to record an album that distinguished themselves from other Fat Wreck Chords bands of the time. They chose Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore to produce the album, with whom <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> strong rapport. Recording took place from November to December 2002 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado.|$|E
5|$|A C Benson was {{a friend}} of Henry James, to whom Walpole wrote a fan letter late in 1908, with Benson's encouragement. A {{correspondence}} ensued and in February 1909 James invited Walpole to lunch at the Reform Club in London. <b>They</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> close friendship, described by James's biographer Leon Edel as resembling a father and son relationship in some, but not all, respects. James was greatly taken with the young Walpole, though clear-eyed about the deficiencies in the artistry and craftsmanship of his protégé's early efforts. According to Somerset Maugham, Walpole made a sexual proposition to James, who was too inhibited to respond. Nevertheless, in their correspondence the older man's devotion was couched in extravagant terms.|$|E

5|$|After judicious self-experiments, Shulgin enlisted a {{small group}} of friends with whom he {{regularly}} tested his creations, starting in 1960. <b>They</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> systematic way of ranking the effects of the various drugs, known as the Shulgin Rating Scale, with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. He personally tested hundreds of drugs, mainly analogues of various phenethylamines (family containing MDMA, mescaline, and the 2C* family), and tryptamines (family containing DMT and psilocin). There are a seemingly infinite number of slight chemical variations, which can produce variations in effect — some pleasant and some unpleasant, depending on the person, substance, and situation — all of which are meticulously recorded in Shulgin's lab notebooks. Shulgin published many of these objective and subjective reports in his books and papers.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{civil war}} in the Arab Empire the Umayyads came to power under Muawiyah I. Under the Umayyads the conquest of the {{remaining}} Byzantine and northern Berber territories in North Africa was completed and the Arabs were able to move across large parts of the Berber world, invading Visigothic Spain through the Strait of Gibraltar, under the command of the allegedly Berber general Tariq ibn-Ziyad. But this happened only after <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> naval power of their own, and they conquered and destroyed the Byzantine stronghold of Carthage between 695698. The loss of Africa meant that soon, Byzantine control of the Western Mediterranean was challenged by a new and expanding Arab fleet, operating from Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|Illustrator and {{designer}} Kory Heinzen worked on pre-visualization, concept and character design {{on the video}} game , developed by Naughty Dog. Heinzen's initial concept differed from the finished character. The production staff drew inspiration from the pulp adventure genre when creating the video games in the Uncharted series, and based Drake on the stereotypical characters of adventure films and novels, giving him wit, resourcefulness, and strong principles. Naughty Dog wanted to highlight Drake's personality through his interactions with the environment during gameplay. To do this, <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> wide range of animations for Drake, allowing him to display reactions and his snarky disposition in context. These animations were designed to be fluid and believable; they removed any animation that did not promote this fluidity or took {{a large amount of}} time to execute. The blended animation system in the game, with more than 30animations comprising one movement, was implemented to make Drake a more relatable character.|$|E

5|$|In 1952 she met Nicholas Heron, {{with whom}} she entered into a relationship. An engraver, {{photographer}} and former journalist for the Brighton Argus, he shared her interest in the occult, and together <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> magical system based upon Luciferianism, the veneration of the deity Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom they {{considered to be a}} benevolent angelic deity. In 1956, they founded the Order of the Morning Star, or Ordo Stella Matutina (OSM), propagating it through a correspondence course. The couple sent out lessons to those who paid the necessary fees over a series of weeks, eventually leading to the twelfth lesson, which contained The Book of Lumiel, a short work written by Montalban that documented her understanding of Lumiel, or Lucifer, and his involvement with humankind. The couple initially lived together in Torrington Place, London, from where they ran the course, but in 1961 moved to the coastal town of Southsea in Essex, where there was greater room for Heron's engraving equipment.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, List {{initially}} {{devised the}} idea that ancient German society had been led by a hierarchical system of initiates, the Armanenschaft, an idea which had developed into {{a key part of}} his thinking by 1908. List's image of the Armanenschaft's structure was based largely on his knowledge of Freemasonry. He claimed that the ancient brotherhood had consisted of three degrees, each with their own secret signs, grips, and passwords. He believed that the Armanenschaft had societal control over the ancient German people, acting as teachers, priests, and judges. In List's interpretation of history, the Christian missionaries persecuted the Armanenschaft, resulting in many fleeing northward into Scandinavia and Iceland. He believed that <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> secretive language for transmitting their teachings, known as kala.|$|E
5|$|On October 12, the Bellas were traded back to Raw {{as part of}} a tri-branded Divas trade, {{where they}} predominately {{appeared}} in backstage segments with the weekly guest stars and only occasionally competed in matches. On the January 4, 2010, episode of Raw, Brie participated in a tournament for the vacant Divas Championship, but lost to Maryse in the first round, when a switch resulted in Nikki being pinned. In June 2010, <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> feud with Jillian Hall, when Brie defeated her after switching places with Nikki. The following week, Nikki defeated Hall after switching with Brie. The feud was exacerbated when the Bellas acted as the special guest referees during one of Hall's matches. During the match, Hall attacked both twins, but lost the match when Nikki made a fast count, allowing her to be pinned by Gail Kim. The next week on Superstars, the twins defeated Hall and Maryse in a tag team match to end the storyline.|$|E

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of printing, written legal texts became more available, reducing the need for students to attend readings and lectures. However, {{this meant that the}} students denied themselves the opportunity to query what they had learnt or discuss it in greater detail. Eventually, students now had a way to learn without attending lectures, they began to excuse themselves from lectures, meetings and moots altogether; in the early 17th century <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> way of deputising other students to do their moots for them. The Benchers and Readers did little to arrest the decline of the practice of lecturers and readings, first because many probably believed (as the students did) that books were an adequate substitute, and secondly because many were keen to avoid the work of preparing a reading, which cut into their time as practising barristers. These problems were endemic to all the Inns, not just Gray's Inn.|$|E
5|$|The armor {{protection}} of the Gangut-class ships had to protect against two different threats as revealed during the Russo-Japanese War. Japanese high explosive shells had riddled the unarmored portions of Russian ships and had even sunk several ships with their heavy armor belts unpenetrated. The Russians decided that the entire {{side of the ship}} needed to be armored, even though this would limit the thickness of the main belt. <b>They</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> system where the outer armor would break up or at least slow shells down and burst immediately behind the outer armor and an inboard armor bulkhead would stop the splinters and shell fragments from reaching the vitals. This system likely would have worked against the British armor-piercing shells that performed so badly at the Battle of Jutland, but would have failed against the improved shells introduced afterwards with their redesigned fuses. A related weakness was that the turrets and conning towers lacked the inboard splinter bulkhead even though they used armor thickness roughly equivalent to that of the main belt.|$|E
