The Elephant's Foot, {{hard and}} strong shortly after its formation, is now cracked enough that a glue-treated wad easily separated its top 1–2 centimeter layer. The structure's shape itself is changed as the material slides down and settles.

The heterogeneous nature of corium and different thermal expansion coefficients of the components causes material deterioration with thermal cycling. Large amounts of residual stresses were introduced during solidification due to the uncontrolled cooling rate. The water, seeping into pores and microcracks and freezing there, the same process that creates potholes on roads, accelerates cracking.|$|E

The resistance of daisy-chained, flip-chip interconnects were measured at room temperature and at various intervals {{as a function of}}extreme <b>temperature</b> thermal <b>cycling.</b> Electrical resistance measurements are reported and the tests to date have not shown significant change in resistance as a function of extreme <b>temperature</b> thermal <b>cycling.</b> However, the change in interconnect resistance becomes more noticeable with increasing number of thennal cycles. Further research work has been carried out to understand the reliability of flip-chip interconnect packages under extreme temperature applications (- 1900 C to 85 oC) via continuously monitoring the daisy chain resistance. Adaptation of suitable diagnostic techniques to identify the failure mechanisms is in progress.

40|$|Beside {{a loss in}} texture, {{the main}} quality aspect of filled {{chocolate}} products during storage {{is the development of}} fat bloom. For these products isothermal or <b>cycling</b> <b>temperature</b> storage tests are used for accelerated shelf life prediction. However, the applicability of these tests compared to real storage conditions is complicated and shelf life estimation is vague. Com; 1;paring storage tests of different authors is difficult because products and analysis methods vary. Additionally most of the storage tests are performed to identify the reasons for fat bloom and therefore the storage conditions are not separately investigated. However, all studies agree that temperature has a major impact due to its influence on migration and crystallization. While migration is accelerated at higher temperatures, crystallization shows an optimum at lower temperatures. Therefore, migration and crystal state have to be evaluated during storage, as well as fat bloom formation. In this study, cold stamped dark chocolate shells with nougat filling were chosen to compare isothermal and <b>cycling</b> <b>temperature</b> storage conditions. <b>Cycling</b> <b>temperature</b> storage at adequate levels includes optimum for fat bloom formation, but takes crystallization and migration influence in unequal account. In contrast, isothermal storage at optimum temperature leads to faster fat bloom formation...|$|R

Corrections {{must be made}} for the {{increased}} membrane surface area given by numerous dendritic spines, temperatures significantly hotter than room-temperature experimental data, and nonuniformity in the cell's internal structure. Certain observed effects do not fit into some of these models. For instance, the <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> (with minimal net temperature increase) of the cell membrane during action potential propagation not compatible with models which rely on modeling the membrane as a resistance which must dissipate energy when current flows through it. The transient thickening of the cell membrane during action potential propagation is also not predicted by these models, nor is the changing capacitance and voltage spike that results from this thickening incorporated into these models. The action of some anesthetics such as inert gases is problematic for these models as well. New models, such as the soliton model attempt to explain these phenomena, but are less developed than older models and have yet to be widely applied.

50|$|One of {{the most}} common feature {{extraction}} methods is based on correlating measured system response quantities, such a vibration amplitude or frequency, with the first-hand observations of the degrading system. Another method of developing features for damage identification is to apply engineered flaws, similar to ones expected in actual operating conditions, to systems and develop an initial understanding of the parameters that are sensitive to the expected damage. The flawed system {{can also be used to}} validate that the diagnostic measurements are sensitive enough to distinguish between features identified from the undamaged and damaged system. The use of analytical tools such as experimentally-validated finite element models can be a great asset in this process. In many cases the analytical tools are used to perform numerical experiments where the flaws are introduced through computer simulation. Damage accumulation testing, during which significant structural components of the system under study are degraded by subjecting them to realistic loading conditions, can also be used to identify appropriate features. This process may involve induced-damage testing, fatigue testing, corrosion growth, or <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> to accumulate certain types of damage in an accelerated fashion. Insight into the appropriate features can be gained from several types of analytical and experimental studies as described above and is usually the result of information obtained from some combination of these studies.|$|E
