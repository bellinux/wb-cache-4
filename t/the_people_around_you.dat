In terms of composing material, they each write on their own, then {{work together on}} structure and harmonies. Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, described their songwriting as [...] "Julia with her highly romantic confessional relationship songs, Angus with his more guarded lyrically, more directly pop oriented songs". Julia related her process as [...] "The songs and the writing happens {{all over the place}} and from all different sources of inspiration. It can be a combination of a place, a person and then the emotions that you're going through in relation to those things. And then there's <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>you</b> who you're leaving with and the lover you've left at home and the fact it's your mom's birthday next week and you're not going to be there".|$|E

Emily Estep of [...] "WeGotThisCovered.com" [...] rated the episode as the 10th best SpongeBob SquarePants episode, saying [...] "The reason Chocolate With Nuts {{is such a}} good episode is that it subtly and somewhat-darkly hints at the concept of just how crazy <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who live <b>around</b> <b>you</b> are. Spongebob and Patrick are mostly swindled into buying things from other people - actually, a single con man who keeps appearing - and nothing is more terrifying/hilarious than the man who simply starts screaming 'chocolate' repeatedly until Spongebob and Patrick run away. Chocolate With Nuts adds the complete absurdity of the program - like the old lady and her even older mother who remembers when 'they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate. I always hated it!' - and the aspects of Spongebob’s undersea life that mirror our own lives on land - like stranger danger." ...|$|R

5000|$|One {{month before}} her death, Scott wrote a school essay {{entitled}} [...] "My Ethics; My Codes of Life" [...] {{in which she}} stated her belief {{in the act of}} compassion being the greatest form of love that human beings could advocate to each other, and her efforts to look for the beauty in everyone she met in her life. In the essay, Rachel also wrote: [...] "My definition of compassion is forgiving, loving, helping, leading, and showing mercy for others. I have this theory that if one person can {{go out of their way}} to show compassion then it will start a chain reaction of <b>the</b> same. <b>People</b> will never know how far a little kindness can go." [...] I am sure that my codes of life may be very different from yours, but how do you know that trust, compassion, and beauty will not make this world a better place to be in and this life a better one to live? My codes may seem like a fantasy that can never be reached, but test them for yourself, and see the kind of effect they have in <b>the</b> lives of <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>you.</b> You just may start a chain reaction. Closing paragraph of Rachel Scott's essay [...] "My Ethics; My Codes of Life", written just one month before her death. On reading the essay and the journals Scott had written in the last 16 months of her life, her father was inspired to found Rachel's Challenge two years after her death. Several other sources of inspiration motivated Darrell Scott to make this decision. These included a phone call from a prosperous business person, Frank Amedia, who informed him that he had repeatedly prayed for the welfare of Scott and his family since Rachel's death, and of his conviction the Lord held plans for him (Darrell) to speak to leaders and young <b>people</b> across <b>the</b> nation. Amedia emphasized his willingness to lend his financial support to whatever cause the Lord held for Darrell. Amedia then described a recurring dream he had been experiencing of Rachel's eyes shedding several tears in a [...] "watering" [...] manner on an unknown object. Darrell Scott replied that the dream did not seem symbolic to him; however, several days later, he was authorized to collect his daughter's backpack from the sheriff's office. Inside the backpack were the two journals Rachel had in her possession at the time of her murder. On viewing the final page Rachel had written in her last journal, Scott was stunned to see his daughter's drawing of her own eyes shedding 13 clear tears on a rose shedding blood-like droplets. This rose was identical to one she had drawn in a previous journal, sprouting from a single columbine flower. Beside this drawing, she had drawn a cross inscribed with the words: [...] "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man would lay down his life for his friends!" ...|$|R
