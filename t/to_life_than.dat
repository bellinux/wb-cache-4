500|$|A main {{element of}} Debuts sound is its {{incorporation}} of dance music, reflecting the contemporary styles of London's club culture, {{with which the}} singer had established close ties. While the echoes of subgenres such as Euro-house, acid jazz, worldbeat and IDM can be noted, [...] "they hadn't yet broken free from the primal thump of four-on-the-floor house music." [...] Tom Breihan of Stereogum asserts that [...] "even as dance music took on all these new sounds, that basic pulse was still {{the most important thing}} about it, and that pulse reverberates all through Debut." [...] Björk said: [...] "A lot of the songs on my record have dance beats, but I think they're beats that are more reflective of daily life—like life in the middle of the day in a city, as opposed to the night life of the clubs." [...] The [...] "four-on-the-floor" [...] style —typical of house music— is mostly evident in songs such as [...] "Human Behaviour", [...] "Crying", [...] "Big Time Sensuality", [...] "There's More <b>to</b> <b>Life</b> <b>Than</b> This" [...] and [...] "Violently Happy".

500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am {{going to give you a}} little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>than</b> material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
500|$|Album opener [...] "Human Behaviour" [...] {{features}} a [...] "bouncing riff" [...] sampled from Antônio Carlos Jobim, with [...] "its syncopated beat consigned to a venerable orchestral instrument, the timpani." [...] Its lyrics [...] refer to Björk's {{experience as a}} child, finding the behaviour of adults [...] "rather chaotic and nonsensical," [...] instead finding harmony with other children, nature and animals. Inspired by naturalist David Attenborough, she sings {{from the point of}} view of an animal, with its opening line being [...] "If you ever get close to a human/And human behaviour/Be ready, be ready to get confused". Following track [...] "Crying" [...] shows a contradiction between its [...] "bubbly, shiny-surfaced acid disco-pop" [...] sound and lyrics that describe the turmoil of feeling alienated in a big city. [...] "Venus as a Boy" [...] —considered an ambient track by Rolling Stone— reflected Björk's newly found interest in Bollywood, having befriended people of Indian origin in London, most notably Talvin Singh. In a spontaneous fashion, the song's strings —and also those of [...] "Come to Me"— were recorded by a fim studio orchestra in India. The lyrics of the track are about the sensitivity of her then boyfriend Dominic Thrupp, with lyrics that have been described as [...] "sweet and just the slightest bit naughty." [...] In the dancefloor-oriented [...] "There's More <b>to</b> <b>Life</b> <b>Than</b> This", Björk leaves romance behind, with [...] "her mischievous side [...] to the fore". Its lyrics were inspired by a party she attended and promptly left. [...] "Like Someone in Love" [...] is one of the several jazz standards the singer recorded with Corky Hale, with her voice [...] "cradled in harp and swoony strings." ...|$|E

[...] Rupert Smith from The Guardian reported that the director [...] "squeezed every last drop of spectacle from a highly stage-managed performance", but commented that [...] "she gave away far more in 1991's In Bed with Madonna; this time she gave only the illusion of candour". However, he complimented saying [...] "Even the easy-to-mock pre-show prayers brought a tear to the eye.
