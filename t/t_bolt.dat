In previous paper, {{influence of a}} self fastening effect on flexural rigidity of their beam joint by using of the half-moon shaped bolts was shown. We were prepared to manufacture the half-moon shaped bolts by 14 <b>T</b> <b>bolt</b> and manufacture a specimen using H-SA 700 high-strength plate for the bearing capacity bonding method. This paper showed a effectiveness and performance of the bolt joint and mechanical properties of bearing failure through loading test and analysis results...|$|E
40|$|Additional contributor: Taichiro Okazaki (faculty mentor). Steel {{buildings}} and bridge structures across the United States currently utilize two main types of high strength structural bolts {{to transfer the}} forces developed in the connections between structural members. These bolts are designated by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) as A 325 and A 490, which can hold up to 120 ksi and 150 ksi respectively. Several countries across the globe have recently introduced new grades of high strength bolts to cope with increasing material strength and to enhance design options. The recently developed Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) F 14 <b>T</b> <b>bolt</b> has an ultimate tensile strength of roughly 200 ksi, 33 % stronger than the A 490, the strongest ASTM bolt. Although the F 14 T is considerably stronger than the A 490, that {{does not necessarily mean}} the connection will be stronger. There are many ways a connection can fail besides bolt failure. The type of failure depends on many factors such as what kind of connection it is, what types of loads are being applied to the connection, and the material properties of all connection members. To determine the potential benefit of the F 14 T over the A 325 and A 490, all connection limit states must be investigated and calculated using the different bolts. Also, before this is done the standards and practices of each standardizing company (ASTM and JIS) must be researched to determine if the bolts can be directly compared or if some values must be changed for a fair representation of their differences...|$|E

40|$|Generally, L {{anchor bolt}} {{system has been}} used {{for a long period of}} time in {{construction}} industry as one of the distributing load structures. However, there are some weaknesses in L anchor bolt which may straighten and pullup when charged with tensile load. Current practices prefer to use other types of anchor bolt systems, such as headed studs anchor bolt system to replace the L anchor bolt design. There has been lack of studies to prove that it is more effective in terms of performance. A new <b>T</b> anchor <b>bolt</b> which was basically modified from headed studs anchor bolt was proposed in this study to compare its performance of tensile loading in concrete failure to typical L design. This study aims to determine whether the <b>T</b> anchor <b>bolt</b> system gives better performance as compared to an L anchor bolt system. The performance was rated based on tensile loading on concrete failure pattern. A pullout test was conducted on two different anchor bolt systems, namely L and <b>T.</b> The anchor <b>bolt</b> embedded depth, h in concrete were varied according to their hook or bend radius. Each sample was repeated twice. There were totally eight samples. The hook or bend radius used were 50 mm and 57. 5 mm for sample L 1 and L 2, respectively. 90 -degree bend were used on sample T 1 and T 2. Based on test results, it can be seen that the performance of concrete failure pattern under tensile load on both L and <b>T</b> anchor <b>bolt</b> design samples with 200 mm embedment depth was better than deeper embedment depth of 230 mm. But the L anchor bolt design gives the best results as compared to T design. Although <b>T</b> anchor <b>bolt</b> design shows higher resistance before first bond failure to the concrete sample. <b>T</b> anchor <b>bolt</b> was analysed and needed deeper embedment depth to allow formation of cone pull-out shape to acquire better performance...|$|R

This paper describes a step toward such a manipulator ?? robot finger that is used to recognize small objects by touch. The device incorporates a novel imaging tactile sensor ?? artificial skin with hundreds of pressure sensors in a space the size of a finger tip. The sensor is mounted on a tendon-actuated mechanical finger, similar in size and range of motion to a human index finger. A program controls the finger, using it to press and probe the object placed in front of it. Based on how the object feels, the program guesses its shape and orientation and then uses the finger to test and refine the hypothesis. The device is programmed to recognize commonly used fastening devices ??<b>ts,</b> <b>bolts,</b> flats, washers, lock washers, dowel pins, cotter pins and set screws...|$|R

For locking the die, <b>T</b> <b>bolts</b> are used and so this plate contain 'T - slots into which t- bolts are slid in. These slots are placed diagonally and with a slot {{horizontal}} to the longer side of the plate, is the general practice. These slots run up to a central hole made in the plate, the hole being large enough to accommodate another bush with a hole, the hole being used for dropping the punched part {{to the bottom of the}} press. The top of the tool butted against a vertical sliding ram with a clamping system which accommodates only a particular diameter of a threaded cylindrical member called the [...] "shank" [...] of the tool. The bottom portion of the tool is locked to the bottom bed plate and the top portion of the tool is locked to the sliding ram. Top and bottom portions of the tool are generally guided by suitable pillar and bush assemblies, which gives safety to the punching elements of the tool.|$|R

40|$|Stress {{affects the}} {{resonance}} properties of materials. A suitable technology and instrumentation for calculating stress in pre-installed oil pipeline bolts is developed and tested. The technology, Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS), relates {{the change in}} bolt resonances to bolt stress, using analysis software. A suitable instrumentation that excites the bolt over a band of frequencies through a broad band sweep and measures the response to compute resonances and bolt stress is developed. The instrumentation and the analysis software operate in a loop with minimum operator input to predict stress in the bolts. The project is primarily aimed at {{the oil and gas}} industry but has the potential to fit bolt-testing applications in aerospace, defence and manufacturing industries. The proposed testing method is new to Non Destructive Testing (NDT) of oil pipeline bolts and has no peers. A calibration data set is built using the resonance information extracted from a set of <b>bolts.</b> <b>Test</b> results are discussed and areas of future work explored. A stress prediction accuracy of = 20 % has been achieved with a group of 10 B 7 bolts.

40|$|We find general first-order {{equations}} for G 2 metrics of cohomogeneity {{one with}} S 3 × S 3 principal orbits. These reduce in two special cases to previously-known systems of first-order equations that describe regular asymptotically locally conical (ALC) metrics B 7 and D 7, which have weak-coupling limits that are S 1 times the deformed conifold and the resolved conifold respectively. Our more general first-order equations provide a supersymmetric unification {{of the two}} Calabi-Yau manifolds, since the metrics B 7 and D 7 arise as solutions of the same system of first-order equations, with different values of certain integration constants. Additionally, we find {{a new class of}} ALC G 2 solutions to these first-order equations, which we denote by ˜ C 7, whose topology is an R 2 bundle over T 1, 1. There are two non-trivial parameters characterising the homogeneous squashing of the <b>T</b> 1, 1 <b>bolt.</b> Like the previous examples of the B 7 and D 7 ALC metrics, here too there is a U(1) isometry for which the circle has everywhere finite and non-zero length. The weak-coupling limit of the ˜ C 7 metrics gives S 1 times a family of Calabi-Yau metrics on a complex line bundle over S 2 × S 2, with an adjustable parameter characterising the relative sizes of the two S 2 factors...|$|R
