The FQPA requires <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>to</b> specifically screen pesticides for disruption to the endocrine system.

25|$|In {{response}} to an EDF suit, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in 1971 ordered <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>to</b> begin the de-registration procedure for DDT. After an initial six-month review process, William Ruckelshaus, the Agency's first Administrator rejected an immediate suspension of DDT's registration, citing studies from the EPA's internal staff stating that DDT was not an imminent danger. However, these findings were criticized, as they were performed mostly by economic entomologists inherited from the United States Department of Agriculture, who many environmentalists felt were biased towards agribusiness and understated concerns about human health and wildlife. The decision thus created controversy.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, the Clean Air Act directs <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>to</b> set National Ambient Air Quality Standards {{for several}} pollutants, {{including}} ground-level ozone, and counties out {{of compliance with}} these standards {{are required to take}} steps to reduce their levels. In May 2008, under a court order, the EPA lowered its ozone standard from 80 nmol/mol to 75 nmol/mol. The move proved controversial, since the Agency's own scientists and advisory board had recommended lowering the standard to 60 nmol/mol. Many public health and environmental groups also supported the 60 nmol/mol standard, and the World Health Organization recommends 51 nmol/mol.|$|E
