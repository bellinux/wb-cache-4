5|$|Despite the {{sometimes}} gruesome testimony {{it was generally}} believed the hearings were politically motivated and that individual excesses could largely be traced only <b>to</b> <b>Lang</b> and Dorcas Williams, both {{of whom had been}} acting under the orders of a Marine Corps officer who had since been committed to an insane asylum. Both of the accused gendarmerie officers had been indicted by U.S. Navy court-martial prior to the hearings. A separate inquiry conducted by the Haitian government concluded that, outside of 10 killings attributed <b>to</b> <b>Lang</b> and Williams, the gendarmerie's conduct of the war had been justifiable.|$|E
5|$|Agent Lang visits Mahone {{and offers}} him a deal: {{eight years in}} a St. Louis prison in {{exchange}} for testifying against {{the government in the}} Lincoln Burrows conspiracy, or multiple homicide charges if he does not cooperate. Mahone eventually accepts the offer and confesses <b>to</b> <b>Lang</b> that he killed Shales, and that guilt made him turn to drugs. Because he is unable to maintain his composure while testifying, Mahone's testimony is dismissed, and Lang is forced to return Mahone to Sona.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long {{abolished}} all large landholding by princes, nobles {{and high}} officials. He dismantled the 800-year-old practice of paying officials and rewarding or endowing nobles with {{a portion of}} the taxes from a village or a group thereof. Existing highways were repaired and new ones constructed, with the north-south road from Saigon <b>to</b> <b>Lạng</b> Sơn put under restoration. He organised a postal service to operate along the highways and public storehouses were built to alleviate starvation in drought-affected years. Gia Long enacted monetary reform and implemented a more socialized agrarian policy. However, the population growth far outstripped that of land clearing and cultivation. There was little emphasis on innovation in agricultural technology, so the improvements in productivity were mainly derived from increasing the amount of cultivated farmland.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1975 crisis, the Governor-General's {{power to}} dismiss a Prime Minister against the incumbent's will under Section 64 of the Constitution {{had never been}} exercised. Twice since Federation, {{conflicts}} between state premiers and state governors, who perform analogous functions to the Prime Minister and Governor-General respectively, at the state level, had resulted in the departure of one or the other. In 1916, New South Wales Premier William Holman was expelled from the Australian Labor Party for supporting conscription. He managed {{to hold on to}} power with the aid of opposition parties and consulted the Governor, Sir Gerald Strickland, proposing to pass legislation to extend the term of the lower house of the state legislature by a year. When Strickland objected, stating that such a course was unfair to Labor, Holman had him replaced. In 1932 the New South Wales Labor Premier, Jack Lang, refused to pay moneys owing to the Federal government, which froze the state's bank accounts, causing Lang to order that payments to the state government be only in cash. The governor, Sir Philip Game, wrote <b>to</b> <b>Lang,</b> warning him that ministers were breaking the law, and that if they continued, he would have to obtain ministers who could carry on government within legal bounds. Lang replied that he would not resign, and Game dismissed his government and commissioned the Leader of the Opposition, Bertram Stevens, to form a caretaker government pending a new election, in which Labor was defeated.|$|E

25|$|Metropolis began {{principal}} photography on 22 May 1925 with {{an initial}} budget of 1.5 million reichsmarks. Lang cast two unknowns with little film experience in the lead roles. Gustav Fröhlich (Freder) had worked in vaudeville and was originally employed as an extra on Metropolis before Thea von Harbou recommended him <b>to</b> <b>Lang.</b> Brigitte Helm (Maria) {{had been given a}} screen test by Lang after he met her on the set of Die Nibelungen, but would make her feature film debut with Metropolis. In the role of Joh Fredersen, Lang cast Alfred Abel, a noted stage and screen actor whom he had worked with on Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. Lang also cast his frequent collaborator Rudolph Klein-Rogge in the role of Rotwang. This was Klein-Rogge's fourth film with Lang, after Destiny, Dr. Mabuse the Gambler, and Die Nibelungen.|$|E

25|$|In May 1911, Lang {{made his}} debut in {{first-class}} cricket for Sussex against Cambridge University at Fenner's, {{in what was}} his only first-class appearance of that season. He played six first-class matches for Sussex in 1912, as well as making his debut for Cambridge University (where he was at Trinity College) against the Marylebone Cricket Club. Lang secured {{his place in the}} Cambridge side in 1913, displacing the incumbent wicket-keeper Walter Franklin who the Cambridge selectors considered an inferior batsman <b>to</b> <b>Lang.</b> He played seven first-class matches for the university in 1913, as well as six for Sussex, most of which came in the latter stages of the County Championship. He made what would be a final appearance in first-class for LG Robinson's XI in 1914. In a total of 22 first-class appearances, Lang scored 830 runs at an average of 22.43, with a high score of 141, while behind the stumps he took seventeen catches and made sixteen stumpings. He made two centuries in first-class cricket, both for Sussex.|$|E
500|$|Handicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it {{is fairly}} easy for a crooked sports {{official}} to fix a game, despite Stern's insistence that Donaghy was a [...] "rogue official". According <b>to</b> <b>Lang,</b> an official can directly influence {{the outcome of a}} game 75 percent of the time if he has money on the game. For instance, Lang said that a crooked NBA referee can fix the total score by calling enough fouls to get both teams in the bonus. When a game is being fixed, Lang said, the officials should be the prime suspects because the players are making too much money to risk their future. [...] Lang also believed a bookie connected to the mob turned Donaghy in to the FBI.|$|E
500|$|Lang's {{appointment}} as a canon of St Paul's Cathedral {{required him to}} spend three months annually as the canon in residence, with administrative and preaching duties. [...] Following his {{appointment as}} canon, he was also appointed Treasurer of the Cathedral.

Temple observed that, in contrast to the Bishop of London's sermons, listening <b>to</b> <b>Lang</b> brought on an intellectual rather than emotional pleasure: [...] "I can remember all his points, just because their connexion is inevitable.... And for me, {{there is no doubt that}} this is the more edifying by far." [...] Lang was a member of the cathedral's governing body, the Dean and Chapter, and was responsible for the organisation of special occasions, such as the service of thanksgiving for King Edward VII's recovery from appendicitis in July 1902.|$|E

500|$|Over {{seven hours}} after Gilham's {{original}} request, at 12:35 the Australian APCs had finally departed Nui Dat under Murphy's command with C Company and the Mortar Platoon. Suspecting a Viet Cong ambush, Murphy had prudently avoided following the obvious route <b>to</b> <b>Lang</b> Phuoc Hai, travelling cross-country instead, moving through Long Dien {{and into the}} paddy fields parallel to Route 326. Yet the initial lack of artillery cover had slowed {{the movement of the}} 35-vehicle column, while the continual need to reduce speed while traversing the numerous paddy bunds en route was not appreciated beforehand and further hampered their progress. Indeed, while Murphy had correctly calculated that the rice fields would be dry and hard at that time of year, he found that the main obstacle to rapid movement was a [...] high paddy-bund every [...] at the edge of each rice field. Meanwhile, although the lead company in the air assault—A Company commanded by Major Max Carroll—had departed Nui Dat at 13:30 aboard fifteen UH-1 helicopters from a US Army aviation company, C Company had still not arrived in position to secure the landing zone.|$|E
2500|$|Considerable {{progress}} was also made in eastern Tonkin, {{a region that}} had seen little fighting during the Sino-French War and was still almost unexplored by the French. [...] Between 1886 and 1888 capitaine de vaisseau de Beaumont's naval division hunted down the pirates who still infested Along Bay {{and most of the}} Delta coasts and completed the work that Admiral Amédée Courbet had begun in 1884. [...] The wild country between Lang Son and the Guangdong border that the French had been unable to subdue during the war with China was now tamed by the French occupation of Tien Yen, Ha Coi and Mong Cai. [...] A vital preliminary to these operations was the completion of the naval survey of the coast of Tonkin by the naval hydrographer La Porte, who took over the work begun in 1883 by Renaud and Rollet de l'Isle. [...] La Porte's moment of glory came when, {{as a result of this}} survey, he personally guided the French gunboats up the narrow river channels to Mong Cai, enabling the French to confront the town's defences with overwhelming strength. [...] Mong Cai was occupied by the French in December 1886. [...] La Porte crowned his career by making a general triangulation of Tonkin, from Haiphong to Hung Hoa and to Phu Lang Thuong, drawing on a series of topographical maps produced since 1883 by military engineering officers. [...] Finally, a column of 600 soldiers and 400 coolies under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Alphonse Dugenne, the hero of the Bac Le ambush in June 1884, marched along the coastal plain of eastern Tonkin as far as the Chinese border and explored the sparsely-populated and mountainous hinterland running back <b>to</b> <b>Lang</b> Son. [...] The French completed their penetration of eastern Tonkin in January 1887 by driving insurgent bands from the Pak Lung peninsula, a border region disputed between Vietnam and China. [...] In July 1887 the peninsula was awarded to China by the Border Delimitation Commission.|$|E

50|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Langs,</b> the {{activities}} of unconscious processing reach the conscious mind solely through the encoded messages that are conveyed in narrative communications like dreams. He maintains that, as a rule, dreams are responses to current traumas and adaptive challenges and that their story lines characteristically convey two sets of meanings: the first expressed directly as the story qua story, while the second is expressed in code and implicitly, disguised in the story’s images. We can tap into our unconscious wisdom by properly decoding our dreams, i.e. by linking the dream to the traumas that have evoked them—a process Langs calls “trigger decoding”. This process, according <b>to</b> <b>Langs,</b> {{is the essence of}} self-healing based on deep insight.|$|R

6000|$|It {{comes over}} me with horror and shame that, {{within the next}} very few months, your return to England may become such a reality that I shall before long stand {{face to face with}} you branded with the almost blood-guilt of my long silence. Let me break that silence then, before the bliss of meeting you again (heaven speed the day) is qualified, in prospect, by the {{apprehension}} of your disdain. I despatch these incoherent words to Sydney, in the hope they may catch you before you embark for our palpitating England. My despicable dumbness has been a vile accident--I needn't assure you that it doesn't pretend to the smallest backbone of system or sense. I have simply had the busiest year of my life and have been so drained of the fluid of expression--so tapped into the public pitcher--that my whole correspondence has dried up and died of thirst. Then, somehow, you had become inaccessible to the mind {{as well as to the}} body, and I had the feeling that, in the midst of such desperate larks, any news of mine would be mere irrelevant drivel to you. Now, however, you must take it, such as it is. It won't, of course, be news to you at all that the idea of your return has become altogether the question of the day. The other two questions (the eternal Irish and Rudyard Kipling) aren't in it. (We'll tell you all about Rudyard Kipling--your nascent rival; he has killed one immortal--Rider Haggard; the star of the hour, aged 24 and author of remarkable Anglo-Indian and extraordinarily observed barrack life--Tommy Atkins--tales.) What I am pledged to do at the present moment (pledged to Colvin) is to plead with you passionately on the question of Samoa and expatriation. But somehow, when it comes to the point, I can't do it--partly because I can't really believe in anything so dreadful (a long howl of horror has gone up from all your friends), and partly because before any step so fatal is irretrievably taken we are to have a chance to see you and bind you with flowery chains. When you tell me with your own melodious lips that you're committed, I'll see what's to be done; but I won't take a single plank of the house or a single hour of the flight for granted. Colvin has given me instantly all your recent unspeakable news--I mean the voyage to Samoa and everything preceding, and your mother has kindly communicated to me her own wonderful documents. Therefore my silence has been filled with sound--sound infinitely fearful sometimes. But the joy of your health, my dear Louis, has been to me as an imparted sensation--making me far more glad than anything that I could originate with myself. I shall never be as well as I am glad that you are well. We are poor tame, terrified products of the tailor and the parlour-maid; but we have a fine sentiment or two, all the same.... I, thank God, am in better form than when you first took ship. I have lately finished the longest and most careful novel I have ever written (it has gone 16 months in a periodical) and the last, in that form, I shall ever do--it will come out as a book in May. Also other things too flat to be bawled through an Australasian tube. But the intensest throb of my literary life, as of that of many others, has been the Master of Ballantrae--a pure hard crystal, my boy, a work of ineffable and exquisite art. It makes us all as proud of you as you can possibly be of it. Lead him on blushing, lead him back blooming, by the hand, dear Mrs. Louis, and we will talk over everything, as we used <b>to</b> <b>lang</b> syne at Skerryvore. When we have talked over everything and when all your tales are told, then you may paddle back to Samoa. But we shall call time. My heartiest greeting to the young Lloyd--grizzled, I fear, before his day. I have been very sorry to hear of your son-in-law's bad case. May all that tension be over now. Do receive this before you sail--don't sail till you get it. But then bound straight across. I send a volume of the Rising Star to goad you all hither with jealousy.
