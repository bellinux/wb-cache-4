We call such <b>time</b> [...] <b>series</b> ARIMA <b>time</b> [...] <b>series.</b> We consider the problem of clustering ARIMA <b>time</b> [...] <b>series.</b> We propose {{the use of the}} Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) cepstrum of <b>time</b> [...] <b>series</b> for clustering ARIMA <b>time</b> [...] <b>series,</b> by using the Euclidean distance between the LPC cepstra of two <b>time</b> [...] <b>series</b> as their dissimilarity measure. We demonstrate that LPC cepstral coefficients have the desired features for accurate clustering and efficient indexing of ARIMA <b>time</b> [...] <b>series.</b> For example, few LPC cepstral coefficients are sufficient in order to discriminate between <b>time</b> [...] <b>series</b> that are modeled by different ARIMA models. In fact this approach requires fewer coefficients than traditional approaches, such as DFT and DWT. The proposed distance measure can be used for measuring the similarity between different ARIMA models as well...|$|R

The obtained conditions appear to apply for a wide class of models. We illustrate our results with specific observation-driven <b>times</b> <b>series,</b> including the recently introduced NBIN-GARCH and NM-GARCH models, demonstrating the consistency of the MLE for these two models...|$|R
