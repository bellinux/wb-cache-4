40|$|Phoracantha longicorn beetles are {{endemic to}} Australia, and some species have become {{significant}} pests of eucalypts worldwide, yet {{little is known}} about their host plant interactions and factors influencing tree susceptibility in Australia. Here, we investigate the host relationships of Phoracantha solida (Blackburn, 1894) on four eucalypt taxa (one pure species and three hybrid families), examining feeding site physical characteristics including phloem thickness, density, and moisture content, and host tree factors such as diameter, height, growth, taper, and survival. We also determine the cardinal and vertical (within-tree) and horizontal (between-tree) spatial distribution of borers. Fewer than 10 % of P. solida attacks were recorded from the pure species (Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegate (Hook)), and this taxon also showed the highest survival, phloem thickness, relative growth rate, and bark:wood area. For the two most susceptible taxa, borer severity was negatively correlated with moisture content, and positively related to phloem density. Borers were nonrandomly and nonuniformly distributed within trees, and were statistically aggregated in 32 % of plots. More attacks were situated on the northern side of the tree than the other aspects, and most larvae fed within the lower 50 cm of the bole, with attack height positively correlated with severity. <b>Trees</b> with <b>borers</b> had more dead neighbors, and more bored neighbors, than <b>trees</b> without <b>borers,</b> while within plots, borer incidence and severity were positively correlated. Because the more susceptible taxa overlapped with less susceptible taxa for several physical tree factors, the role of primary and secondary chemistries in determining host suitability needs to be investigated. Nevertheless, taxon, moisture content, phloem density, tree size, and mortality of neighboring trees appeared the most important physical characteristics influencing host suitability for P. solida at this site...|$|R

30|$|For many {{researchers}} in wood and forest sciences, increment borer is a preferred way of sampling {{because it can}} take wood core samples without killing the living <b>tree.</b> Manual increment <b>borers</b> have a tapered cutting thread at the tip, which draws the borer into the stem when rotated. They are {{the most commonly used}} tool to obtain core samples, typically from 4.35 to 12  mm in diameter [1]. The bit for sampling 12  mm cores has the outer diameter of 19  mm. Owing to high contact surface area and large friction forces with the wood, the increment borer needs a high torque to penetrate the wood, especially when sampling 12  mm cores.|$|R
40|$|Many insects {{feed and}} make {{their homes in the}} bark, trunks and {{branches}} of shade trees and shrubs in Texas. Insect borers belong to several different insect groups including a variety of beetles, moths and horntail wasps. Most insect borers are attracted to weakened, damaged, dying or dead plants. These are referred to as “secondary invaders ” because they attack only after a plant has been weakened by another stress. Secondary invaders are a symptom of other problems with the health of the tree or shrub, but may contribute to its decline. Secondary invaders include species from groups already mentioned, but also may include termites, carpenter bees and carpenter ants. Many other insects live in dying or dead trees, including natural enemies (predators and parasites) of the insect borers, sap or fungi feeders, or species which merely use the spaces provided by the tunnels and galleries as living quarters. Wood-boring insects that attack healthy trees and shrubs are called “primary invaders. ” Primary invaders may eventually kill <b>trees.</b> Damage <b>Borer</b> infestations often go unnoticed until plants or parts of plants begin to die or show external signs of damage. Wood-boring insects often produce sawdust-like frass (excrement). Their holes are normally round, oval or semicircular and are found in a random pattern on the plant. Woodpecker damage is sometimes confused with that of woodboring beetles; however, woodpecker damage will not produce frass. One woodpecker, the yellow-bellied sapsucker, produces square holes in rows around a trunk or branch. (See photo on page 5. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this review paper are {{to provide an}} overview of issues related to forest health and forest entomology, explain existing methods for forest insect pest detection, and provide background information on a case study of emerald ash borer. Early detection of potentially invasive insect species is a key aspect of preventing these species from causing damage. Invasion management efforts are typically more feasible and efficient if they are applied as early as possible. Two proposed approaches for detection are highlighted and include dendroentomology and near infrared spectroscopy (NIR). Dendroentomology utilizes tree ring principles to identify the years of outbreak and the dynamics of past insect herbivory on trees. NIR has been successfully used for assessing various forest health concerns (primarily hyperspectral imaging) and decay in <b>trees.</b> Emerald ash <b>borer</b> (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis), is a non-native beetle responsible for widespread mortality of several North American ash species (Fraxinus sp.). Current non-destructive methods for early detection of EAB in specific trees are limited, which restricts the effectiveness of management efforts. Ongoing research efforts are focused on developing methods for early detection of emerald ash borer...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{strategies}} to cultural management. Establishment of new trees that are disease free {{by trying to}} plant trees {{as soon as they}} are received from the nursery {{to reduce the amount of}} stress the tree undergoes to reduce the amount of dead tissue. Apply insecticides to prevent insects such as, peach <b>tree</b> <b>borer</b> to prevent disease causing conidia from entering wounded parts of the tree that the insects create. Prune trees appropriately and at the correct time when buds start to break to promote wide angled branching. Infection at pruning sites is less common when done during late spring because of the smaller amount of inoculum present at this time. Inspect trees occasionally and removed any dead branches to prevent infection at these sites. Training trees properly also helps foster decreased amount of disease. Training trees during the first season to have branches develop wide crotch angles to sustain long orchard life. Avoid excessive and late fertilization during cold season to avoid low temperature injury. Fertilize trees during the early spring to prevent cold-susceptible growth.|$|E

40|$|Annual tree-ring {{width of}} Southwestern {{conifers}} growing on dry sites exhibits sensitivity to variation in climatically created moisture stress. Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and pinyon {{in the eastern}} San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado were sampled at four sites to investigate covariation of climate with intra-annual anatomy. The sites possessed characteristics that created different amounts of physiological stress in <b>trees.</b> Increment <b>borer</b> samples were glued into wooden mounts and machined to approximately 1. 0 mm thickness by a special router-planer. All samples were crossdated by comparing climatically controlled synchronous patterns of ring widths. Moving slit X-ray densitometry (at Forintek Canada Corporation Western Forest Products Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia) objectively defined the earlywood zone (large, low density cells) and latewood zone (smaller, denser cells formed late in the growing season) in each ring. The densitometer measured eight parameters for each ring: ring, earlywood, and latewood width, minimum and maximum density, and mean ring, earlywood, and latewood density. Individual radial series were standardized (i. e, transformed to indices with 1. 0 mean and homogeneous variance) by fitting curves and dividing annual values by the corresponding curve values. Density series proved more difficult to standardize than widths and usually correlated more poorly among individual radii of the same data data type. Statistical characteristics of site summary density chronologies differed from width chronologies. Response functions using monthly mean temperature and total precipitation showed climate influenced all data types. Low moisture stress increased ring, earlywood, and latewood width and ring, maximum, and latewood density. High moisture stress increased minimum and early— wood density. No width or density type consistently covaried {{more than any other}} with climate. Linkage of climatic variation with density parameters differed considerably from that reported in the literature for conifers growing in wetter, cooler climates. Southwestern conifers posed unique densitometric technical difficulties. Selection of sites that caused moderate physiological stress and samples with few missing rings proved critical. Acquisition of density data required much more time and effort than optical measurement of ring width, but yielded valuable intra—annual data. Intra—annual densitometric data hold great promise for reconstruction of seasonal paleoclimate...|$|R
40|$|Forest dieback is {{a complex}} area of study {{that has led to}} the {{development}} of a number of theories or models which purport to explain it. These models are examined using the example of kamahi dieback in Tongariro National Park, There has long been concern over the health of kamahi in the Park and it is thought kamahi could be in a state of decline. A survey on three transects in the area of the Park where dieback is most apparent compared kamahi health to possible predisposing, triggering and hastening factors (the decline-disease theory of forest dieback) to determine their role in any dieback. Possums, pinhole borer, and Sporothrix fungus were highlighted in literature as likely triggering factors in kamahi dieback; an experiment examined their role: possums were excluded from <b>trees,</b> pinhole <b>borer</b> attack simulated, and healthy trees infected with Sporothrix, while unhealthy trees were treated with fungicide. To assess the effect of canopy health and vertebrate browsers on regeneration (regeneration is important in both the cohort senescence theory and the model of stand succession), another experiment was conducted using open and exclosure plots under healthy and thinning canopies. A second survey assessed the overall health of kamahi in the area, and compared site and tree factors to levels of dieback. The survey of an area with high apparent dieback found 14 % of kamahi stems were dead. There was some evidence that age predisposed stems to dieback, and Sporothrix was identified as accelerating stem death; no causal factor was determined. The experiment found no evidence that possums, pinhole borer, or Sporothrix were affecting the health of kamahi at this site. Sites under a thinning canopy in the regeneration study were much more variable in composition than sites under the healthy canopy; while sites in exclosure plots had higher densities of seedlings than sites that browsers had access to. Sites covered by the broad-scale survey contained very few unhealthy or dead kamahi trees, and none of the factors studied seemed to be impacting on the health of kamahi. There were more small (between 50 cm and 2 m) saplings present at sites with more dead kamahi trees. It was concluded that kamahi in Tongariro National Park is generally in a healthy state, and not undergoing decline; although localised dieback may be very high. Possums, pinhole borer and Sporothrix are not having a large effect on kamahi health in this area. Vertebrate browsers may be maintaining regeneration at a level below natural. Comparison between the theories of dieback, succession and the kamahi data indicate that the successional model may best explain the pattern of kamahi dieback. The models of dieback and succession can be inserted into an overriding model of dieback management, which will indicate the best path for investigating forest dieback...|$|R
