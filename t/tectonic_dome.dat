40|$|The Fangshan area, SW of Beijing, {{lies at the}} {{junction}} of the NNE-trending Taihang mountain range and the southeastern portion of the Yanshan intraplate orogenic belt and has undergone at least five stages of deformation. Mid- to late Triassic extensional deformation (D 1) {{is represented by the}} formation of the Fangshan <b>tectonic</b> <b>dome</b> during SE-directed extensional tectonics. This deformation was later modified by NNW-directed thrusting in the late Triassic (D 2) and WNW-directed thrusting in the late Jurassic (D 3). These D 1 -D 3 structures were deformed by the arcuate Beiling syncline (D 4), which formed during the intrusion of the 133 - 128 Ma Fangshan pluton. D 5 deformation is represented by Cretaceous to Quaternary NNE-striking high-angle normal faults. The ages of these events demonstrate that the principal ENE-trending tectonic framework of the Yanshan intraplate orogenic belt was established mainly in the mid- to late Triassic (the Indosinian event). The Jurassic to Cretaceous Yanshanian deformation with thick-skinned thrusting was associated with intrusion of numerous plutons, and strongly modified the older structures. The tectonic evolution of the Fangshan <b>tectonic</b> <b>dome</b> was linked genetically with the collision of the North China Block and the Siberian Craton, and the later collision of the North and South China blocks. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The Dulong-Song Chay <b>tectonic</b> <b>dome</b> lies on {{the border}} of China (SE Yunnan Province) and {{northern}} Vietnam, and consists of two tectonic and lithologic units: a core complex and a cover sequence, separated by an extensional detachment fault. These two units are overlain unconformably by Late Triassic strata. The core complex is composed of gneiss, schist and amphibolite. SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating results for the orthogneiss yield an age of 799 ± 10 Ma, which is considered to be the crystallization age of its igneous protolith formed in an arc-related environment. A granitic intrusion within the core complex occurred with an age of 436 - 402 Ma, which probably formed during partial closure of Paleotethys. Within the core complex, metamorphic grades change sharply from upper greenschist-low amphibolite facies in the core to low greenschist facies in the cover sequence. There are two arrays of foliation within the core complex, detachment fault and the cover sequence: S 1 and S 2. The pervasive S 1 is the axial plane of intrafolial S 0 folds. D 1 deformation related to this foliation is characterized by extensional structures. The strata were structurally thinned or selectively removed along the detachment faults, indicating exhumation of the Dulong-Song Chay <b>tectonic</b> <b>dome.</b> The major extension occurred at 237 Ma, determined by SHRIMP zircon U-Pb and 39 Ar/ 40 Ar isotopic dating techniques. Regionally, simultaneous tectonic extension was associated with pre-Indosinian collision between the South China and Indochina Blocks. The S 2 foliation appears as the axial plane of NW-striking S 1 buckling folds formed during a compressional regime of D 2. D 2 is associated with collision between the South China and Indochina Blocks along the Jinshajiang-Ailao Shan suture zone, and represents the Indosinian deformation. The Dulong granites intruded the Dulong-Song Chay dome at 144 ± 2, 140 ± 2 and 116 ± 10 Ma based on 39 Ar/ 40 Ar measurement on muscovite and biotite. The dome was later overprinted by a conjugate strike-slip fault and related thrust fault, which formed a vortex structure, contemporaneously with late Cenozoic sinistral movement on the Ailao Shan-Red River fault. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The Ni-Cu-PGE sulfide {{deposits}} in the Yangliuping area, SW China, are hosted in mafic-ultramafic sills. The four mineralized sills {{are located in}} the Yangliuping <b>tectonic</b> <b>dome</b> and intrude Devonian carbonaceous marble, graphitic schist. The sills are 200 - 300 m thick and 1, 000 - 2, 000 m in strike length and now consist chiefly of serpentinite, talc schist, tremolite schist, and meta-gabbro. Disseminated Ni-Cu sulfide mineralisation occurs in the serpentinite in the lower parts of the sills. Massive sulfide mineralisation is located in the base of the sills and in the footwall along fractures beneath the mineralized serpentinite. Although the sulfide ores have been modified by hydrothermal activity, there are relict cumulate textures in the disseminated sulfides indicating a magmatic origin for the ores. The Yangliuping Intrusions and the Dashibao Formation have similar primitive-mantle normalized trace element and platinum group element (PGE) patterns, indicating that they are derived from a common parental magma type. The positive correlation between Cu concentrations and Cu/Zr ratios of the Dashibao Formation basalts indicates that the chalcophile elements were removed before eruption. We propose that fractional crystallization of the Yangliuping magma accompanied by the introduction of S and CO 2 from the wall rocks caused the magma to become S-saturated leading to the segregation of magmatic sulfides that became enriched in Ni-Cu-(PGE). The sills acted as conduits for the overlying Dashibao Formation basalts with the sulfide liquid, along with early crystallizing olivine and pyroxene, segregating from the magma as it passed through the conduits prior to eruption. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Neoproterozoic igneous and {{metamorphic}} complexes {{occur as}} <b>tectonic</b> <b>domes</b> in the Longmen Mountains {{of the western}} margin of the Yangtze Block, and are important in reconstructing the Rodinian supercontinent and constraining the timing and mechanism of tectonic denudational processes. The Pengguan dome consists of granitic intrusions and metamorphic rocks of the Huangshuihe Group and is tectonically overlain by ductilly deformed Sinian to Paleozoic strata. The plutonic intrusions consist of granites with abundant amphibolite enclaves. New LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating yielded an emplacement age of 809 ± 3 Ma and a protolith age of 844 ± 6 Ma for the granite. The granitic rocks have geochemical signatures typical of A-type granites, indicating their formation under an extensional environment, by melting of newly formed tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) rocks. A detachment fault, characterized by variable ductile shear deformation of S-C fabric and ESE-ward kinematics, separates the Pengguan dome from the Sinian-Paleozoic cover. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of muscovite from the mylonite in the detachment fault of the dome demonstrates that ductile deformation occurred at ∼ 160 Ma. This study indicates {{the existence of a}} Neoproterozoic magmatic arc-basin system, which was denudated by a Jurassic middle crustal ductile channel flow along the Longmenshan thrust belt. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2008. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Goldschmidt Conference Abstracts 2006 The Songpan-Ganze Orogenic belt (SGOB) in the Tibetan plateau was a {{consequence}} of the collision between the South China block and the North China block during Triassic time [1 - 3]. The Jianglang, Danba and Xuelongbao <b>tectonic</b> <b>domes</b> form an extensional belt along {{the eastern part of the}} SGOB and are composed of three units: core, middle ductilely slab and cover. Supracrustal paragneisses, mica-schist, and quartzite comprise cores of these domes and contain multi-stages of foliation and metamorphic mineral assemblages, whereas the Paleozoic to Triassic cover sequences have thicknesses ranging from 30 to 40 km with only a contractional foliation. The ductilely middle slabs, seperating the core from the cover, are composed of mylonite with S-C fabric, intralayer fold and metamorphic mineral assemblage of garnet -biotite -muscovite -quartz -plagioclase of greenschist facies metamorphism. They have variable thicknesses from centimeters to kilometers and show ESE-ward extensional senses. Amphibole separates yield well defined 39 Ar- 40 Ar plateau ages of 176 ± 0. 68 Ma for the slab of the Jianglang dome (LS 2), 161 ± 0. 7 for the slab of the Xuelongbao dome (BM 29) and 173 ± 12 Ma, 170 ± 10 Ma and 166 ± 9 Ma (GZ- 5), and 159 ± 14 Ma (DB- 8) for the slab of the Danba dome, consistent with SHRIMP zircon (metamorphic rims) U-Pb ages of 175 ± 3 and 176 ± 2 Ma [1, 4]. We conclude that the tectonic evolution of the SGOB involved the Triassic compression to Jurassic extension which resulted in the selective removing or thinning of the middle slab at 159 - 176 Ma. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The Jianglang <b>Tectonic</b> <b>Dome</b> (JTD) lies on {{the eastern}} margin of the Tibetan Plateau and {{consists}} of three tectono-stratigraphic units separated by two extensional detachment faults: a schist complex, a middle ductile slab and an overlying sedimentary unit. The schist complex is composed of quartz-mica schists and amphibolites of possible Mesoproterozoic age and exhibits two early foliations (S 1 S 2) overprinted by two later foliations (S 3 S 4). The ductilely deformed middle slab consists of Paleozoic quartzite, phyllite, marble, amphibolite and meta-basalt. It is characterized by pervasive intrafolial and intraformational recumbent folds with a penetrative axial foliation S′ 1 (an equivalent of S 3 in the basement rocks). The cover unit, the Triassic Xikang Group of flysch sedimentary rocks, experienced shallow level buckling and flattening deformation with an axial cleavage defining S″ 1 (an equivalent of S 4 in the middle slab and basement rocks). The JTD appears to have experienced three stages of extension immediately after orogeny. The earliest (D 1), recorded by an axial surface S 1 of S 0 intrafolial folds and sub-parallel to S 0 in the schist complex, probably occurred prior to the collision between the South China and North China Blocks. This extensional event was followed by subduction of the Yangtze Block to the west towards the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The two detachment faults are characterized by structures formed by ductile-brittle to brittle shear deformation, which are sub-parallel to the layer of S 2 in the lower detachment and to S 0 in the upper detachment. These faults mark {{the second stage of}} extension and may have caused thinning and selective removal of the Sinian and Paleozoic strata, as well as exhumation of the schist complex and the middle slab in the middle Jurassic (177 Ma). The final stage of extension (D 5), shown by brittle deformation and thermo-metamorphism from the lower detachment to the Xikang Group, was associated with the Indian-Eurasia collision. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The Songpan-Ganze terrane of the Tibetan plateau is {{underlain}} by Neoproterozoic {{crystalline basement}} rocks of the Yangtze block. These basement rocks are exposed {{as a series}} of extensional <b>tectonic</b> <b>domes</b> that form a nearly north-south trending extensional belt more than 1000 km long in the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau. In the Danba area, detachment faults separate the basement core complexes (e. g., the Gezong and Gongcai complexes) from the Paleozoic strata which have been thinned or removed completely. The cover sequences have undergone upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies metamorphism to form the Danba schist and are overlain by the Triassic Xikang Group, a thick flysch sequence. Both the basement rocks and the Paleozoic rocks have undergone multiple stages of deformation and thus provide an excellent opportunity to study the tectono-thermal evolution of the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau. Two stages of deformation, corresponding to three generations of foliation (S 1, S 2 1, and S 2 2), have been recognized on the basis of structural and microscopic observations. We selected amphibole and biotite separates associated with distinct generations of foliation for 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating using laser microprobe incremental heating technique to place numerical constraints on the major tectono-thermal events within the Danba area. The geochronogical results reveal an earliest metamorphic event at 258. 6 ± 0. 5 Ma (S 1 biotite) and 263. 6 ± 0. 8 Ma (S 1 amphibole), coinciding temporally with the mantle plume that produced the voluminous Emeishan flood basalts. The second event was a progressive extensional deformation first occurred at 159 - 166 Ma (S 2 1 amphibole) responsible for the earlier tectonic doming of the crystalline basement, and then the final tectono-thermal overprint recorded by S 2 2 foliation and M 2 2 metamorphism locally in the core complexes at 47 - 58 Ma for the Gezong complex and 64 - 81 Ma for the Gongcai complex. This major post-orogenic extensional event is believed to be a consequence of collision between the North China and South China blocks. The apparent discrepancy of the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages observed between localities suggests a slow cooling process associated with progressive uplift. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|When the subducting slab {{broke off}} (slab breakoff, slab pull) and fell away, the subducted crust began moving up. This {{led to the}} uplift of the {{thickened}} continental crust which led, in the Miocene, to extension. In {{the case of the}} Alps, the extension could only take place in a west-east direction because the Apulian plate was still converging from the south. An enormous thrustzone evolved that would later become the Periadriatic Seam. The zone also accommodated dextral shear that resulted from the west-east extension. With the exception of the allochthon Austroalpine material, this thrust evolved at the boundary of the Apulian and European plates. The central zones of the Alps rose and were subsequently eroded. <b>Tectonic</b> windows and <b>domes</b> as the Hohe Tauern window were formed in this way.|$|R

The brines and high-salinity interstitial waters were investigated in several rift valleys with subzonal orientation (Tyro and Kreteus valleys) associated with {{the crest of the}} Mediterranean swell, which is complicated by salt <b>dome</b> <b>tectonics.</b> Increase of salinity in cores containing diatomaceous-sapropelic oozes was accompanied by sulfate reduction and generation of H 2 S. All water samples and brines belonged to the magnesium subtype of the sulfate category. Two genetic varieties of interstitial waters in the epigenetic class are clearly distinguishable: 1) brines resulting from leaching of halite and mixing with NaCl of seawater, and 2) waters and brines rich in MgCl 2.

40|$|Aksum {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} archaeological and historical towns in Ethiopia. The archaeological area stretches on a plateau ranging from 2250 to 2460 m and the general landscape consists of a few dome-shaped hills standing on a plateau crossed by small ephemeral streams. The main geomorphic features are the result of the emplacement of basalt flows, the intrusion of syenite subvolcanic plugs and <b>domes,</b> <b>tectonics,</b> weathering and its interaction with various surface erosion processes. In such a context, between 700 BC and 800 AD, the rise and the decay of the Aksumite Kingdom, one of the most known civilisations of East Africa took place. The core of the archaeological area of Aksum, with tall carved obelisks, is a UNESCO World Heritage listed property. The integration of archaeological data with the analysis of soil conservation measures and agricultural practices, adopted till present, allowed to develop a plough marks based methodology to assess the historical soil erosion rate and, hence, to understand historical landscape evolution within a man-controlled environment. The occurrence of archaeological evidence in such a characteristic geomorphological context provides an excellent opportunity to study and understand interaction between geomorphic and anthropic processes...|$|R
40|$|A {{great variety}} of tectonic and {{volcanic}} features have been documented on Venus. It is widely appreciated that there are close spatial associations among certain types of tectonic structures and some classes of volcanic flows and constructs. Coronae are endowed with a particularly rich variety of volcanism. It is thought that coupled tectonic and volcanic aspects of coronae are cogenetic manifestations of mantle plumes. An outstanding feature of most venusian coronae is their circular or elliptical shape defined by peripheral zones of fracturing and/or folding. Some coronae are composite, consisting {{of two or more}} small coronae within a larger enclosing corona, suggesting complex histories of structured diapirism analogous in some ways to salt <b>dome</b> <b>tectonics.</b> Coronae range widely in size, from smaller than 100 km to over 1000 km in diameter. Volcanic features associated with venusian coronae include lunar-like sinuous rilles, thin lava flows, cinder cone-like constructs, shield volcanos, and pancake domes. Several types of volcanic features are often situated within or near a single corona, in many instances including land-forms indicating effusions of both low- and high-viscosity lavas. In some cases stratigraphic evidence brackets emplacement of pancake domes during the period of tectonic development of the corona, thus supporting a close link between the igneous and tectonic histories of coronae. These associations suggest emplacement of huge diapirs and massive magmatic intrusions, thus producing the tectonic deformations defining these structures. Igneous differentiation of the intrusion could yield a range of lava compositions. Head and Wilson suggested a mechanism that would cause development of neutral buoyancy zones in the shallow subsurface of Venus, thereby tending to promote development of massive igneous intrusions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{covers a}} 300 km long, NE/SW {{oriented}} transect including five outcrop sections, and provides new biostratigraphic data and a sequence stratigraphic {{interpretation of the}} Albian, Cenomanian and Turonian sediments (Kazhdumi and Sarvak Formations) present in Coastal Fars (SW Iran). Two different carbonate depositional systems are distinguished, one for the Albian {{and one for the}} Cenomanian/Turonian. During the Albian eustatic control was the dominant factor influencing sedimentation, while during the Cenomanian and Turonian large and small scale tectonics were dominant. This resulted in significant thickness variations and local diagenetic overprint of the sequence boundaries. Regional correlations were established constrained by ammonite data, as well as sedimentological and sequence stratigraphic considerations. In the Albian interval, including the Kazhdumi Formation and redated Mauddud Member, three 3 rd order sequences have been distinguished. The depositional system consists of muddy carbonate ramps, rich in orbitolinid benthic foraminifers, which laterally interfinger with green marls. Albian deposits are present throughout the area and vary in thickness from 100 to 160 m. Subaerial exposure has only been observed on top of the Albian- 3 sequence (Top Mauddud Member). In {{the upper part of the}} succession, which is of Cenomanian/Turonian age, the depositional system changed to rudist-rimmed carbonate platforms surrounding local organic-rich, intra-shelf basins. The thickness in this interval varies greatly, from 0 to 300 m, which was controlled by both large scale (Qatar-Fars high) and local scale (salt <b>domes)</b> <b>tectonic</b> processes. In this tectonically active setting, three Cenomanian and one Turonian 3 rd order sequences have been distinguished. Several sequence boundaries show evidences for long-lasted subaerial exposures (up to 13 Ma), with the local preservation of soil sequences and continental deposits. The expression of these exposures varies laterally considerably, and macroscopic evidences are sometimes lacking. Petrographic and C & O stable isotope investigations supplement classic sedimentology to reveal the record of these exposures. status: publishe...|$|R
