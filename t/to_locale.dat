For example, PHP and Python allow this optional parameter, while Pascal and Java do not. With Common Lisp's [...] function, the parameter (called character-bag) is required. The C++ Boost library defines space characters according <b>to</b> <b>locale,</b> as well as offering variants with a predicate parameter (a functor) to select which characters are trimmed.|$|E

5000|$|The fixed effect model {{provides}} a weighted average {{of a series}} of study estimates. The inverse of the estimates' variance is commonly used as study weight, so that larger studies tend to contribute more than smaller studies to the weighted average. Consequently, when studies within a meta-analysis are dominated by a very large study, the findings from smaller studies are practically ignored. Most importantly, the fixed effects model assumes that all included studies investigate the same population, use the same variable and outcome definitions, etc. This assumption is typically unrealistic as research is often prone to several sources of heterogeneity; e.g. treatment effects may differ according <b>to</b> <b>locale,</b> dosage levels, study conditions, ...|$|E

In 1996, sponsorship of the corps was passed to Youth Education in the Arts (YEA), an umbrella organization sponsoring several youth and musical activities. Also in '96, the Cadets performed at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. In 2003, Yea! and the corps moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania, and the corps dropped any reference <b>to</b> <b>locale</b> from its name, becoming simply, The Cadets. In January 2009, The Cadets marched in President Barack Obama's Inaugural Parade in Washington, D.C.

50|$|In Asia, {{the cuisine}} offered by food trucks {{requires}} simple skills, basic facilities and {{a relatively small}} amount of capital. They are plentiful, with large potential for income and often a very large sector for employment. Individuals facing difficulty finding work in formal sectors, will often venture into this industry, as it allows entire families to involve themselves in the preparing and cooking of foods sold to the public. The appeal involved in sustaining a food truck lie {{not only in the}} low capital requirement, but also in the flexibility of hours, with minimal constraints <b>to</b> <b>locale.</b> Street foods predominantly reflect local culture and flavor. Food trucks appeal to consumers in that they are often an inexpensive means of attaining quick meals. Location and word of mouth promotion has been credited for their widening success.|$|E

Since family medicine has been taught, educators have been attempting to define its core content—and find ways of teaching it. At the McMaster University Medical Centre Family Practice Unit we have put the problems first: residents present a problem in patient care and the group discusses the problem in relation to a precirculated article on the topic. Lecturing is kept to a minimum, and articles are chosen according to the principles of critical appraisal. An attempt at evaluation generated a positive response...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the ways in}} which the predominant economic mechanisms of capitalism, characterized by a hyper-mobility of flows, affect actual places and people. The rationality informing these mechanisms is the quest for a reduction of costs and the increase of potential benefit, and this can only be achieved by jumping from locale <b>to</b> <b>locale</b> searching for a cheaper labor force, new pools of resources, or an absence of environmental regulations. Mobility becomes the fundamental framework through which to understand modernity and its new economic articulations and their associated sovereignties. Anthropology has often discussed and theorized the impact of market integration on local communities across the world. This paper, in contrast, analyzes the extraction, or the disconnection, of a community away from the market...|$|E
