Chlorine (0. 25 mg of free chlorine per liter [pH 7. 2]) and monochloramine (1 mg/liter [pH 9. 0]) were employed as disinfectants in the study. Two fluorgenic compounds, 5 -cyano- 2, 3 -ditolyl <b>tetrazolium</b> <b>chloride</b> and rhodamine 123, and tritiated uridine incorporation were chosen for assessment of physiological activities. Results obtained by these methods were compared with those from the plate count and direct viable count methods. 5 -Cyano- 2, 3 -ditolyl <b>tetrazolium</b> <b>chloride</b> is an indicator of bacterial respiratory activity, rhodamine 123 is incorporated into bacteria in response to transmembrane potential, and the incorporation of uridine represents the global RNA turnover rate.

40|$|International audienceThe {{membrane}} protein NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase Nox 4 constitutively generates {{reactive oxygen species}} differing from other NADPH oxidases activity, particularly in Nox 2 which needs a stimulus to be active. Although the precise mechanism of production of reactive oxygen species by Nox 2 is well characterized, the electronic transfer throughout Nox 4 remains unclear.
