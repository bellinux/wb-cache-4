5|$|<b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> Salò and {{associated}} documentation, reconstructed through the numerous bills and payments, {{attests to the}} complex relationship between Cairano and Mangiacavalli. They shared staff, which was directed by either of them depending on who was on site. Such collaborative work, which has already been noted at San Pietro in Oliveto are emblematic of Cairano's artistic activity, which became increasingly busy and varied as public and private commissions poured {{in the first decade}} of the sixteenth century following <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the Loggia palazzo. However, Cairano's attention was not directed to Salò, which he visited rarely, or even to San Pietro in Oliveto, which was mainly run by Sanmicheli, but to two works of greater importance and resonance: the grand staircase of the Loggia and the arch at Sant'Apollonio.|$|E
50|$|John Vardy {{was born}} to a simple working family in Durham. His early {{training}} is obscure. His career <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Office of <b>Works,</b> which demanded most of his attention throughout his life, began in May 1736, when he was appointed Clerk of <b>the</b> <b>Works</b> <b>at</b> Greenwich Hospital. He was Clerk of <b>the</b> <b>Works</b> <b>at</b> Hampton Court Palace, January 1745 to 1746; Clerk of <b>the</b> <b>Works</b> <b>at</b> Whitehall, Palace of Westminster and St James's Palace, December 1746 to 1754; Kensington Palace, July 1754 to 1761. He also served as Clerk of <b>the</b> <b>Works</b> <b>at</b> Chelsea Hospital and as Surveyor to the Mint.|$|R

5|$|A {{few years}} after {{starting}} work on the canal, the Member had an artificial lake built on a flat piece of land {{to the front of}} the mansion house. The landscape gardener William S Gilpin was carrying out work on the adjacent Strichen estate at about the same time, and it is assumed he gave help with <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> Pitfour. The lake extends to almost 50 acres and was based on the artificial lake at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
5|$|An {{offshoot}} of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> MIT {{was the beginning}} of digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with many castles – {{especially}} of the 12th century – there is no record of how much it cost to build Buckton Castle. However, based on comparison to Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, where construction of the keep in 11751177 cost £184 according to the Pipe Rolls, it is estimated that <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> Buckton would have cost around £100. This was close to the median annual income for a baron in 1200.|$|E

5|$|Brassey had {{considerable}} skill in choosing good men {{to work in}} this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an agreed price {{he would make a}} suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> a lower cost he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 {{the castle}} was sold for around £2 {{million to the}} Hay Castle Trust, who {{intended}} {{to turn it into}} an arts and education centre. The firm of Rick Mather Architects were taken on in 2015 to manage <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> a projected cost of £4.35 million, to include a new art gallery and a viewing point {{at the top of the}} keep. A grant of £528,600 from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2014 supported initial planning, and further grants were given by the Country Houses Foundation and the Headley Trust.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} of England private castles were being built by newly emerging, wealthy families; like <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> Windsor, these castles drew on the {{architectural}} themes of earlier martial designs, but were not intended to form a serious defence against attack. These new castles were heavily influenced by French designs, involving a rectangular or semi-rectangular castle with corner towers, gatehouses and moat; the walls effectively enclosing a comfortable courtyard plan not dissimilar to that of an unfortified manor. Bodiam Castle built in the 1380s possessed a moat, towers and gunports but, rather than being a genuine military fortification, the castle was primarily intended to be admired by visitors and used as a luxurious dwelling – the chivalric architecture implicitly invoking comparisons with Edward I's great castle at Beaumaris.|$|E

5|$|Sargent's break {{came when}} Sir Henry Wood visited De Montfort Hall, Leicester, early in 1921 with the Queen's Hall orchestra. As it was {{customary}} to commission a piece {{from a local}} composer, Wood invited Sargent to write a piece entitled Impression on a Windy Day. Sargent completed the work too late for Wood to {{have enough time to}} learn it, and so Wood called on Sargent to conduct the first performance himself. Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent's talent as a conductor and gave him the chance to make his debut conducting <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> Wood's annual season of promenade concerts, generally known as the Proms, in the Queen's Hall on 11 October of the same year.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{arrived back}} in London during March 1964 and {{returned}} to meet with Cobbold, informing him of the offer with Cunard, a position which initially would be the management of Cunard's London operation, with a trip to Cunard's headquarters in Liverpool {{once a week for}} management and board meetings. Cobbold also had a job offer for Smallpeice, an accountancy position within the Queen's Household, a position formally to be titled Administrative Adviser. This position could be combined with <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> Cunard quite comfortably, but would preclude taking further directorships in the short term, as a result, Smallpeice was forced to turn down non-executive director positions with Charterhouse Group and Rugby Portland Cement.|$|E
5|$|The Passion of Martin Luther King was {{composed}} in 1968 following King's assassination. The Passion was first recorded in London in 1969, with Ezio Flagello, the composer's brother, as the bass baritone soloist. This performance was eventually released by Naxos American Classics in 2012. DePreist conducted the National Symphony Orchestra's first performance of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the Kennedy Center on February 19, 1974. Music critics drew comparisons to Johann Sebastian Bach's Passions, which recounts Jesus' death. The Oregon Symphony album {{was the first}} published recording of the work. Bazemore provided bass vocals, with additional vocals by the Portland Symphonic Choir, directed by Bruce Browne. The nine sections of the work are performed with a brief pause in between.|$|E

5|$|The choir has broad arches {{with two}} wave {{mouldings}} carried down the piers which support the ribs of the vaulting. These {{may have been}} designed by Thomas Witney or William Joy as they are similar to <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> Wells Cathedral and St Mary Redcliffe. The choir is separated from the eastern Lady Chapel by a 14th-century reredos which was damaged in The reformation and repaired in 1839 when the 17th-century altarpiece was removed. The Lady Chapel was brightly painted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries following existing fragments of colour. To the south east of the choir and Lady Chapel is the Berkeley Chapel and an adjoining antechapel or sacristy, {{which may have been}} added in the 14th century, possibly replacing an earlier structure.|$|E

5|$|The {{final draft}} of Compton's November 1941 report {{made no mention}} of using plutonium, but after {{discussing}} the latest research with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project, which was codenamed X-10. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He felt that having teams at Columbia, Princeton, the University of Chicago and the University of California was creating too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he concentrated <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago.|$|E
5|$|There {{was still}} fog on the plateau on 1 September, but by 15:00 CEST it was {{possible}} to fly a team there by helicopter. Because the fog stayed, the team retained work until 03:00 CEST in the night. In the following days, the fog lifted, making work and transport easier. By 5 September, all bodies had been recovered and <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the plateau could be terminated. The recovery in the valley was completed two days later. The accident resulted in about 40 journalists staying in Svalbard to cover the story. The Norwegian authority's costs related to the investigation and other activities related to the accident were estimated at 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK).|$|E
5|$|When Karajan {{was in a}} {{position}} to do so he added Falstaff to the repertoire of his opera company at Aachen in 1941, and he remained a proponent of the work for the rest of his career, presenting it frequently in Vienna, Salzburg and elsewhere, and making audio and video recordings of it. Solti also became closely associated with Falstaff, as did Carlo Maria Giulini; they both conducted many performances of the work in mainland Europe, Britain and the US and made several recordings. Leonard Bernstein conducted <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the Met and the Vienna State Opera, and on record. The advocacy of these and later conductors has given the work an assured place in the modern repertoire.|$|E
