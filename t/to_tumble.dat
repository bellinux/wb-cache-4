5|$|Inter Milan faced Valencia in {{the opening}} match of the tournament; manager Roberto Mancini named an {{experienced}} Inter team that included defender Marco Materazzi and forward Zlatan Ibrahimović. Valencia began the much the stronger of the two, and went ahead in the 13th minute when Jaime Gavilán scored. The midfielder had received the ball from a cross, and managed to guide it under goalkeeper Francesco Toldo. Referee Alan Kelly turned down Inter Milan's appeals for a penalty, when a challenge by Valencia defender Iván Helguera had caused Luís Figo <b>to</b> <b>tumble</b> in the area. Inter nearly equalised through Maxwell as his effort hit the post, but conceded their second goal of the match minutes before the interval. Materazzi fouled David Villa outside the penalty area, and his deflected free-kick sailed into the net. Substitutions for {{both sides in the}} second half led to further chances, all of which came to nothing.|$|E

25|$|Sri Lanka's {{powerful}} batting line-up {{saw their}} team {{through to a}} huge total of 318/7, including 88 from Dias, 68 from Mendis and 45 from captain Anura Tennekoon. The Danes began reasonably well in pursuit of such a daunting target, reaching 96/3 at one stage before wickets began <b>to</b> <b>tumble</b> and Denmark declined to 110 all out, a crushing 208-run loss. Bandula Warnapura (3–22), Somachandra de Silva (3–20) and Sudath Pasqual (3–7) were the pick of Sri Lanka's bowlers.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{moved on}} to Bristol looking for their first win since the opening match of the tour against the Duchess of Norfolk's XI. With only three tour matches {{to go before the}} start of the One day {{international}} series, the tourists were hoping to build some momentum going into those matches. Greg Chappell won the toss, and elected to bat first, but the Australia innings was poor. McCosker fell for 2 with the score on 3. Kim Hughes fell a few overs last for 7. The wickets continued <b>to</b> <b>tumble</b> at regular intervals, with the only real resistance coming from Doug Walters (32), and Ray Bright (53). The Australians were all out for 154 in 47.5 overs.|$|E

25|$|Jamaica was {{not always}} as diverse as it is today. Throughout the 19th to early 20th centuries, Jamaica was mainly {{populated}} with whites as new Irish immigrants settled around the places known today as Downtown and Baisley Pond Park. In the 1950s, however, what was later called white flight began and middle-income African Americans started taking their place. After the 1970s, as housing prices began <b>to</b> <b>tumble,</b> many Hispanic such as Salvadorans, Colombians, Dominicans, and West Indian immigrants moved in. These ethnic groups tended to stay more towards the Jamaica Avenue and South Jamaica areas. Immigration from other countries did not become widespread until the late 1990s and early 2000s. Gentrification and decrease in crime attracted many families to Jamaica's safe havens; Hillside Avenue reflects this trend. Along 150th to 161st streets, much of the stores and restaurants typify South American and Caribbean cultures.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{respective}} mid-table position, {{the first team}} lost the services of Stenhouse whose four-year reign as captain ended with him moving to Bootle. Batsman Chris Davies took charge for the 2015 season and managed to bring in quality players like Luke Camden and the Sri Lankan all-rounder Ian Daniel. The latter showed his class with both bat and ball as he scored over 900 runs in all competitions and took 50 wickets. Park were involved in some thrilling games that year which included a memorable away win at National T20 champions Chester Boughton Hall in the Liverpool Echo Knockout Competition. They also pulled off their highest ever run chase victory as they chased down Lytham's total of 258 to seal a sensational win. Records continued <b>to</b> <b>tumble</b> in {{the final game of}} the season as the departing Rob Houghton pulled off the remarkable feat of taking his 1000th Liverpool Comp wicket in a defeat by Highfield. Despite that loss, Park finished up in a commendable sixth place.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{recorded}} a thumping 10-wicket win over Bangladesh to level their head-to-head {{record in the}} NatWest Series to 1–1. Under leaden skies at Old Trafford, Ricky Ponting made the wise decision and chose to bowl, and short-balls from Brett Lee immediately had the Bangladeshis worried. They survived six overs without loss before Javed Omar was trapped by an in-swinger for a 20-ball 3. Tushar Imran was next to fall to Lee, and many expected a procession to begin, but Shahriar Nafees and Mohammad Ashraful gave the crowd a treat with some special strokes. Ashraful had two top-edged sixes, as Lee was dispatched for 20 runs in the 11th over. By the drinks break after 15 overs, Bangladesh were 76 for 2, having added 53 from the last 39 balls. Ponting, however, brought on the spinners Brad Hogg and Andrew Symonds, who both got {{a fair amount of}} turn out of the Old Trafford pitch, and Symonds had Shahriar bowled for 47 with a yorker that he played late to. The next ball, he got the out-of-form captain Habibul Bashar, and the wickets began <b>to</b> <b>tumble</b> quickly. Symonds got five wickets for 18 runs, Hogg three for 29, Bangladesh collapsed from 137 for 6 (when Khaled Mashud was bowled by Hogg) to 139 all out in three overs, as Ashraful went for 58 and no one else really offering any resistance to the slow Australian bowlers.|$|E

25|$|Bangladesh's {{scores were}} worse {{the second time}} around, as Nafees {{failed to live up}} to his {{previous}} innings century after making 33, and opener Omar edged to the wicket keeper Gilchrist for 18. Soon the captain was run out for seven and Aftab Ahmed lost his wicket in the final over to see Bangladesh positioned at 124 for 5 at stumps. The fourth day continued in the same vain as Khaled Mashud was bowled for a duck in the second over of the day and both Shane Warne and Jason Gillespie made up for their first innings oversight by bowling and trapping the last five wickets of Bangladeshi for 88 runs, the former improving his previous 0-112 to this innings' 3-28, despite Mohammad Rafique taking three fours off him. Australia started the final innings in the knowledge that they have only twice, in fifty years, managed to pull off a second innings score higher than the first, needing as they did 307 runs for victory. Taking no risks, Australia's openers made a calm 67 either side of the tea break before captain Ricky Ponting came out with seven boundaries and an unbeaten 72 at the close of play. The second wicket partnership stood for 106 before Australian wickets began <b>to</b> <b>tumble</b> with two removals from left-arm slow bowler Mohammad Rafique to leave the team at 212-4, with only their high-scoring skipper and Adam Gilchrist (6*) in the way of their five bowlers at the lower order.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} are the four steps in traditional die casting, also known as , these are also the basis {{for any of the}} die casting variations: die preparation, filling, ejection, and shakeout. The dies are prepared by spraying the mold cavity with lubricant. The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting. The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure; between [...] Once the mold cavity is filled, the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies. The dies are then opened and the shot (shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die, yielding multiple castings per shot) is ejected by the ejector pins. Finally, the shakeout involves separating the scrap, which includes the gate, runners, sprues and flash, from the shot. This is often done using a special trim die in a power press or hydraulic press. Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding. A less labor-intensive method is <b>to</b> <b>tumble</b> shots if gates are thin and easily broken; separation of gates from finished parts must follow. This scrap is recycled by remelting it. The yield is approximately 67%.|$|E
500|$|From 1996, {{the website}} of the Colchester tourist board {{attributed}} {{the origin of}} the rhyme to a cannon recorded as used from the church of St Mary-at-the-Wall by the Royalist defenders in the siege of 1648. In 1648, Colchester was a walled town with a castle and several churches and was protected by the city wall. The story given was that a large cannon, which the website claimed was colloquially called Humpty Dumpty, was strategically placed on the wall. A shot from a Parliamentary cannon succeeded in damaging the wall beneath Humpty Dumpty which caused the cannon <b>to</b> <b>tumble</b> to the ground. The Royalists (or Cavaliers, [...] "all the King's men") attempted to raise Humpty Dumpty on {{to another part of the}} wall, but the cannon was so heavy that [...] "All the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put Humpty together again". Author Albert Jack claimed in his 2008 book Pop Goes the Weasel: The Secret Meanings of Nursery Rhymes that there were two other verses supporting this claim. Elsewhere, he claimed to have found them in an [...] "old dusty library, [...] an even older book", but did not state what the book was or where it was found. It has been pointed out that the two additional verses are not in the style of the seventeenth century or of the existing rhyme, and that they do not fit with the earliest printed versions of the rhyme, which do not mention horses and men.|$|E
