5|$|After the Berlin Wall {{was built}} in 1961, Zoologischer Garten became the West Berlin and Ostbahnhof the East Berlin de facto central station. The station Friedrichstraße now was the <b>terminal</b> <b>point</b> of the {{separated}} West and East Berlin S-Bahn lines and departure point for the Interzonenzug (Inter-zone train) services between West Berlin and West Germany. Friedrichstraße station was separated into Eastern and Western parts with steel walls, and enabled West Berliners to change to S-Bahn trains running on the Nord-Süd-Bahn and the U6 line of the Berlin U-Bahn without passing through GDR border controls. The station also featured a border crossing into East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{the still}} poorly {{developed}} peninsula suddenly {{found itself in}} a strategic position, as the communication between Russia and the Allies was cut and the ice-free harbors of the Murman Coast remained {{the only means of}} sending the war supplies to the Eastern Front. In March 1915, the construction of the railroad was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, even though it was only partially completed and poorly built. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (modern Murmansk) was founded as the <b>terminal</b> <b>point</b> of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula.|$|E

25|$|From June 1922 to June 1939, the 3rd Battalion 12th Infantry {{occupied}} Fort Washington. The fort's {{primary function}} {{was as a}} city garrison for Washington.

That same year the fort was transferred to the Department of the Interior and a Civilian Conservation Corps barracks was built.

25|$|Construction of {{the line}} to Loch Fittie (the Kingseat branch) was delayed owing to a dispute over mineral rights. Additional powers, the West of Fife Mineral Railway (Kingseat Extension) Act of 23 July 1860, were needed for the line when it was finally built; it was {{completed}} {{after the end of}} the independent existence of the company. It served new workings south of Loch Fitty; development of these deep pits allowed the life expired Halbeath pits to be abandoned. The <b>terminal</b> <b>point</b> of the Kingseat branch was close to the end of the Kinross-shire Railway, and the lines were connected by the Kinross-shire Railway when the West of Fife line was built. The Kingseat branch became the West of Fife main line with a greater volume of traffic than the Steelend line, where collieries were much slower to develop.|$|E

2500|$|Consider the {{following}} problem. [...] Suppose that a tangent vector to the sphere S is {{given at the}} north pole, and we are to define a manner of consistently moving this vector to other points of the sphere: a means for parallel transport. [...] Naïvely, this could be done using a particular coordinate system. [...] However, unless proper care is applied, the parallel transport defined in one system of coordinates will not agree with that of another coordinate system. [...] A more appropriate parallel transportation system exploits the symmetry of the sphere under rotation. [...] Given a vector at the north pole, one can transport this vector along a curve by rotating the sphere {{in such a way}} that the north pole moves along the curve without axial rolling. [...] This latter means of parallel transport is the Levi-Civita connection on the sphere. [...] If two different curves are given with the same initial and <b>terminal</b> <b>point,</b> and a vector v is rigidly moved along the first curve by a rotation, the resulting vector at the <b>terminal</b> <b>point</b> will be different from the vector resulting from rigidly moving v along the second curve.

2500|$|The {{development}} of the derived category, by Alexander Grothendieck and his student Jean-Louis Verdier shortly after 1960, now appears as one <b>terminal</b> <b>point</b> in the explosive {{development of}} homological algebra in the 1950s, a decade in which it had made remarkable strides. The basic theory of Verdier was written down in his dissertation, published finally in 1996 in Astérisque (a summary had earlier appeared in SGA 4½). The axiomatics required an innovation, the concept of triangulated category, and the construction is based on localization of a category, a generalization of localization of a ring. The original impulse to develop the [...] "derived" [...] formalism came from the {{need to find a}} suitable formulation of Grothendieck's coherent duality theory. Derived categories have since become indispensable also outside of algebraic geometry, for example in the formulation of the theory of D-modules and microlocal analysis. Recently derived categories have also become important in areas nearer to physics, such as D-branes and mirror symmetry.|$|E

40|$|Sources and {{propagation}} {{characteristics of}} high-frequency gravity waves {{observed in the}} mesosphere using airglow emissions from Gadanki (13. 5 ° N, 79. 2 ° E) and Hyderabad (17. 5 ° N, 78. 5 ° E) are investigated using reverse ray tracing. Wave amplitudes are also traced back, including both radiative and diffusive damping. The ray tracing is performed using background temperature and wind data obtained from the MSISE- 90 and HWM- 07 models, respectively. For the Gadanki region, the suitability of these models is tested. Further, a climatological model of the background atmosphere for the Gadanki region has been developed using nearly 30 years of observations available {{from a variety of}} ground-based (MST radar, radiosondes, MF radar) and rocket- and satellite-borne measurements. ERA-Interim products are utilized for constructing background parameters corresponding to the meteorological conditions of the observations. With the reverse ray-tracing method, the source locations for nine wave events could be identified to be in the upper troposphere, whereas for five other events the waves terminated in the mesosphere itself. Uncertainty in locating the <b>terminal</b> <b>points</b> of wave events in the horizontal direction is estimated to be within 50 – 100 km and 150 – 300 km for Gadanki and Hyderabad wave events, respectively. This uncertainty arises mainly due to non-consideration of the day-to-day variability in the tidal amplitudes. Prevailing conditions at the <b>terminal</b> <b>points</b> for each of the 14 events are provided. As no convection in and around the <b>terminal</b> <b>points</b> is noticed, convection is unlikely to be the source. Interestingly, large (~ 9 m s − 1 km − 1) vertical shears in the horizontal wind are noticed near the ray <b>terminal</b> <b>points</b> (at 10 – 12 km altitude) and are thus identified to be the source for generating the observed high-phase-speed, high-frequency gravity waves...|$|R
