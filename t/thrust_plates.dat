In addition to the uniform wedge formation, the high oil film pressure also induces a local elastic deformation of the fixed <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> normal to its surface. The normal <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> deformation and the oil wedge effectively form an elasto-hydrodynamic-lubrication (EHL) pocket, even more effectively increasing the oil film pressure between the sliding surfaces, due to the envelopment of the oil, as confirmed in our companion paper [3], and an earlier, less-detailed contribution [4]. The present study focuses on aspects of EHL that have both positive and negative effects on the lubrication performance of the thrust slide-bearings in scroll compressors. Theoretical calculations using the average Reynolds equation and Patier-Chen solid contact theory, for the boundary of the local elastic deformation of the thrust slide-bearing, were conducted for a small cooling capacity scroll compressor driven at 3600 rpm with 0. 1 kW.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 125 - 129) Eastern Sierran wall {{rocks in}} the central portion of the Slate Range have undergone several phases of Mesozoic deformation resulting in the folding and faulting of Permian (?) - Triassic (?) metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks. Additionally, five phases of pre-, syn- and(or) post-tectonic intrusion occurred in the study area. Five generations of folding are recognized, several of which are correlative with regionally recognized structures. Early-formed fold generations, F 1, F 2 and F 3, are oriented in a northeasterly direction. Axial plane cleavage is developed only in the F 1 generation. Fold trends changed to a northwesterly direction during the F 4 generation which also has a poorly developed axial plane cleavage. The F 5 generation is pervasive and is represented by kink folds, warps and minor folds. F 1 folds are cut by west-trending strike- and oblique-slip faults, and both folds and faults are truncated by the northwest-striking Ophir thrust fault, which has been refolded about a N. 50 ??W. orientation by the F 4 fold generation. Three other minor thrust faults associated with this compressional phase also developed.

Sm–Nd mineral and bulk-rock data from pegmatite and granophyre zircon samples and from wehrlites and clinopyroxenites {{of the main}} Duke Island cumulate sequence {{are consistent with the}} consanguinity of the ultramafic cumulates and the zircon-bearing feldspathic rocks, and with an Early Cretaceous igneous age for the intrusion. Wall rocks for the intrusion consist of Ordovician–Silurian amphibolite- and greenschist-grade metamorphosed plutonic, volcanic, and minor sedimentary rocks and crosscutting Late Triassic gabbro–diorite of the Alexander terrane. The Duke Island ultramafic intrusion formed as a northwest-trending elongate funnel-shaped stratiform body commensurate with extensional brittle–ductile faulting in its roof and adjacent wall rocks. Intrusion occurred in a basinal setting within the Gravina volcanic arc along the Cordilleran continental margin. During the latter phases of intrusive activity the Gravina basin began to close by regional thrust faulting, which in the Duke Island region was west-northwest directed. The intrusion may have still had local intercumulate liquid upon initiation of thrust faulting. It responded first by open folding with incipient crystal plasticity. Once completely solidified, the intrusion behaved like a large "augen" with ductile deformation concentrated along its margins and within quartzo-feldspathic and micaceous members of its wall-rock complex. Much of the intrusion's northern margin behaved as a ductile shear zone serving as a tear fault between <b>thrust</b> <b>plates</b> to the northeast and an oblique thrust complex that roots beneath the southwest margin of the intrusion. The intrusion may thus be tectonically transported relative to its original underpinnings.

40|$|About 3000 km(2) {{within the}} {{crystalline}} basement complex of the Eastern Transverse Ranges in the Chuckwalla, Orocopia, Eagle, Cottonwood, Hexie, Little San Bernardino, and Pinto Mountains of Riverside County, California were mapped at scales of 1 : 36, 000 and 1 : 62, 500 and compiled at 1 : 125, 000 (Plate I). Pre-Jurassic(?) (i. e., {{older than the}} Mesozoic batholiths) rocks of the crystalline complex comprise two lithologically distinct terranes. These terranes are called the Joshua Tree and San Gabriel terranes for regions of southern California in which their lithologies were initially characterized. The two terranes are superposed along a previously unrecognized low-angle fault system of regional extent, the Red Cloud thrust. During {{the course of this}} study, the structurally lower Joshua Tree terrane has been defined as a stratigraphically coherent group of crystalline rocks that consists of Precambrian granite capped by a paleo-weathered zone and overlain nonconformably by orthoquartzite that interfingers westward with pelitic and feldspathic granofelses. The quartzite contains near-basal quartz/quartzite clast conglomerates, and has well-preserved cross-bedding that appears upright wherever it has been observed. Pelitic and feldspathic granofelses crop out {{to the west of the}} quartzite exposures in four lithologically different belts that trend northnorthwest throughout the area mapped. These lithologic belts are interpreted to have been derived from stratigraphically interfingering sedimentary protoliths deposited in a basin offshore from a quartzose beach-sand protolith. In proximity to the early Red Cloud thrust, this whole stratigraphic package was pervasively deformed to granite gneiss, stretched pebble conglomerate, lineated quartzite, and schist. A northeast-trending pattern of metamorphic isograds was orthogonally superimposed on the northnorthwest-trending protoliths of the Pinto gneiss. A central andalusite zone, located in the southern Little San Bernardino and Hexie, and northern Eagle Mountains, is flanked to the northwest and southeast by sillimanite zones. Coincident with this symmetrical distribution of aluminosilicates is an asymmetrical distribution of other pelitic mineral zones, with prograde cordierite-aluminosilicate-biotite- and K-feldspar-aluminosilicate-bearing assemblages to the northwest in the northern Little San Bernardino and Pinto Mountains, staurolite-bearing assemblages in a narrow zone in the southern Little San Bernardino-Hexie and northern Eagle Mountains, and retrograde chlorite-muscovite-bearing assemblages in the southernmost Little San Bernardino, Cottonwood, southern Eagle, Orocopia, and Chuckwalla Mountains. One occurrence of chloritoid-sillimanite in the central Eagle Mountains is apparently also retrograde. The crossing isograds are interpreted to result from a temporal increase in PH 2 O relative to PT from south to north through the field area. Comparison of the pelitic assemblages with experimental studies suggests peak conditions of PT [ [...] . ] 3. 5 to 4 kb, T [ [...] . ] 525 to 625 °C. The early prograde metamorphism pre-dated the thrusting event; the retrograde stage may have overlapped in time with the emplacement of the San Gabriel terrane allochthon. Cordierite-orthoamphibole-bearing assemblages are present in one stratigraphic zone of the Pinto gneiss. In this study, the Precambrian lithologies of the San Gabriel terrane are viewed as a three-part deep crustal section, with uppermost amphibolite grade pelitic (Hexie) gneiss intruded by granodioritic (Soledad) augen gneiss at the highest level, retrograded granulite (Augustine) gneiss at an intermediate level, and syenite-mangerite-jotunite at the lowest level exposed in the Eastern Transverse Ranges. The Hexie gneiss, characterized by sillimanite-garnet-biotite-bearing assemblages, is thrust over andalusite-bearing granofels of the Pinto gneiss. The Red Cloud thrust system is inferred to have developed in three or four sequential structural events: 1) early thrusting that probably moved parallel to the ENE mineral lineations recorded in both plates; 2) regional folding of the initial thrust surface around NNE-trending axes; 3) later thrusting that broke with some component of westward movement across a fold in the older thrust surface to produce a stacking of crystalline <b>thrust</b> <b>plates</b> of the two terranes; 4) continued or renewed folding of both thrust faults with eventual overturning toward the SW. It is consistent with all observations to date to link these structural events into a single regional tectonic episode that resulted in westward-vergent allochthonous emplacement of the San Gabriel terrane over Joshua Tree terrane. The thrust timing can only be loosely bracketed in time between 1195 m. y. and 165 m. y. ago. The pre-batholithic terranes and the westward-vergent Red Cloud thrust are considered to be exotic with respect to the pre-batholithic rocks and structures exposed to the north and east of the field area. The bounding discontinuity has been obliterated by intrusion of both suites of Mesozoic batholithic rocks. The Mesozoic plutonic rocks comprise two batholithic suites, both of which intrude the Joshua Tree and San Gabriel terranes and the Red Cloud thrust system. NW-SE trending belts of plutonic lithologies have been mapped within each suite: the oldest lithology of the younger suite intrudes the youngest lithology of the older suite. The older suite, Jurassic(?), lying to the NE, appears to have an alkalic character; the younger suite, Cretaceous(?), appears calc-alkaline. The older suite consists of biotite- and K-feldspar-bearing gabbro-diorites intruded by low-quartz monzogranites. The younger suite includes hornblende-biotite-sphene granodiorite intruded by porphyritic monzogranites, intruded in turn by nonporphyritic monzogranite. The Eastern Transverse Ranges south of the Pinto Mountain fault are defined by several Cenozoic E-W left-lateral strike-slip faults that have a cumulative westward displacement from S to N of about 50 km. The left-lateral faults are interpreted to form part of a conjugate fault set with complementary right-lateral faults in the Mojave and Colorado Deserts. Along the western boundary of the Eastern Transverse Ranges in the Little San Bernardino Mountains, the crystalline rocks have been pervasively cataclasized by an event that post-dates intrusion of the Cretaceous(?) plutonic rocks. The cataclasis is attributed to the Vincent-Orocopia-Chocolate Mountain thrust that is thought to superpose the diverse pre-batholithic and batholithic rocks of the Eastern Transverse Ranges above Pelona-type schist. The cataclastic foliation is folded along the length of the Little San Bernardino Mountains in an antiform that is inferred to be cored with Pelona-type schist. This fold may have formed a single antiformal feature comprising all the crystalline-rock antiforms now recognized along the San Andreas fault that are cored by Pelona-type schist. Displacements of the piercing points formed by the antiformal axis apparently indicate 220 km of right-lateral offset on the present San Andreas strand and about 80 km of right-lateral offset along a fragmented older San Andreas strand that consisted of the San Francisquito, Fenner, and Clemens Well faults and a buried extension of this fault beneath the alluvial fill of the valley between the Chocolate and Chuckwalla Mountains...|$|E

Two potential geologic hazards that could impact a dam site upstream from the Thistle dam, however, may be in the area: the Thistle Canyon fault and the Thistle Creek diapiric fold. Uncertainty shrouds the existence of both. The Thistle Canyon fault is a postulated high-angle normal fault that trends about N. 20 degrees E. through Thistle. The fault, downthrown on the east, separates an erosional escarpment formed on the Charleston-Nebo <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> from younger overlying Cretaceous and Tertiary sedimentary rocks. The Thistle Creek diapiric fold theoretically trends about N. 30 degrees E. through the area. Tenuous evidence suggests that the Arapien Shale, an evaporite-rich intrusive sedimentary unit that forms the core of the fold, was overridden by the upper plate of the Charleston-Nebo thrust fault. Since then, the Arapien has welled upward, arching both the <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> and the overlying younger sedimentary cover. Additional field investigations should be completed to determine the existence of these hazards prior to any final decision about a new dam. The presence of either or both of these hazards, however, does not necessarily preclude the construction of a safe and stable dam that would impound a multi-purpose reservoir...|$|R
40|$|Intermediate {{igneous rocks}} exposed in the Badger Pass area and 3. 5 km {{away in the}} McDowell Springs area of Beaverhead County, Montana, {{previously}} mapped as Cretaceous intrusive (Ki), and Cretaceous undifferentiated volcanics (Kvu) respectively, exhibit little geochemical variation. Trace element, and lead isotope analyses provide strong evidence allowing for a single source. REE patterns, obtained through ID-ICP-MS, are essentially identical. Mineral/melt Eu analyses reveal that Eu behaved predominantly as a divalent cation, refuting an earlier study asserting that trivalent Eu dominated. Data suggest rocks were formed under low oxygen activity conditions, not oxidizing conditions as previously reported. Geochemical data combined with field mapping allow us to establish the temporal relationship between late Cretaceous thrusting, intrusion, and volcanism in this locale. Folding, faulting and thrusting were significantly, if not entirely, completed prior to the commencement of volcanism. Volcanism included contemporaneous <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> intrusion, foreland extrusion, and hypabyssal foreland intrusion...|$|R
5000|$|Koelle's {{solution}} to reducing the development time {{was to use}} a cluster of fuel tanks from Redstone and Jupiter missiles, sit them {{on top of a}} single <b>thrust</b> <b>plate,</b> and then attach the required engines {{to the bottom of the}} plate. Calculations demonstrated that a total thrust of about 1 million pounds would be needed, greatly limiting their engine selection. Looking for suitable designs, Koelle learned of the E-1 from Rocketdyne's George Sutton. Rocketdyne was developing this 400000 lbf kN engine for the Titan missile, and it was the largest engine nearing introduction within the time frame that ARPA gave Wernher von Braun to develop what was then known as the [...] "Juno V". The E-1 had originally been developed as a backup engine for the Titan missile, designed specifically to be as simple to develop as possible, in case the Aerojet General LR-87 did not pan out.|$|R
40|$|The {{resorption}} of bone in {{the human}} femur following total hip arthroplasty is recognized {{to be related to}} the loading in the bone surrounding the prosthesis. However, the precise nature of the mechanical signal that influences the biological remodelling activity of the bone is not completely understood. In this study, a validated finite element modelling methodology was combined with a numerical algorithm to simulate the biological changes over time. This was used to produce bone remodelling predictions for an implanted <b>thrust</b> <b>plate</b> prosthesis (Centerpulse Orthopedics Limited) in a patient specific bone model. The analysis was then repeated using different mechanical signals to drive the remodelling algorithm. The results of these simulations were then compared to the patient-specific clinical data, to distinguish which of the candidate signals produced predictions consistent with the clinical evidence. Good agreement was found for a range of strain energy based signals and also deviatoric remodelling signals. The results, however, did not support the use of compressive dilatational strain as a candidate remodelling signa...|$|R
