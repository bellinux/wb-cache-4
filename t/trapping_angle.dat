40|$|The low-latitude {{boundary}} layer (LBL) and its {{separation from the}} cusp have previously been identified using observations of particle precipitation at magnetosheath energies. Using S 3 - 3 satellite observations, we have determined that these identifications can also be made from energetic particle observations on polar-orbiting satellites. It is found that the equatorward boundary of the LBL is identifiable as an approximately discontinuous decrease in 33 -keV electron fluxes from low to high latitudes. Both the energetic ion and electron fluxes decrease discontinuously at {{the boundary between the}} LBL and the cusp or polar cap. A distinct LBL is nearly always identifiable in energetic particle measurements in the 10 - 14 MLT region when counting rates are statistically significant. The identifications obtained using the energetic particle measurements have been compared to those obtained using criteria developed by Newell and Meng (1988, 1989) for magnetosheath energy particle precipitation. In this way, we have evaluated the accuracy of both techniques and used the energetic particle measurements to supplement the identifications obtained using the Newell and Meng criteria. We propose that the Newell and Meng threshold on ion energy flux can be reduced by a factor of 6. This modification provides identification of the LBL for lower ion intensity levels than has previously been thought possible.

Most current microfabricated ion trap designs are based on planar-segmented surface electrodes. Although promising scalability to trap arrays containing ten to one hundred ions, these planar designs suffer from the challenges of shallow trap depths, radial asymmetry of the confining potential, and electrode charging resulting from laser interactions with dielectric surfaces. In this research, the design, fabrication, and testing of a monolithic and symmetric two-level ion trap is presented. This ion trap overcomes the challenges of surface-electrode ion traps. Numerical electrostatic simulations show that this symmetric trap produces a deep (1 eV for 171 Yb+ ion), radially symmetric RF confinement potential.

40|$|AbstractBacteriophage T 4 Lysozyme (T 4 L) catalyzes the {{hydrolysis}} of the peptidoglycan {{layer of}} the bacterial cell wall late in the infection cycle. It has long been postulated that equilibrium dynamics enable substrate access to the active site located at the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains. Crystal structures of WT-T 4 L and point mutants captured a range of conformations that differ by the hinge-bending angle between the two domains. Evidence of equilibrium between open and closed conformations in solution was gleaned from distance measurements between the two domains but {{the nature of the}} equilibrium and the timescale of the underlying motion have not been investigated. Here, we used fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy to directly detect T 4 L equilibrium conformational fluctuations in solution. For this purpose, Tetramethylrhodamine probes were introduced at pairs of cysteines in regions of the molecule that undergo relative displacement upon transition from open to closed conformations. Correlation analysis of Tetramethylrhodamine intensity fluctuations reveals hinge-bending motion that changes the relative distance and orientation of the N- and C-terminal domains with ≅ 15 μs relaxation time. That this motion involves interconversion between open and closed conformations was further confirmed by the dampening of its amplitude upon covalent substrate trapping. In contrast to the prevalent two-state model of T 4 L equilibrium, molecular brightness and number of particles obtained from cumulant analysis suggest that T 4 L populates multiple intermediate states, consistent with the wide range of hinge-bending <b>angles</b> <b>trapped</b> in the crystal structure of T 4 L mutants...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} lutjanid and serranid fishes {{are thought to}} utilise {{tropical}} estuaries as juvenile habitats. However, little detailed biological or life-history information exists for any species, and the species compositions of these families inhabiting tropical estuaries, are poorly known. During this study, the species compositions and life-histories of lutjanid and serranid fishes inhabiting estuaries along the north-eastern coast of tropical Australia were investigated. Using fish-traps, estuary faunas were compared to those inhabiting near-shore reefs. Additional samples were donated by anglers and collected from estuaries by angling. The reproductive statuses, and size and age structures of two serranids (Epinephelus coioides and E. malabaricus) and two lutjanids (Lutjanus russelli and L. argentimaculatus), in estuaries were compared {{to those of the}} same species from offshore. Fish-traps were also used to obtain data on the distribution and abundance by size of L. russelli, E. coioides and E. malabaricus from three estuaries - Cattle, Barramundi and Alligator Creeks - over a two year period. Far fewer species of lutjanids and serranids were trapped from estuaries than from nearshore reefs. While fish-trap and angling collections from estuaries produced 9 species of serranids and 5 species of lutjanids, most were collected in low numbers. Only two serranids (Epinephelus coioides and E. malabaricus) and two lutjanids (Lutjanus russelli and L. argentimaculatus) were common in either <b>trap</b> or <b>angling</b> catches. All fish of each of these species from estuaries were found to be much smaller and younger than the largest and oldest fishes of these species from offshore waters. Furthermore, all fish of each species from estuaries were found to be in pre-reproductive condition. This implies that the estuarine populations of these species consist of juveniles, and that they undergo migrations to offshore adult habitats. Thus they possess three distinct life-history stages (pelagic larvae, estuarine juveniles, offshore adults) that correspond to major habitat shifts. L. russelli were common in all estuaries and distributed throughout the three estuaries studied in detail. The probability of capturing L. russelli was similar in seaward areas of Cattle, Barramundi and Alligator Creeks, remained similar upstream areas of Barramundi Creek, but fell markedly in upstream parts of Cattle Creek. Spatial differences in the size of L. russelli (both within and between estuaries) were small, however, there was a strong pattern of seasonal change in the size of L. russelli in all estuaries. This seasonal pattern was apparently a product of the interaction between recruitment, mortality and migration. Studies in Alligator Creek showed that L. russelli demonstrated a strong preference for structurally complex habitats provided by fallen timbers and mangrove roots. The numbers of both species of Epinephelus in trap catches declined in upstream areas of the three estuaries considered in detail. However, this reduction was much more marked for E. coioides than E. malabaricus, and while in downstream areas, the numbers of E. coioides were similar to or greater than those of E. malabaricus, in upstream areas E. malabaricus dominated. This suggests that the two species differ in their abilities to access or remain in upstream areas of estuaries. There was a strong negative correlation between the maximum deviation of salinity from 'normal' seawater levels and catches of both species of Epinephelus, suggesting that long-term salinity variation may be important in determining the distribution and abundance of Epinephelus spp. within estuaries. The occupation of specific habitats during particular periods of development must be considered in the development of management strategies for these fishes. The use of estuaries as juvenile nursery grounds underlines the importance of maintaining the quality of estuarine habitats. More data from localities further afield (both within Australia and overseas) are needed to determine if the reproductive patterns found here apply to these species in other areas or to related species...|$|R

In the last few years, the number of investigations on active particles has significantly grown, but a general picture connecting the emergence of similar collective behaviors from {{a great variety of}} systems is still lacking. Here, the dynamics of self-propelled rod-like particles in two dimensions is investigated by means of numerical simulations. The main model we use corresponds to Run-and-Tumble particles which move straight for certain time (run), until they randomly change direction of motion (tumble). The sequence of these runs and tumbles leads to a kind of random walk that nicely models the motion of flagellated bacteria like E. coli. We first study the diffusive motion of self-propelled elongated particles in the bulk. In a particular region of the particle length-velocity space, the rotational diffusion coefficient increases with density. This is in strong contrast to the case of passive elongated Brownian particles, where the presence of neighboring particles always diminish each particle's rotational motion. This enhancement of the rotation due to the particle activity can be understood with a simple active-gas picture. In this active-gas approximation, collision events are treated as two-particle point-like collisions, where no mutual alignment is induced. Increasing the particle aspect ratio, collisions among particles induce particle alignment, such that after each collision particles move together for some time, eventually forming larger clusters. The active-gas picture is no longer valid and rotational diffusion decreases with density. Spontaneous segregation of active particles with different velocities in microchannels is also investigated. Self-propelled particles are known to accumulate in the proximity of walls. Here we show how fast particles expel slower ones from channel walls, leading to a segregated state. The mechanism is characterized as a function of particle velocities, particle density, and channel width. In the presence of capillary flow, self-propelled particles show upstream swimming at the channel walls. Since this effect depends on particle motility, we show that the solvent velocity can be tuned to segregate slow and fast particles. Promising applications {{can be found in the}} development of microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices for sorting of particles with different motilities. Finally, the motion of self-propelled particles in microchannels with asymmetric ratchet-like walls is analyzed. The asymmetry of the channel induces a net flux of particles in a determined direction with a flow which shows to be planar. We quantify the average flow velocity as a function of the relevant parameters of the self-propelled particles and the microchannel geometry. The results can be explained in terms of single-particle trajectories in the non-tumbling limit. With increasing particle density, the ratchet effect strongly decreases. Only in some cases, when particles get <b>trapped</b> in acute <b>angles,</b> a semi-dilute system performs better than a dilute one. For two-component systems, the separation of fast and slow particles is approximately proportional to the ratchet effect of single-component systems. Although the channel with ratchet-like walls does not need any imposed flow to separate fast and slow particles along the channel main axis, it turns out to be less effective in separating fast and slow particles compared to a channel with Poiseuille flow. The results presented here are quite general since they are not dependent on the specific details of the self-propelled mechanism. Sample results obtained with run-and-tumble particles have been compared with results obtained with other models. The results we present are of great theoretical and practical interest, and the give new insights into the fascinating world of self-propelled particles and off-equilibrium systems. The presented findings are of particular relevance in the design of microfluidic lab-on-chip devices, where the manipulation, the transport, the control, and the directed motion of particles is achieved without the use of laser fields or other external invasive force fields...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the growing}} demand for marine fish resources, and the {{apparent}} and expected impacts of global climate change, {{there is a need}} to conduct long-term monitoring (LTM) to ensure effective management of resources and conservation of biodiversity. However LTM programmes often suffer from design deficiencies and fail to achieve their objectives. These deficiencies stem from the fact that insufficient consideration is afforded to the design phase, with programmes selecting methods that are not suitable to address the objectives, or are not cost-efficient, compromising the sustainability of the LTM. To facilitate the establishment of LTM programmes along the southern coast of South Africa, background research needed to be conducted to identify which methods were most appropriate for LTM of reef fish. This study presents a detailed field-based assessment of the suitability and cost-efficiency of monitoring methods for long-term monitoring of reef fish in the Agulhas Ecoregion of South Africa. The approach adopted to identify the method, or suite of methods most suited for LTM, involved (i) the selection of methods considered suitable for LTM, (ii) the individual assessment and optimisation of method performance, and (iii) the comparative assessment of the fish community sampled by the different methods. The most suited method(s) were then identified as those that provide the most comprehensive assessment of the fish community and had the highest cost-efficiency. The research was conducted between January 2008 and 2011 in the Tsitsikamma and Table Mountain National Park (TNP and TMNP, respectively) marine protected areas (MPAs) within the Agulhas Ecoregion. The methods selected included fish <b>traps</b> (FT), controlled <b>angling</b> (CA), underwater visual census (UVC), remote underwater video (RUV), baited RUV (BRUV) and remotely operated vehicles (ROV). The individual assessment and optimisation was conducted with the FT, UVC, RUV and BRUV methods. The assessment of the FT method aimed to identify the optimal soak time, and whether or not the size of the funnel entrance to the trap affected the catch. The results identified that larger funnel entrances caught more fish and soak times of 80 minutes produced the highest catches per unit effort. However the data were highly variable and the method detected few of the species typical of the region. Fish traps were also associated with high levels of mortality of fish post-release. The assessment of UVC strip transect method involved directly comparing the precision of data collected by researchers and volunteers using a novel double-observer technique (paired-transects). The results showed considerable error in both the volunteers and researchers data, however the researchers produced significantly higher precision data, compared to the volunteers. The distinction between researchers and volunteers was not evident in the data for the dominant species of fish. For all observers, the abundance of a species in the sample had a significant influence on its detectability, with locally scarce or rare species poorly detected. UVC was able to sample the majority of species typical of reefs in the region, however it appeared plagued by observer and detectability biases. The assessments of RUV and BRUV were conducted simultaneously which enabled the assessment of the effect of bait on the observed fish community. In addition the optimal deployment time for both methods to maximise species richness and abundance was determined. The results showed that BRUV, and to a lesser degree RUV, were able to effectively survey the reef fish community for the region with a 50 minute and 35 minute deployment time, respectively. Baited remote underwater video was especially good at detecting the invertebrate and generalist carnivores, and cartilaginous species. On the other hand, RUV was more effective at surveying the microinvertebrate carnivores. Remote underwater video was characterised by higher data variability, compared to BRUV, and was ultimately considered a less cost-efficient monitoring method. Comparative methods assessments were conducted during two field experiments with the FT, UVC and BRUV methods in the TMNP MPA, and the FT, CA, UVC, RUV, BRUV and ROV methods compared in the TNP MPA. The objectives of the comparison were to investigate differences in the fish communities observed with the different methods, and to determine the power of the data to detect an annual 10 % growth in the fish populations over a period of five years. The results from the method comparison were in turn used to conduct the cost-benefit analysis to determine the efficiency of the different methods at achieving monitoring objectives requiring population data from multiple trophic and functional groups with the community, and from species of fisheries importance. The results indicated that FT, CA and ROV were ineffective at monitoring the reef fish community, although CA appeared to provide valuable data for the dominant fisheries species. Both CA and FT required minimal initial investment however, the variability in the data translated into high annual monitoring costs, as the required sampling effort was great. The ROV required the highest initial investment and was identified as the least cost-efficient method. Underwater visual census was able to adequately survey the bony fish within the community, however it did not detect the cartilaginous species. Underwater visual census required a large initial investment and was not cost-efficient, as a many samples were required to account for the variability in the data. Remote underwater video provided a comprehensive assessment of the reef fish community, however it too was associated with high levels of variability in the data, compared to BRUV, reducing its cost-efficiency. BRUV provided the most comprehensive assessment of the reef fish community and was associated with the highest cost-efficiency to address the community and fisheries species monitoring objectives. During the course of this research stereo-BRUV has gained considerable support as an effective reef fish monitoring method. Although not tested during this research, stereo-BRUV is preferred to BRUV as it provides accurate data on the size of fish. However, the initial investment of stereo-BRUV is over three times that required for the BRUV. Although it is recommended that a baited video technique be used for LTM in the Agulhas Ecoregion, the choice between BRUV and stereo-BRUV will depend on the specific objectives of the programme and the available budget at the implementing agency...|$|R
