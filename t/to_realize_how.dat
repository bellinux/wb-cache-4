For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Cady, Stanton's father, was a {{prominent}} Federalist attorney who served one term in the United States Congress (1814–1817) and then became both a circuit court judge and, in 1847, a New York Supreme Court justice. Judge Cady introduced his daughter to the law and, together with her brother-in-law, Edward Bayard, planted the early seeds that grew into her legal and social activism. Even as a young girl, she enjoyed reading her father's law books and debating legal issues with his law clerks. It was this early exposure to law that, in part, caused Stanton <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> disproportionately the law favored men over women, particularly married women. Her realization that married women had virtually no property, income, employment, or even custody rights over their own children, helped set her course toward changing these inequities.|$|E

Current research, therefore, {{has focused on the}} development of a vaccine that could be integrated into existing control programs. The goal of vaccine development is not necessarily to create a vaccine with sterilizing immunity or complete protection against immunity.

Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a celestial sphere. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the obliquity of the Zodiac as the Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder reports in Natural History (II, 8). It is a little early to use the term ecliptic, but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The doxographer and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity.|$|E

The case was involving {{one of the young}} Dubois brothers and a merchant from St. Henri who had been beaten after he had refused to pay his daily receipt to the brothers’ hold up men. Mercier believed that the Dubois Brothers were getting help from someone on the inside as the victim was almost sentenced and the Dubois brother had only received a small fine. The Dubois Brothers also received permits, swung votes to which person they wanted through intimidation and were able to get judges to give reduced sentences. They had corrupted a journalist in order to have the journalist change information they needed and report information they wanted out but with his change of careers, due to the company finding out about his corruption, the Dubois Brothers turned him into their lawyer opening an office and giving them legal information. They were able to corrupt politicians, the police, judges and lawyers according to Mercier causing them a vast integration into society.|$|E

Flying home after visiting the Guantanamo Bay detention center he said September 10, 2006 he expects bipartisan support for putting top captured al-Qaeda figures on trial before military commissions and for guidelines on how they should be treated. Frist visited the detention center in eastern Cuba, which holds some 460 detainees, including 14 top alleged al-Qaida figures recently transferred from CIA custody. He stated that his visit with fellow Republicans Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, was especially poignant coming one day short of {{the fifth anniversary of}} the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. Frist said that visiting the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center, and recognizing that the 14 individuals who likely contributed to the September 11, 2001 attacks were there, led him <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> critical it is that the U.S. define the appropriate criteria {{to make sure that the}} government have the information to prevent such a tragedy from occurring again. The senators didn't see the 14 new detainees, but visited Guantanamo to learn of the interrogation techniques. In his mind, the detainees are being treated in a safe and humane way.|$|E

Gracie believed that Bedtime Stories was an album with [...] "timeless sound" [...] and signified an evolution of Madonna as an artist, acting as the front-runner to her more experimental album like Ray of Light (1998).

500|$|Her humour {{comes from}} her modesty {{and lack of}} superiority, {{allowing}} her most successful characters, such as Elizabeth Bennet, to transcend the trivialities of life, which the more foolish characters are overly absorbed in. Austen used comedy to explore the individualism of women's lives and gender relations, and she appears to have used it to find the goodness in life, often fusing it with [...] "ethical sensibility", creating artistic tension. Critic Robert Polhemus writes, [...] "To appreciate the drama and achievement of Austen, we need <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> deep was her passion for both reverence and ridicule... and her comic imagination reveals both the harmonies and the telling contradictions of her mind and vision {{as she tries to}} reconcile her satirical bias with her sense of the good." ...|$|E

500|$|From 1940 to 1946, the Bears {{displayed}} their {{dominance in}} the game, playing in five NFL championship games, winning four, and posted a 54–17–3 regular season record. In 1942, the Bears posted a perfect 11–0record and outscored their opponents, 376–84, however they lost the championship game to the Redskins. Although the T-formation had been used many years before Luckman joined the Chicago Bears, he was central to Chicago's successful use of this style of play because of his game-sense and versatility. Perfecting Halas' complex offensive scheme of fakes, men in motion, and quick hitting runs, Luckman added the dimension of accurate downfield throwing. He was instrumental in his team's record-setting 73–0 win over the Washington Redskins in the 1940 NFL championship game. Sportscaster Jimmy Cannon once said in reference to Luckman's years at Columbia, [...] "You {{had to be there}} <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> great Sid was."

The Denver Post Lisa Kennedy praised the depiction of the robots as having [...] "a believably rendered scale and intimacy", and ABC presenter Margaret Pomeranz was surprised [...] "that a complete newcomer to the Transformers phenomenon like myself became involved in the fate of these mega-machines". Ain't It Cool News's Drew McWeeny felt most of the cast grounded the story, and that [...] "it has a real sense of wonder, one of the things that's missing from so much of the big CGI lightshows released these days". Author Peter David found it ludicrous fun, and said that [...] " [...] manages to hold on to his audience's suspension of disbelief long enough for us to segue into some truly spectacular battle scenes". Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, giving it 3 stars out of a possible 4, writing: [...] "It's goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good, and it has the grace not only <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> preposterous it is, but to make that into an asset." ...|$|E
