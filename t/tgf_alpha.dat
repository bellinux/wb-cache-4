We now show that further purification of crude SGF by reverse-phase HPLC on muBondapak C 18 and CN columns at pH 2 resolves it into two distinctly different polypeptides, which we call types alpha and beta transforming growth factors (<b>TGFs).</b> Type <b>alpha</b> <b>TGF</b> (TGF-alpha), but not type beta TGF (TGF-beta), competes for binding to the EGF receptor and induces the formation of small colonies (1, 000 - 2, 000 micron 2) of normal rat kidney cells in soft agar. Both TGF-beta and EGF or TGF-alpha must be present in order to induce the formation of large colonies (7, 000 - 15, 000 micron 2). Based on EGF competing equivalents as determined from a radioreceptor assay with 125 I-labeled EGF in normal rat kidney cells, the relative ability of EGF and TGF-alpha to potentiate TGF-beta-dependent colony formation is in the order conditioned-medium TGF-alpha greater than EGF greater than intracellular TGF-alpha. Suboptimal concentrations of the same polypeptides give additive potentiation of the TGF-beta-dependent colony-forming response; saturating levels potentiate a similar maximum response whether used alone or in various combinations. The data indicate that the EGF-competing activity of crude SGF is due to its TGF-alpha component alone, whereas the soft-agar colony-forming activity {{is due to the}} combined action of two distinct polypeptides, TGF-alpha and TGF-beta...|$|R

Epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation in psoriasis may be linked by those cytokines many of which are produced by both keratinocytes and leukocytes. Epidermal acanthosis and keratinocyte mitoses have been observed in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and after the intradermal injection of gamma interferon. Gamma interferon and its induced proteins have been demonstrated in active psoriatic plaques. Increased levels of the keratinocyte autocrine cytokines, transforming growth factor (<b>TGF)</b> - <b>alpha</b> and interleukin (IL) - 6, have been detected in active plaques. The apparent overexpression of IL- 6 in hyperplastic psoriatic tissue may explain features of psoriasis that link keratinocyte proliferation with immune activation and tissue inflammation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Alkali burn is a {{frequently}} occurring {{ocular injury}} that resembles ocular inflammation caused by eye allergies, infection, and refractive surgeries. METHODS: We investigated the synergistic regenerative potential of dominant negative survivin mutant (SurR 9 -C 84 A) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin-A (TSA) against alkali burn and corneal haze using human keratocytes and rabbit alkali burn model (Female New Zealand white rabbits). RESULTS: Combination of SurR 9 -C 84 A and TSA suppressed levels of transforming growth factor (<b>TGF)</b> -β, <b>alpha</b> smooth-muscle actin (α-SMA), fibronectin and HDAC 1, leading to apoptosis in myofibroblast cells and, showed {{the potential to}} clear the corneal haze. An insult with 0. 5 N NaOH for 1 min led to neutrophils infiltration and formation of large vacuoles in the stroma. Treatments with TSA and SurR 9 -C 84 A for 40 min led to improvement in the conjunctival and corneal tissue integrity, marked {{by an increase in}} clathrin, and claudin expressions. An increase in TGF-β and endogenous survivin confirmed wound healing and cell proliferation in rabbit cornea. The blood analysis revealed a substantial decrease in the RBC, WBC, platelets, or the hemoglobin content post alkali burn. The cytokine array analysis revealed that NaOH induced expressions of IL- 1 α and MMP- 9, which were found to be significantly downregulated (1. 8 and 11. 5 fold respectively) by the combinatorial treatment of SurR 9 -C 84 A and TSA. CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed that combination of SurR 9 -C 84 A with TSA worked in synergy to heal ocular injury and inflammations due to alkali burn and led to the regeneration of ocular tissue by increasing clathrin, claudin, survivin, and TGF-β and reversal of alkali burn by suppressing IL- 1 α and MMP- 9 without inducing haze...|$|R

Here we describe the first application of a network inference approach integrating transcriptional, metabolic and phenotypic information representative of wild populations of the European flounder fish, sampled at seven estuarine locations in northern Europe with different degrees and profiles of chemical contaminants. We identified network modules, whose activity was predictive of environmental exposure and represented a link between molecular and morphometric indices.

40|$|Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) is characterised by {{an accumulation}} of cells ('LCH cells') with the same phenotypic features as normal Langerhans cells found in skin and other organs. The pathogenesis of LCH is unknown but there is increasing evidence to implicate the involvement of lymphokines and proinflammatory cytokines in the tissue damage seen in this disorder. Apart from histiocytes, the lesions contain giant cells, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells and occasional mast cells that are the hallmark of an inflammatory process. The role of cytokines in the recruitment of haemopoietic cells within inflammatory lesions has only recently been recognised. In this article, we review the possible role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of LCH, and {{provide an overview of}} the methods currently used to detect and quantitate them. An appreciation of the type, distribution and amount of different cytokines released within lesions can provide clues to the possible aetiology of LCH.

Currently, it is not clear which factors determine progression to fibrosis. We investigated whether DNA profile as determined by pyrosequencing can distinguish patients with mild from those with advanced/severe fibrosis in non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD). To this end, paraffin-embedded liverbiopsies were collected from patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD or ALD, as well as paraffin-embedded normal liver resections, genomic DNA isolated, bisulfite converted and pyrosequencing assays used to quantify DNA methylation at specific CpGs within PPAR <b>alpha,</b> PPAR <b>alpha,</b> <b>TGF</b> beta 1, Collagen 1 A 1 and PDGF alpha genes.

In normal liver, age, gender or anatomical location had no significant impact on DNA methylation patterns in the liver.

40|$|AbstractAlthough the multifactorial {{nature of}} {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) is well recognized, genetic {{factors have been}} found to be strong determinants of the disease. Evidence of a genetic influence of OA comes from a number of sources, including epidemiological studies of family history and family clustering, twin studies, and exploration of rare genetic disorders. Classic twin studies have shown that the influence of genetic factors is between 39 % and 65 % in radiographic OA of the hand and knee in women, about 60 % in OA of the hip, and about 70 % in OA of the spine. Taken together, these estimates suggest a heritability of OA of 50 % or more, indicating that half the variation in susceptibility to disease in the population is explained by genetic factors. Studies have implicated linkages to OA on chromosomes 2 q, 9 q, 11 q, and 16 p, among others. Genes implicated in association studies include VDR, AGC 1, IGF- 1, ER <b>alpha,</b> <b>TGF</b> beta, CRTM (cartilage matrix protein), CRTL (cartilage link protein), and collagen II, IX, and XI.

50|$|EGFR is over-expressed by many tumor cells. Upon binding by a ligand, {{such as the}} {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} or <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha,</b> dimerization occurs, leading to autophosphorylation on the intracellular tyrosine residues. Following phosphorylation, the Grb2-SOS signaling complex is stimulated. This causes the activation of the G protein RAS through the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The exchange of GDP for GTP induces a conformational change of RAS {{to allow it to}} bind to Raf-1. Raf-1 is then activated through another multistep mechanism in which dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), as well as the phosphorylation of activating sites by p21 activated kinase (PAK) occurs. After this, Raf-1 activates MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which then goes on to activate extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). ERK is then able to enter the cell nucleus and control gene expression by phosphorylating various transcription factors, such as Elk-1. It is from there that the specific gene transcription occurs to initiate the cell cycle. Through this mechanisam, apoptosis is inhibited, angiogenesis, migration, adhesion, and invasion occur. Each of these is a functional element to the progression and development of cancer, which is defined as an abnormal growth of cells with a tendency to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to metastasize.|$|E

RUNX 2 attenuates growth and stimulates maturation of osteoblasts during bone formation but is also robustly expressed in a subset of osteosarcomas, {{as well as in}} metastatic breast and prostate tumors. To assess the biological function of RUNX 2 in osteosarcoma cells, we examined human genomic promoter interactions for RUNX 2 using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) -microarray analysis in SAOS- 2 cells. Promoter binding of both RUNX 2 and RNA polymerase II was compared with gene expression profiles of cells in which RUNX 2 was depleted by RNA interference. Many RUNX 2 -bound loci (1550 of 2339 total) exhibit promoter occupancy by RNA polymerase II and contain the RUNX consensus motif 5 '-((T/A/C) G(T/A/C) GG(T/G).

In the present study we have used the ER down-regulator fulvestrant (''Faslodex'') to investigate {{the influence of the}} ER on growth of a tamoxifen-resistant (TAM-R) human breast cancer cell line. Expression levels of ER mRNA and protein were equivalent in parental wild-type MCF- 7 (WT) and TAM-R cells. Fulvestrant eliminated ER protein expression and inhibited proliferation in both cell lines. The growth inhibitory effects of fulvestrant were associated with a decrease in basal EGFR, c-erbB 2 and ERK 1 / 2 activity in TAM-R but not WT cells. ER functionality as determined by oestrogen response element (ERE) -luciferase reporter activity and expression of PgR, pS 2 and transforming growth factor <b>alpha</b> (<b>TGF)</b> was significantly reduced in TAM-R compared to WT cells and was further decreased by fulvestrant treatment in both cell lines. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and TGF significantly increased EGFR/MAPK pathway activity in both cell lines. Ligand-induced EGFR/MAPK activation promoted TAM-R cell growth in both the absence and presence of fulvestrant, whereas no proliferative activity was observed under the same conditions in WT cells. These results suggest that the ER modulates EGFR/MAPK signalling efficiency in TAM-R cells possibly through the regulation of TGF availability. This effect may be overcome by the action of exogenous EGFR ligands, which strengthen EGFR/MAPK signalling activity to generate endocrine-insensitive cell growth...|$|R

MDA-MB- 231 cells were stably transfected with ER cDNA and clones were screened by estrogen response element (ERE) -luciferase assay and ER mRNA expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Three stable MDA-MB- 231 /ER clones were compared with S 30 cells with respect to their growth properties, ability to activate ERE- and activating protein- 1 (AP- 1) luciferase reporter constructs, and the ability to activate the endogenous ER-regulated transforming growth factor <b>alpha</b> (<b>TGF)</b> gene. ER 6 and ER 27 clones express 300 – 400 -fold and the ER 41 clone express 1600 -fold higher ER mRNA levels compared with untransfected MDA-MB- 231 cells. Unlike S 30 cells, 17 -estradiol (E 2) does not inhibit ER 41 cell growth.

In pancreas, <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> itself was not oncogenic, but it nevertheless dramatically accelerated growth of tumors induced by either oncogene alone, {{thereby reducing the}} host life span up to 60 %. Coexpression of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> and TAg produced an early synergistic growth response in the entire pancreas together with the more rapid appearance of preneoplastic foci. Coexpression of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> and c-myc also accelerated tumor growth in situ and produced transplantable acinar cell carcinomas whose rate of growth was <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> dependent. In liver, expression of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> alone increased the incidence of hepatic cancer in aged mice. However, coexpression of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> with c-myc or TAg markedly reduced tumor latency and accelerated tumor growth. Significantly, expression of the <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> and myc transgenes in hepatic tumors was induced up to 20 -fold relative to expression in surrounding nonneoplastic liver, suggesting that high-level overexpression of these proteins acts as a major stimulus for tumor development.

Assessments of follicular growth were performed primarily using [3 H]-thymidine incorporation assays, while survival was assessed using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 3, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), DNA degradation and vital staining assays. Basal [3 H]-thymidine incorporation was significantly higher in F 5, 6 (smallest follicles in follicular hierarchy versus F 1 (largest follicle in follicular hierarchy) granulosa cells while the opposite was observed for MTT metabolism. LH stimulated [3 H]-thymidine incorporation in F 5, 6 cells, while inhibiting [3 H]-thymidine incorporation in F 1 cells. In contrast, (TGF a) stimulated [3 H]-thymidine incorporation in F 1 cells and to a lesser extent, F 5, 6 cells. TNF a had no apparent effect on basal, LH- or TGF a -induced [3 H]-thymidine incorporation in either F 1 or F 5, 6 granulosa cells. In addition, while neither TNF a nor TGF a alone affected the viability of cultured granulosa cells from either developmental stage, in the presence of both factors an increase in MTT metabolism occurred in F 5, 6 but not F 1 granulosa cells. In contrast to the TNF a -TGF a studies, interactions between TNF a and Cch were not observed irrespective of the stage of follicular development and the rate of MTT metabolism was not affected by either factor. F 5, 6 cell viability in vitro decreased with time in the presence of TNF a or TGF a while the combination of these intraovarian regulators significantly delayed this decrease. In contrast, only TGF a increased MTT metabolism in sparsely cultured F 5, 6 granulosa cells during the first 24 hours of culture, after which time no significant changes were observed. TGF a also significantly decreased the amount of DNA fragmentation, while TNF a had no significant effect in the presence or absence of the growth factor. In conclusion, the objective of this research was to study TNF a and its interactions with Cch, TGF a and LH in the regulation of granulosa cell fate, ie proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, as well as the possible signalling mechanisms involved during follicular development.

Pretreatment with orogastric <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> (200 micrograms/kg) only partially (40 %) decreased macroscopic ethanol damage. Intraperitoneal administration of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg, which does not significantly inhibit gastric acid secretion, decreased aspirin-induced macroscopic damage by > 80 %. <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> protection {{does not seem to be}} mediated by prostaglandin, glutathione, or ornithine decarboxylase-related events, as evidenced by lack of influence of the inhibition of their production. Pretreatment with the sulfhydryl blocking agent N-ethylmaleimide partially abolished (40 %) the protective effect of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha.</b> In addition, systemic administration of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> resulted in a two-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 and in a time- and dose-dependent increase in levels of immunoreactive insoluble gastric mucin; these events occurred in a time frame consistent with their participation in the protective effect of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha...</b>|$|E
40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} alpha (<b>TGF</b> <b>alpha)</b> is a 5. 6 kd {{single-chain}} polypeptide that acts through binding to the {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR). <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> is produced {{in a wide range}} of normal as well as embryonic and neoplastic cells and tissues. <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> and EGFR, but not EGF, are expressed in normal gastric mucosa. We have identified the following biological roles for <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> in the stomach, using a variety of primate and rodent models: inhibition of acid secretion; stimulation of mucous cell growth; protection against ethanol- and aspirin-induced injury. This last effect is associated with a time- and dose-dependent increase in levels of insoluble gastric mucin. Based on these known biological actions of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha,</b> we have examined <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> production in Ménétrier's disease, a disorder characterized by foveolar hyperplasia, hypochlorhydria, and increased gastric mucin content. In four patients with Ménétrier's disease, there was enhanced <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> immunostaining throughout the gastric mucosa. Furthermore, metallothionein (MT) -TGF alpha transgenic mice which overproduce <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> in the stomach exhibit histopathological and biochemical features characteristic of and consistent with the diagnosis of Ménétrier's disease. Thus locally produced <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> may mediate a number of biological processes in the stomach, and its altered production may participate in the pathogenesis of selected pathological states...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of the {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} alpha (<b>TGF</b> <b>alpha)</b> cDNA {{predicts that the}} mature <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> polypeptide is cleaved from the extracellular domain of its precursor, which is an integral membrane protein. Furthermore, the cleavage sites for the release of this mitogen are compatible with the participation of an elastaselike protease. We have immunohistochemically localized <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> to the vascular smooth muscle cells in the arterioles. To investigate whether polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytic elastase, a blood-borne protease, could process the cell surface <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha,</b> NR 6 cells were transfected with the rat <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> cDNA. The cDNA encoded the entire open reading frame, and its expression was {{under the control of the}} mouse metallothionein I promoter. A cloned transfectant, termed 1 B 2, synthesized the <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> precursor in a zinc-inducible manner, and the precursor was localized to the cell surface. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis indicated that treatment of the zinc-induced 1 B 2 cells with either PMN leukocytic or pancreatic elastase resulted in the release of the mature <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> polypeptide. The released <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> was bioactive, as it was capable of both competing with epidermal growth factor for binding to its receptor and stimulating [3 H]thymidine incorporation in the mitogenic assay. Formaldehyde fixation of the 1 B 2 cells eliminated basal release of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> but allowed normal processing by both PMN leukocytic and pancreatic elastase to occur. However, human cathepsin G, bovine pancreatic alpha 1 -chymotrypsin, collagenase, trypsin, subtilisin, and plasmin failed to release any detectable fragments of the <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> precursor from the fixed cells. The location of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> in the arterioles and ability of PMN leukocytic elastase to process the membrane-bound <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> precursor suggests a novel role for this elastase at the wound site...|$|E
40|$|Background. Transforming {{growth factor}} alpha (<b>TGF</b> <b>alpha)</b> is an {{important}} mitogen that binds to epidermal growth factor receptor and {{is associated with the}} development of several tumors. Aims. Assessment of the immunoexpression of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in non-neoplastic liver tissue and its relationship to morphological patterns of HCC. Material and methods. The immunohistochemical expression of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> was studied in 47 cases of HCC (27 multinodular, 20 nodular lesions). Five lesions measured up to 5 cm and 15 lesions above 5 cm. Thirty-two cases were graded as I or II and 15 as III or IV. The non-neoplastic tissue was examined in 40 cases, of which 22 had cirrhosis. HBsAg and anti-HCV were positive in 5 / 38 and 15 / 37 patients, respectively. The statistical analysis for possible association of immunostaining of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> and pathological features was performed through chi-square test. Results. <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> was detected in 31. 9 % of the HCC and in 42. 5 % of the non-neoplastic. There was a statistically significant association between the expression of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> and cirrhosis (OR = 8. 75, 95 % CI = [1. 93, 39. 75]). The <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> was detected more frequently in patients anti-HCV(+) than in those HBsAg(+). The immunoexpression of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> was not found related to tumor size or differentiation. In conclusion the <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> is present in hepatocarcinogenesis in HBV negative patients. Further analysis is needed to examine the involvement of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> in the carcinogenesis associated with HCV and other possible agents. In addition, <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> has an higher expression in hepatocyte regeneration and proliferation in cirrhotic livers than in HCC. CAPES/PROAPCAPES (PROAP...|$|E
40|$|Many {{carcinoma}} {{cells secrete}} {{transforming growth factor alpha}} (<b>TGF</b> <b>alpha).</b> A 23 base anti-sense oligonucleotide that recognizes the <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> mRNA inhibits both DNA synthesis and {{the proliferation of}} the colon carcinoma cell line LIM 1215. The effects of the anti-sense <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> oligonucleotide are reversed by epidermal growth factor (EGF) at 20 ng/ml. When the LIM 1215 cells are grown under serum free conditions, the anti-sense <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> oligonucleotides have their greatest effects at high cell density (2 x 10 (5) cells/cm 2), indicating that the secreted <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> is acting as an exogenous growth stimulus. In addition, at higher cell densities, the kinase activity of the EGF receptor is activated and the receptor is down-modulated. The cell density dependent activation of the EGF receptor is inhibited by the application of the antisense <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> oligonucleotides...|$|E
40|$|Psychosocial {{factors are}} thought to {{influence}} risk and survival from cancer. We have previously studied specific behaviours in transgenic male CD- 1 MT 42 mice, which overexpress the gene encoding human {{transforming growth factor alpha}} (<b>TGF</b> <b>alpha)</b> in multiple tissues, and which develop a high incidence of spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma. The male <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> mice spent a lengthened time immobile in the swim test, were highly aggressive, had increased plasma levels of 17 beta-estradiol (E 2), and reduced natural killer (NK) cell activity. The female transgenic MT 42 <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> mice do not develop an increased rate of tumours at any site. We hypothesised that if the alterations in male <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> mice are associated with their development of hepatocellular carcinomas, female <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> should not show these alterations. The data in the present study indicate that female <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> mice display shortened immobility in the swim test, suggesting an improved ability to cope with stress, and appear less aggressive in the resident-intruder test than non-transgenic female CD- 1 mice. The female <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> mice also exhibit a 3 -fold increase in the plasma levels of E 2, and a 3 -fold increase in NK cell activity. These findings suggest that the elevated expression of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> in the transgenic mice is associated with gender-specific behavioural alterations, and the development of spontaneous hepatocellular tumours in the males. Furthermore, <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> alters hormonal and immune parameters similarly in both sexes. It remains to be determined whether the development of hepatocarcinoma in the male <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> animals is associated with an impaired ability to cope with stress and elevated aggressive tendencies and/or whether manipulations leading to an impaired ability to cope with stress will promote tumourigenesis in female <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> mice...|$|E
40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} alpha (<b>TGF</b> <b>alpha)</b> shares with {{epidermal}} growth factor (EGF) structural homology (35 %), a common cell-surface membrane receptor (TGF alpha/EGF receptor), and a nearly identical spectrum of biological activity, including inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Herein, we report expression of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> mRNA in normal gastric mucosa of the adult guinea pig, rat, and dog. <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> mRNA was also detected in matched surgically resected gastric mucosa and adjacent gastric carcinoma from 10 patients, and in gastric mucosa adjacent to a benign ulcer from an additional patient. <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> protein was quantitated by radioimmunoassay and was present in tumor and adjacent mucosa. TGF alpha/EGF receptor mRNA was also detected in gastric mucosa from all species studied. Localization of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> and TGF alpha/EGF receptor mRNA expression was examined in samples of unfractionated guinea pig gastric mucosa and from chief cell-enriched and parietal cell-enriched fractions. All samples exhibited <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> and TGF alpha/EGF receptor expression. The <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> signal was greatest in the parietal cell fraction (5. 8 -fold increase), but was also enhanced in the chief cell fraction (1. 9 -fold increase) relative to the unfractionated gastric mucosa. Like <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> expression, TGF alpha/EGF receptor mRNA expression was most intense in the parietal cell-enriched fraction (7. 8 -fold increase), but was also increased in the chief cell-enriched fraction (2. 7 -fold increase) relative to the unfractionated guinea pig gastric mucosa. We conclude that <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> and TGF alpha/EGF receptor genes are expressed in normal adult mammalian gastric mucosa. These findings, when interpreted in light of described actions of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> and EGF, provide evidence that local production of <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> could {{play an important role}} in the regulation of acid secretion and mucosal renewal in the stomach...|$|E
40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} alpha (<b>TGF</b> <b>alpha)</b> is a growth factor {{produced}} by colon cancer cells which may {{function as an}} autocrine growth regulator. Therefore, the proliferation and transformation of colon cancer cells might be attenuated by blocking the production of endogenous <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha.</b> GEO cells, from a human colon carcinoma cell line that expresses <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> and functional epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, were infected with a replication-defective, recombinant amphotropic retroviral expression vector containing the neomycin-resistance gene and a 435 -bp ApaI-EcoRI coding fragment of the human <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> cDNA oriented in the 3 ' to 5 ' direction under the transcriptional control of the heavy-metal-inducible mouse metallothionein I promoter. Following antibiotic selection, G 418 -resistant colonies were pooled and expanded into a cell line (GEO <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> AS cells). A 50 to 70 % inhibition {{in the production of}} secreted and cell-associated <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> protein was observed in GEO <b>TGF</b> <b>alpha</b> AS cells that had been maintained in CdCl 2 -supplemented medium.

In contrast, CdCl 2 treatment of parental GEO cells had no significant effect upon these parameters.
