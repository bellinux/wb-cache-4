2500|$|Typical of {{a western}} state, Oregon {{is home to a}} unique and diverse array of wildlife. Roughly 60 percent of the state is covered in forest, while the areas west of the Cascades are more densely {{populated}} by forest, making up around 80percent of the landscape. Some 60percent of Oregon's forests are within federal land. Oregon is the <b>top</b> <b>timber</b> producer of the lower 48 states.|$|R
50|$|Humboldt County {{is known}} for its {{impressive}} redwood trees, and many acres of private redwood timberland make Humboldt the <b>top</b> <b>timber</b> producer in California. The lush river bottoms adjacent to the ocean are renowned for producing rich, high-quality dairy products. Somewhat more inland the warmer valleys have historically produced abundant apples and other fruit. More recently vineyards have been planted in the Trinity, Klamath, Mattole and upper Eel river valleys.|$|R

5000|$|Class C: The {{soft ground}} of the tidal valleys at Weston Mill, Forder, Wivelscombe, and Nottar {{required}} a lighter structure. This was achieved by dispensing with the stone piers and replacing them with vertical timber trestles built on <b>top</b> of <b>timber</b> piles driven into the mud. There were no fans supporting the track, instead timber trusses were built directly on <b>top</b> of the <b>timber</b> trestles.|$|R
25|$|Because of its diverse {{landscapes and}} waterways, Oregon's economy is largely powered by {{various forms of}} agriculture, fishing, and {{hydroelectric}} power. Oregon is also the <b>top</b> <b>timber</b> producer of the contiguous United States, and the timber industry dominated the state's economy in the 20thcentury. Technology is another one of Oregon's major economic forces, beginning in the 1970s {{with the establishment of}} the Silicon Forest and the expansion of Tektronix and Intel. Sportswear company Nike, Inc., headquartered in Beaverton, is the state's largest public corporation with an annual revenue of $30.6billion.|$|R
2500|$|As {{submitted}} by Dolliver & Sleeper - [...] "Only a practised mechanical eye could detect a little inequality in her sides, in consequence of her {{having had a}} heel to port. We have replaced the keel, sternpost, stern-knee, part of the keelson, all the floor timbers, most of the first futtocks and the garboard strake on the starboard side; but the stem and fore-foot, the <b>top</b> <b>timbers</b> and deck are gone.

5000|$|In wooden shipbuilding, each {{frame is}} {{composed}} of several sections, so that {{the grain of the}} wood can follow the curve of the frame. Starting from the keel, these are the floor (which crosses the keel and joins the frame to the keel), the first futtock, the second futtock, the <b>top</b> <b>timber,</b> and the rail stanchion. [...] In steel shipbuilding, the entire frame can be formed in one piece by rivetting or welding sections; in this case the floor remains a separate piece, joining the frame on each side to the keel.|$|R

The oak floors were reserved for the ends, and were both sided and molded 8 inches. Her <b>top</b> <b>timbers</b> (which were of spruce and extended from a log that formed the bridge to the deck) were sided 6 inches and molded at heel, and both sided and molded 4 inches at the head. She had no guards when first built and was steered by a tiller. Her draft of water was 28 inches.|$|R
