50|$|On Anvers Island, <b>the</b> British <b>Antarctic</b> Survey {{built and}} {{operated}} a station (Base N) {{for the purpose}} of survey and geology.

In 1958, the station of <b>the</b> British <b>Antarctic</b> Survey was closed when local work was completed. The hut of station of <b>the</b> British <b>Antarctic</b> Survey was loaned to the U.S. Government on July 2, 1963, which converted it into a biological laboratory in January 1965 for use by American scientists at the nearby Palmer Station. The station of <b>the</b> British <b>Antarctic</b> Survey was open in support of an air facility from 1969 until 1971.

5|$|Antarctica is {{intensely}} {{cold and}} arid. Most of the world's freshwater ice is contained within its sheets. Its most dramatic example of glacier retreat {{is the loss}} of large sections of the Larsen Ice Shelf on <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula. The recent collapse of Wordie Ice Shelf, Prince Gustav Ice Shelf, Mueller Ice Shelf, Jones Ice Shelf, Larsen-A and Larsen-B Ice Shelf on <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula has raised awareness of how dynamic ice shelf systems are.|$|E
5|$|Between 1839 and 1843 Royal Naval Captain James Clark Ross, {{commanding}} his {{two ships}} HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, completed three voyages to <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> continent.

5|$|Emilio Marcos Palma was {{the first}} person born south of the 60th {{parallel}} south (the continental limit according to <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> Treaty), as well as the first one born on <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> mainland, in 1978 at Base Esperanza, on the tip of <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula; his parents were sent there along with seven other families by the Argentine government to determine if the continent was suitable for family life. In 1984, Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Frei Montalva Station, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station. As of 2009, eleven children were born in Antarctica (south of the 60th parallel south): eight at the Argentine Esperanza Base and three at the Chilean Frei Montalva Station.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic,</b> {{species were}} found in the South Shetland Islands, South Orkney Islands, South Georgia and <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula. Species from <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> or subantarctic regions are rarer than {{specimens}} in the Arctic regions, although lack of access may be a factor. Until 1983, only five records were made, with only individual finds since then. According to two studies of the myxomycete flora of these regions, more species were discovered in the subantarctic forests, for example 67 species in Argentinian Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, and 22 on high ground on Macquarie Island.|$|E

5|$|A 1993 review {{estimated}} that the macaroni was the most abundant species of penguin, {{with a minimum of}} 11,841,600 pairs worldwide. Macaroni penguins range from the Subantarctic to <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula; at least 216 breeding colonies at 50 sites have been recorded. In South America, macaroni penguins are found in southern Chile, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and South Orkney Islands. They also occupy much of Antarctica and <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula, including the northern South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island, the Prince Edward and Marion islands, the Crozet Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Heard and McDonald Islands. While foraging for food, groups will range north to the islands off Australia, New Zealand, southern Brazil, Tristan da Cunha, and South Africa.|$|E

In 1894 he joined a commercial expedition, led by Henryk Bull in the whaler Antarctic, which penetrated Antarctic waters and reached Cape Adare, the western portal to the Ross Sea. A party including Bull and Borchgrevink briefly landed there and {{claimed to be the}} first men to set foot on <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> continent—although the American sealer John Davis believed he had landed on <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> Peninsula in 1821. They also visited Possession Island in the Ross Sea, leaving a message in a tin box as proof of their journey. Borchgrevink was convinced that the Cape Adare location, with its huge penguin rookery providing a ready supply of fresh food and blubber, could serve as a base at which a future expedition could overwinter and subsequently explore <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> interior.|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} {{claims to the}} contrary, Caroline Island {{was not the first}} point of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs to a point of land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> Circle, and the area beyond <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> Circle is affected by the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric refraction effects.|$|E
