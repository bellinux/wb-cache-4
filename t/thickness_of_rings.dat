40|$|The {{performance}} of highly multiplexed spectrographs {{is limited by}} focal ratio degradation (FRD) in the optical fibres. It has already been shown that this is caused mainly by processes concentrated around the mounting points {{at the ends of}} the fibres. We use the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>rings</b> produced in the far-field when a fibre is illuminated by a collimated beam, to estimate the size of the region where the FRD is generated. This requires {{the development of a new}} model, using features of existing ray-tracing and wave-based models, which fits existing data very well. The results suggest that the amount of FRD is primarily determined by the length of fibre bonded into the supporting ferrule. We point out the implications for the production of future fibre systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{collision}} behaviour {{of three}} types of circular aluminium rings was experimentally studied in this paper. A specially designed ﬁxture attached to the barrel of an air gun was employed for the lateral impact of ﬂying rings on a rigid target. The force history, deformation mechanisms and rebounding velocity of the rings, {{as well as their}} dependence on the wall <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>rings</b> and initial impact velocity were extensively investigated. The results showed that larger initial velocity and greater nondimensional thickness led to larger magnitude of peak force. With the increase of initial velocity, the rebounding velocity ﬁrst increased to a maximum value and then dropped, while the coefﬁcient of restitution ﬁrst decreased almost linearly and then levelled off at a lower level. However, the wall thickness of the ring only has a limited inﬂuence on both the rebounding velocity and the coefﬁcient of restitution within the studied range. A six-hinge deformation mechanism was identiﬁed based on the four-phase deformation mode of the ring during its collision, which was captured in high speed camera recordings. Furthermore, it was observed that the impact force history was highly related to the deformation mode...|$|E

We measured the velocity of EHD flow with electrodes configuration of Pin- Dual Ring Concentric and compare the result to Pin-Single Ring electrodes. The pin needle was made by stainless steel with a length of 50 mm and a tip diameter of 0. 01 mm. The dual ring electrodes constructed by two metal material connected to each other with diameter of 24 mm and width of 16 mm. The <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>rings</b> is 2 mm and 3 mm, respectively. Single ring electrode has diameter, width and thickness of 24 mm, 2 mm and 3 mm, respectively. The EHD was generated by using a DC high voltage of 10 kV. The Pin act as an active electrode of corona discharge and concentric rings dual / single ring electrodes act as ions collector and passive electrodes. The velocity of EHD flow was measured by a Hot- Wire Anemometer. We found that the velocity of EHD flow with electrodes configuration of pin-dual ring concentric electrodes is larger than pin-single ring electrode. The velocity of EHD flow for two cases of electrodes configuration were saturated at the certain spacing of inter-electrodes distance. The maximum velocity of the of EHD flow using electrodes configuration of pin-dual rings concentric was 0, 6 m/s at a distance of inter-electrodes distance 6 mm and a voltage of 3, 2 kV...|$|E

40|$|A new {{minimum weight}} design method for {{high-speed}} axisymmetric inlets was demonstrated on a generic inlet.

The optimum spacing and equivalent isotropic <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>ring</b> frame supports are computed to prevent buckling. The method thus develops a preliminary structural design for the inlet and computes the structural weight. Finite element analyses were performed on the resulting inlet design to evaluate the analytical results. Comparisons between the analytical and finite element stresses and deflections identified areas needing improvement in the analytical method. The addition of the deflection due to shear and a torsional buckling failure mode to the new method brought its results in line with those from the finite element analyses.

40|$|AIM: To {{measure the}} macular {{structure}} of amblyopia eyes and non-amblyopia eyes {{in children with}} monocular hyperopic amblyopia and in normal children by optical coherence tomography(OCT). METHODS: Fifty-six children with monocular hyperopic amblyopia and 75 normal children were selected. The macular retinal thickness and the macular retinal volume were measured by OCT. Data was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The thinnest part of retina {{was at the center}} retina, and the thickest part was the inner ring, while the outer ring was thinner than the inner ring in the amblyopia eyes group. Among the four quadrants <b>of</b> the inner <b>ring,</b> the thickest quadrant was the nasal quadrant(335. 58 ± 17. 42 μm),and the thinner part was superior quadrant(326. 42 ± 15. 36 μm), the next was the inferior quadrant,the thinnest part was the temporal quadrant. The trend <b>of</b> outer <b>ring</b> was the same as the inner ring. The quadrant differences of non-amblyopia eyes and normal eyes were same with amblyopia eyes. The center 1 mm of macula, nasal quadrant and superior quadrant retinal <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> inner <b>ring</b> were thicker in amblyopia eyes group than that in non-amblyopia eyes group and normal eyes group(P P > 0. 05). The other quadrant retinal thickness was not different in amblyopia eyes group, non- amblyopia eyes group and normal eyes group(P > 0. 05). In amblyopia eyes group, non- amblyopia eyes group and normal eyes group, the smallest retinal volume was macular retinal volume, the biggest volume was nasal retinal volume <b>of</b> inner <b>ring,</b> then was superior retinal volume and inferior retinal volume,the smallest was temporal retinal volume. The change of retinal volume in outer ring was same as inner <b>ring.</b> The difference <b>of</b> central 1 mm macular retinal volume, nasal quadrant and superior quadrant retinal <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> inner <b>ring</b> in amblyopia eyes group was statistically significant compared with non-amblyopia eyes group and normal eyes group(P P > 0. 05).

30|$|The {{types of}} surface textures {{influenced}} the friction coefficient behaviors markedly {{as shown in}} Table  3. The variation of the friction coefficient between cylinder liner and piston <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> the {{two different types of}} surface texture processed by CNCPM were compared and analyzed. At the load of 200  N, the friction coefficient in the micro V-groove surface was smaller than that in the micro-concave surface. The possible reasons were that when the micro V-groove were ran at a low load, the existence of the grooves made the cylinder liner surface store amount of lubrication oil, which was much more than that in the micro-concave surface. The lubrication oil slowed down the wear of CLPR friction pair. And thus the friction coefficient was relatively low at the load of 200  N. When the applied load increased to 400  N, the friction coefficient in the micro V-groove surface was larger than that in the micro-concave surface. This is because that when the load increased, the wear surfaces of friction pairs were forced into close contact. Due {{to the fact that the}} length of the groove was larger than the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> piston <b>ring</b> and the diameter of micro-concave was smaller than the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> piston <b>ring,</b> the lubrication oil in the micro V-groove was more readily to be squeezed out than the micro-concave. Hence, the friction coefficient of micro V-groove was larger than that of micro-concave at the load of 400  N. When the applied load grew to 600  N, the lubrication environment of CLPT became harshest. A large number and different kinds of wear particles generated. For the micro V-groove cylinder liner, some wear particles were whirled away by the lubrication oil. In addition, the micro V-groove could retain more and larger size of wear particles than the micro-concave. Consequently, the friction coefficient of micro V-groove was lower than that of micro-concave at the load of 600  N.|$|R
