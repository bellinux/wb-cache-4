5|$|The {{only other}} 11th-century {{cartulary}} surviving from England is the Oswald cartulary, also compiled at Worcester. Historian M. T. Clanchy {{has suggested that}} the form English cartularies took may have originated at Worcester, although fellow historian Robin Fleming has argued that Christ Church Canterbury's surviving cartulary is also an 11th-century compilation. Who owned <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> after it left Worcester Cathedral Priory, presumably with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1540s, is unknown, but <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> was in the possession of Robert Cotton by 1612, when it is recorded as being loaned by Cotton to Arthur Agarde. There are annotations in <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> by John Joscelyn, who was secretary to Matthew Parker (d. 1575), the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, but whether Parker owned <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> is uncertain. <b>The</b> <b>manuscript</b> thus became part of the Cotton library, which passed into public ownership in 1702 on the death of Cotton's grandson on the basis of an act of Parliament of 1701. <b>The</b> <b>manuscript</b> itself is now part of the British Library's holdings.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>manuscripts</b> {{were written}} in Arabic and local {{languages}} like Songhay and Tamasheq. [...] The dates of <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts</b> ranged between <b>the</b> late 13th and the early 20th centuries (i.e., from the Islamisation of the Mali Empire until the decline of traditional education in French Sudan).Their subject matter ranged from scholarly works to short letters. <b>The</b> <b>manuscripts</b> were passed down in Timbuktu families and were mostly in poor condition. [...] Most of <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts</b> remain unstudied and uncatalogued, and their total number is unknown, affording only rough estimates. A selection of about 160 <b>manuscripts</b> from <b>the</b> Mamma Haidara Library in Timbuktu and the Ahmed Baba collection were digitized by <b>the</b> Tombouctou <b>Manuscripts</b> Project in <b>the</b> 2000s.|$|R
50|$|By and large, however, Anglo-Saxon {{poetry is}} {{categorised}} by <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts</b> {{in which it}} survives, rather than its date of composition. <b>The</b> most important <b>manuscripts</b> are <b>the</b> four great poetical codices of the late 10th and early 11th centuries, known as <b>the</b> Cædmon <b>manuscript,</b> <b>the</b> Vercelli Book, the Exeter Book, and <b>the</b> Beowulf <b>manuscript.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>manuscripts</b> {{were created}} in a monastery in the {{mountains}} of Leon in northwest Spain. [...] There are a number of hands discernible in <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts.</b> <b>The</b> chief painter was likely a priest called Senior. Historians have also attributed elements of <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts</b> to Emetrius, whose style is attributable in comparison to an earlier signed work. The third attributable hand is that of Ende. She signed the work as DEPINTRIX (painter) and DIE AIUTRIX (helper of god). [...] She was probably a nun.|$|R

5|$|After a lacuna in <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> of the poem, Hymiskviða {{abruptly}} {{picks up}} again with Thor and Hymir in a boat, out at sea.

Thor pulls the serpent on board, and violently slams him in the head with his hammer. Jörmungandr shrieks, and a noisy commotion is heard from underwater before another lacuna appears in <b>the</b> <b>manuscript.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} in The Sleeping Dragon, George Stobbart is running a bail bonds office in New York with his partner Virgil.

50|$|Wolfe's {{first step}} is to acquire and read <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts</b> that form <b>the</b> basis for the complaints.

5|$|Scholars cannot {{pinpoint}} the exact date of composition. Orm wrote his book {{over a period}} of decades and <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> shows signs of multiple corrections through time (Burchfield 1987, p.280). Since it is apparently an autograph, with two of the three hands in the text generally believed by scholars to be Orm's own, the date of <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> and the date of composition would have been the same. On the evidence of the third hand (that of a collaborator who entered the pericopes at the head of each homily) it is thought that <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> was finished circa 1180, but Orm may have begun the work as early as 1150 (Parkes 1983, pp.115–27). The text has few topical references to specific events {{that could be used to}} identify the period of composition more precisely.|$|E

5|$|The Bannatyne {{manuscript}} also names {{two other}} sons; however, Matheson considered <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> {{to be of}} dubious authority, {{since it is the}} only source for these names. It lists Leod's third son as John, stating that John followed Bruce to Ireland. <b>The</b> <b>manuscript</b> continues that in Ireland he acquired considerable estates in Galway and was knighted; although he was the principal man of his name there, his descendants were known not as MacLeods, but as MacElliots. <b>The</b> <b>manuscript</b> states that his daughter, and heiress, married Maurice, 2nd Lord of Kerry. According to MacLeod, the statement about John following Bruce to Ireland is a mistake, since John's daughter couldn't have married later than 1285. Bruce was, however, born in 1275, and did not go to Ireland until 1306. Leod's fourth son is listed by <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> as being Olaus. The account states that this Olaus was the reputed ancestor of the MacLewis, or Fullarton family, which originated on the Isle of Arran and that this family traced its ancestry from Lewis, or MacLoy, son of Olaus, son of Leod.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the book was terminated by Bernoulli's death in 1705; thus the book is essentially incomplete when compared with Bernoulli's original vision. The quarrel with his younger brother Johann, who was the most competent person who could have fulfilled Jacob's project, prevented Johann {{to get hold of}} <b>the</b> <b>manuscript.</b> Jacob's own children were not mathematicians and were not up to the task of editing and publishing <b>the</b> <b>manuscript.</b> Finally Jacob's nephew Niklaus, 7 years after Jacob's death in 1705, managed to publish <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> in 1713.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Philip Carolan <b>Manuscripts</b> were {{compiled}} in Crossmolina, Co. Mayo, c 1863 to c 1873.

After {{the death of}} Philip Carolan <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts</b> remained in <b>the</b> possession {{of his family and}} therefore their contents have been uninvestigated until now. This study of <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts</b> combines an investigation of both paleographical and musical data with a view to obtaining an appreciation of the collection itself and the insight it can offer to the repertoire of an Irish musician in rural Ireland in the closing decades of the 19 th century. As an initial step, a catalogue of <b>the</b> Carolan <b>Manuscripts</b> is compiled and the papers, rastrographies, handwritings and bindings are classified to facilitate further study. The background to <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts,</b> and <b>the</b> life and times of Philip Carolan are also investigated as a means of understanding the context in which <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts</b> were written. An examination of the textual and non-textual data to be found in individual manuscripts helps to establish the provenance of <b>the</b> <b>manuscripts</b> and also gives a comprehensive view of the composition of the collection.
