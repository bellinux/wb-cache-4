5|$|<b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by {{termites}} {{costs the}} southwestern United States approximately $1.5billion {{each year in}} wood structure damage, but {{the true cost of}} damage worldwide cannot be determined.

5|$|Farmers use live {{electric}} wires to guard their farms, which kills other animals as well. Farmers in Neemuch (Madhya Pradesh) {{went on a}} hunger strike in 2015 demanding compensation for <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by nilgai. Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies for the menace.|$|E

5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by the hurricane, a {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared in southern Sonora.

5|$|Jones {{estimates}} Domitian's {{annual income}} {{at more than}} 1.2 billion sestertii, of which over one-third would presumably have been spent maintaining the Roman army.

5|$|The tornado {{that struck}} New Richmond would today be {{categorized}} an EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds {{in excess of}} 200 miles per hour, making it the third of only six EF5 tornadoes recorded in Wisconsin. Surveys of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> at New Richmond and elsewhere determined the tornado had a damage path of roughly 400-500 yards, or slightly over a quarter-mile in width.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{investigation}} {{and analysis of}} measurements and <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by the tornado, it was given a rating of 'F3' on the Fujita scale. This {{was one of the}} most powerful tornadoes ever recorded in Australia, and the scale indicated the tornado may have produced winds of between 252 and 300 kilometres per hour.|$|E
5|$|Before urban development, <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by {{overgrazing}} {{during the}} Spanish period was still considered capable of recovery. However, {{the completion of}} Interstate 5 {{through the middle of}} the San Juan Creek watershed in the 1950s transformed the area into a bedroom community for Los Angeles and permanently erased many remaining grassland, meadow and riparian zones. The percent of urbanized land increased from 3percent in 1964 to 18percent in 1988. In the 1990s, the watershed was 32 percent urbanized. With continuing development in east San Juan Capistrano and Rancho Mission Viejo, the projected growth by 2050 is 50 percent.|$|E

30|$|A good {{basis for}} reconstructing <b>the</b> <b>damages</b> <b>caused</b> by <b>the</b> {{earthquake}} of 1670 in Hall is the Dreifache Chronik der Stadt Hall im Innthale (Seeböck 1882). In this chronicle {{there is an}} accurate description of buildings <b>damaged</b> by <b>the</b> earthquake in a survey which was carried out nine days after the earthquake (Seeböck 1882, 314). Moser (1989) used this chronicle inter alia {{as a basis for}} his comprehensive publication {{on the development of the}} old town of Hall, in which he also considered <b>the</b> <b>damages</b> <b>caused</b> by <b>the</b> earthquake.|$|R

5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence. Brain trauma {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of a sudden acceleration or deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> at the moment of injury, a variety of events in the minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury. These processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull. Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).|$|E
5|$|Deptford {{experienced}} {{economic decline}} in the 20th century with {{the closing of the}} docks, and <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by the bombing during the Second World War - a V-2 rocket destroyed a Woolworths store (now New Cross Gate), killing 160 people. High unemployment caused some of the population to move away as the riverside industries closed down in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The local council have developed plans with private companies to regenerate the riverside area, and the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} on Saint Lucia destroyed about 15% of its yearly banana crop. Damage was heaviest on Martinique, where seven casualties {{occurred and}} 1,500people were left homeless as the heavy rainfall caused severe flooding on the island, resulting in some landslides. The remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties; {{the same area}} was affected with more precipitation {{a few days later}} by Tropical Storm Marco. Due to <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by the storm, the name Klaus was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hazel was {{the deadliest}} and costliest {{hurricane}} of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm {{killed at least}} 400people in Haiti before striking the United States near the border between North and South Carolina, as a Category 4 hurricane. After causing 95fatalities in the US, Hazel struck Canada as an extratropical storm, raising the death toll by 81people, mostly in Toronto. As {{a result of the}} high death toll and <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by Hazel, its name was retired from use for North Atlantic hurricanes.|$|E
50|$|On February 2016, Maguindanao {{experienced}} {{the effects of}} the 2014-16 El Niño, causing destruction on rice and corn fields due to drought. The province declared a state of calamity in response to <b>the</b> <b>damages</b> <b>caused.</b>|$|R
50|$|Postherpetic {{neuralgia}} {{is thought}} to be due to nerve <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> by herpes zoster. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>causes</b> nerves in <b>the</b> affected dermatomic area of the skin to send abnormal electrical signals to the brain.
