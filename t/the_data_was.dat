5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>was</b> not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Between September 2008 and December 2010, twenty-two spectra were {{collected}} using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) instrument at Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory. This data {{was used to}} derive HAT-P-33's radial velocity. A far greater number of spectra were gathered for HAT-P-33 than the number usually gathered for planetary candidates {{to compensate for the}} data's jitter effect. It was concluded that the jitter in <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>was</b> caused by stellar activity and not the presence of other planets.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{traffic in}} the mid-1980s changed the politician's interests, and in 1988 Parliament voted {{to build a new}} main airport at Hurum, located {{on the same side of}} Oslo as Fornebu, but further away. However, new weather data showed that Hurum was unsuitable, and the {{location}} was discarded. There were accusations that <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>was</b> fabricated to manipulate the political decision. In 1992, parliament made a final vote that started construction of a new airport at Gardermoen and mandated the closure of Fornebu.|$|E

5|$|The {{distance}} to Beta Pictoris {{and many other}} stars {{was measured by the}} Hipparcos satellite. This was done by measuring its trigonometric parallax: the slight displacement in its position observed as the Earth moves around the Sun. Beta Pictoris was found to exhibit a parallax of 51.87 milliarcseconds, a value which was later revised to 51.44 milliarcseconds when <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>was</b> reanalyzed taking systematic errors more carefully into account.

5|$|Later, between 2009 and 2011, {{another team}} of astronomers {{observed}} WASP-13b and WASP-21b {{to find what}} caused some Hot Jupiters to have anomalously high radii. The RISE photometric camera on the Liverpool Telescope was used to detect further transits. Two partial transits and two full transits were observed during this period, although the quality of both full transits was slightly compromised because of passing cloud cover. The collected observations, along with the JGT observations {{that were used to}} confirm the planet, were scaled to filter out errors such as background noise. <b>The</b> <b>data</b> <b>was</b> then used to re-define WASP-13b's parameters, including its age, mass, radius, and density. The study also noted that a limb darkening effect was present, a characteristic that may affect future atmospheric studies of the planet.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the right}} to vote was secured, Stevens turned her {{attention}} to women's legal status. She supported passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and worked with Alice Paul from 1927–1933 on a volume of work comparing varying impact on law for women and men. The goal in compiling <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>was</b> to obtain an international law protecting women's right of citizenship. The research was completed with the help of feminists in 90 countries and evaluated laws controlling women's nationality from every country. Gaining approval for the work from the League of Nations in 1927, Stevens presented the proposal Pan American Union in 1928, convincing the governing body to create the Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM). In 1931, she joined the American Institute of International Law, becoming its first female member. In 1933, her work resulted in the first treaty to secure international rights for women. The Convention on the Nationality of Women established that women retained their citizenship after marriage and Convention on Nationality provided that neither marriage nor divorce could affect the nationality of the members of a family, extending citizenship protection to children.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} record chart in the United Kingdom. In the 1970s, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry with a one-week break each Christmas. Prior to 1969 many music papers compiled their own sales charts but, on 15 February 1969, the BMRB was commissioned in a joint venture by the BBC and Record Retailer to compile the chart. BMRB compiled the first chart from postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops. The sampling cost approximately £52,000 and shops were randomly chosen and submitted figures for sales taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. <b>The</b> <b>data</b> <b>was</b> compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Record Retailer (rebranded Music Week in 1972). However, the BMRB often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post. The 1971 postal strike meant that data had to be collected by telephone but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart, and by 1973 the BMRB was using motorcycle couriers to collect sales figures.|$|E
