5|$|The {{fire was}} fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, {{but also by}} the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and {{gunpowder}} stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting point between 1,250 and 1,480°C (2,300 and 2,700°F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting point between 1,100 and 1,650°C (2,000 and 3000°F)). Nor would anonymous bone fragments have been of much interest to the hungry people sifting through <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> tons of rubble and debris after the fire, looking for valuables, or to the workmen clearing away the rubble later during the rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|After {{showing the}} game at the Macworld Expo, Bungie was mobbed with {{interest}} and orders for the game. The game was not finished until December 14, 1994; Jones {{and a few other}} employees spent a day at a warehouse assembling boxes so that some of the orders could be filled before Christmas. The game was a critical and commercial success, and is regarded as a relatively unknown but important part of gaming history. It served as the Mac alternative to DOS PC-only games like Doom and System Shock. The game's volume of orders was unprecedented for the studio, who found that its old method of mail or phone orders could not scale to the demand and hired another company to handle <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> orders. Marathon also brought Bungie attention from press outside the small Mac gaming market.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{was left}} to decide where in Italy to settle <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> {{veterans}} of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought {{on the republican side}} with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.|$|E

5|$|The reedbeds, {{the largest}} of which are at the Cley, Salthouse and Titchwell reserves, are {{dominated}} by common reed, and salt marsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also occur in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed, and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, marsh foxtail, and slender hare's-ear. The flat land just inland from the dunes at Holkham was reclaimed from the marshes by {{the nineteenth century and}} was initially used for grazing. It was made arable during World War II, but the water levels have been raised to make the fields attractive to breeding and wintering birds. The pastures are of international importance for <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> geese and ducks that feed there in the winter months.|$|E
5|$|The {{win over}} #14Virginia Tech enabled the Bulldogs {{to break into}} the Top25 rankings in the final college {{football}} poll of the season. Georgia was ranked#23 in the country thanks to its win over the Hokies, who dropped to #19nationally following the loss. The loss snapped a six-game winning streak by Virginia Tech and ended the Hokies' bid at becoming just the fourth team in school history to win 11 games in a season. The 2006 Georgia Bulldogs, consequently, became the first team in school history to defeat three consecutive ranked teams. No.5 Auburn, No.16 Georgia Tech, and No.14 Virginia Tech all fell to Georgia in November or December. The game and <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> fans it attracted injected an estimated $35million into the Atlanta area economy, mostly as a result of food, hotel, and other expenses incurred by visiting fans.|$|E
5|$|When Odilo Globocnik made a {{surprise}} visit to Treblinka on 26 August 1942 with Christian Wirth and Wirth's adjutant from Bełżec, Josef Oberhauser, Eberl was dismissed on the spot. Among {{the reasons for}} dismissal were: incompetently disposing of <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> dead bodies, using inefficient methods of killing, and not properly concealing the mass killing. Eberl was transferred to Berlin, closer to operational headquarters in Hitler's Chancellery, where the main architect of the Holocaust, Heinrich Himmler, had just stepped up {{the pace of the}} programme. Globocnik assigned Wirth to remain in Treblinka temporarily to help clean up the camp. On 28 August 1942, Globocnik suspended deportations. He chose Franz Stangl, who had previously been the commandant of the Sobibór extermination camp, to assume command of the camp as Eberl's successor. Stangl had a reputation as a competent administrator with a good understanding of the project's objectives, and Globocnik trusted that he would be capable of resuming control.|$|E

25|$|MSRs make closed {{nuclear fuel}} cycles cheaper and more practical. If fully implemented, a closed nuclear fuel cycle reduces {{environmental}} impacts: The chemical separation makes long-lived actinides back into reactor fuel. The discharged wastes are mostly fission products (nuclear ashes) with short half-lives. This reduces the needed geologic containment to 300 years rather than <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> years needed by a light-water reactor's spent nuclear fuel.
