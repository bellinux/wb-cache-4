5|$|As {{it existed}} before the {{designation}} was removed, M-114 {{started at the}} corner of BYP US16 (28th Street) and what is now East Beltline Avenue in Paris Township (now Kentwood) and ran northward. The trunkline intersected the mainline for US16/M-50 at Cascade Road and the mainline for M-21 at Fulton Street near East Grand Rapids in Grand Rapids Township. Further north, the highway split into two. In Plainfield Township, a leg of M-114 continued west along the modern 3Mile Road through an intersection with US131 to terminate at Coit Avenue near the Grand River and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> continued north to a terminus with US131 at Northland Drive and Plainfield Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the heel}} {{is up for}} one foot, the thigh for that leg is {{typically}} more {{parallel to the ground}} than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg,</b> additionally the heel up foot is typically planted further back than the heel down foot.|$|E
25|$|Crouching {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be synonymous with squatting. It is common to squat with one leg and kneel with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg.</b> One or both heels may be up when squatting. Young children often instinctively squat. Among Chinese, Southeast Asian, and Eastern European adults, squatting often {{takes the place of}} sitting or standing.|$|E
60|$|I {{examined}} the leg. There were the notches, twenty-two {{or three of}} them. On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> were more notches too numerous to reckon.|$|R
50|$|On Earth-001, Kaine {{transforms}} into {{a massive}} Man-Spider as the Inheritors arrive. Kaine impales Solus on multiple spines, killing him. An enraged Morlun rips {{off one of}} <b>the</b> <b>Other's</b> <b>legs</b> and stab it through the head, apparently killed Kaine.|$|R
5000|$|In season 1, {{teams were}} told to [...] "Find Allan Wu" [...] {{only to find out}} {{that it was not a}} Pit Stop. In this season, a [...] "superleg" [...] is merely one leg that is longer than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|R
25|$|The most usual leg {{movement}} {{with the front}} crawl is called the flutter kick. The legs move alternately, with one leg kicking downward while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> moves upward. While the legs provide {{only a small part}} of the overall speed, they are important to stabilize the body position. This lack of balance is apparent when using a pull buoy to neutralize the leg action.|$|E
25|$|The parsec {{is defined}} as being equal {{to the length of}} the longer leg of an {{extremely}} elongated imaginary right triangle in space. The two dimensions on which this triangle is based are its shorter leg, of length one astronomical unit (the average Earth-Sun distance), and the subtended angle of the vertex opposite that leg, measuring one arcsecond. Applying the rules of trigonometry to these two values, the unit length of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> of the triangle (the parsec) can be derived.|$|E
25|$|In partial {{suspension}} {{the person}} is bound {{in a way that}} part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains. The classic partial suspension position is to have the person balancing on one foot with part of their weight supported through a chest harness and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> pulled up in some direction. A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a suspension point to pull their lower back off the ground would also qualify as partial suspension.|$|E
50|$|Barbaro's {{injuries}} were life-threatening. Unlike other mammals, such as dogs, a horse cannot survive in humane circumstances on three legs. A broken leg in a horse {{can lead to}} complications as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> attempt to bear {{the weight of the}} horse's body.|$|R
50|$|Uroballus {{are about}} 3 mm long in both sexes. The {{cephalothorax}} is very broad, almost square. The abdomen is oval, the {{first pair of}} legs thick and short with swollen femora. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> are weak. <b>The</b> spinnerets are very long and thin.|$|R
50|$|Ashworth {{attended}} Dartmouth College. He ran {{the second}} {{leg of the}} gold medal performance of the American 4 × 100 m relay team, which set a new world record of 39.0 at the Tokyo Olympics. Paul Drayton, Richard Stebbins and Bob Hayes ran <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|R
25|$|All other {{variants}} fail {{to increase}} the frontal area, yet swimmers using them still generate some thrust by the velocity variation and do not drown. Another variant of the breaststroke kick is the scissor kick, however, this kick violates {{the rules of the}} FINA as it is no longer symmetrical. Swimming teachers put a great effort into steering the students away from the scissor kick. In the scissor kick, one leg moves as described above, but <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> does not form an elliptical movement but merely an up-down movement similar to the flutter kick of front crawl. Some swimming teachers believe that learning the front crawl first gives a higher risk of an incorrect scissor kick when learning breaststroke afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Bayern Munich (2012–13, 2013–14) and Real Madrid (2013–14, 2014–15) {{hold the}} record of ten {{consecutive}} wins in the Champions League. Bayern Munich's run started on 2 April 2013 in the 2–0 win against Juventus in {{the first leg of}} the quarter-final of the 2012–13 season after losing 2–0 against Arsenal three weeks earlier. The run continued in the other three knockout matches and the final of the 2012–13 season. The run continued in the first five group stage matches of the 2013–14 season, but ended with the sixth in a 2–3 home defeat against Manchester City on 10 December 2013. Real Madrid's run started on 23 April 2014 in the 1–0 win against Bayern Munich in the first leg of semi-final of the 2013–14 season after losing 2–0 against Borussia Dortmund two weeks earlier in the second leg of the quarter-final. The run continued in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> of the semi-final, the final against Atlético Madrid, the six group stage matches of the 2014–15 season, and the first leg of round of 16 of the 2014–15 season, against Schalke 04.|$|E
500|$|In January 1801, Benedict Arnold's health {{began to}} decline. He had {{suffered}} from gout since 1775, and the condition attacked his unwounded leg {{to the point}} where he was unable to go to sea. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> ached constantly, and he walked only with a cane. His physicians diagnosed him as having dropsy, and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition. He died after four days of delirium on June 14, 1801, at the age of 60. Legend has it that, when he was on his deathbed, he said, [...] "Let me die in this old uniform in which I fought my battles. May God forgive me for ever having put on another," [...] but this story may be apocryphal. Arnold was buried at St. Mary's Church, Battersea in London, England. As a result of a clerical error in the parish records, his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later. His funeral procession boasted [...] "seven mourning coaches and four state carriages"; the funeral was without military honors.|$|E

Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, Simeon Williamson and Tyrone Edgar ran <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A horse favoring {{an injured}} leg will both {{severely}} limit its movement and place greater weight on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs.</b> This sometimes leads to static laminitis, {{particularly if the}} animal is confined in a stall. [...] A notable example is the 2006 Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro.|$|R

Breast and abdomen yellow grey. Wings {{coloured}} {{as on the}} upper side, but fainter. Margins of the wings entire. Wing-span 4 inches (100 mm).|$|R
500|$|Residual {{complications}} of paralytic polio often occur following the initial recovery process. Muscle paresis and paralysis can sometimes result in skeletal deformities, tightening of the joints and movement disability. Once {{the muscles in}} the limb become flaccid, they may interfere with the function of other muscles. A typical manifestation of this problem is equinus foot (similar to club foot). This deformity develops when the muscles that pull the toes downward are working, but those that pull it upward are not, and the foot naturally tends to drop toward the ground. If the problem is left untreated, the Achilles tendons {{at the back of}} the foot retract and the foot cannot take on a normal position. Polio victims that develop equinus foot cannot walk properly because they cannot put their heel on the ground. A similar situation can develop if the arms become paralyzed. In some cases the growth of an affected leg is slowed by polio, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> continues to grow normally. The result is that one leg is shorter than the other and the person limps and leans to one side, in turn leading to deformities of the spine (such as scoliosis). Osteoporosis and increased likelihood of bone fractures may occur. An intervention to prevent or lessen length disparity can be to perform an epiphysiodesis on the distal femoral and proximal tibial/fibular condyles, so that limb's growth is artificially stunted, and by the time of epiphyseal (growth) plate closure, the legs are more equal in length. Alternatively, a person can be fitted with custom made footwear which corrects the difference in leg lengths. Other surgery to re-balance muscular agonist/antagonist imbalances may also be helpful. [...] Extended use of braces or wheelchairs may cause compression neuropathy, as well as a loss of proper function of the veins in the legs, due to pooling of blood in paralyzed lower limbs. Complications from prolonged immobility involving the lungs, kidneys and heart include pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, paralytic ileus, myocarditis and cor pulmonale.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is common}} for one leg to be kneeling, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> is: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{extended}} high step, {{similarly to}} the chair step, involves the thigh being {{parallel to the ground}} and perpendicular to the body, but instead with the shin extended outward at a forty five-degree angle from the body and with toes pointed downward. [...] The leg is then driven quickly back to the ground while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> repeats in this fashion.|$|E
50|$|On 11 August 2013 {{it worked}} the Fifteen Guinea Special to {{celebrate}} the 45th Anniversary of the ending of steam on British Railways. 70013 {{was in charge of}} the Longsight to Carlisle leg of the special with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> being worked by LMS Black 5s numbers 45305, 45231 & 44932.|$|R
50|$|Stenopus spinosus {{can grow}} up to 4 cm long, and has a yellow spiny {{carapace}} and abdomen and long white antennae. The third pair of pereiopods (walking legs) are spiny and bear long claws and are much larger than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> pairs. They are boldly barred in red and white while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> are yellow. <b>The</b> tip of the abdomen, uropods and telson are also marked with orangeish-red and white.|$|R
40|$|Anterior extreme {{position}} (AEP) and posterior {{extreme position}} (PEP) {{of the legs}} of stick insects were measured during walking on a treadwheel or on a slippery glass plate. In several experiments, either protraction or re-traction of a middle or hind leg was interrupted. <b>The</b> AEP of <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> was independent of a protraction interruption but PEP was displaced backward in the leg anterior to the interrupted leg. When a leg was standing on a fixed platform (interruption of retraction) no changes were found in AEP and PEP for <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> but if <b>the</b> platform was slowly moved, PEP of leg on the platform was moved forward. These results disagree with several pub-lished hypotheses. The results suggest the hypothesis of a position-dependent threshold value for protraction which is modulated by co-ordinating influ-ences from <b>other</b> <b>legs...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Skate save: A save {{made with}} the goaltender's skate. The goaltender decides which {{direction}} the rebound should travel in, and turns his skate in that direction. Then, bending <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg,</b> he pushes towards the puck with the off leg, as the bent knee drops to the ice. This move is rarely used since the butterfly method has become popular. [...] A skate save's effectiveness is more limited {{because of the difficulty}} in directing a puck compared with using a stick, a blocker, or the pad.|$|E
2500|$|On stage 12 of the 1955 Tour, {{the riders}} went over Mount Ventoux. Ten {{kilometres}} from the summit, said the journalist Jacques Augendre, French rider Jean Malléjac was: [...] "Streaming with sweat, haggard and comatose, he was zigzagging {{and the road}} wasn't wide enough for him... He was already {{no longer in the}} real world, still less in the world of cyclists and the Tour de France." [...] Malléjac collapsed, falling to the ground with one foot still trapped in a pedal. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> pedalled on in the air. He was, said Pierre Chany, [...] "completely unconscious, his face the colour of a corpse, a freezing sweat ran on his forehead.|$|E
2500|$|The trail {{begins in}} {{northeast}} New York {{and proceeds to}} {{the western end of}} the state. [...] It cuts across northwestern Pennsylvania, then follows a southwesterly course through the hilly region of southern Ohio until it nears Cincinnati when it runs north through western Ohio to the hills of SE Michigan. [...] It continues from southeast Michigan through the western Lower Peninsula, crosses the Straits of Mackinac, and takes a northern route the length of the Upper Peninsula. [...] After crossing northern Wisconsin, one leg follows the Lake Superior shore to the northeast corner of Minnesota before turning west, where it meets <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> in central northern Minnesota. [...] The trail enters southeast North Dakota, and continues to its other terminus {{in the center of the}} state.|$|E
50|$|Hopping Air Flares - Both hands {{never touch}} {{the floor at}} the same time. A hopping motion is used to {{continuously}} hop from one hand to <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>The</b> <b>legs</b> are sometimes bent in this variation in order to generate the hopping effect.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{standard}} airport landing pattern, {{which is usually}} used under visual meteorological conditions (VMC), aircraft turn from base leg to final within one-half to two miles of the airport. For instrument approaches, as well as approaches into a controlled airfield under visual flight rules (VFR), often a [...] "straight-in" [...] final approach is used, where all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> are dispensed with. Straight-in approaches are discouraged at non-towered airports in the US.|$|R
3000|$|The {{admissible}} {{region of}} the position of the COG is determined such that the magnitude of the vertical force of each leg does not exceed that of the grope-force when the robot stands on three legs (Step B of Fig. 2). The admissible {{region of the}} contact point for the groping leg is determined such that the magnitude of the vertical force of the groping leg larger than that of the grope-force, and the magnitude of the vertical force for <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three <b>legs</b> less than that of the grope-force. In fact, the vertical force of one of the three legs is assumed to be zero (we call this leg the “float leg” [...]), because the groping leg can apply the maximum force when one of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> is floating.|$|R
2500|$|Traditionally, the Blue & Gold Marching Machine {{utilizes}} {{a variation}} of the high step marching style. This involves the lifting of the knee with legs directly in front, thighs parallel to the ground, and toes pointed downward. When the leg is elevated, there should be a 90-degree angle with the body and the thigh, and a 90-degree angle with the thigh and the shin. The leg is then lowered, and this is repeated with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>leg.</b> This is informally referred to as the [...] "chair step". This is also the style commonly found in many HBCU bands. Recently, the band program has introduced into their on-field performances, techniques similar to those seen in modern drum and bugle corps of Drum Corps International (DCI). Commonly referred to as corps style, constantly changing step sizes, forward, backward, and side to side [...] "bell-front" [...] marching is used to accommodate the different forms the band is creating on the field. The band's auxiliary unit, also known as [...] "Golden Delight" [...] is a combined unit that serves the purposes of [...] "Color Guard," [...] Baton twirlers, and dancers. Golden Delight is known for incorporating diverse flags, air blades, and other props and costuming to provide visual and theatrical elements into the band's shows.|$|E

50|$|In RAID configurations, {{almost all}} {{policies}} {{are applied to}} each leg in isolation. For example, even if a LV has a policy of cling, expanding the file system will not result in LVM using a PV if it is already used by one of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> in <b>the</b> RAID setup. LVs with RAID functionality will put each leg on different PVs, making <b>the</b> <b>other</b> PVs unavailable to any <b>other</b> given <b>leg.</b> If {{this was the only}} option available, expansion of the LV would fail. In this sense, the logic behind cling will only apply to expanding each of the individual legs of the array.|$|R
