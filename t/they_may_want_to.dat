500|$|Olympus convened an {{extraordinary}} shareholders' meeting for 20 April 2012 {{to vote on}} its proposal for the new board and to approve the restated accounts. The board slate consisted of 11 candidates, the majority of whom were [...] "completely independent" [...] of Olympus. The company controversially [...] sought to promote its executive officer, Hiroyuki Sasa, to president; its candidate for chairman was Yasuyuki Kimoto, a former senior executive of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. – the largest creditor of Olympus. Another proposed director is Hideaki Fujizuka, formerly with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. While the company argued the candidates were well-qualified, a shareholder advisory firm urged investors to vote down the proposed president citing his lack of experience as a corporate manager of a turnaround situation; it also {{expressed concern that the}} ex-bankers may put banks' interests ahead of shareholders'. ISS also recommended shareholders not to approve the accounts on grounds that it could undermine any legal recourse <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> pursue in future.

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN felt that [...] "Laryngitis" [...] highlighted a trend of Glee storylines becoming progressively sadder, rather than comedic. She {{wrote that the}} plotlines came across as lecturing, and concluded: [...] "I still heart Glee, which is clearly {{one of the best}} shows on television right now. I just think <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> lighten the life lessons a bit or spread them out more over several episodes rather than clobbering us all at once." [...] Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV wrote that he was uncertain what to make of the episode, noting: [...] "Sure, there were some high points, and it was a pretty enjoyable watch, but unlike the last few episodes this one left me a little high and dry." [...] Batallones observed that the Sean storyline felt [...] "totally forced into the episode, making Rachel's epiphany [...] very forced and unnatural." [...] Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich was also troubled by the storyline, noting: [...] "It seems like the height of vanity to basically use this storyline to teach Rachel an important lesson about being herself. [...] Glee has used disabled actors before, and I think it's worth debating whether the show honors that or uses it shamelessly." ...|$|E

6000|$|Yet it {{is curious}} {{that it never}} {{occurred}} to me for a year or so that this was likely to be a matter of passion between us. I have told how definitely I put my imagination into harness in those matters at my marriage, and I was living now in a world of big interests, where there is neither much time nor inclination for deliberate love-making. I suppose there is a large class of men who never meet a girl or a woman without thinking of sex, who meet a friend's daughter and decide: [...] "Mustn't get friendly with her--wouldn't DO," [...] and set invisible bars between themselves and all the wives in the world. Perhaps that is the way to live. Perhaps there is no other method than this effectual annihilation of half--and the most sympathetic and attractive half--of the human beings in the world, so far as any frank intercourse is concerned. I am quite convinced anyhow that such a qualified intimacy as ours, such a drifting into the sense of possession, such untrammeled conversation with an invisible, implacable limit set just where the intimacy glows, it is no kind of tolerable compromise. If men and women are to go so far together, they must be free to go as far as <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go, without the vindictive destruction that has come upon us. On the basis of the accepted codes the jealous people are right, and the liberal-minded ones are playing with fire. If people are not to love, then they must be kept apart. If they are not to be kept apart, then we must prepare for an unprecedented toleration of lovers.|$|E
6000|$|There is a {{great variety}} of {{suggestions}} for this increase of public wealth and production. Many of them have an extreme reasonableness. The extent to which they will be adopted depends, no doubt, very largely upon the politician and permanent official, and both these classes are prone to panic in the presence of reality. In spite of its own interests in restraining a rise in prices, the old official [...] "salariat" [...] is likely to be obstructive to any such innovations. It is the resistance of spurs and red tabs to military innovations over again. This is the resistance of quills and red tape. On the other hand the organisation of Britain for war has [...] "officialised" [...] a number of industrial leaders, and created a large body of temporary and adventurous officials. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> carry on into peace production the great new factories the war has created. At the end of the war, for example, every belligerent country will be in urgent need of cheap automobiles for farmers, tradesmen, and industrial purposes generally, America is now producing such automobiles at a price of eighty pounds. But Europe will be heavily in debt to America, her industries will be disorganised, and there will therefore be no sort of return payment possible for these hundreds of thousands of automobiles. A country that is neither creditor nor producer cannot be an importer. Consequently though those cheap tin cars may be stacked as high as the Washington Monument in America, they will never come to Europe. On the other hand the great shell factories of Europe will be standing idle and ready, their staffs disciplined and available, for conversion to the new task. The imperative common sense of the position seems to be that the European governments should set themselves straight away to out-Ford Ford, and provide their own people with cheap road transport.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may agree," [...] wrote Andre-Louis from Paris to Le Chapelier, in {{a letter}} which survives, [...] "that {{it is to be}} regretted I should {{definitely}} have discarded the livery of Scaramouche, since clearly there could be no livery fitter for my wear. It seems to be my part always to stir up strife and then to slip away before I am caught in the crash of the warring elements I have aroused. It is a humiliating reflection. I seek consolation in the reminder of Epictetus (do you ever read Epictetus?) that we are but actors in a play of such a part as it may please the Director to assign us. It does not, however, console me to have been cast for a part so contemptible, to find myself excelling ever in the art of running away. But if I am not brave, at least I am prudent; so that where I lack one virtue I may lay claim to possessing another almost to excess. On a previous occasion they wanted to hang me for sedition. Should I have stayed to be hanged? This time <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hang me for several things, including murder; for I do not know whether that scoundrel Binet be alive or dead from the dose of lead I pumped into his fat paunch. Nor can I say that I very greatly care. If I have a hope at all in the matter it is that he is dead--and damned. But I am really indifferent. My own concerns are troubling me enough. I have all but spent the little money that I contrived to conceal about me before I fled from Nantes on that dreadful night; and both of the only two professions of which I can claim to know anything--the law and the stage--are closed to me, since I cannot find employment in either without revealing myself as a fellow who is urgently wanted by the hangman. As things are it is very possible that I may die of hunger, especially considering the present price of victuals in this ravenous city. Again I have recourse to Epictetus for comfort. 'It is better,' he says, 'to die of hunger having lived without grief and fear, than to live with a troubled spirit amid abundance.' I seem likely to perish in the estate that he accounts so enviable. That it does not seem exactly enviable to me merely proves that as a Stoic I am not a success." ...|$|E
