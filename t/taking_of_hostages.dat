5|$|One of {{the first}} major {{operations}} in which the ships were involved was Operation Eagle Claw launched by USS Nimitz in 1980 after she had deployed to the Indian Ocean {{in response to the}} <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> in the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Although initially part of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, Eisenhower relieved Nimitz in this operation after her service in the Mediterranean Sea. Nimitz conducted a Freedom of Navigation exercise alongside the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal in August 1981 in the Gulf of Sidra, near Libya. During this exercise, two of the ship's F-14 Tomcats shot down two Libyan aircraft in {{what became known as the}} Gulf of Sidra incident. In 1987, Vinson participated in the first U.S. carrier deployment in the Bering Sea, and Nimitz provided security during the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.|$|E

25|$|In the {{progress}} of the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the main cities and administrative centers fell into the hands of Muslim troops. Control of the central and southern regions, such as the Guadalquivir and Ebro valleys, presented few problems for the newcomers, who used the existing Visigothic administrative structures, ultimately of Roman origin. However, in the northern mountains, urban centers (such as Gigia) were practically nonexistent and the submission of the country had to be achieved valley by valley. Muslim troops often resorted to the <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> to ensure the pacification of the newly conquered territory.|$|E
25|$|The {{seizure of}} Islam's holiest site, the <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> {{from among the}} worshippers and the deaths of {{hundreds}} of militants, security forces and hostages {{caught in the crossfire}} in the ensuing battles for control of the site, shocked the Islamic world. The siege ended two weeks after the takeover began and the mosque was cleared. Following the attack, the Saudi state implemented a stricter enforcement of Islamic code (Sharia). While the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca was taking place, between 26 November to 3 December 1979 a revolt by the Shiite Muslim minority in the oil-rich Al-Hasa province of Saudi Arabia, known as the 1979 Qatif Uprising, took place.|$|E

500|$|According to Paul Dundas, in {{and after}} the 12th century, the {{persecution}} and violence against Jains by Muslim state caused Jain scholars to revisit their theory of Ahimsa (non-violence). For example, Jinadatta Suri in 12th century, wrote {{during a time of}} widespread destruction of Jain temples and blocking of Jaina pilgrimage by Muslim armies, that [...] "anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody" [...] in self-defense would not lose any merit. N.L. Jain, quoting Acarya Mahaprajna, states Anekantavada doctrine is not a principle that can be applied to all situations or fields. In his view, the doctrine has its limits and Anekantavada doctrine does not mean intellectual tolerance or acceptance of religious violence, terrorism, <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostages,</b> proxy wars such as in Kashmir, and that [...] "to initiate a conflict is as sinful as to tolerate or not oppose it".|$|E
2500|$|I {{have not}} {{published}} a Fatwa on this issue. At the Egyptian Journalists' Union {{a few days}} ago I was asked about the permissibility of fighting against the occupation in Iraq, and I answered that it is permitted. Afterwards I was asked concerning the American civilians in Iraq and I merely responded with the question – are there American civilians in Iraq? It is a matter of common knowledge that in Fatwas such as these I do not use the word [...] "killing" [...] but rather I say [...] "struggle", which is a more comprehensive word than the word [...] "killing" [...] and whose meaning is not necessarily to kill. In addition, I have condemned the <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> {{on a number of occasions}} in the past and have demanded that they be released and that their lives not be threatened.|$|E
2500|$|Movement towards {{peace in}} Niger, which seemed {{unlikely}} {{at the beginning}} of 2009, progressed rapidly following the Malian peace deal. The <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> by the AQIM in Niger, especially Canadian diplomat Robert Fowler, brought intense international interest in the security situation in Niger. Beginning in February 2009, there was intensive involvement with the Nigerien government and the rebel groups by the UN, Canada, and later by Algeria and Mali, and finally Libya. Canadian and other sources floated rumors of Tuareg rebel and even Nigerien government involvement in the kidnappings, which all sides united to deny. Malian and Algerian government mediators, as well as informal groups representing Tuareg interests and the Nigerien government met at a Malian organised conference in Niamey on 25 and 26 February. [...] Press in Bamako and Niamey began to talk of the [...] "Malian Approach" [...] to peace.|$|E

2500|$|As {{reprisals}} for Résistance activities, {{the authorities}} established harsh forms of collective punishment. For example, the increasing militancy of communist resistance in August 1941 {{led to the}} <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> thousands <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> from the general population. A typical policy statement read, [...] "After each further incident, a number, reflecting {{the seriousness of the}} crime, shall be shot." [...] During the occupation, an estimated 30,000 French civilian hostages were shot to intimidate others who were involved in acts of resistance. German troops occasionally engaged in massacres, such as the destruction of Oradour-sur-Glane, where an entire village was razed and the population murdered (save for a few scant survivors) because of persistent resistance in the vicinity.|$|R

2500|$|First, the MCA {{changed the}} {{definition}} of war crimes for which US government defendants can be prosecuted. Under the War Crimes Act of 1996, any violation of Common Article3 of the Geneva Conventions was considered a war crime and could be criminally prosecuted.

2500|$|Far from {{settling}} tensions, Rigdon's oration had {{the opposite}} effect: it terrified and inflamed {{the residents of}} surrounding counties.

Samuel Bogart and his militia, operating in northern Ray County (to the south of Caldwell). [...] When the Latter-day Saint militia {{from the town of}} Far West moved south to the militia camp on the Crooked River, causing rumors of a planned full-scale invasion of Missouri that ran rampant throughout the summer and aroused terror throughout {{the western part of the}} state. [...] These rumors only increased as reports of the Battle of Crooked River reached the capital at Jefferson City, with accounts of Latter-day Saints allegedly slaughtering Bogart's militia company, including those who had surrendered.
