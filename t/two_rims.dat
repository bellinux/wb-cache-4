40|$|We {{consider}} ultracold {{atoms in}} a two-dimensional optical lattice {{of the dice}} geometry in a tight-binding regime. The atoms experience a laser-assisted tunneling between the nearest neighbour sites of the dice lattice accompanied by the momentum recoil. This allows one to engineer staggered synthetic magnetic fluxes over plaquettes, and thus pave a way towards a realization of topologically nontrivial band structures. In such a lattice the real-valued next-neighbour transitions are not needed to reach a topological regime. Yet, such transitions can increase a variety of the obtained topological phases. The dice lattice represents a triangular Bravais lattice with a three-site basis consisting of a hub site connected to <b>two</b> <b>rim</b> sites. As a consequence, the dice lattice supports three dispersion bands. From this point of view, our model {{can be interpreted as}} a generalization of the paradigmatic Haldane model which is reproduced if one of the <b>two</b> <b>rim</b> sub-lattices is eliminated. We demonstrate that the proposed upgrade of the Haldane model creates a significant added value, including an easy access to topological semimetal phases relying only on the nearest neighbour coupling, as well as enhanced topological band structures featuring Chern numbers higher than one. The numerical investigation is supported and complemented by an analytical scheme based on the study of singularities in the Berry connection. Comment: 24 pages, 15 figure...|$|R

Rakower was involved with technical support aspects of the Iditabike (later IditaSport) race, which started in 1987. Since 2002 the race continued on the same trail under the name Iditarod Trail Invitational (ITI). Rakower started hand making extra wide rims for participants by welding <b>two</b> <b>rims</b> together and cutting off the middle ridge known as the snowcat rims 44 mm. S. Rakower produced those rims from 1991 through 1999. Many riders on the Iditarod Trail used a Geax tire with the snow cat rim. Enthusiasts would cut and sew tire-carcasses together to maximize {{the size of the}} tire and utilize all the available space between the seat stays and chain stays; this tire and rim combination would maximize the bicycle's footprint, increasing flotation on winter trails. Soon after, Rakower decided to design a 44 mm rim from scratch and had it produced.

First, {{the sensitivity of the}} sheets shapes to a mass flow ratevariation is evidenced. For a sufficiently high flow rate, a liquid sheet forms with <b>two</b> <b>rims</b> bordering it. These rims join after a certain length L c resulting in a triangle-like shape of the sheet. This characteristiclength is compared with a theoretical prediction given by a model valid for Re >> 1. Furthermore,some capillary waves forming a striped pattern are present at the sheet interface near the rims and arepropagating towards the central axis as the sheet falls. These waves are interpreted as the consequenceof the displacement of a high curvature gradient zone at the rim-sheet interface as suggested by theirstationary shape. The critical mass flow rate at which the sheet destabilization is systematically observedis Q c = 0. 056 kg. s − 1. It corresponds to a Weber number We ≈ 2. 7, a value in line with the theoreticalone We_th = O(1) which usually indicates a sufficient condition to maintain a stable sheet.

40|$|This {{report is}} based {{on one of my}} own ideas and {{describes}} the development of a propulsion system for a conceptual motorcycle. The main idea is to mount the drivetrain within a hubless wheel and thus fully integrate these two together. The project began with a comprehensive collection of information. This collection mainly focused on an investigation of the traditional automotive drivetrain, tracing different transmission input elements and an investigation of their relative functions. Two visits to the Air Force Museum in Linköping were performed, where the primarily aim was to study different radial engine's physical dimensions. The work with the hubless wheel and the work with the drivetrain were separated in order to facilitate the development of the whole work. Therefore two main problem determinations and one divided specification of conditions were established {{as the basis for the}} construction sub-functions. After the reduction of different design solutions concerning the sub-functions, which mainly were carried out through logical reasoning and discussions, two rather similar proposals of solutions remained as a base for further development of the project. The final drivetrain was based on an Australian radial engine from Rotec Engineering, Rotec R 3600, which was combined with a hybrid module from the German manufacturer ZF Sachs. This combination reduces the need for a torque converter in the driveline. During start-up the driveline will instead use the the electrical motors high torque at low speeds, which reaches about 770 Nm in this case, and then switch to the combustion engine at higher speeds. The included hybrid technology reduces fuel consumption by almost 15 % and also provides the ability to convert braking energy into electrical energy to recharge the batteries. The hybrid technology also offers the ability to connect the electric motor to the drivetrain as an extra "boost" when there is a need for faster acceleration at higher speeds. The work with the hubless wheel resulted in the development of nine separate shafts mounted on the outside of the fixed inner rim. Four radial and two axial bearings were mounted to each shaft. This makes it possible for the outer rim, the tire and the disc brake to rotate freely outside the inner rim. The bearings were selected and dimensioned through a self-developed model concerning possible loads and stresses. Finally the drivetrain was concentric and vibration damped mounted inside the hubless wheels inner rim via a self-developed engine suspension. The impulsion is transferred from the drivetrain to the outer-rim by the spoke system. This system was also designed to reduce vibrations from spreading from the engine to the rest of the construction. The final construction was integrated and visualized as a conceptual motorcycle by Erik Evers, a former student at Luleå University of Technology. The following further development of the project is proposed: Complete the rear wheel mounting to the motorcycle. Determine the final axial center of gravity of the driveline when mounted in the rear wheel. Further develop the engine mount to encompass eight attachment points distributed over two different planes in the inner rim. Develop of one or more drive shafts interconnecting the driveline components. Examine the possibility of transition to fuel injection and digital ignition for better engine operation. Complete the seal between the <b>two</b> <b>rims</b> in the hubless wheel for increased resistance to dirt and moisture. Validerat; 20121028 (anonymous...|$|E
40|$|On {{the role}} of outside vs. inside {{interactions}} for the enantiorecognition by cyclodextrins: conventional mechanism and novel insights Native and derivatized cyclodextrins represent versatile chiral selectors for the separation of enantiomers by chromatographic and electromigratory methods. However, the underlying mechanisms of enantiorecognition are still poorly understood. While {{the presence of a}} cavity and inclusion therein is often thought to be of prime importance for enantioseparation of racemic analytes it is conceivable that this effect can be complemented, or even overridden, by interaction of analytes with the external surface of cyclodextrins. To probe the importance of the molecular inclusion mechanism, linear dextrin derivatives - devoid of a true cavity - have been synthesized and compared with their cyclic analogues with regard to their properties as chiral selectors for enantioselective gas chromatography. Via the comparison of cyclic and acyclic dextrins (cyclodextrins versus 'acyclodextrins') it is demonstrated that the existence of a cavity is not a prerequisite to enantiorecognition. Thus, the well known gas-chromatographic selector heptakis(2, 3 -di-O-acetyl- 6 -O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl) -beta-cyclodextrin has been compared with the corresponding linear derivative heptakis[(2, 3 -di-O, 4 ''-O) -acetyl-(1 '-O, 6 -O) -tert-butyldimethylsilyl]-maltoheptaose and a complementary enantioseparation ability for alpha-amino acid derivatives (N-trifluoroacetyl-O-methyl/ethyl-esters) and racemic halogenated compounds was observed. In several cases, the acyclic chiral stationary phase (CSP) was even more enantioselective than the cyclic CSP. While it is conceivable that the maltoheptaose derivative could still form a "pseudo cavity" which is responsible for the observed enantiorecognition, this is certainly not the case with the maltotriose and glucose derivatives, these molecules being too small to be able to form a helical conformation. Surprisingly, even on the single building block comprising cyclodextrins and linear dextrins, i. e., (2, 3, 4 -tri-O-acetyl- 1, 6 -di-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl) -D-glucose, the enantiomers of some alpha-amino acid derivatives and racemic halogenated compounds could be separated by gas chromatography. Whereas cyclodextrins are available only in the D form, the linear counterparts can readily be synthesized in the D and L form, which is of interest for peak inversion scenarios in the chromatographic analysis of non-racemic mixtures. These unexpected enantioseparations prove the existence of enantioselective interactions with the outer surface of the selector. Enantiorecognition mechanism by NMR spectroscopic studies The controversial role of the inclusion phenomenon by cyclodextrins has also been verified by NMR studies in solution, where investigations were focused on the enantiorecognition process and on the conformation of the derivatized chiral selector. In this respect, derivatized cyclodextrins differ strongly from the native macrocycles. Due to the distortion of the glucose units and their tilting across the glycosidic linkages, the conformation of modified alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrin selectors are often significantly different from a classical torus shaped structure and the diameter of the cavity is markedly affected by derivatization. Thus, the functional groups on the <b>two</b> <b>rims</b> of cyclodextrins {{play an important role in}} the complexation step as demonstrated in this work for the enantiodiscrimination of 'compound B' by heptakis(2, 3 -di-O-acetyl- 6 -O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl) -beta-cyclodextrin. The yet unchallenged role of the cavity in the enantioseparation process of racemic hydrocarbons In the case of apolar racemic analytes such as saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, the inclusion process still appears to be the driving force for enantiorecognition on the well established selector Chirasil-beta-Dex, since no enantioseparation is observed on the acyclic counterpart of linear permethylated maltoheptaose (both as the diluted and supported CSP). However, in many cases, e. g. for the per-O-methylated beta-cyclodextrin, {{the role of}} the cavity is not very well understood. Thus, the application of linear selectors as novel CSP represents a comparable tool to determine whether an inclusion phenomenon is present or absent with the established cyclic selectors. Furthermore, the size of the cavity cannot be the sole parameter in rationalizing the enantiorecognition because the nature of the functional groups on the <b>two</b> <b>rims</b> plays a key role for the overall structure by modifying the cavity size and by directing the enantiorecognition towards the external surface of the macrocycles. Über die Rolle von externen und internen Wechselwirkungen für die Enantiomerenerkennung durch Cyclodextrine: konventioneller Mechanismus und neue Erkenntnisse Native and derivatisierte Cyclodextrine stellen effektive chirale Selektoren zur Enantiomerentrennung durch Chromatographie und Elektromigration dar. Allerdings werden die verantwortlichen Mechanismen der Enantiomerenerkennung kaum verstanden. Während die Gegenwart einer Kavität, und Inklusion in dieselbe, oft als Hauptursache für die Enantiomerenerkennung racemischer Analyte angesehen wird, kann es sein, dass dieser Effekt ergänzt oder übertroffen wird durch die Wechselwirkung mit der externen Oberfläche der Cyclodextrine. Um die Signifikanz der molekularen Inklusion zu untersuchen, wurden lineare Dextrinderivate, die über keine Kavität verfügen, synthetisiert und mit ihren cyclischen Analoga im Hinblick auf ihre Eigenschaften als chirale Selektoren für die enantioselektive Gaschromatographie verglichen. Mithilfe des Vergleichs von cyclischen und acyclischen Dextrinen (Cyclodextrine versus 'Acyclodextrine') wird gezeigt, dass die Existenz einer Kavität keine Voraussetzung für die Enantiomerenerkennung ist. So wurde der bekannte Selektor Heptakis(2, 3 -di-O-acetyl- 6 -O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl) -beta-cyclodextrin mit dem entsprechenden linearen Derivat Heptakis[(2, 3 -di-O, 4 ''-O) -acetyl-(1 '-O, 6 -O) -tert-butyldimethylsilyl]-maltoheptaose verglichen und es wurde eine komplementäre Enantiomerenerkennung für alpha-Aminosäurederivate (N-Trifluoroacetyl-O-methyl/ethyl-ester) und racemische halogenierte Verbindungen beobachtet. In verschiedenen Fällen war die acyclische chirale stationary Phase (CSP) sogar enantioselektiver als die cyclische CSP. Während es vorstellbar ist, dass das Maltoheptaose-Derivat immer noch eine "Pseudokavität" ausbildet, die für die beobachtete Enantiomerenerkennung verantwortlich ist, gilt dies sicher nicht für die Maltotriose und Glucosederivate, da diese Moleküle zu klein sind, um eine helikale Konformation auszubilden. Überraschenderweise wurden sogar mit dem einfachen Baustein der Cyclodextrine und linearen Dextrine, nämlich mit (2, 3, 4 -tri-O-acetyl- 1, 6 -di-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl) -D-glucose, die Enantiomere einiger alpha-Aminosäurederivate und racemischer halogenierter Verbindungen durch Gaschromatographie getrennt. Während Cyclodextrine nur in der D Form verfügbar sind, können die linearen Gegenstücke in einfacher Weise in der D und L Form hergestellt werden, was wichtig ist für Peakinversionszenarios in der chromatographischen Analyse von of nicht-racemischen Mischungen. Diese unerwarteten Enantiomerentrennungen beweisen die Existenz von enantioselektiven Wechselwirkungen mit der äußeren Oberfläche der Selektoren. Enantiomerenerkennungsmechanismus durch NMR spektroscopische Untersuchungen Die kontroverse Rolle des Inklusionsphänomens durch Cyclodextrine wurde auch durch NMR Untersuchungen in Lösung verifiziert, wobei die Untersuchungen auf den Enantiomerenerkennungsprozess und auf die Konformation des derivatisierten chiralen Selektors fokussiert wurde. In diesem Zusammenhang unterscheiden sich derivatisierte Cyclodextrine stark von den nativen Makrocyclen. Aufgrund der Verzerrung der Glucoseeinheiten und ihrer Neigung gegenüber der glycosidischen Bindungen weist die Konformation der modifizierten Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-Cyclodextrinselektoren oft in markanter Weise Unterschiede gegenüber der klassischen Torus-Struktur auf und der Durchmesser der Kavität wird deutlich durch die Derivatisierung beeinflusst. So spielen die funktionellen Gruppen an den Öffnungen der Cyclodextrine eine wichtige Rolle im Komplexierungsschritt wie in dieser Arbeit anhand der Enantiomerendiskriminierung von 'compound B' an Heptakis(2, 3 -di-O-acetyl- 6 -O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl) -beta-cyclodextrin gezeigt wurde. Die unumstrittene Rolle der Kavität im Enantiomerenerkennungsprozess racemischer Kohlenwasserstoffe Im Falle apolarer racemischer Analyte wie gesättigte aliphatische Kohlenwasserstoffe erscheint immer noch der Inklusionsprozess die Treibkraft der Enantiomerenerkennung an dem etablierten Selektor Chirasil-beta-Dex zu sein, zumal keine Enantiomerenerkennung an dem acyclischen Gegenstück, der linearen permethylierten Maltoheptaose (beide als verdünnte und gebundene CSP), beobachtet wurde. Fernerhin kann die Größe der Kavität nicht der einzige Parameter in der Rationalisierung der Enantiomerenerkennung sein, da die Natur der funktionellen Gruppen an beiden Öffnungen eine wesentliche Rolle für die Gesamtstruktur spielen, indem diese die Größe der Kavität modifizieren und die Enantiomerenerkennung in Richtung der externen Oberfläche der Makrocyclen dirigieren...|$|E
