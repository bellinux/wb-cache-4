5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> related {{negative}} publicity, Turner {{accepted the}} lead role in Ross Hunter's remake of Imitation of Life (1959) {{under the direction of}} Douglas Sirk. Universal Studios capitalized on her new-found notoriety; the result {{was one of the biggest}} hits of the year, and the biggest of Turner's career; she owned 50% of the earnings of the picture and during just the first year of the film's release she earned $11 million. According to Hunter, the film made an excess of $50 million in box office receipts. Critics and audiences could not help noticing that the plots of Peyton Place and Imitation of Life each seemed to mirror certain parts of Turner's private life. Specifically, both films depicted the troubled, complicated relationship between a single mother and her teenaged daughter.|$|E

The group {{attempts}} to fight him, but he proves to be too powerful. When notified by Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) that the Hierophant cannot enter houses without permission, Jake shapeshifts into a house and the group takes shelter inside. The Hierophant then tells Marceline that he didn't come to fight, but to propose an alliance to take down the Vampire King together. Marceline agrees only {{on the condition that}} the Hierophant no longer drinks blood, but he attacks her instead. During the struggle, he is accidentally knocked into Jake and dies due to entering a house uninvited. Marceline reabsorbs his shapeshifting powers but then falls ill, having been stung and poisoned by the Hierophant's stinger. Princess Bubblegum takes Marceline to the Candy Kingdom {{to try to find a}} cure for the Hierophant's poison. Meanwhile, Finn and Jake track down the Moon in hopes of using her healing power to heal Marceline. Upon finding the Moon, they find that due to her healing powers, they can't kill her with their stakes. When the sun sets, the Moon wakes up and Finn and Jake flee, luring the Moon to the Candy Kingdom. However, when they try to fight back, the Moon uses her powers to incapacitate Finn and Jake as she attempts to kill Marceline. Fortunately, Peppermint Butler stabs the Moon in the back, her only weak spot. Marceline reabsorbs the Moon's healing power and fully recovers from the poison.|$|E
