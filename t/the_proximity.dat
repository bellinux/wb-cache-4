5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave located {{over the}} open Pacific Ocean organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} the next day. Shortly afterwards, wind shear increased. Lowell's convection was disrupted, and its center of circulation became exposed. The cyclone crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on October 26. The shear relaxed, and the depression restrengthened into a tropical storm. Lowell drifted in slow steering currents until it approached Hurricane Huko. <b>The</b> <b>proximity</b> of Huko caused a gradual weakening in Lowell, and it dissipated on October 31.|$|E

Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> of the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|Although the willie wagtail is an {{aggressive}} defender of its nest, predators do account for many eggs and young.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> to the entrance of Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships. Another reason was that mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E
5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> of the threat based on the loudness of bird song {{as well as the}} level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E
5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Stapleton Road passed to Regional Railways. All trains along the Severn Beach Line ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular. This was changed in the mid-1990s, with a more frequent service to Avonmouth but very few on to Severn Beach and no Sunday services. Services at Stapleton Road were boosted due to <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> of Eastville Stadium, but this use ended in 1986 when Bristol Rovers F.C. moved to Twerton Park in Bath.|$|E
5|$|Cassel was {{annexed to}} France the {{following}} year {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war. The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to fortify both hills. In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty was now a significant distance from Cassel and without <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> of the border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} of my dissertation {{is to improve}} two weaknesses of Random Forests. One, the failure to detect genetic interactions between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in higher dimensions when the interacting SNPs both have weak main effects and two, the difficulty of interpretation in comparison to parametric methods such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and linear regression. We focus on detecting pairwise SNP interactions in genome case-control studies. We determine the best parameter settings to optimize the detection of SNP interactions and improve the efficiency of Random Forests and present an efficient filtering method. The filtering method is compared to leading methods and is shown that it is computationally faster with good detection power. Random Forests allows us to identify clusters, outliers, and important features for subgroups of observations through the visualization of <b>the</b> <b>proximities.</b> We improve <b>the</b> interpretation of Random Forests through <b>the</b> <b>proximities.</b> <b>The</b> result of <b>the</b> new <b>proximities</b> are asymmetric, and the appropriate visualization requires an asymmetric model for interpretation.

The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline, the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used to park disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.|$|E

Tennessee held a 5-2 advantage in the series, but before 1994, the last meeting between them was in 1937. The 1994 meeting was in the 1994 Gator Bowl, which the Volunteers won 45-23. Each school rapidly sold its allotment of 17,000 tickets, and publicly available tickets were sold out before the matchup was announced. This gave the Chick-fil-A Bowl its 13th consecutive sellout.|$|E
30|$|From Table  1, {{it is also}} {{observed}} that the ranks of CFRs and CCFVs are consistent with <b>the</b> electrical <b>proximities</b> of fault positions to the inverter, {{which means that the}} closer <b>the</b> electrical <b>proximity,</b> <b>the</b> smaller is the CFR and the lower is the CCFV. For this reason, faults occurring at SZ station have less influence on commutation compared with faults occurring at other stations, and faults at LD station are the most unfavorable.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This is {{a survey}} of {{compactification}} extension results and problems for a special class of <b>proximities.</b> <b>The</b> compatible Efremovič <b>proximities</b> on a Tichonov space are ordered by δ ≤ ρ if for all A,B ⊆ X, AδB → AρB. It {{is well known that}} the Smirnov completions of <b>the</b> Efremovič <b>proximities</b> give a one-to-one, order reversing correspondence between the Hausdorff compactifications and <b>the</b> <b>proximities.</b> This merely means that <b>the</b> <b>proximities</b> share <b>the</b> compactification lattice order problem (“find a necessary and sufficient condition on X that the Hausdorff compactifications form a lattice”). While it is not practical to work on the order problems by embedding the Hausdorff compactifications in the larger family of T 1 compactifications, there simply being no end to the latter, <b>the</b> Efremovič <b>proximities</b> generalize nicely to the complete lattice of Ladato proximities. When Gagrat and Naimpally showed that <b>the</b> compatible separated <b>proximities</b> on a space complete to T 1 compactifications, it seemed a solution to the order problem was at last in sight. Unfortunately, troubles remain. The Gagrat-Naimpally compactifications are among the T 1 compactifications, yes, but which ones are they? Moreover, the corresponding order between the completions breaks down. Even a p-map between proximity spaces will only lift, in general, to a continuous extension from the Gagrat-Naimpally completion of the domain to the “bunch space ” of the range — something rich and strange. What follows is an attempt to solve these problems for the special case of Lodato <b>proximities</b> in <b>the</b> style of Wallman-Frink. Definition 1. Let X be a T 1 space with at least two points. Let B be any base for the closed sets such that (1) B is a network (i. e. x ∈ G, open, implies there is some B ∈ B with x ∈ B ⊆ G), an...|$|R
