5|$|The kebbe {{consists}} of cement buildings that are built overnight {{and made to}} look permanent to avoid destruction by the authorities. In 1999, it was estimated <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the city's inhabitants lived in tents and shacks, which were used for residential as well as business purposes. The city is broken into nine arrondissements, sub-divided into alphabetised Îlots. These are Teyarett, Ksar, Tevragh Zeïna, Toujournine, Sebkha, El Mina, Dar Naïm, Arafat and Riad. The Sebkha (Cinquième) Arrondissement {{is home to a}} large shopping area.|$|E
5|$|This species' {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} shallow water is naturally susceptible to {{problems such as}} drought or the encroachment of vegetation, but this duck's habitat might be increasingly threatened by climate change. Populations are also affected by the conversion of wetlands and grassland to arable crops, depriving the duck of feeding and nesting areas. Spring planting means that many nests of this early breeding duck are destroyed by farming activities, and a Canadian study showed <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the surveyed nests were destroyed by agricultural work such as ploughing and harrowing.|$|E
5|$|In other areas, Grameen has {{had very}} high payback rates—over 98 percent. However, {{according}} to the Wall Street Journal, in 2001 {{a fifth of the}} bank's loans were more than a year overdue. Grameen says <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> its borrowers in Bangladesh (close to 50 million) have risen out of acute poverty thanks to their loan, as measured by such standards as having all children of school age in school, all household members eating three meals a day, a sanitary toilet, a rainproof house, clean drinking water, and the ability to repay a 300 taka-a-week (around 4 USD) loan.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1990s the {{function}} of the cerebellum was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have brought that view into question. Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown interactions between the cerebellum and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the cerebellum. In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children. Estimates based on functional mapping of the cerebellum using functional MRI suggest <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the cerebellar cortex is interconnected with association zones of the cerebral cortex.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} two decades, public support for {{same-sex}} marriage has steadily increased, and polls indicate <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> Americans support same-sex marriage. Voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington approved same-sex marriage by referendum on 6 November 2012.|$|E

25|$|More recently, {{many states}} have {{authorized}} financial requirements {{that will make it}} more difficult for working-poor adults to access coverage. In Wisconsin, nearly a quarter of Medicaid patients were dropped after the state government imposed premiums of 3% of household income.

25|$|The MTA is in {{the midst}} of a {{large-scale}} project to bring Long Island Rail Road trains into the terminal via the East Side Access Project. The project was spurred by a study that showed <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> LIRR riders work closer to Grand Central than to the current terminus at Penn Station. The East Side Access has resulted in major blasting work under Grand Central Terminal. Since March 2007, about 1000 workers have completed more than 2,400 controlled blasts ending about October 4, 2013.|$|E
25|$|Corruption {{has been}} a {{pervasive}} problem in India. A 2005 study by Transparency International (TI) found <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> those surveyed had first-hand experience of paying a bribe or peddling influence {{to get a job}} done in a public office in the previous year. A follow-up study in 2008 found this rate to be 40 percent. In 2011, TI ranked India at 95th place amongst 183 countries in perceived levels of public sector corruption. In 2014, India saw a reduction in corruption and improved the ranking to 85th place.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, CBO {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> {{the combined}} benefits of 10 major tax expenditures {{would apply to}} households in the top 20% income group, and that 17% of the benefit {{would go to the}} top 1% households. The top 20% of income earners pay about 70% of federal income taxes, excluding payroll taxes. For scale, 50% of the $1.5 trillion in tax expenditures in 2016 was $750 billion, while the U.S. budget deficit was approximately $600 billion. In other words, eliminating the tax expenditures for the top 20% might balance the budget over the short-term, depending on economic feedback effects.|$|E

25|$|In April 2008, the Union of Concerned Scientists said <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> {{the nearly}} 1,600 EPA staff {{scientists}} who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported {{they had experienced}} incidents of political interference in their work. The survey included chemists, toxicologists, engineers, geologists and experts in other fields of science. About 40% of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent {{in the last five}} years than in previous years. The highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life.|$|E
25|$|Necessity. Corporate tree-planting {{is not a}} new idea; farming {{operations}} have been used by companies making paper from trees for a long time. If farmed trees are replanted, and the products made from them are placed into landfills rather than recycled, a very safe, efficient, economical and time-proven method of geological sequestration of greenhouse carbon {{is the result of the}} paper product use cycle. This only holds if the paper in the land fill is not decomposted. In most landfills, this is the case and leads to the fact <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the greenhouse gas emissions from the life cycle of paper products occur from landfill methane emissions.|$|E
25|$|The {{main issue}} of gender {{equality}} in Ivory Coast is the education. According to CIA World Factbook, the literacy rate in Ivory Coast in total is 43.1%. 53.1% of males can {{read and write}} and only 32.5% of females can read and write. This shows <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> men can read, and {{less than half of}} women can read. It also states that the school life expectancy for males is ten years, whereas for girls it’s eight years. So far, no specific organizations have helped women education in Ivory Coast. However, many organizations have helped education for women in Africa as a whole, such as Africa Education Trust and Aid for Africa.|$|E

25|$|Notes in the Mitrokhin Archive claim <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet Union's {{weapons are}} based on US designs, that the KGB tapped Henry Kissinger's {{telephone}} when he was US Secretary of State, and had spies in place in almost all US defense contractor facilities. In France, some 35 senior politicians were alleged to have worked for the KGB during the Cold War. In West Germany, the KGB {{was said to have}} infiltrated the major political parties, the judiciary, and the police. Large-scale sabotage preparations were supposedly made against the US, Canada and elsewhere in case of war, including hidden weapons caches; several have been removed or destroyed by police relying on Mitrokhin's information.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{classify}} debris {{as either}} land- or ocean-based; in 1991, the United Nations Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution estimated {{that up to}} 80% of the pollution was land-based. More recent studies have found <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> plastic debris found on Korean shores is ocean-based. A wide variety of anthropogenic artifacts can become marine debris; plastic bags, balloons, buoys, rope, medical waste, glass bottles and plastic bottles, cigarette stubs, cigarette lighters, beverage cans, polystyrene, lost fishing line and nets, and various wastes from cruise ships and oil rigs are among the items commonly found to have washed ashore. Six pack rings, in particular, are considered emblematic of the problem.|$|E
25|$|Financial {{capital is}} mostly earned through remittances. Remittances are the {{transnational}} exchange of funds earned by migrants working abroad. In recent years, {{they have become}} an important global economic resource. In the 1990s, the estimated value of remittances doubled to over $105 billion each year. The United Nations estimates that the annual figure is around $232 billion, but the unofficial flow is unknown; it is possible <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the remittances earned go unrecorded each year. Remittances vary in the channels used to transfer money, the amount transferred, {{and the manner in}} which the money is invested, saved, and consumed. There is evidence that circular migrants are able to send back greater remittances than permanent migrants.|$|E
