Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.|$|E

25|$|Combining {{the brain}} bias towards facial {{processing}} and surface discovery, a follow-up study by Dr. Vuilleumier exposed subjects to paired visual stimuli in three phases. In the initial phase, stimuli were simply bilateral pairs, and extinction frequency was measured. In the next stage, the stimuli were surrounded with an oval, {{so that they}} appeared to represent eyes in a face. The extinction rate for this appearance was greatly reduced. Finally, the patients were shown the stimuli minus <b>the</b> <b>contextual</b> oval – however, the reduced extinction rate persisted, as though the patients had learned to group these stimuli. The effect did not occur when the stimuli were surrounded by a nonoval shape, pointing towards facial processing as being {{the key to this}} phenomenon.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the radical}} plan form and large {{scale of the}} New City {{attracted}} international attention, early phases of the city include work by celebrated architects, including Sir Richard MacCormac, Lord Norman Foster, Henning Larsen, Ralph Erskine, John Winter, and Martin Richardson. The Corporation itself attracted talented young architects led by the young and charismatic Derek Walker. Its strongly modernist designs featured regularly in the magazines Architectural Design and the Architects' Journal. Though strongly committed to sleek [...] "Miesian" [...] minimalism inspired by the German/ American architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, they also developed a strand of contextualism {{in advance of the}} wider adoption of commercial Post-Modernism as an architectural style in the 1980s. In the Miesian tradition were the Pineham Sewage Works, which Derek Walker regarded as his finest achievement, and the Shopping Building designed by Stuart Mosscrop and Christopher Woodward. <b>The</b> <b>contextual</b> tradition that ran alongside it is exemplified by the Coproration's infill scheme at Cofferidge Close, Stony Stratford, designed by Wayland Tunley, which inserts into a historic stretch of High Street a modern retail facility, offices and car park.|$|E

Approach: This study used Research and Development design. The technique of data collection used observation, documentation, Focus Group Discussion and questionnaire. The analysis of qualitative data used data collection, data reduction, data presentation and conclusion stages. Meanwhile, quantitative data analysis used correlation and regression analysis. The subjects of study were 98 students of Civic Education Study Program, Indonesia University of Education of academic year 2011 / 2012. Results: The finding showed that: (1) <b>the</b> living values-based <b>contextual</b> learning model conceptually in lecturing was the integration of living values into material, method, media, learning source and lecturing evaluation conceptually; (2) <b>the</b> living values-based <b>contextual</b> learning model was implemented through value learning variation in contextual learning (problem-based learning, cooperative learning, project-based learning, service learning and work-based learning); (3) the implementation of <b>the</b> living values-based <b>contextual</b> learning model had an effect by 26 % on the students character development Conclusion: <b>The</b> living values-based <b>contextual</b> learning is an alternative of character education integration model in university learning process.
