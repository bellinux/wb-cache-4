50|$|In electronics, a <b>transimpedance</b> <b>amplifier</b> (TIA) is a current-to-voltage converter, {{most often}} {{implemented}} using an operational amplifier. The TIA {{can be used}} to amplify the current output of Geiger-Müller tubes, photomultiplier tubes, accelerometers, photo detectors and other types of sensors to a usable voltage. Current-to-voltage converters are used with sensors that have a current response that is more linear than the voltage response. This is the case with photodiodes, where {{it is not uncommon for}} the current response to have better than 1% linearity over a wide range of light input. The <b>transimpedance</b> <b>amplifier</b> presents a low impedance to the photodiode and isolates it from the output voltage of the operational amplifier. In its simplest form a <b>transimpedance</b> <b>amplifier</b> has just a large-valued feedback resistor, Rf. The gain of the amplifier is set by this resistor and has a value of −Rf (because the amplifier is in an inverting configuration). There are several different configurations of transimpedance amplifiers, each suited to a particular application. The one factor they all have in common is the requirement to convert the low-level current of a sensor to a voltage. The gain, bandwidth, as well as current and voltage offsets, change with different types of sensors, requiring different configurations of transimpedance amplifiers.|$|E
50|$|Often the {{detector}} {{is a simple}} Faraday plate coupled to a <b>transimpedance</b> <b>amplifier,</b> however, more advanced ion mobility instruments are coupled with mass spectrometers {{in order to obtain}} both size and mass information simultaneously. It is noteworthy that {{the detector}} influences the optimum operating conditions for the ion mobility experiment.|$|E
50|$|For a good noise performance, a high {{feedback}} resistance should thus be used. However, a larger {{feedback resistance}} increases the output voltage swing, and consequently a higher {{gain from the}} operational amplifier is needed, demanding an operational amplifier with a high gain-bandwidth product. The feedback resistance and therefore the sensitivity are thus limited by the required operating frequency of the <b>transimpedance</b> <b>amplifier.</b>|$|E

50|$|If {{the gain}} is large, any {{input offset voltage}} at the {{non-inverting}} input of the op-amp will result in an output DC offset. An input bias current on the inverting terminal of the op-amp will similarly result in an output offset.

5000|$|In the Bode plot of a <b>transimpedance</b> <b>amplifier</b> with no compensation, {{the flat}} curve with the peak, labeled I-to-V gain, is the {{frequency}} {{response of the}} <b>transimpedance</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The peaking of the gain curve is typical of uncompensated or poorly compensated transimpedance amplifiers. The curve labeled AOL is the open-loop response of the amplifier. The feedback factor, plotted as a reciprocal, is labeled 1/β. In Fig. 5 the 1/β curve and AOL form an equilateral triangle with the frequency axis. The two sides have equal but opposite slopes, since one {{is the result of}} a first-order pole, and the other of a first-order zero. Each slope has a magnitude of 20 dB/decade, corresponding to a phase shift of 90°. When the amplifier's 180° of phase inversion is added to this, the result is a full 360° at the fi intercept, indicated by the dashed vertical line. At that intercept, 1/β = AOL for a loop gain of AOLβ = 1. Oscillation will occur at the frequency fi because of the 360° phase shift, or positive feedback, and the unity gain. [...] To mitigate these effects, designers of transimpedance amplifiers add a small-value compensating capacitor (Cf in the figure above) in parallel with the feedback resistor. When this feedback capacitor is considered, the compensated feedback factor becomes ...|$|E
