500|$|When Rundgren {{discovered}} that the deal with RCA did not actually exist, Albert Grossman, who had been Bob Dylan's manager, offered {{to put it on}} his Bearsville label but needed more money. Rundgren had essentially paid for the album himself. Mo Ostin at Warner Bros. was impressed, but other senior people rejected them after they performed live. Steinman had offended them a few years earlier by auditioning with a song named [...] "Who Needs the Young", which contains the lyric [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>anyone</b> left who can fuck?

500|$|Nine minutes later, at 23:39, Fleet spotted {{an iceberg}} in Titanics path. He rang the lookout bell {{three times and}} telephoned the bridge to inform Sixth Officer James Moody. Fleet asked [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>anyone</b> there?" [...] Moody replied, [...] "Yes, what do you see?" [...] Fleet replied: [...] "Iceberg, right ahead!" [...] After thanking Fleet, Moody relayed the message to Murdoch, who ordered Quartermaster Robert Hichens to change the ship's course. Murdoch is {{generally}} believed to have given the order [...] "Hard astarboard" [...] which {{would result in the}} ship's tiller being moved all the way to starboard (the right side of the ship) in an attempt to turn the ship to port (left). He also rang [...] "Full Astern" [...] on the ship's telegraphs.|$|E
500|$|Nick Krewen, {{writing for}} The Star, {{dismissed}} [...] "Pusher Love Girl" [...] as a [...] "dull dirge" [...] {{of a song}} that [...] "plods along at a midtempo slog lasting five minutes, before a false ending and equally dull coda drag our carcasses another 400 meters after its initial impact". He wrote that [...] "just when we feel we've escaped with minor scratches", Timberlake repeats the line [...] "I'm a junkie for your love" [...] ad nauseam [...] "until the song reaches its merciful resolution". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy wrote that [...] "Pusher Love Girl" [...] begins [...] "perky enough", but that is [...] "hard to justify" [...] its length when it feels repetitive after the first three minutes and [...] "self-indulgent thereafter". HitFix reviewer Melinda Newman was critical of the lyric [...] "hydroponic jelly bean", commenting: [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>anyone</b> else on God's green earth that could pull off calling someone that?" ...|$|E

500|$|Critic Lyman B. Hagen {{states that}} much of Angelou's poetry and most of her writings, {{especially}} [...] "Worker's Song", the first poem in I Shall Not Be Moved, praises the laborer. [...] He says, [...] "In Angelou's writings, rarely is <b>there</b> <b>anyone</b> who does not work. [...] Everyone of her characters—singers, dancers, railway workers, etc.—works hard". [...] Critic Hazel Rochman, who calls the poem an [...] "exquisitely simple worksong", states that Angelou connects physical action with wit and longing. [...] She compares it to the performances of singer Paul Robeson and to Langston Hughes' poem [...] "Florida Road Workers". [...] Michele Howe calls I Shall Not Be Moved [...] "a collection that testifies to the undaunted spirit of oppressed people everywhere", and states that it [...] "relates a history of hard work, pain, joy, and the affection and heartbreak often associated with love". [...] She also mentions [...] "Worker's Song" [...] in her article in the New Jersey newspaper The Star-Ledger, stating that it describes the struggles of the workers that [...] "keep the whole world running".|$|E
500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is <b>there</b> <b>anyone</b> {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Elijah {{of legend}} {{did not lose}} any {{of his ability to}} afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai is illustrative. Once, when walking a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man—the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, [...] "Peace be with thee, Rabbi." [...] Instead of {{returning}} the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, [...] "How ugly you are! Is <b>there</b> <b>anyone</b> as ugly as you in your town?" [...] Elijah responded with, [...] "I don’t know. Perhaps you should tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction." [...] The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1950s the public's musical {{preferences}} shifted toward toward {{rhythm and}} blues and rock and roll, ending the careers of most older artists. Carmichael's songwriting career also slowed down, but he continued to perform. He appeared in the motion picture Young Man with a Horn (1950), based on friend Bix Beiderbecke's life, with Bacall and Kirk Douglas. [...] "In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening", with lyrics by Johnny Mercer, was featured in the 1951 film Here Comes the Groom and won Carmichael his first Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Mercer his second of four Academy Awards. In 1952 Carmichael played his composition [...] "My Resistance Is Low" [...] in the Howard Hughes film The Las Vegas Story. The lyrics were written by Harold Adamson. Although the song did not catch fire in the United States, it was a hit in Great Britain. Carmichael also composed seven songs for Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), but only two made the final cut: [...] "Ain't <b>There</b> <b>Anyone</b> Here for Love", sung by Jane Russell, and [...] "When Love Goes Wrong (Nothing Goes Right)". Harold Campbell Adamson wrote the lyrics or both songs.|$|E
2500|$|Leung's father saw an {{advertisement}} for a Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire casting call, and suggested she should try out. She waited four hours {{in line for a}} five-minute audition, despite feeling she had little likelihood of obtaining the role, Two weeks later, she was called back for a workshop and was cast as Cho Chang, beating out over 3,000 other girls for the part. In retrospect, she stated {{in an interview with the}} Daily Record that her Scottish accent probably gave her an advantage in the casting, as the casting director asked the girls who attended the audition, [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>anyone</b> here from Scotland?", to which only Leung raised her hand. In a 2011 interview, Leung said her fondest memory of the Harry Potter experience was the first audition, because both her parents, who were separated at the time, went with her. [...] "It was a really nice moment because my parents hadn't seen each other for a long, long time," [...] Leung said. In an effort to heavily promote Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Warner Bros. sent Leung to China in the film's second week of release, which was unusual for a market not used to frequent celebrity visits.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reaching}} the water, Lowe ordered his lifeboat to be rowed about [...] {{away from the}} Titanic. When the ship foundered at around 2.20AM, Lowe had begun to gather several lifeboats together. He wished to return to pick up survivors but had fears of being swamped by hordes of people. He redistributed the survivors {{in the group of}} lifeboats he had gathered, to ready one lifeboat for a search for additional survivors. The lifeboat he took back {{to the site of the}} sinking had no passengers and an excess of crewmen, saying [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>anyone</b> alive out there" [...] to facilitate rescue. Reluctantly, he waited until the screams died down before returning. When he returned to gather survivors, he picked up only four men, one of whom died later that night. Lowe's was one of two boats to return for survivors. After that, Lowe had his crew of men raise the mast (he was the only officer to make use of the mast and sail in each lifeboat); using a breeze that had sprung up, he continued on to rescue the passengers on the sinking Collapsible A. Lowe and his group of lifeboats were picked up the next morning by the [...] An image taken by a passenger on the Carpathia clearly shows Lowe at the tiller of lifeboat 14 as they approach rescue. He remained aboard his lifeboat long enough to ship the mast and make certain everything was properly stowed.|$|E
