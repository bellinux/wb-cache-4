40|$|This article {{deals with}} the problem of {{controlling}} a <b>tandem</b> <b>line</b> of manufacturing machines such that an unknown production demand is tracked with a desired accuracy. To study this problem, a manufacturing machine is approximated by an integrator which is subject to input saturation {{as a result of the}} finite capacity of the machine. To solve the problem in the case of unknown demand rate, a combination of feedforward–feedback controller with a reduced-order observer is proposed. The decentralised feedback control strategy for a line of machines is proposed and studied both in continuous time-domain and in frequency-domain representation. The presented illustrating example for a line of four machines underlines the efficiency of the proposed frequency-domain-based performance analysis tool...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} of two papers dealing with the optimal bu er {{allocation}} problem in <b>tandem</b> manufacturing <b>lines</b> with unreliable machines. We address the theoretical issues that arise when using sample-path optimization, a simulation-based optimization method, to solve this problem. Sample-path optimization is a recent method to optimize performance functions of stochastic systems. By exploiting the fact that the performance function we want to optimize is the almost sure limit of a sequence of random functions, it overcomes some of the di culties from which variants of stochastic approximation methods su er. We provide a mathematical framework that makes use of a function space construction to model the dependence of throughput on bu er capacities and maximum ow rates of machines. Using this framework we prove various structural properties of throughput and show how these properties, along with a niceness condition on the steady-state, can be used to prove that the sample-path optimization method converges almost surely when applied to the bu er allocation problem. Among the properties established, monotonicity in bu er capacities and in ma- chine ow rates are especially important. Although monotonicity results of this nature have appeared in the literature for discrete <b>tandem</b> <b>lines,</b> as far as we are aware the kind of analysis we present here has not yet been done for continuous <b>tandem</b> <b>lines.</b> ...|$|R

Next, we consider understaffed <b>tandem</b> <b>lines</b> with partially or fully flexible servers, determine optimal and heuristic server assignment policies, and show that most of the benefits of full flexibility can be achieved with limited flexibility. Finally, we incorporate the setups to our model, determine the optimal server assignment policy for some systems and show how the effective assignment of servers depends on the magnitude of the setup costs.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} effective management of cross-trained workforce in manufacturing and service systems. In particular, non-collaborative queueing networks with cross-trained (flexible) servers are analyzed. For finite-buffered Markovian tandem networks with two stations, non-collaborative flexible servers, and no setups; the optimal server assignment policy is identified. For larger tandem networks, myopic server assignment heuristics are developed. It is {{also shown that}} the improvement that can be gained through collaboration is dependent on similarity of the tasks in the system, {{as well as the}} buffer sizes. When the server reassignments result in setup costs, the profit-optimal server assignment policy for Markovian <b>tandem</b> <b>lines</b> with two stations, homogeneous tasks is characterized to be of double threshold type. Our results demonstrate that the structure of the optimal policy depends both on the magnitude of the setup costs and the buffer size. For systems with non-homogeneous tasks and/or non-constant setup costs, near-optimal server assignment heuristics were provided. Finally, dynamic server allocation in queueing networks with general topology and routing is analyzed. For non-collaborative networks with infinite buffers, a processor sharing scheme that achieves an upper bound on the long-run average throughput is introduced. For Markovian systems with two stations, finite buffers, and homogeneous tasks, processor sharing attains the non-collaborative optimal throughput as the buffer size grows. To achieve near-optimal throughput in systems where processor sharing is not implementable, a class of round-robin policies that approximate processor sharing is proposed. Numerical results suggest these policies are near-optimal in systems with finite buffers and various topologies. Ph. D...|$|R

Given the numerous control mechanisms introduced in recent years, it {{is a difficult}} task to evaluate which mechanism is best suited for a specific application. Using simulation, design of experiments and response surface methodology, various homogenous lines controlled by Kanban, CONWIP and the hybrid Kanban/CONWIP control mechanisms are optimized and then compared. It is observed that the hybrid mechanism always outperforms CONWIP and Kanban when storage space and inventory costs are considered explicitly. However, hybrid is equivalent to CONWIP when storage space costs are not considered explicitly but rather aggregated with the inventory costs in the holding costs as usually found in the literature. Furthermore, with the increase of storage space cost and the number of workstations, Kanban outperforms CONWIP.

The machines operate according to a static priority rule, operating on the highest priority part whenever possible, and operating on lower priority parts only when unable to produce those with higher priorities. We develop a new decomposition method to analyze {{the behavior of the}} manufacturing system by decomposing the long production line into small analytically tractable components. As a first step in modeling a production line with more than one part type, we restrict ourselves to the case where there are two part types.

Then, a generalized longer flow line is analyzed. Furthermore, estimates for performance measures, such as average buffer levels and production rates, are presented and compared to extensive discrete event simulation.

40|$|One of the {{important}} aspects contributing to the competitiveness and success of a manufacturer is the efficient management for timely order delivery. After production orders are scheduled, there arises the need of a support tool {{to aid in the}} analysis with the available information, and to support managerial decision making which ultimately aims at on-time delivery. One way in which companies can meet due-dates of orders that are in jeopardy of being late, is to schedule overtime. This research presents a method used for 1) predict the completion times of scheduled jobs; and 2) optimizing overtime allocation when delays are foreseen. Mathematical mixed-integer linear program models are developed to represent the above problems for a <b>tandem</b> production <b>line</b> with single machine work stages. Non-operational downtime occurrences are considered in the production horizons which can be varied by work stage. Buffer areas (queues) are also included in the production system.

40|$|Automated {{manufacturing}} {{processes such as}} automotive <b>tandem</b> press <b>lines</b> include time dependent complex control functions. All motions and critical interactions between moving parts must be synchronised to avoid collisions and reach high production rate. It is even for a skilled operator hard to optimise these processes on-line. Therefore, a hardware-in-the-loop simulation including real industrial control systems and its control code establish an essential tool for optimisation. Additionally, an efficient optimisation algorithm is required to reach a useful simulation-based optimisation method. This paper proposes a new optimisation algorithm starting with the Lipschitzian algorithm DIRECT as global search and then switches over to the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm for local convergence. During the switch over, the new algorithm determines all local candidates of the set of points evaluated by DIRECT and starts multiple Nelder-Mead local searches in each of these. An optimisation study for an automotive press line shows that the proposed algorithm combines {{the benefits of the}} Lipschitzian and the simplex algorithms in an efficient way. The importance of multiple local searches from all local candidates found is also shown in the study. Based on the same number of function evaluations, it is also shown that this algorithm reaches improved press line performances compared to the stochastic differential evolution algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The {{deformation}} of compliant parts during material handling {{is a critical}} issue that can significantly affect the productivity and the parts' dimensional quality. There are multiple relevant aspects to consider when designing end-effectors to handle compliant parts, e. g. motion planning, holding force, part deformations, collisions, etc. This paper focuses on multi-robot material handling systems where the end-effector designs influence the coordination of the robots to prevent that these collide in the shared workspace. A multi-disciplinary methodology for end-effector design optimisation and multi-robot motion planning for material handling of compliant parts is proposed. The novelty is the co-adaptive optimisation of the end-effectors' structure with the robot motion planning to obtain the highest productivity and to avoid excessive part deformations. Based on FEA, the dynamic deformations of the parts are modelled in order to consider these during the collision avoidance between the handled parts and obstacles. The proposed methodology is evaluated for a case study that considers the multi-robot material handling of sheet metal parts in a multi-stage <b>tandem</b> press <b>line.</b> The results show that a substantial improvement in productivity can be achieved (up to 1. 9 %).
