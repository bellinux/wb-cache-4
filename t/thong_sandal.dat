50|$|The {{department}} had six undercover {{officers in the}} 1970s. Long hair, dirty jeans, and <b>thong</b> <b>sandals</b> provided cover while they worked in narcotic interdiction.|$|R
5000|$|Zōri (...) {{are flat}} and <b>thonged</b> Japanese <b>sandals</b> made of rice straw or other plant fibers, cloth, {{lacquered}} wood, leather, rubber, or—increasingly—synthetic materials. Zōri are {{quite similar to}} flip-flops, which first appeared in Australia, New Zealand and the United States sometime around World War II as rubber imitations of the wooden <b>thong</b> <b>sandals</b> long worn in Japan.|$|R
25|$|As civilizations {{began to}} develop, <b>thong</b> <b>sandals</b> (the {{precursors}} {{of the modern}} flip-flop) were worn. This practice dates back to pictures of them in ancient Egyptian murals from 4000 BC. One pair found in Europe was made of papyrus leaves and dated to be approximately 1,500 years old. They were also worn in Jerusalem during the first century of the Common Era. <b>Thong</b> <b>sandals</b> were worn by many civilizations and made {{from a wide variety}} of materials. Ancient Egyptian sandals were made from papyrus and palm leaves. The Masai of Africa made them out of rawhide. In India they were made from wood. In China and Japan, rice straw was used. The leaves of the sisal plant were used to make twine for sandals in South America while the natives of Mexico used the Yucca plant.|$|R
5000|$|The Bra Boys {{were made}} {{the subject of}} satire by The Chaser's War on Everything, episode 29, aired on 11 April 2007. In the skit Julian Morrow {{approached}} gang members while wearing a pill-filled brassiere and sporting a tattoo similar to Koby Abberton's saying [...] "mybrothersalibi". A gang member responded by slipping off one of his <b>thong</b> <b>sandals</b> and flinging it at Morrow.|$|R

50|$|They {{are made}} {{from a wide variety}} of materials, as were the ancient <b>thong</b> <b>sandals.</b> The modern sandals are made of more modern materials, such as rubber, foam, plastic, leather, suede, and even fabric. Thongs made of {{polyurethane}} have caused some environmental concerns; because polyurethane is a number 7 resin, they can't be easily discarded, and they persist in landfills for a very long time. In response to these concerns, some companies have begun selling flip-flops made from recycled rubber, such as that from used bicycle tires, or even hemp, and some offer a recycling program for used flip flops.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thong</b> <b>sandals</b> {{have been}} worn for {{thousands}} of years, dating back to pictures of them in ancient Egyptian murals from 4,000 BC. A pair found in Europe was made of papyrus leaves and dated to be approximately 1,500 years old. These early versions of flip-flops were made {{from a wide variety}} of materials. Ancient Egyptian sandals were made from papyrus and palm leaves. The Masai of Africa made them out of rawhide. In India, they were made from wood. In China and Japan, rice straw was used. The leaves of the sisal plant were used to make twine for sandals in South America, while the natives of Mexico used the yucca plant.|$|R
5000|$|The lack {{of support}} {{provided}} by <b>thong</b> <b>sandals</b> is thought {{by some to be}} a major cause of injuries. Some flip-flops have a spongy sole, causing the foot to roll further inward than normal when it hits the ground [...] - [...] an action called over-pronation, which is responsible for many foot problems [...] Overpronation may also lead to flat feet [...] Flip-flops can cause a person to overuse the tendons in their feet, resulting in tendonitis. The lack of an ankle strap that holds the foot in place is also a common reason for injury, as this causes wearers to scrunch their toes {{in an effort to keep}} the flip-flop in place, which can result in tendonitis.|$|R
5000|$|The Valluno dialect {{has many}} {{words and phrases}} not used outside of the region. People {{commonly}} greet one another with the phrase [...] "¿Q'hubo vé, bien o qué?". Also, {{it is common to}} be asked [...] "¿Sí o no?" [...] when assessing agreement to even rhetorical statements. <b>Thong</b> <b>sandals</b> are referred to as chanclas, and plastic bags (bolsas elsewhere) are called chuspas. As in other areas, a chocha here is another crude word for [...] "vagina". It is used the word chucha to refer to an opossum. A pachanguero is someone who dances/parties all night long. Andrés Caicedo was the main writer to depict the vernacular usage of language in an accurate manner.|$|R
2500|$|Northwestern {{has won the}} {{national}} championship in women's lacrosse five straight times, from 2005 to 2009, and then again in 2011 and 2012, giving them 7 championships in 8 years. In 2007, the team joined Maryland as the only other school to three-peat. The run started in 2005, when the team enjoyed a perfect season and defeated many long-established east-coast schools after only five years as a varsity sport to capture the school's first national championship since 1941. In doing so, it became the westernmost institution to ever win the title. Soon after, the team made national news when members appeared in a White House photo with President Bush wearing <b>thong</b> <b>sandals,</b> or flip-flops, dubbed as the [...] "White House flip-flop flap." [...] The 2009 season also was an undefeated run. In their five championship seasons, the Wildcats have a 106–3 record.|$|R
2500|$|While <b>thong</b> <b>sandals</b> were {{commonly}} worn, {{many people}} in ancient times, such as the Egyptians, Hindus and Greeks, saw little need for footwear, {{and most of the}} time, preferred being barefoot. The Egyptians and Hindus made some use of ornamental footwear, such as a soleless sandal known as a [...] "Cleopatra", which did not provide any practical protection for the foot. The ancient Greeks largely viewed footwear as self-indulgent, unaesthetic and unnecessary. Shoes were primarily worn in the theater, as a means of increasing stature, and many preferred to go barefoot. Athletes in the Ancient Olympic Games participated barefoot – and naked. Even the gods and heroes were primarily depicted barefoot, and the hoplite warriors fought battles in bare feet and Alexander the Great conquered his vast empire with barefoot armies. The runners of Ancient Greece are also believed to have run barefoot. Pheidippides, the first marathoner, ran from Athens to Sparta in less than 36 hours. After the Battle of Marathon, he ran straight from the battlefield to Athens to inform the Athenians of the news.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{flip-flop}} {{has been}} used in American and British English since the 1970s to describe the <b>thong</b> or no-heel-strap <b>sandal.</b> It is an onomatopoeia of the sound made by the sandals when walking in them. They are called thongs in Australia, jandals (originally a trademarked name derived from [...] "Japanese sandals") in New Zealand, slops in South Africa and tsinelas in the Philippines (or, in some Visayan localities, [...] "smagul", from the word smuggled).|$|R
5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people should avoid jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing <b>thongs</b> or <b>sandals</b> will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised {{to stay away from}} all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|R
5000|$|The {{people ask}} {{what they should}} do and John says share and that tax {{collectors}} and soldiers should not abuse their positions. They ask him if he is the Christ, and he replies [...] "I baptize you with water. But one more powerful than I will come, the <b>thongs</b> of whose <b>sandals</b> I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire." [...] (16) also found in Matthew 3:11 Mark 1:7-8 and John 1:26-27. John is then locked up by Herod for rebuking him about his wife Herodias and everything else as well.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{people come}} to be baptised by John. He tells them [...] "After me will come one more {{powerful}} than I, the <b>thongs</b> of whose <b>sandals</b> I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit". Untying someone's sandals was a task commonly done by someone's slave. What baptising with the Holy Spirit refers to, as Jesus never baptises in Mark, is uncertain if one only considers Mark. [...] has Jesus' disciples (but not Jesus) baptising {{at the same time}} as John the Baptist. (See also Paraclete, , , , [...]) Matthew 3:11 and Luke 3:16 specify baptism with holy spirit and fire.|$|R
5000|$|A slide is a shoe that is backless and open-toed, {{essentially}} an open-toed mule. Generally, all slides are <b>sandals.</b> <b>Thongs</b> and flip flops are normally classified separately. [...] Slides can be high-heeled, flat-heeled or somewhere in between, and may cover {{nearly the entire}} foot from ankle to toe, or may have {{only one or two}} narrow straps. They usually include a single strap or a sequence of straps across the toes and {{the lower half of the}} foot to hold the shoe on the foot. The term is descriptive in that this shoe is easy to 'slide' on and off the foot when the wearer wants to do so. Slides are currently trending because of the desire for a more comfortable shoe that still allows you to participate in the activities and sports that you have done before.|$|R
