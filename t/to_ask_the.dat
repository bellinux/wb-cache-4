5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score {{to match the}} key of the Schubert Mass, {{in order for the}} music to {{continue}} seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat, and he had <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> players to tune flat to match his intended key.|$|E

5|$|Fans of Ultra {{were open}} about liking it {{and sent a}} {{significant}} amount of correspondence to Image and the Luna Brothers. The series was intended as a finite story, but its success prompted Image <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> creators to continue the story. Instead, they chose to move on to a different project, Girls, which began in May 2005.|$|E
5|$|The U.S public's {{perception}} of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated President John F. Kennedy <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Congress on May 25, 1961, to commit {{the federal government to}} a program to land a man on the Moon {{by the end of the}} 1960s, which effectively launched the Apollo program.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Hermie {{helps the}} bride move boxes into her attic and she thanks him by {{giving him a}} kiss on the forehead. Later, in {{preparation}} for a marshmallow roast on the beach with Aggie and Miriam, Hermie goes to the local drugstore. In a painfully humorous sequence, he builds up the nerve <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> druggist (Lou Frizzell) for condoms.|$|E

5|$|Then Eärendil the Mariner, a half-elf {{from the}} House of Finwë, sailed to Valinor <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Valar for help. Then the Ban of the Noldor was lifted, and the Valar started the War of Wrath, in which Morgoth was finally overcome.|$|E
5|$|This outcry led to {{condemnation}} of the plans and heritage listing of the property by the National Trust, and forced the Commonwealth Bank <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Federal Government to take the property off its hands.|$|E
5|$|A second labor action {{took place}} in July 1935, as {{construction}} on the dam wound down. When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike. Emboldened by Crowe's reversal of the lunch decree, workers raised their demands to include a $1-per-day raise. The company agreed <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Federal government to supplement the pay, but no money was forthcoming from Washington. The strike ended.|$|E

5|$|At around 22:10 Madeleine's father sent Matthew Oldfield <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> resort's {{reception}} desk {{to call the}} police, and at 22:30 the resort activated its missing-child search protocol. Sixty staff and guests searched until 04:30, at first assuming that Madeleine had wandered off. One of them told Channel 4's Dispatches that, {{from one end of}} Luz to the other, you could hear people calling her name.|$|E
5|$|By April 2010 {{almost five}} {{years had passed since}} the {{previous}} general election (held on 5 May 2005), requiring a fresh election to take place. On 6 April 2010 Brown went to Buckingham Palace <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Queen to dissolve Parliament on 12 April in preparation for a general election. In a live press conference at Downing Street, Brown announced the election would be held on 6 May. The time between the announcement of the election and the dissolution of Parliament, known as wash-up, was to allow for the handling of any unfinished legislative business before the Parliamentary session's conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Cosima was 24 {{years younger}} than Wagner and was herself illegitimate, the {{daughter}} of the Countess Marie d'Agoult, who had left her husband for Franz Liszt. Liszt initially disapproved of his daughter's involvement with Wagner, though nevertheless the two men were friends. The indiscreet affair scandalised Munich, and Wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the King. In December 1865, Ludwig was finally forced <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> composer to leave Munich. He apparently also {{toyed with the idea of}} abdicating to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner quickly dissuaded him.|$|E

5000|$|Members of the {{audience}} were allowed <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions. <b>The</b> eight questions, in order, were: ...|$|R
5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 365/8, with Evans on 47 not out. Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures, with 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make the surface more likely to spin.|$|E
5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Johnson ended with 1/85 from 21 overs and was the most uneconomical of the Australian bowlers, conceding runs {{at a rate of}} 4.04 per over while the others averaged 3.26. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket, make it more likely to spin and therefore more difficult for Australia to bat on.|$|E
5|$|England {{declared}} at 8/365 {{after two}} overs {{on the last}} day. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make it more likely to spin. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device would only make batting more difficult.|$|E
60|$|Here {{the train}} stopped again, and Hoffman came <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> if <b>the</b> ladies desired anything.|$|R
60|$|In {{acknowledging}} her route Margery brought herself <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> who <b>the</b> new gentleman might be.|$|R
60|$|The {{landlord}} {{was understood}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> whether <b>the</b> signor no longer wished for the carriage.|$|R
5|$|Hunt drew {{criticism}} for {{his style of}} returning the football; upon receiving the ball, he would run straight at opposition players rather than attempting to evade them. As a result, he received several high tackles, causing the Broncos <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> NRL to protect Hunt by punishing opposition players more severely. The referees' board supported this position, and stated that fullbacks such as Hunt needed to be protected due to greater risk of injury.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a {{possibility}} that he or she may be able <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} innings, Loxton took 0/29 from ten overs, and England batted on {{for five minutes}} on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> groundsman to use a heavy roller. This would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make the surface more likely to spin, therefore making life more difficult for Australia’s batsmen.|$|E
