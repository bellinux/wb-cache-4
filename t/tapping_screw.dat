The PSSDB is a light weight composite panel comprised of a profiled steel sheet PSS and cement board as dry board connected together by either mechanical fasteners or by epoxy adhesive resin. Ten push-out specimens with different size, shape, thickness of dry board, and types of connections were carried out. The ultimate load, the load slip relationship, and modes of failure were observed. The results showed that the samples connected by epoxy adhesive resin can sustain load greater than that connected by mechanical fasteners up to 76 %, and the ultimate load affected by the thickness of dry board. The capacity of connecter (self drilling-self <b>tapping</b> <b>screw</b> with 4. 2 mm diameter) is about 1. 736 kN/screw. This value increased by about 20 % with the increase in dryboard thickness to double (from 8 mm to 16 mm).

This research studies the effect of dry -board thickness on the overall-floor panel stifThess. -Two -different thicknesses of Primaflex dry board; 6 mm and 9 mm, were used whilst the Peva 45 profiled steel sheeting thickness was maintained at 0. 8 mm. Bending tests were performed to identify the thickness that contributed to the higher stiffness of the floor panel. From the result, the maximum load for 6 mm and 9 mm boards are 24. 51 kN/m 2 and 27. 2 kN/m 2 respectively. The stiffness of the panels was also determined from the slope of the load versus the deflection graph. The stiffness value for the 6 mm board is 85 kNm 2 /m. In comparison, the stifffiess value of 9 mm Primaflex dry board is 89 kNm 2 /m. It can be concluded that the thicker the dry board, the stiffer the floor panel will be.

It has been established from clinical observations {{that the use of}} a small air drill for inserting self-tapping screws provides improved coaxial alignment and precision, and that the drill should be stopped before the screw head is completely seated on the plate, presumably {{to reduce the risk of}} over-tightening. The risk of overrun and over-tightening during <b>tapping</b> and <b>screw</b> insertion is increased with the use of power tools. Prevention of over-tightening is dependent upon when the surgeon detects the onset of tightening, both visually and from the feel of the rapid increase in torque. If detection is too late, then over-tightening or stripping can occur. This study is concerned with using a mechatronic screwdriver to control the tapping depth and to prevent the over-tightening of screws. The effects of various parameters upon the torque profile during <b>tapping</b> and <b>screw</b> insertion have been investigated in synthetic bone and sheep tibia. An automated system is proposed for preventing over-tightening of pre-tapped and self-tapping screws when attaching a surgical plate to a sheep tibia in vitro.

Objective: To conclude whether the self-tapping insertion technique is indeed the optimum one for self-tapping screws, {{with respect to the}} pullout strength. Summary of Background Data: It is reported in the literature that the size of the pilot-hole significantly influences the pullout {{strength of}} a self-tapping screw. In addition it is accepted that an optimum value of the diameter of the pilot-hole exists. For non self-tapping screw insertion it is reported that undertapping of the pilot-hole can increase its pullout strength. Finally it is known that in some cases orthopedic surgeons open the threaded holes, using another screw instead of a tap. Methods: A typical commercial self-tapping pedicle screw was inserted into blocks of Solid Rigid Polyurethane Foam (simulating osteoporotic cancellous bone), following different insertion techniques. The pullout force was measured according to the ASTM-F 543 - 02 standard. The screw was inserted into previously prepared holes of different sizes, either threaded or cylindrical, to conclude whether an optimum size of the pilot-hole exists and whether tapping can increase the pullout strength. The case where the tapping is performed using another screw was also studied. Results: For <b>screw</b> insertion with <b>tapping,</b> decreasing the outer radius of the threaded hole from 1. 00 to 0. 87 of the screw's outer radius increased the pullout force 9 %. For insertion without tapping, decreasing the pilot-hole's diameter from 0. 87 to 0. 47 of the screw's outer diameter increased its pullout force 75 %. Finally, <b>tapping</b> using another <b>screw</b> instead of a tap, gave results similar to those of conventional tapping. Conclusion: Undertapping of a pilot-hole either using a <b>tap</b> or another <b>screw</b> can increase the pullout strength of self-tapping pedicle screws. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R
