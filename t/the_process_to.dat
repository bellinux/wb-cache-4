5|$|While the {{incidence}} of use dropped, towards the latter end of the Middle Ages the incendiary devices became more sophisticated, and the principle of wielding fire with sword remained present throughout the Early Modern and Modern periods; improving technology merely allowed <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> become more efficient.|$|E
5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored, {{self-shielding}} or gasless wire-fed welding {{had been}} developed for simplicity and portability. This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an inert shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for solid wire. The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than inert, so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (inert gas shield). This limits <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> steel and not aluminium.|$|E

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{had been}} used to separate isotopes before. Francis William Aston had used it to partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig Hertz had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it through a series of stages. In the United States, William D. Harkins had used it to separate chlorine. Kistiakowsky was familiar with the work of Charles G. Maier at the Bureau of Mines, who had used <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> separate gases.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the Bureau of Public Roads began <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> {{start the}} {{construction}} {{design for the}} parkway. Federal and state officials commissioned the firm J.E. Greiner to create designs for the parkway, which included a large Y-junction at the southern terminus to connect with New York Avenue and the proposed Anacostia Freeway. Meanwhile, the northern end included a similar wye, with one end running to US 40 (Franklin Street) and the other end crossing the Inner Harbor, but this was modified in 1945 to the current configuration.|$|E
5|$|In {{a perfect}} scenario, this would enable every block {{to be written}} to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> evenly {{distribute}} writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces {{the life of the}} flash memory. The key is to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.|$|E

5|$|The Giants {{received}} the second-half kickoff and mounted a drive {{during which they}} converted on five third-down plays {{over the course of}} more than nine minutes (a Super Bowl record) and scored on a one-yard touchdown run by Ottis Anderson, giving the Giants a 17–12 lead. The signature play of the drive came on a third-down play, when Giants receiver Mark Ingram appeared about to be tackled well short of a first down. However, Ingram evaded several tacklers, dragging one defender in <b>the</b> <b>process,</b> <b>to</b> gain just enough yards for a first down. The Giants' strategy to handle the Bills' potent offense had become clear: keep them off the field. The Giants' two touchdown drives consumed over 17 minutes.|$|E

5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth in}} Commercial Air Transport (CAT) has eroded the {{operational}} freedom of GA, {{both in the}} air and on the ground at larger airports. Difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by a {{decline in the number of}} aerodromes generally, and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system is designed to focus on local issues, and consideration of the national impact of GA operations is not within its remit. This makes aerodrome development difficult, often subjecting those that successfully negotiate <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> restrictions in use.|$|E

5|$|Though sound-on-film would {{eventually}} become the universal standard for synchronized sound cinema, Lauste never successfully exploited his innovations, {{which came to}} an effective dead end. In 1914, Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt was granted German patent 309,536 for his sound-on-film work; that same year, he apparently demonstrated a film made with <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> an audience of scientists in Berlin. Hungarian engineer Denes Mihaly submitted his sound-on-film Projectofon concept to the Royal Hungarian Patent Court in 1918; the patent award was published four years later.

5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210–230°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not go fast enough for <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>to</b> be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.|$|E
