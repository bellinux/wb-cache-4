5|$|Octopuses {{and other}} coleoid {{cephalopods}} {{are capable of}} greater RNA editing (which involves changes to the nucleic acid sequence of the primary transcript of RNA molecules) than any other organisms. Editing is concentrated in the nervous system and affects proteins involved in neural excitability and neuronal morphology. More than 60% of RNA transcripts for coleoid brains are recoded by editing, compared to less than 1% for a human or fruit fly. Coleoids rely mostly on ADAR enzymes for RNA editing, which requires large double-stranded RNA structures to flank to the editing sites. Both the structures and editing sites are conserved in the coleoid genome and the mutation rates for the sites are severely hampered. Hence, greater <b>transcriptome</b> plasticity has come {{as the cost of}} slower genome evolution. High levels of RNA editing {{do not appear to be}} present in more basal cephalopods or other molluscs.|$|E

Studies of the anther sporophytic cells, especially the tapetum, have recently expanded {{from the use of}} microscopy to molecular biology and <b>transcriptomes.</b> The available sequencing technologies, plus the use of laser microdissection and in silico subtraction, have produced high-quality anther sporophyte <b>transcriptomes</b> of rice, Arabidopsis and maize.

25|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{and accuracy of}} an RNA-Seq experiment are dependent {{on the number of}} reads obtained from each sample. A large number of reads are needed to ensure sufficient coverage of the <b>transcriptome,</b> enabling detection of low abundance transcripts. Experimental design is further complicated by sequencing technologies with a limited output range, the variable efficiency of sequence creation, and variable sequence quality. Added to those considerations is that every species has a different number of genes and therefore requires a tailored sequence yield for an effective <b>transcriptome.</b> Early studies determined suitable thresholds empirically, but as the technology matured, suitable coverage is predicted computationally by <b>transcriptome</b> saturation. Somewhat counter-intuitively, {{the most effective way to}} improve detection of differential expression in low expression genes is to add more biological replicates, rather than adding more reads. The current benchmarks recommended by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project are for 70-fold exome coverage for standard RNA-Seq and up to 500-fold exome coverage to detect rare transcripts and isoforms.|$|E

The field adapts the approach to analyzing the presence and quantity of transcripts of proteases, their substrates, and their inhibitors. While developed microarrays remain a major workhorse in studying gene expression in degradomics, its limitations of cross hybridization and dynamic range issues suggest RNA-seq will take a larger role as costs decrease and analysis improves.|$|E

25|$|Studies of {{individual}} transcripts were being performed several decades before any transcriptomics approaches were available. Libraries of silkmoth mRNAs were collected and converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) for storage using reverse transcriptase {{in the late}} 1970s. In the 1980s, low-throughput Sanger sequencing began {{to be used to}} sequence random individual transcripts from these libraries, called Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The Sanger method of sequencing was predominant until the advent of high-throughput methods such as sequencing by synthesis (Solexa/Illumina). ESTs came to prominence during the 1990s as an efficient method to determine the gene content of an organism without sequencing the entire genome. Quantification {{of individual}} transcripts by Northern blotting, nylon membrane arrays, and later Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were also popular, but these methods are laborious and can only capture a tiny subsection of a <b>transcriptome.</b> Consequently, the manner in which a <b>transcriptome</b> as a whole is expressed and regulated remained unknown until higher-throughput techniques were developed.|$|E
25|$|RNA-Seq {{refers to}} the {{combination}} of a high-throughput sequencing methodology with computational methods to capture and quantify transcripts present in an RNA extract. The nucleotide sequences generated are typically around 100 bp in length, but can range from 30 bp to over 10,000 bp, depending on the sequencing method used. RNA-Seq leverages deep sampling of the <b>transcriptome</b> with many short fragments from a <b>transcriptome</b> to allow computational reconstruction of the original RNA transcript by aligning reads to a reference genome or to each other (de novo assembly). The typical dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude for RNA-Seq is a key advantage over microarray transcriptomes. In addition, input RNA amounts are much lower for RNA-Seq (nanogram quantity) compared to microarrays (microgram quantity), which allowed finer examination of cellular structures, down to the single-cell level when combined with linear amplification of cDNA. Theoretically, there is no upper limit of quantification in RNA-Seq, and background signal is very low for 100 bp reads in non-repetitive regions.|$|E
