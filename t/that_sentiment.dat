5|$|The loss to Virginia brought Virginia Tech to an 83 regular-season record, {{something}} Tech coach Frank Beamer {{said was}} better than he expected at the season's start. Despite <b>that</b> <b>sentiment,</b> most fans and supporters pointed {{to the fact that}} in all of Virginia Tech's losses, the deciding points came late in the fourth quarter and {{near the end of the}} game. Only three plays separated Tech from an undefeated 110 record. Tech's bowl destination was unclear immediately after the Virginia loss. The Music City Bowl seemed likely, but the Micron PC Bowl, Insight.com Bowl, and Sun Bowl also were possibilities. Virginia Tech officials preferred the Music City Bowl because of its proximity to Virginia, and bowl officials selected the Hokies on November 30.|$|E
25|$|The War Cabinet met (8 April) to discuss, in Hankey's words, “the {{desirability}} {{of getting rid}} of Haig”, who had recently offered to resign. Hankey recorded <b>that</b> <b>sentiment</b> was “unanimously agst Haig” but Wilson’s opinion was that there was no obvious successor and that he suggested waiting for Haig’s report on the March retreat before making a decision. However, in his own diary Wilson later claimed (11 May) he had urged that Haig be sacked, and told Haig so (20 May). Haig and Wilson gradually established a warily respectful relationship, and Lloyd George was soon complaining that one was Scotch and one Irish, but both were whiskies.|$|E

25|$|Lowell, even as {{far back}} as the 1860s, was {{described}} as a city with little civic pride. At the time, Cowley attributed it to a large percentage of the population being foreign born and therefore having no real roots there. Post its industrial collapse, <b>that</b> <b>sentiment</b> intensified, even if the reasons had changed. Many residents of Lowell viewed the city's industrial history poorly - the factories had abandoned their workers, and now sat empty and in disrepair. However, some city residents, such as educator Patrick J Mogan, viewed the city's history as something that should be preserved and capitalized on. In 1974, Lowell Heritage State Park was founded, and in 1978, Lowell National Historical Park was created as an urban national park, through legislation filed by Lowell native, congressman, and later senator Paul Tsongas. The canal system, many mills, and some commercial structures downtown were saved by the creation of the park and the visitors it brought.|$|E

500|$|Much as {{the label}} had argued {{with the band}} over {{the quality of the}} songs before production, RCA {{continued}} to debate the issue with Priestess after the album sessions were finished in the fall of 2008. Despite the confidence the band themselves had in the strength of the album's material, RCA still did not share <b>that</b> <b>sentiment</b> and refused to release the album, as they felt it still lacked a potential single.

500|$|As well as {{the final}} {{confrontation}} between Eddard and Cersei, other scenes were praised by the critics. The introduction of Charles Dance as Lord Tywin Lannister was considered [...] "a beauty" [...] by Todd VanDerWerff from the A.V. Club, who admired how a single scene depicted not only the relationship between Tywin and Jaime, but also all {{the dynamics of the}} Lannister clan. He also praised the work of Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in the scene, commenting that despite having few lines, he transmitted that Jaime is cowed by his father very well. Maureen Ryan agreed with <b>that</b> <b>sentiment,</b> and also lauded Natalia Tena's short appearance. David Sims (a second reviewer for the A.V. Club) highlighted the work of Mark Addy in his final scene, extending the praise to the rest of his work on the series.|$|E
500|$|The club {{selected}} {{its name}} and logo as {{an homage to}} Bret [...] "The Hitman" [...] Hart. The team's distinctive pink, grey and black jerseys were also modelled after Hart's ring attire. The logo proved immensely popular and Hitmen merchandise sold well at many local retailers. However, the name and logo were also subject to heavy criticism from segments {{of the public and}} the business community, who panned both as negative stereotypes of violence within the sport. Among the chief critics of the new logo was the Flames organization. [...] They had received calls from concerned business people over theme and shared <b>that</b> <b>sentiment.</b> Struggling to attract corporate sponsors, the Hitmen chose to scrap the [...] "Jason Voorhees"-style logo in favour of an alternate [...] "starburst" [...] logo just two months after it was unveiled.

[...] Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from The Avengers, saying [...] "It's gotta be a show that works for people who haven't seen the Marvel movies.

It needs to be its own thing. It needs to be adjacent ... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't?

Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, [...] "Let 'em up easy." [...] In keeping with <b>that</b> <b>sentiment,</b> Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep. Thaddeus Stevens, Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade, political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war.

500|$|Despite Smith's claim, some Rhodesians {{felt that}} the flag implied that Rhodesia was still a colony and not an {{independent}} nation. In 1967, the Cabinet of Rhodesia started a contest to design a new flag for the country. The committee {{in charge of the}} contest specifically precluded the Union Jack being part of it, stating: [...] "Whether or not Rhodesia retains a connection with the Crown, the independence of this country must be seen to be a fact. Since the confrontation with Britain the Committee believe <b>that</b> <b>sentiment</b> in the country will be against the continued use of the Union Flag. For these two reasons the Committee recommend that the Union Flag should not be incorporated into the new Rhodesian flag." [...] There were calls for the Southern Rhodesian flag to be retained, led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs the Duke of Montrose, who said it represented Rhodesia's past and was a symbol of their active rebellion against the British government. Despite these calls, the flag of Southern Rhodesia was abandoned and replaced with the new flag of Rhodesia in 1968. During the formal changeover ceremony on the third anniversary of UDI, Smith noticeably expressed sadness when the flag of Southern Rhodesia was lowered to the Last Post.|$|E

According to IGN's Ed Thompson, Lee sings the lines [...] "It's true we're all a little insane/But it's so clear now that I'm unchained", with her [...] "haunting vocals". Some critics found dark lyrics like [...] "I dream in darkness, I sleep to die, erase the silence, erase my life, our burning ashes darken the day, a world of nothingness, blow me away" [...] accompanied with [...] "rumbling guitars" [...] and a string section. A writer for the website Sputnikmusic found similarities between the songs on Fallen and [...] "Sweet Sacrifice". The main theme for the song is getting over from an abusive relationship.
