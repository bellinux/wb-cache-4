500|$|Fellow Jezebel writer Jia Tolentino {{wrote an}} {{analysis}} of Erdely's story and reported on fraternity rush after the Rolling Stone article was discredited. [...] In her article Tolentino stated: [...] "Five years after I'd left the UVA Greek system, I read 'A Rape on Campus' as an outsider account about a true problem, written by someone good at cherry-picking... So {{it took me a}} day or two <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> found many of Erdely's details unrecognizable. No one says 'UVrApe'; no one I know has ever heard the Rugby Road-themed 'traditional fight song' that poetically ('fuck for 50 cents'/'panties on the fence') separated the article's sections... Jackie was lying, and railroaded into the spotlight on a story that now appears to be a PTSD-laced delusional flashback." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{civilian}} life, Murphy was at {{odds with}} what he perceived as an innate film industry culture of phoniness, once likening his own acting career to prostitution. He was uncomfortable being an iconic war hero, and felt used because of that image. However, he often spoke of his kinship with the military, [...] "I have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love the damned Army. It was father, mother, brother to me for years. It made me somebody, gave me self-respect." [...] Although he was officially retired from the military {{when he died in}} a private plane crash on 28 May 1971 at Brush Mountain, near Catawba, Virginia, his ties to the military and to his home state were evident in the aftermath.|$|E

5000|$|You know, {{it was a}} shock. I haven't {{been proud}} <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> {{everyone}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did scream. I didn't expect to be shocked by an earthquake. I actually got so used to them <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't mind them ... but this one came from nowhere.|$|R
500|$|Later that year, Górecki {{learned of}} an {{inscription}} scrawled {{on the wall}} of a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane, which lies {{at the foot of the}} Tatra mountains in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna, a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read O Mamo, nie placz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. [...] Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, [...] "I have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words". He later explained, [...] "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lakshmi's {{modeling}} {{career began}} at age twenty-one while studying abroad in Madrid, Spain, {{when she was}} discovered by an agent while sitting in a café. As she has stated, [...] "I was the first Indian model to have a career in Paris, Milan, and New York. I'm the first one <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a novelty." [...] Lakshmi was able to pay off her college loans by working as a model and actress.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on William F. Buckley's Firing Line program, Ervin suggested that people in public life need to have more [...] "backbone", and Buckley playfully suggested Gordon Liddy as a model to which Ervin responded, [...] "Well, Gordon Liddy has {{a little too much}} backbone. I'll have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have a sort of sneaking admiration for a fellow like Gordon Liddy that does have an excess of backbone. His backbone exceeds his intelligence, really." ...|$|E
60|$|And smooth! Polished glass {{could not}} be more so. Finally <b>I</b> had <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> at last <b>I</b> had {{discovered}} a Barsoomian fortification which I could not negotiate.|$|R
60|$|I {{was angry}} with myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{permitted}} <b>that</b> matter to affect me as it had. I {{did not wish}} <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was angry with this uncultured little savage, that it made the slightest difference to me what she did or what she did not do, or <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could so lower myself as to feel personal enmity towards a common sailor. And yet, to be honest, I was doing both.|$|R
6000|$|Since <b>that</b> time <b>I</b> have {{no doubt}} taken upon myself to say [...] that that {{engagement}} was over; and <b>I</b> am free <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> [...] <b>I</b> did so without any assent or agreement on your part to [...] that effect. Such conduct no doubt requires a valid and [...] strong defence. My defence is as follows:-- ...|$|R
2500|$|However, he {{expressed}} concern that some items {{for some of the}} domains of the BMMRS might be [...] "contaminated": [...] "Among its spirituality subscales are meaning, values, and forgiveness subscales [...] items such as... 'Knowing that I am a part of something greater than myself gives meaning to my life'... 'It is easy for me <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am wrong,' ... these positive traits could very well be the outcome or the results of spirituality. However, should they be part of the definition itself?... completely secular persons and atheists may experience these things as frequently or more frequently than so called 'spiritual persons" [...] (p.352). Others have empirically tested this issue for the BMMRSs Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale finding that it is composed of two factors - theism and civility — with many people who eschew religion and spirituality scoring highly on civility.|$|E
2500|$|The {{marriage}} {{was marred by}} difficulties that included financial problems, {{as well as her}} husband's alcoholism and infidelities. Gresham sometimes had drunken outbursts, once smashing his guitar on a chair. Davidman wrote that her husband had telephoned her, one day in spring 1946, telling her that he was having a nervous breakdown, and did not know when he would return home. Afterwards, she suffered from a defeated emotional state. She had an experience that she described as: [...] "for the first time my pride was forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not, after all, 'the master of my fate'... All my defenses – all the walls of arrogance and cocksureness and self-love behind which I had hid from God – went down momentarily – and God came in." [...] When Gresham did return home, the couple began to look to religion for answers. Davidman at first studied Judaism, but decided to study all religions and concluded that [...] "the Redeemer who had made himself known, whose personality I would have recognized among ten thousand—He was Jesus." [...] Through their religious studies, the couple, in particular, began to read and be influenced by the books of C.S. Lewis.|$|E
2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E
6000|$|Smith-Oldwick looked rather crestfallen. [...] "But it is a weapon," [...] he said. [...] "You {{will have}} <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that,</b> and {{certainly}} <b>I</b> could {{kill a man}} with it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> her <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was waiting}} to see Mr Fyne come out. <b>That</b> was all. <b>I</b> {{had nothing to say}} to him.|$|R
60|$|I thanked her, and {{presently}} {{found myself}} before a large stove, {{on which it}} was evident, from the odors, that supper was preparing. In a certain way the heat was grateful, but {{in less than a}} minute I was bound <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt as if I were enveloped in a vast warm poultice. The little man and his wife--if wife she were, for she looked big enough to be his mother, and young enough to be his daughter--stood talking in the hall, and I could hear every word they said.|$|R

6000|$|... "Drank {{more than}} usual?" [...] Andrew {{suggested}} grimly when she hesitated. [...] "I noticed that.

6000|$|... "You are too acute by far," [...] said he; [...] "your {{imagination}} {{runs with}} you. I have said I like you, and I {{can teach you}} classics as well as another. Is it not enough <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> the money <b>I</b> get for your instruction keeps me in champagne?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps a greater," [...] {{returned}} Tom. [...] "I have no wish {{to enter}} into comparisons, but I'm quite prepared <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am as bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly!" [...] he {{answered}} smoothly. [...] "I am free <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a puzzle to myself. I find myself, in fact, a most interesting study." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not {{prepared}} <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have given any," [...] replied Romaine; [...] "certainly none {{that did not}} fall {{in the sphere of}} my responsibilities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I not admitting {{everything}} you tell me? But the more I admit," [...] I explained, [...] "the more I must understand. It's <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> you see, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> inquire. If Briss {{came down with}} Lady John yesterday to oblige Mr. Long----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the pride}} of youth, {{you feel that you}} have {{thoroughly}} categorized me, particularly since <b>I</b> am willing <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that,</b> though <b>I</b> shall have abundance of the clinking iron men to buy my share of our chow, I chance just for the leaden-footed second to lack the wherewithal to pay my railroad fare back to Blewett; and the bumpers and side-door Pullman of the argonauts like me not. Too damn dusty. But your analysis is unsynthetic, though you will scarce grasp my paradoxical metaphor." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> am frank <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> {{for myself}} <b>I</b> {{was much more}} {{concerned}} with our own immediate future than with any problematic loss which the world might be about to suffer.

6000|$|She {{nodded her}} head reflectively. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I was right. I think you ought <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a good judge of human nature--at least, in some people and under certain circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Assuredly! You will do me {{the justice}} <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have never pretended to like your country, have I? I hope {{to leave it}} for several years, if not for ever, within {{the course of a}} few weeks." ...|$|E
5000|$|Entertainment Weekly's Tanner Stransky notes, [...] "I have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> {{realized}} Ugly Betty {{was going}} to put its weird, rambling subplot of Ignacio's visa woes front and center, I immediately thought, Oh, hell no. For {{the second half of the}} season, I'd been fighting yawns when this snoozefest story line worked its way into an episode. Buuuut, I'm kind of into it now that the subplot got a little bit more play. It was a breath of fresh, wholesome air in an otherwise really bitchy, shallow (but totally delicious!) season of television." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Schuyler, who {{was talking}} to Breckenridge, turned and smiled, and Hetty said, [...] "Then, {{that makes it a}} little easier for me <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> the folks <b>I</b> belong to go just a little too far occasionally. Larry, I hate to think of the little {{children}} going hungry. Are there many of them?" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that,</b> and <b>I</b> {{do it with}} a {{great amount}} of pleasure, that this first contact with the great Greek {{sculpture}} as I experienced it in Olympia, {{for many years to come}} was of decisive importance for me. I got a sense <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to start on a new course in constructing my sculptures. To reassess my whole platform. I believe this meant a catharsis, a way of making the necessary starting points clear. Eric Grate, quoted at the age of 78, speaking about his study visit to Greece in his youth ...|$|R
