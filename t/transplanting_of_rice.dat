We grew four rice cultivars: Huanghuazhan, LvdaoQ 7, Yangliangyou 6, and Yliangyou 1. We measured grain yield, yield components, water consumption, water productivity, and greenhouse gas emissions. Our {{results show that the}} grain yield <b>of</b> wet direct-seeded <b>rice</b> was 10. 8  % higher than that <b>of</b> <b>transplanted</b> <b>rice,</b> when averaged across cultivars and both years.

But before implementing any approach, different issues relating to RWCS must be discovered, considered and addressed in a holistic manner. In this review, {{an attempt was made}} to highlight different issues resulted from the practise of intensive rice–wheat cropping sequence of the region, which must be considered while framing and implementing any integrated approach/project such as conservation agriculture for improving the productions, profits and sustainability of RWCS in the region...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} row arrangement, time of tiller {{separation}} {{and number of}} tillers kept hill - 1 was studied on the yield <b>of</b> <b>transplant</b> aman <b>rice</b> (cv. BR 23). The highest number of total tillers hill - 1, effective tillers hill - 1 and harvest index were found in single row. The highest harvest index was found in single row. The highest grain yield was obtained in double row arrangement. Plant height and panicle length were higher when the tillers were separated at 25 DAT but number of total tillers hill - 1 was maximum when the tillers were separated at 35 DAT. The highest number of effective tillers hill - 1, number of grains panicle - 1 and grain yield were obtained when 2 tillers were kept hill - 1. The highest number of effective tillers hill - 1 was obtained when tillers were separated at 35 DAT and 4 tillers kept hill - 1 which was similar to tiller separation at 25 DAT keeping 2 tillers hill - 1. Growing transplant aman rice in double row arrangements appears as the promising practice. Cultivar BR 23 <b>of</b> <b>transplant</b> aman <b>rice</b> appears to be resistant to tiller separation leaving behind only 2 tillers hill - 1. Tillers can be separated at 25 or 35 DAT without hampering the grain yield...|$|R
40|$|This paper synthesizes recent {{research}} by two projects {{to develop new}} technology for the High Barind Tract in Bangladesh. Farmers in this complex drought prone ecosystem usually grow a single crop <b>of</b> <b>transplanted</b> aman <b>rice.</b> The research strategy was to expand the area that could be planted to rabi crops using residual soil moisture by introducing new technology that advanced the harvest <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> and improved yields <b>of</b> chickpea. Direct-seeded <b>rice</b> (DSR) with long-duration variety Swarna and introduced varieties of short-duration rice(SDR) gave earlier harvesting without reducing rice yields. Higher-quality seed, seed priming, and improved crop management also improved the profitability of chickpea. Because the farming system is complex, SDR and DSR should {{not be seen as}} prescriptive recommendations but as choices that allow timely rice establishment with variable monsoon rainfall. Dissemination of these technologies requires local partnerships to build a reliable supply chain to deliver knowledge and inputs to farmers...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was {{conducted}} was to increase productivity of exiting cropping systems and farmers income by expanding potato in non-traditional potato growing regions by adopting an innovative technology Double <b>Transplanting</b> (DT) <b>of</b> <b>Rice</b> and planting early maturing potato between two rice crops. This cropping pattern will enhance productivity of system without sacrificing area or productivity of {{either of the two}} crops. Similar work has been done earlier (Robin et al. 2007 and Burdhan Roy et al. 2007). The field trials were carried out at three locations Siliguri Subdivision of Darjeeling district to and Rajgunj block of Jalpaiguri district to introduce potato as sand witch crop between two rice crops. Eighty five farmers planted 18. 6 acres land under rice-potato-rice system in 2013 - 14. Cost-benefit of different cropping systems was analyzed. Results revealed that “Potato-DT Rice” produced higher income/ha compared to traditional potato-boro rice and kharif (monsoon) rice-boro rice. The DT rice-potato system generated 27 % higher income over traditional potato-boro rice and 290 % over mono boro rice system. The gender responsive meetings, trainings and demonstrations were conducted. The farming community was motivated to adopt this new profitable cropping system in the region. Peer Revie...|$|R
