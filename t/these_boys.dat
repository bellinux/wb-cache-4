5|$|Little {{is known}} of {{the early years of}} the legacy. This bequest was {{administered}} by the Corporation of London in around 1460 and a small college was founded next to Guildhall Chapel, also using the library facilities in the chapel. Despite the fact that this continued for over 70 years, the earliest certain evidence of the existence of Carpenter's Children can only be traced back to 1536, and thus it isn't clear who <b>these</b> <b>boys</b> were, what they were taught and where they lived. In 1547, under the Chantries Act the Guildhall Chapel and Library were forfeited. The funding for the four boys was also discontinued. The Corporation of London remained in control of Carpenter's estate and accounts from the next 300 years show that the money continued to be spent on children's benefits such as providing new coats to every child or providing them with access to education.|$|E
25|$|I said {{to one of}} <b>these</b> <b>boys</b> on one occasion, when he came {{in through}} rather a heavy fire: 'You will get hit one of these days riding about like that when shells are flying'. And he replied 'I pedal so quick, Sir, they'd never catch me'.|$|E
25|$|At {{this same}} time, {{there was a}} {{movement}} to expand the constituent membership of the Boys' Parliament beyond the select churches providing members at the time. For example, by the late 1960s, there had been Lutheran, Jewish, and Catholic members of the OBP. <b>These</b> <b>boys</b> qualified {{for membership in the}} OBP by associating themselves with youth groups connected to the sponsoring organizations of the OBP.|$|E

25|$|The {{first group}} of {{students}} to complete the full five years of secondary education at the new high school sat for the Leaving Certificate in 1961. Most of <b>these</b> <b>boys</b> {{were part of the}} initial enrolment of 1st Year pupils at the Felton Rd. site, in 1957. James Ruse AHS was originally a boys only school, but gradually became co-educational after an initial intake of 24 female students into Year 11 in 1977.|$|E
25|$|Gymnastics {{for males}} is {{tailored}} only towards {{those that are}} muscular and defined, rather than the boys that are thin and lean, due to the equipment that is used. <b>These</b> <b>boys</b> could compete with the women, but {{are not permitted to}} participate with the other sex, and males have different events that require a greater amount of strength to women. The men that do compete in gymnastics at a competitive level are defined as 'men' because of their build.|$|E

Almost all can be classified as bishōnen, exhibiting the same physically feminine features combined with a sometimes deliberately ambivalent sexuality or at the very least, a lack of any hint of a relationship to maintain their popular availability.|$|E

25|$|A {{project by}} Richard Chua, after Lover's Words, about heterosexuals in a {{homosexual}} society. It was {{an extension of}} Chua's belief that life should be led honestly and truthfully. In his quest to further meditate on love between people (in this case, among three boys in their 20s), Chua embarked on this project to push his collaborators {{to work in a}} space where they had nowhere to go, but to clean. Cleaning was an essential task that would bring <b>these</b> <b>boys</b> to the next phase of eternity.|$|E
25|$|A form {{of forced}} {{conversion}} became institutionalized during the Ottoman Empire {{in the practice}} of devşirme, a human levy in which Christian boys were seized and collected from their families (usually in the Balkans), enslaved, converted to Islam, and then trained as elite military unit within the Ottoman army or for high-ranking service to the sultan. From the mid to late 14th, through early 18th centuries, the devşirme–janissary system enslaved an estimated 500,000 to one million non–Muslim adolescent males. <b>These</b> <b>boys</b> would attain a great education and high social standing after their training and conversion.|$|E

A small room above the temple is exclusively used as a school room to teach local boys of the villages and some of <b>these</b> <b>boys</b> are chosen as Lamas. The top floor is also the official residence of the incarnate lama of the monastery. A large pillar engraved with the Buddha's teachings is also located here. The monastery complex has a number of white washed huts, which house the Lamas.|$|E

500|$|Like many {{of their}} 1970s contemporaries {{including}} Led Zeppelin and Alice Cooper, the members of Aerosmith were prone to excess and debauchery. Drug consumption was rampant; the recording sessions for 1976's Rocks and 1977's Draw the Line were especially noted for their substance indulgence, including heroin. In the words of Bebe Buell, [...] "They [...] were like a gang of kids with their own planes, Porsches, millions of dollars, limitless resources. [...] Mick Jagger and Jimmy Page had control, but <b>these</b> <b>boys</b> did not care. They won the prize, hands down, for the rowdiest rock 'n' roll band in that era. No question." ...|$|E

[...] To avoid any {{appearance}} of bias, the Saginaw native noted: [...] "You may think I am a friend of <b>these</b> <b>boys</b> but I do not know either of them.

500|$|Initially, the {{response}} to the new comic book was muted due to its low status as a [...] "toy book."

The Village Voices Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "I love this record—love it—even though I know <b>these</b> <b>boys</b> flirt with images of {{brutality}} (Nazi especially)... For me, it blows everything else off the radio". In Rolling Stone, Paul Nelson described it as [...] "constructed almost entirely of rhythm tracks of an exhilarating intensity rock & roll has not experienced since its earliest days." [...] Characterizing the band as [...] "authentic American primitives whose work has to be heard to be understood", he declared, [...] "It is time popular music followed the other arts in honoring its primitives."

500|$|... "Moments" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, {{many of whom}} praised its musical arrangement and memorability. Alex Hughes from The Huffington Post characterised the song as [...] "heartbreaking". Hollywood Life and AllMusic both rated [...] "Moments" [...] {{as one of the}} best songs on Up All Night. Herald Sun writer Cameron Adams referred to the track as a [...] "classic boy band ballad". Entertainment Weeklys Adam Markovitz cited the lyrics [...] "be your life, your voice, your reason to be", writing that [...] "Lyrics like that won't help the group earn much respect in music circles. But if a tween-pop empire is what <b>these</b> <b>boys</b> are after, they're definitely headed in the right direction". Erica Futterman for Rolling Stone opined that the track's lyricism is [...] "quintessentially swoonworthy" [...] toward an audience aged approximately 8 to 12 and female.|$|E

The song {{has been described as}} emotional in nature, containing a glitchy beat sampled from Mr Hudson, with heavily synthesised vocals. [...] "There Will Be Tears" [...] has a thundering bass flat over a hyperactive 808 beat. Ocean sings about not having a father; [...] "Hide my face, hide my face, can't let 'em see me crying / Cause <b>these</b> <b>boys</b> didn't have no fathers neither / And they weren't crying", where he [...] "lets his guard down completely." ...|$|E
