The article discusses security issues with web-based exams, and proposes precautionary measures to reduce the risks. A security model is presented that distinguishes supervision support, software restrictions, and network restrictions. Solutions to security problems are tools to supervise and monitor webbased exams, measures for exam computers with Windows and Linux, and secure network setups in common network architectures.

40|$|Overnutrition is a {{major cause}} of diabetes. The {{contrary}} situation of undernutrition has also been suggested to increase the risk of the disease.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} likely <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the {{frequency}} and severity of climate variability, rendering smallholder farmers increasingly vulnerable. This necessitates adaptation actions to mitigate potential losses. Based on farm household survey data collected from three Chinese mountain villages, the study examines farmers' adaptation measures in response to drought and factors driving motivations to adapt. The results show that climate risk perceptions and households' assessment of their own abilities to adapt are important determinants of proactive adaptation decisions, with the latter found a better predictor than the former. The influences of village context and farm income are also significant. By drawing attention to the vital roles of human cognition to stimulate adaptation responses, the study emphasizes the need for greater efforts <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>risk</b> awareness and, more importantly, to equip households {{with a feeling of}} perceived capacity to adapt. This can be done by providing additional information on risk-reducing measures and how to implement them as well as to make them affordable.

30|$|Soft {{measures}} against railway trespass included {{new approaches to}} education, innovative collaboration between institutions and agencies, soft approaches to physical barriers, and training railway staff to dissuade certain groups of trespassers. First, the results pointed towards the need <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>risk</b> awareness in less conventional locations situated close to the tracks, to educate urban planners and community representatives, and to combine education campaigns with punitive measures. Second, {{there was a need}} for a better joint work within communities, between IMs and RUs on one hand, and urban planners, local authorities, municipalities, etc. on the other, and the main recommendation was that railway companies should seek collaboration partners. Third, it was suggested {{that one of the most}} popular physical measures (i.e. fencing) may in fact be used as a symbolic barrier, indicating the boundary of an area with restricted admission, or that smearing the bars of fences with heavy grease could potentially reinforce the deterrent effect on behaviour. Last but not least, it was shown that in some countries like Spain or Turkey there was a need to train the railway staff to detect and warn trespassers, and to communicate with third parties in difficult situations.|$|R

This research explores recently diagnosed HIV-positive {{pregnant women}}'s reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure of serostatus to various members of their social networks, {{as well as the}} consequences of their disclosure. Data were collected through open-ended questions as part of a semi-structured interview with 293 recently diagnosed HIV-positive pregnant women recruited from antenatal clinics in two townships in Tshwane, South Africa. A content analysis of responses showed that women weighed fear of abandonment and discrimination against their desire <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>risk</b> awareness and their need for support. Partners most often responded to disclosure with disbelief and shock, whereas parents frequently exhibited emotional distress, but were still supportive, as were other relatives and friends. The women subsequently experienced low levels of adverse consequences after disclosure. The results can assist healthcare providers in understanding the complexity of pregnant women's decisions to disclose to various members of their social networks and emphasize the need for continued counselling and support...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) {{is a common}} {{disorder}} that currently serves as a major global public health issue due <b>to</b> <b>raised</b> <b>risk</b> of cardiovascular disease (CVD), kidney failure, and other complications. With the ever-growing increase of ageing populations and rising global frequency of diabetes and other chronic non-transmissible diseases, present clinical data suggests a corresponding worldwide increase in prevalence of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). The overall aims of this thesis was to study the prevalence of known traditional and novel CKD related risk factors in a non-clinical population, examine the applicability of several predictive equations in the estimation of GFR for the stratification of CKD, Investigate the relationships between key risk factors amongst different subgroups of the total study population, and Provide evidence in {{the need for further}} healthcare screening strategies to help identify early onset CKD. This project carried out quantitative and qualitative assays to investigate the Incidence of chronic kidney disease risk factors in a non-clinical, mixed-age university population and establish the risk of development of CVD, CKD and type 2 diabetes.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{evidence}} from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Russian space program showing that humans exposed to the microgravity environment of space have a greater risk for developing renal stones. Increased bone resorption and the attendant hypercalciuria and hyperphosphaturia contribute significantly <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> the urinary state of saturation with respect to the calcium salts, namely calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. In addition, other environmental and dietary factors may adversely affect urine composition and increase stone formation risk during space flight. For example, reductions in urinary volume, pH, and citrate contribute <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> stone formation <b>risk.</b> In addition <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> the <b>risk</b> for calcium stone formation, this metabolic profile is conducive to the formation of uric acid stones. Although observations to date have suggested that there may actually be a reduced food intake during the early phase of flight, crew members on longer-duration flights may increase food intake and be at increased risk for stone formation. Taken together, these findings support the use of nutritional recommendations for crew members that would serve to reduce the stone-forming propensity of the urinary environment. Pharmacologic intervention should be directed at raising urinary volumes, diminishing bone losses, and preventing reductions in urinary pH and citrate. Success in reducing the risk for stone formation in astronauts would also be of potential major benefit to the estimated 20 million Americans with nephrolithiasis...|$|R
40|$|Objective - The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate weight-related risk perception in early pregnancy and to compare this perception between women commencing pregnancy healthy weight and overweight. Study design - Pregnant women (n= 664) aged 29 ± 5 (mean±s. d.) years were recruited from a metropolitan teaching hospital in Australia. A self-administered questionnaire was completed at around 16 weeks of gestation. Height measured at baseline and self-reported pre-pregnancy weight were used to calculate body mass index. Cross-sectional analysis was conducted. - Differences between groups were assessed using chi-squared tests for categorical variables and t-tests or Mann–Whitney U tests for continuous variables depending on distribution. Result - Excess gestational weight gain (GWG) during pregnancy was more important in leading to health problems for women or their child compared with pre-pregnancy weight. Personal risk perception for complications was low for all women, although overweight women had slightly higher scores than healthy-weight women (2. 4 ± 1. 0 vs 2. 9 ± 1. 0; P< 0. 001). All women perceived their risk for complications to be below that of an average pregnant woman. Conclusion - Women should be informed of the risk associated with their pre-pregnancy weight (in the case of maternal overweight) and excess GWG.

Among others, children embody our {{best chance to}} implant appropriate behaviors that will be recalled during hazardous situations and to involve adults according to a knowledge chain reaction. In this work, scientists challenge their communication skills to built a set of hands-on and learn-by-play based laboratory activities, for primary and secondary schools, addressing three major issues: (1) the location of earthquakes and volcanoes on Earth; (2) earthquakes and eruptions mechanisms; (3) earthquakes unpredictability. Students are asked to place volcanoes and earthquakes epicenters (issue 1) on a wooden plate puzzle according to Plate dynamics. To addresses eruption mechanisms (issue 2) and related hazard, we use backing soda forced blowing out from a volcano vent and suggest that a pyroclastic flow is fast, it can spread over a large area and <b>raise</b> high up <b>to</b> the stratosphere. Earthquake mechanisms (issue 2) are discussed describing the energy buildup, release, and transfer, using a wooden sticks bendand- break analogy.

In view of the already <b>raised</b> thrombotic <b>risk</b> profile in gout patients as a group, it is reassuring that hyperfibrinogenaemia only seems to be present during acute attacks of gout, presumably as an acute phase response.

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess whether the rise in breast cancer awareness influenced the presentation pattern of breast cancer in Malta. Method: The patients’ records operated for breast cancer in the year 2000 and 2010 were reviewed after sourcing the list from the Pathology Department at Mater Dei Hospital. For each case demographics, laterality, surgical procedure, histology of tumour, largest histological tumour dimension, differentiation and nodal status were collected. Results: 456 patients were studied; 171 for the year 2000 and 285 for the year 2010. Median age was 64 years (range 23 - 91 years) in 2000 and 59 years (range 29 - 96 years) in 2010. Lumpectomy or wide local excision were carried out in 41. 0 % of patients in 2000 and 64. 7 % in 2010. Mastectomy was done in 49. 7 % of patients in 2000 and 27. 1 % in 2010. Invasive ductal carcinoma of the unspecified type was the most common histological tumour in both years (68. 8 % in 2000, 74. 7 % in 2010). Peak incidence for the histological tumour dimension shifted from pT 2 in 2000 to pT 1 c in 2010. Mean tumour size of the invasive type decreased from 28. 2 mm in the year 2000, to 22. 9 mm in the year 2010 (p value = 0. 007). Histological regional lymph node metastases decreased from 52. 2 % in 2000 to 45. 0 % in 2010. Conclusion: Our study shows a trend of decrease in tumour size, less axillary node metastases and an increase in breast conservation surgery.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of social}} network sites (SNSs) entails several privacy risks. Therefore, a multitude of educational interventions have been developed <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>risk</b> awareness amongst teenagers and to change unsafe behavior. However, most of these interventions are developed from a formal educational perspective. We hypothesized that traditional courses to teach about risks on SNSs are less effective to increase awareness and to change unsafe behavior, as they are further away from real life SNSs, which are mostly used as entertainment during leisure time. Moreover, an important added value of teacher involvement during educational game play in class was hypothesized. A quasi-experimental study {{was set up in}} 11 secondary classes, involving 80 pupils divided over 4 conditions. In these conditions, 4 different interventions were compared, in which pupils: (1) played a serious game on a tablet computer without teacher involvement, (2) played a serious game on a tablet computer while the teacher summarized the learned content every five minutes, (3) received a traditional course on privacy risks and (4) received a course on a different topic (control condition). In a pretest-posttest survey, we measured risk awareness, pupils’ attitudes towards risky behavior, and their behavior. Moreover, qualitative data from open questions in the survey established whether pupils were aware of the topic of the game and the course, and what they had actually learned. The results revealed that all interventions caused an increase in awareness compared to the control conditions. Moreover, a better attitude towards safe behavior was found, but this increase was equal over conditions. No impact could be found on pupils’ behavior. Finally, qualitative results showed that pupils in the condition with teacher involvement were more aware of the topic of the game than those who played the game without teacher involvement.

Results A case-control study of 1090 individuals including 567 asthmatic patients was realized on five SNPs within the VDR gene. Only rs 7975232 (ApaI) marker showed a significant association with asthma (P = 0. 009). Haplotype analysis of the five VDR polymorphisms showed a significant association with asthma (global-p value = 0. 012). Conclusion Although the susceptibility of VDR gene variants with asthma could not be confirmed for all SNPs tested in this study, the significant association obtained for rs 7975232 provides evidence for a previously unknown report about the Chinese Han population and may raise the susceptibility of VDR to be a candidate gene for asthma. </p...|$|R
