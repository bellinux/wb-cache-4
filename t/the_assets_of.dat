40|$|This {{rigorous}} thesis {{deals with}} the activities of notaries in relation to <b>the</b> common <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> spouses. <b>The</b> theme was chosen because of the profession of the author, {{who works as a}} permanent representative of the notary. The purpose of this thesis is not a detailed interpretation of all legal provisions in <b>the</b> common <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> spouses, or to answer any questions that this legal institute initiates. Its aim is to preview <b>the</b> common <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> spouses from <b>the</b> perspective of a notary, who acts in the position of the impartial and independent person, equipped with professional knowledge. The rigorous thesis is divided into six chapters. The first chapter describes the legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> spouses. <b>The</b> second explains the basic concepts related to the notary and notary activities, and it also {{deals with the}} notarial records of agreements modifying <b>the</b> common <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> spouses. <b>The</b> third chapter deals with probate proceedings in connection with <b>the</b> common <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> spouses. <b>The</b> fourth focuses on the acquisition of real estate property by spouses. In the fifth chapter I describe some of the European legislation of the marital property law. The sixth chapter deals with the amendment of the Civil Code in relation to <b>the</b> common <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> spouses...|$|R

The project was then transferred to a court-appointed receiver and later stripped of its EB-5 eligibility. In May 2016, the presiding judge approved a plan by two firms to buy out Dargey's share {{of the project and}} restart construction, pending approval from EB-5 investors; in October, the two companies signed an agreement to restart construction and re-brand the project.|$|E
5|$|In August 1934, Hitler {{appointed}} Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in {{the following}} year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war. Reconstruction and rearmament were financed through Mefo bills, printing money, and seizing <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> people arrested as enemies of the State, including Jews. Unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936. Hitler oversaw {{one of the largest}} infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works. Wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 percent. The average work week increased during the shift to a war economy; by 1939, the average German was working between 47 and 50 hours a week.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, the Enabling Act, an {{amendment}} to the Weimar Constitution, passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94. This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws—even laws that violated the constitution—without the consent of the president or the Reichstag. As the bill required a two-thirds majority to pass, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several Social Democratic deputies from attending, as the Communists had already been banned. On 10 May, the government seized <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> the Social Democrats and they were banned in June. The remaining political parties were dissolved and on 14 July 1933 Germany became a de facto one-party state when the founding of new parties was made illegal. Further elections in November 1933, 1936 and 1938 were entirely Nazi-controlled and saw only the Nazis and a small number of independents elected. The regional state parliaments and the Reichsrat (federal upper house) were abolished in January 1934.|$|E

The new brigade was assigned to the III Corps as a corps asset. 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, was transferred to the new brigade on 21 February 1975. The brigade served as a test bed for new concepts involving the employment of attack helicopters on the modern battlefield. In 1985-85, the brigade consisted of 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry; 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment (4-9 CAV); and 5th and 7th Squadrons, 17th Cavalry Regiment (5-17 CAV and 7-17 CAV), all flying attack helicopters.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the crisis, three Icelandic banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, multiplied in size. This expansion {{was driven by}} ready access to credit in international financial markets, in particular short-term financing. As the international financial crisis unfolded in 2007–2008, investors perceived the Icelandic banks to be increasingly risky. Trust in the banks gradually faded, leading to a sharp depreciation of the Icelandic króna in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their short-term debt. At {{the end of the}} second quarter of 2008, Iceland's external debt was 9.553 trillion Icelandic krónur (€50 billion), more than 7 times the GDP of Iceland in 2007. <b>The</b> <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> the three banks totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at {{the end of the second}} quarter 2008, equal to more than 11 times the national GDP. Due to the huge size of the Icelandic financial system in comparison with the Icelandic economy, the Central Bank of Iceland found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during the crisis, further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system.|$|E

In 1989, Nauru took legal action against Australia in the International Court of Justice over Australia's administration of the island, in particular Australia's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining.

5|$|Proposals to {{establish}} a joint British airline, combining <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA) were first raised in 1953 {{as a result of}} difficulties in attempts by BOAC and BEA to negotiate air rights through the British colony of Cyprus. Increasingly BOAC was protesting that BEA was using its subsidiary Cyprus Airways to circumvent an agreement that BEA would not fly routes further east than Cyprus, particularly to the increasingly important oil regions in the Middle East. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of merger as a potential solution to this disagreement and had backing for the idea from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Rab Butler. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the proposal.|$|E
