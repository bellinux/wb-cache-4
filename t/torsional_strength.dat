Biomechanical properties such as tensile, bending and torsion strengths must be determined. In field experiments, the trees were selected from an orchard in Rafsanjan, Kerman Province, Iran.

30|$|It is {{believed}} {{that this type of}} the continuum mechanics was originally introduced by Voigt since 1887 and the brothers Cosserat since 1909. There is a simplified variant of the theory of micropolar bodies, the so-called couple-stress theory, and in this theory the rotation vector is not independent of the displacement vector, but related to it {{in the same way as}} in classical continuum mechanics. The motivation for the extension of the classical to micropolar and couple-stress theory was that the classical theory was not able to predict the size effect experimentally observed in problems which had a geometric length scale comparable to the material’s microstructural length, such as the grain size in a polycrystalline or granular aggregate. For example, the apparent strength of some materials with stress concentrators such as holes and notches is higher for smaller grain size; for a given volume fraction of dispersed hard particles, the strengthening of metals is greater for smaller particles; the bending and <b>torsional</b> <b>strengths</b> are higher for very thin beams and wires.|$|R

50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} examples of concrete slabs were built by Roman engineers. Because concrete is quite strong in resisting compressive loads, but has relatively poor tensile or <b>torsional</b> <b>strength,</b> these early structures consisted of arches, vaults and domes.

To mould this structure, temporary scaffolding and formwork or falsework {{was built in the}} future shape of the structure. These building techniques were not isolated to pouring concrete, but were and are widely used in masonry. Because of the complexity and the limited production capacity of the building material, concrete’s rise as a favored building material did not occur until the invention of Portland cement (and developments by the Edison Portland Cement Company) and reinforced concrete.|$|E

50|$|The {{compact size}} of the rocket motors enabled Norris to design a vehicle with a very low {{cross-sectional}} area. A dart-like configuration was chosen, with two closely paired front wheels behind the nose-mounted cockpit and two rear wheels 8 ft apart, faired into stabilising fins. The design {{was expected to be}} inherently stable in a straight line. The main structure of the car was both elegant and simple, yet it would ensure significant <b>torsional</b> <b>strength</b> and also allow separate storage of the two liquids used as the propellant. The main chassis would be a flat box-like structure with internal rib strengthening, not unlike the chassis of Bluebird CN7. This would provide the frame to which were attached the rocket engines, one above and one below, as well as the propellant tanks - hydrogen peroxide on top, kerosene underneath. The frame would also house the torsion bar rear suspension. Clad in a slim pencil-shaped body with rear outrigger fins, the vehicle would feature a recumbent driving position. The wheels were to be machined from solid aluminium billets. As they were not required for propulsion, but merely to support the car, there would be no need for tyres.|$|E
50|$|Design of the FS-23 {{was started}} in 1953 and took {{thirteen}} years, including a hiatus while the Akaflieg Stuttgart FS-24 Phönix was developed. The goal of the FS-23 designers was a lightweight high-performance glider to meet the proposed 13m mini-standard class for competition gliders. To achieve this goal the students at Akaflieg Stuttgart thoroughly tested fibreglass re-inforced composites, as well as birch ply and balsa/fibreglass sandwiches, for E- and G-modulus, compressive and <b>torsional</b> <b>strength</b> as well as bonding and rivetting methods. Once the testing was complete the aircraft could be designed to ensure adequate strength with light weight, (1/3 to 2/3 the weight of typical gliders of the time), and good aerodynamic qualities, the result being the FS-23 Hidalgo.Built primarily of balsa core sandwiched in fibreglass, the FS-23 was a high-wing, high aspect ratio, cantilever monoplane with moderate dihedral and -6o sweep, (to reduce the tail moment required and thus the size and weight of the rear fuselage and tail unit), and a V-tail. A fixed undercarriage and a brake parachute were used.Flight trials began on 1 February 1966 demonstrating that the FS-23 had sensitive controls, side-slipped well and gave adequate warning of a stall. It recovered easily from a spin, within half a turn. In 1967 the FS-23 suffered severe tail flutter and the pilot {{was thrown out of}} the cockpit, descending by parachute, as the aircraft dived towards the ground from 1500 meters altitude. The aircraft landed with minimal damage and was repaired to continue the test programme until July 1971 when the FS-23 crashed a second time, with the pilot, Heinz Jahn, losing his life.|$|E

40|$|Two {{techniques}} for assembling an aluminium drill pipe to a steel tool joint were investigated: 'hot' assembling and 'cold' assembling. During hot assembling {{a difference of}} temperature between the two parts is exploited to impose contact interferences and then to obtain a friction bond that generates <b>torsional</b> <b>strength.</b> Hot assembling is ordinarily used. The cold assembling technique is introduced here as an alternative. During cold assembling connection make up, the contact interferences are obtained by imposing an external torque.
