In the days after the crash, news reports emerged that up to 800 people had died.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Urban Search and Rescue teams, including Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue assisted the search for remains, working through the National Interagency Incident Management System (NIIMS).

Debris from the Pentagon was taken to the Pentagon's north parking lot for more detailed search for remains and evidence.|$|E
