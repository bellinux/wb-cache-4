The notch is slipped over the lock cylinder, then forced down by striking with the flat side of the axe or maul.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} for energy saving {{are presented in}} this paper for turning and milling TiAl 6 V 4 workpieces. The major outcome of the cutting trials with the internally cooled <b>turning</b> <b>tool</b> is that the tool wear under dry cutting conditions is in between dry and wet machining, whereas the combination of the internally cooled <b>turning</b> <b>tool</b> with wet machining leads to strongly increased tool lifetimes. In contrast to this, the energy demand under dry cutting conditions is much lower than under wet cutting conditions. With respect to the environmental protection, the best tool cooling is dry cutting combined with the internally cooled tool. To achieve higher productivity rates or increased tool lifetimes, the combination of wet machining and the internally cooled <b>turning</b> <b>tool</b> is the best solution. In comparison to conventional milling, the average effective power consumption of the machine tool under trochoidal cutting conditions is increased by 6 %. Nevertheless, the amount of used energy is decreased by 15 % and the process time is reduced by 35 %. The reasons for this are higher material removal rates, {{due to the fact that}} the cutting time per edge and revolution can be reduced to a minimum. The heat-up phase and the cutting temperatures are small. By increasing the cutting parameters, e. g. cutting speed or feed, it is possible to improve the material removal rate. This enables a higher energy productivity and lower process time. The milling tool was used for both milling strategies. For trochoidal milling the tool has sufficient potential to increase the cutting parameters. For the conventional cutting process, however, the tool works at the load limit...|$|E
