5|$|The {{first step}} {{requires}} <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> {{to practice the}} skill without preparation.

5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> improves from their base-line knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to <b>the</b> <b>participant.</b> Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a survey of email users in different regions of Saudi Arabia about email SPAM. The survey investigated the nature of email SPAM, how email users in the eastern, western, central, southern and northern dealt with it, and the efforts made to combat it. It also investigated the effectiveness of existing Anti-SPAM filters in detecting Arabic and English email SPAM. 1, 500 <b>participants</b> located in <b>the</b> eastern, western, central, southern and northern regions of Saudi Arabia were surveyed and completed surveys were collected from 1, 020 of <b>the</b> <b>participants.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that there were different definitions for email SPAM based on different usersâ€™ opinions in Saudi Arabia. The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in <b>the</b> central and western regions were more aware of SPAM than <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in other regions. The results revealed that the volume of email SPAM was different from region to another and the volume of SPAM received by <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in <b>the</b> northern and central regions was larger than that received in other regions. The results indicated that the majority of email SPAM received by <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in different regions was written in English. The results showed that {{the most common type of}} email SPAM received in Arabic was emails related to forums and in English was phishing and fraud, and business advertisements. The results also showed that a few participants in all regions responded to SPAM and the average of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> who responded to SPAM was larger in the southern region than other regions. The results showed that most of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were not aware of Anti-SPAM programs and <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in <b>the</b> central region were more aware of Anti-SPAM programs than <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in other regions. The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in all regions estimated that the existing Anti-SPAM programs were more effective in detecting English SPAM than Arabic SPAM. The results showed that most of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in all regions were not aware of the government efforts to combat SPAM and <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in <b>the</b> central region were more aware of the government efforts than <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in other regions. The results also showed that most of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in all regions were not aware of the ISPs efforts to combat SPAM and <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in <b>the</b> central and western regions were more aware of the ISPs efforts than <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in other regions...|$|R

5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E

The instructor may utilize more advanced members to help less skilled members. The instructor often tries to elicit information from the participants' experience by asking questions.|$|E

Various entertainment programmes such as lion and dragon dances will be held every evening. Miri International Dance for Humanity is held annually since 2004 by Miri Chapter of Malaysian Red Crescent Society to promote racial and cultural harmony. This event will showcase up to 40 to 50 multicultural dance troupes which attract an audience of around 3,500. No dancing competition will be held during this event. Donation cards will be distributed to raise funds for the Red Crescent Society. 916 Malaysia Day Countdown cum Street Party {{has been held}} annually since 2010.

25|$|The SSRT test is similar, {{except that}} the 'stop' signal is {{presented}} after the 'go' signal. This small modification increases the difficulty of inhibiting the 'go' response, because <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> has typically already initiated the 'go' response {{by the time the}} 'stop' signal is presented. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> is instructed to respond as fast as possible to the 'go' signal while maintaining the highest possible inhibition accuracy (on no-go trials). During the task, the time at which the 'stop' signal is presented (the stop signal delay or SSD) is dynamically adjusted to match the time after the 'go' signal at which <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> is just able/unable to inhibit their 'go' response. If <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> fails to inhibit their 'go' response, the 'stop' signal is moved slightly closer to the original 'go' signal, and if <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> successfully inhibits their 'go' response, the 'stop' signal is moved slightly ahead in time. The SSRT is thus measured as the average 'go' response time minus the average 'stop' signal presentation time (SSD).|$|E

If <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires; priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).|$|E
