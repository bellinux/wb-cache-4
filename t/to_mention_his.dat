5|$|Set {{before the}} events of Thor, Phil Coulson stops {{at a gas station}} on his way to Albuquerque, New Mexico. While Coulson shops for snacks {{in the back of the}} station, two robbers enter and demand the money from the register. When the robbers ask whose car is outside, Coulson reveals himself, {{surrender}}s his keys, and offers to surrender his pistol as well. As he is about to turn over the gun, Coulson distracts the robbers and subdues both men in seconds. He then nonchalantly pays for his snacks while subtly advising the clerk not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> involvement to the police and leaves the station.|$|E
5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it. Working {{in an atmosphere of}} increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Umbricht's death, the Colts decided to honor their {{teammate}} by wearing black armbands {{for the entire}} 1964 season. Umbricht's uniform number (32) was immediately retired by the team; {{it was the first}} time the club retired a uniform number, and only the ninth time in Major League history a number was retired. In the Colts' opening-day match against the Cincinnati Reds, starting pitcher Ken Johnson dedicated his victory in Umbricht's memory. The Astros' MVP award was also named in his honor. The back of Umbricht's 1964 Topps baseball card was updated <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> death shortly before printing. The retirement of Umbricht's number received some criticism, however. Former teammate Jimmy Wynn wrote in his autobiography that Walt Bond, a former Astros player who was African-American, died from leukemia while he was still active. His jersey number was not retired by the club after his death, although he appeared in more games for the Astros than Umbricht. (It should be noted, however, that Bond ended his career not with Houston but as a member of the Minnesota Twins.) Journalists criticizing the retirement of numbers sometimes use Umbricht as an example of someone whose number was retired but who is unfamiliar to baseball fans.|$|E

5|$|Ste {{starts a}} {{relationship}} with Rae. Ste is angered when he sees Brendan has assaulted Trev Costello (Scott Neal), who he thinks is gay, leading him to believe that Brendan's denial of his sexuality is leading him to gay-bash, ending their relationship. Ste later decides to give Brendan a second chance. Brendan reluctantly agrees to a date with Ste and the pair go to a gay bar, but Brendan bails. Rae reveals to Ste that she is pregnant.

Eileen tells Brendan he cannot see his son Declan Brady (Jay Duffy) unless he does not see Ste. Brendan tells Ste they have to pretend until Declan returns to Ireland.Ste and Brendan break it off because of this, Ste leaving to go on vacation with his kids. When he returns he sees Declan and happens <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> sexuality. This causes Brendan to panic and give Ste a black eye. Ste goes to the police but Brendan convinces him to not tell for the sake of Declan.|$|E

According to Jack Roush, the parting was mutual and not because of any falling-out.|$|E
25|$|Hogg {{was careful}} not to divulge {{potentially}} embarrassing information about Shelley's living friends, however. He also failed <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> own passion for Harriet Shelley, Percy Shelley's first wife. Harriet was portrayed very favourably in the book, although Hogg did discuss her preoccupation with suicide. Percy's father Timothy Shelley was portrayed very negatively, and the book characterized Percy Shelley as often disdainful towards his parents.|$|E

Shalmaneser IV (783-73 BC) seems to have wielded little authority, and a victory over Argishti I, king of Urartu at Til Barsip, is {{accredited}} to a general ('Turtanu') named Shamshi-ilu who does not even bother <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> king. Shamshi-ilu also scored victories over the Arameans and Neo-Hittites, and again, takes personal credit at the expense of his king.|$|E

25|$|We are now {{left with}} two sons from Antonio's first {{marriage}} {{who worked in}} the family shop: Omobono and Franceso. As Omobono had left the dwelling aged eighteen in search of new employment possibilities in Naples, he left Antonio to pay for much of his living expenses. In this sense, his father had never really forgiven him for leaving home. Just as Paolo, he would inherit six violins. That was all that was written on the will for him. As For Francesco, who was named his father's successor, he would inherit the rest of his father's belongings, the rest of the estate. This included all of the wood tools, stencils, finished violins, patterns, not <b>to</b> <b>mention,</b> <b>his</b> father's reputation.|$|E
25|$|Sullivan {{writes that}} Devlin sets up Alicia as sexual bait, refuses {{to take any}} {{responsibility}} for his role, then feels devastated when she does a superb job. Alicia finds herself coldly manipulated by the man she loves, sees her notorious behavior exploited for political purposes, then fears abandonment by the lover who {{put her in the}} excruciating predicament of spying on her late father's Nazi colleague by sleeping with him—a man who genuinely loves her, perhaps more than Devlin does. Alex is Hitchcock's most painfully sympathetic villain, driven by his profound jealousy and rage—not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> enthrallment to an emasculating mother—culminating in an abrupt, absolute imperative to kill the love of his life.|$|E
25|$|The fourth Under-19 World Cup held in New Zealand only {{confirmed}} Australia's {{dominance of}} the game, and from their opening match, when they obliterated Kenya by 430 runs, through to their comprehensive victory over South Africa in the final, they were never threatened. Participating nations included the ten Test-playing nations, plus Canada, Kenya, Namibia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, and Scotland. Their captain, Cameron White, was singled out for praise for his leadership, and he chipped in with 423 runs at 70.50. And they didn't rely on pace either, playing only two seamers and four slow bowlers, with Xavier Doherty, a slow left-armer, leading the wicket-takers with 16 at 9.50 and all without a single wide. In contrast, India, the holders, underperformed in their semi-final against South Africa, a team they had easily beaten {{a week or so}} earlier. They also suffered embarrassing defeats to neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh. Pakistan, however, provided the main upset when they lost to Nepal by 30 runs, and Nepal also gave England a few uneasy moments. Zimbabwe won the plate competition, with their expected opponents, Bangladesh, beaten in the semi-final by Nepal. Australian Cameron White was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 423 runs at an average of 70.50 and Xavier Doherty was the leading wicket-taker, with 16 wickets at 9.50. Tatenda Taibu, Zimbabwe's captain, was Man of the Series for his 250 runs and 12 wickets, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> wicket-keeping in between bowling stints.|$|E

On 9 April 1656 he passed through Dover, and the register of visitors indicates: [...] Perhaps tactfully, the record glosses Wright's employment in Flanders, (euphemistically referred to as [...] "other parts") as England and the Habsburgs were now at open war, and it fails <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>his</b> membership of the Accademia di San Luca, which would have identified him as a Roman Catholic.|$|E
