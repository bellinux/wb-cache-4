40|$|Due to {{trends in}} aero-design, {{aeroelasticity}} becomes increasingly important in modern <b>turbomachines.</b> Design requirements of <b>turbomachines</b> {{lead to the}} development of high aspect ratio blades and blade integral disc designs (blisks), which are especially prone to complex modes of vibration. Therefore, experimental investigations yielding high quality data are required for improving the understanding of aeroelastic effects in <b>turbomachines.</b> One possibility to achieve high quality data is to excite and measure blade vibrations in <b>turbomachines.</b> The major requirement for blade excitation and blade vibration measurements is to minimize interference with the aeroelastic effects to be investigated. Thus in this paper, a non-contact-and thus low interference-experimental set-up for exciting and measuring blade vibrations is proposed and shown to work. A novel acoustic system excites rotor blade vibrations, which are measured with an optical tip-timing system. By performing measurements in an axial compressor, the potential of the acoustic excitation method for investigating aeroelastic effects is explored. The basic principle of this method is described and proven through the analysis of blade responses at different acoustic excitation frequencies and at different rotational speeds. To verify the accuracy of the tip-timing system, amplitudes measured by tip-timing are compared with strain gage measurements. They are found to agree well. Two approaches to vary the nodal diameter (ND) of the excited vibration mode by controlling the acoustic excitation are presented. By combining the different excitable acoustic modes with a phase-lag control, each ND of the investigated 30 blade rotor can be excited individually. This feature of the present acoustic excitation system is of great benefit to aeroelastic investigations and represents one of the main advantages over other excitation methods proposed in the past. In future studies, the acoustic excitation method will be used to investigate aeroelastic effects in high-speed <b>turbomachines</b> in detail. The results of these investigations are to be used to improve the aeroelastic design of modern <b>turbomachines.</b> Siemens EnergyDFG/SFB/ 87...|$|R

This implies the enlargement of the design space of propulsive systems such that it can even be operated equally as a compressor or turbine, which leads to rethink the paradigm of designing <b>turbomachines.</b> The continuity in the definition and characterization of different types of <b>turbomachines</b> should be restored which is proposed through this contribution. Analytical relationships allowing to switch between compressor map, propeller map and map are developed. To minimize the inputs of the maps’ conversion relations, a methodology to extract mean flow features from any characterization map is presented, namely the rotor outlet relative flow angle and mean streamline radius. The application of the characterization maps’ conversion relations ona turbofan’s single-stage axial fan and on a propeller allowed their validation through the physical coherence of the results. The flow features extraction methodology also showed very satisfying results with comparison to experiments.

40|$|AbstractThe steady {{calculation}} {{based on}} the mixing-plane method {{is still the most}} widely-used three-dimensional flow analysis tool for multistage <b>turbomachines.</b> For modern <b>turbomachines,</b> the trend of design is to reach higher aerodynamic loading but with still further compact size. In such a case, the traditional mixing-plane method has to be revised to give a more physically meaningful prediction. In this paper, a novel mixing-plane method was proposed, and three representative test cases including a transonic compressor, a highly-loaded centrifugal compressor and a high-pressure axial turbine were performed for validation purpose. This novel mixing-plane method can satisfy the flux conservation perfectly. Reverse flow across the mixing-plane interface can be resolved naturally, thus making this method numerically robust. Artificial reflection at the mixing-plane interface is almost eliminated, and then its detrimental impact on the flow field is minimized. Generally, this mixing-plane method is suitable to simulate steady flows in highly-loaded multistage <b>turbomachines...</b>|$|R
