5|$|Due to {{the civil}} war, Mongalla had {{suffered}} considerable physical neglect and damage, and population loss. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla {{as one of the}} Nile ports {{to be the first to}} be rehabilitated. He warned <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> for reconstruction spending would be much greater than available funding, so work had to be prioritized.|$|E
5|$|Ginko {{receives}} a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> her {{to write about}} Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi {{who is trying to}} capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told them about the Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried to write about it, she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E
5|$|Luke's face {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This is reinforced by the fact that Luke is shown drawing in silverpoint on white paper; an extremely difficult medium <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> high concentration, and is normally used only for preparation. The artist is boldly emphasising his ability and skill with preparatory sketches; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden, now in the Louvre, contains a female head very similar to Mary's in the Boston panel.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{of these}} {{sentences}} contains two arguments (in bold), the first noun (phrase) being the subject argument, {{and the second}} the object argument. Jill, for example, is the subject argument of the predicate likes, and Jack is its object argument. Verbal predicates <b>that</b> <b>demand</b> just a subject argument (e.g. sleep, work, relax) are intransitive, verbal predicates <b>that</b> <b>demand</b> an object argument as well (e.g. like, fry, help) are transitive, and verbal predicates <b>that</b> <b>demand</b> two object arguments are ditransitive (e.g. give, lend) [...]|$|R

25|$|Supporters of Bersih claim <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> for {{electoral reform}} {{made during the}} 2007 {{demonstration}} fell on deaf ears. UMNO Youth and Perkasa planned counter-rallies, dismissing Bersih's demands for electoral reform, but Perkasa called off its counter-rally due to its inability to secure a venue and permit.|$|E

25|$|Muhammad Subuh saw {{the present}} age as one <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> {{personal}} evidence and proof of religious or spiritual realities, as {{people no longer}} just believe in words. He claimed that Subud {{is not a new}} teaching or religion but only that the latihan kejiwaan itself is the kind of proof that humanity is looking for. There are now Subud groups in about 83 countries, with a worldwide membership of about 10,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{statement}} quoted above compares samples {{collected in}} 2001 adjacent to Red Dog industrial activity to samples collected for the Nordic moss monitoring program: samples which are deliberately collected {{as far from}} urban and industrial areas as possible. The Nordic moss monitoring program follows a protocol <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> that samples be collected at least 300 meters from a road and that samples be collected in non-urban areas. Significantly, samples for the study at Red Dog included the loose dust on the moss, while the Nordic moss monitoring program moss samples were shaken to remove dust.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{scholarship}} generally describes Ammianus as a pagan who was {{tolerant of}} Christianity. Marcellinus writes of Christianity {{as being a}} pure and simple religion <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> only what is just and mild, and when he condemns the actions of Christians, he does not do so {{on the basis of}} their Christianity as such. His lifetime was marked by lengthy outbreaks of sectarian and dogmatic strife within the new state-backed faith, often with violent consequences (especially the Arian controversy) and these conflicts sometimes appeared unworthy to him, though it was territory where he could not risk going very far in criticism, due to the growing and volatile political connections between the church and imperial power.|$|E

5000|$|On May 31, 2011, Goldenvoice {{announced}} that {{beginning with the}} 2012 festival, Coachella would be expanded to a second, separately-ticketed weekend, with identical lineups for each. Explaining the decision, Tollett said <b>that</b> <b>demand</b> for tickets was up in 2011 even after [...] "operations weren't the best they've ever had" [...] in 2010 {{and that he did}} not want to satisfy <b>that</b> <b>demand</b> by allowing additional attendees to overcrowd the venue. Rolling Stone called it a [...] "very risky move" [...] and said there was [...] "no guarantee <b>that</b> <b>demand</b> be high enough to sell out the same bill over two consecutive weekends". Nonetheless, 2012 tickets sold out in less than three hours.|$|R

25|$|Smith {{considers}} {{his treatment}} of Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy XII among his best translations. He looks to Vagrant Story as a title <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> to be in English and thought of his work as revealing the inner English game that always existed underneath. Smith was able to speak directly with Matsuno to improve the script translation, marking the first of their many collaborations. For Final Fantasy XII, his role entailed rebuilding the world to make sense for an English-speaking audience. He chose to portray the Archadian Imperials with a British accent to distinguish them from the American-accented Resistance members. For both of these titles, Smith relied on Matsuno's dense notes on the world's backstory to capture subtle and implied connections and preserve the rich texture of the game.|$|E
500|$|Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard {{magazine}} {{reviewed the}} song favorably, {{calling it a}} [...] "great little tune about the underdog fulfilling his dreams, and the story is wrapped in a melody <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> attention." [...] She goes on to call Keith's performance [...] "feisty" [...] {{and say that the}} production [...] "just percolates." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{their path}} to the fountain, they face three challenges. The first {{involves}} a giant worm <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> [...] "proof of [...] pain". The second, a steep slope {{where they have to}} bring the [...] "fruit of their labours". The third challenge, crossing a river, requires them to pay with [...] "the treasure of [...] past". Amata passes the challenge by using magic to withdraw the memories of her ex-lover and drop them into the water.|$|E

500|$|F.E.A.R.s horror {{theme was}} praised by critics. Game Informer claimed that [...] "...the {{frequent}} spooky head trips that Monolith has so skillfully woven together make an experience <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> to be played." [...] IGN opined that [...] "... {{the environment has}} been so well-crafted to keep you edgy and watchful ... playing the game {{for a few hours}} straight can get a little draining." [...] GameSpot reacted similarly, calling F.E.A.R.s horror [...] "... exceedingly effective", and agreeing that it [...] "... can leave you a bit emotionally exhausted after a while." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Alive" [...] {{was written}} when Dan Nelson was {{member of the}} band. Anthrax premiered the song live in 2008, though it was titled [...] "Vampires" [...] at that time. It is notable for its tribal-sounding {{introduction}} with clean guitars backed up by a marching drum beat, before taking off into a heavy riff and gradually breaking into a melodic chorus. In an album preview by Blabbermouth.net, [...] "I'm Alive" [...] was described as [...] "beautiful and grand with a build <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> audience participation". The song {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in the category Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance, the band's fourth Grammy nomination.|$|E
500|$|However, {{some critics}} found it inconsistent. Music {{journalist}} Peter Shapiro criticized its [...] "loose playing and bohemian self-indulgence", stating [...] "Voodoo drifted {{all over the}} map in a blunted haze". Rolling Stones James Hunter disapproved of the experimental and loose-sounding structure, and viewed that it does not attain its potential, stating [...] "long stretches of it are unfocused and unabsorbing [...] Voodoo flatters the real {{at the expense of the}} thing. The result is superb smoke, but smoke nonetheless". Jon Caramanica wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), [...] "D'Angelo achieves through nuance what some singers with decades of experience and training never achieve: a throbbing, vital presence, <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> attention, even as it shuns it".|$|E

500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Spencer Owen of Pitchfork {{called the}} album [...] "harmless and pretty... nothing else". Barry Walters, writing in The Village Voice, similarly writes that [...] "there's little on Parachutes <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> attention or punctures the pensive spell, and, unlike Travis's, Coldplay's hooks are slight." [...] In his Consumer Guide column for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau selected [...] "Yellow" [...] and [...] "Don't Panic" [...] as [...] "choice cuts", indicating good songs on [...] "an album that isn't worth your time or money." [...] Setareh Yousefi of Stylus Magazine felt that [...] "the finer moments of Parachutes are blended with some boring sappy songs", with Martin's [...] "powerful voice" [...] ultimately being [...] "in many ways wasted on songs that are alright but not bewildering." ...|$|E
500|$|Race, gender issues, {{and racial}} {{identity}} often feature in Lee's works. The main characters, up through The Art of Woo, are Asian {{women that are}} [...] "caught up in some cross cultural encounter". She writes that she attempts {{to address these issues}} through her films in non-didactic ways, such that the [...] "racial melancholia... are like seepages in the more obvious dramatic or comedic content". She contrasts her films with the 1993 drama The Joy Luck Club, which she considers a film with obvious, easily consumable, ethnic content. She considers the stereotype of Asian women as seductresses, either demure [...] "lotus blossoms" [...] or vociferous [...] "dragon ladies", to be a degenerative one which is [...] "sometimes extremely offensive", but one that has [...] "a cultural memory <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> [...] attention." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to {{functioning as a}} spiritual conversion narrative, The Autobiography of Malcolm X also reflects generic elements from other distinctly American literary forms, from the Puritan conversion narrative of Jonathan Edwards and the secular self-analyses of Benjamin Franklin, to the African American slave narratives. This aesthetic decision {{on the part of}} Malcolm X and Haley also has profound implications for the thematic content of the work, as the progressive movement between forms that is evidenced in the text reflects the personal progression of its subject. Considering this, the editors of the Norton Anthology of African American Literature assert that, [...] "Malcolm's Autobiography takes pains to interrogate the very models through which his persona achieves gradual self-understanding...his story's inner logic defines his life as a quest for an authentic mode of being, a quest <b>that</b> <b>demands</b> a constant openness to new ideas requiring fresh kinds of expression." ...|$|E
