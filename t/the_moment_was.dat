50|$|One of the {{statistical}} approaches for unsupervised learning <b>is</b> <b>the</b> method of <b>moments.</b> In <b>the</b> method of <b>moments,</b> <b>the</b> unknown parameters (of interest) in the model <b>are</b> related to <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> {{of one or more}} random variables, and thus, these unknown parameters can <b>be</b> estimated given <b>the</b> <b>moments.</b> <b>The</b> <b>moments</b> <b>are</b> usually estimated from samples empirically. <b>The</b> basic <b>moments</b> <b>are</b> first and second order moments.

50|$|In mathematics, a <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> a {{specific}} quantitative measure, {{used in both}} mechanics and statistics, of {{the shape of a}} set of points.

If the points represent probability density, then <b>the</b> zeroth <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> total probability (i.e. one), <b>the</b> first <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> mean, <b>the</b> second central <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> variance, <b>the</b> third central <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> skewness, and <b>the</b> fourth central <b>moment</b> (with normalization and shift) is the kurtosis.

500|$|Furthermore, {{the battle}} was one {{instance}} in which Moller's and Seydlitz's awareness of Frederick's operational objectives led to battlefield success.

Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me."). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or shouldn't be lived. An example is the poem typed on the [...] "Aye Davanita" [...] page. The song's subtitle is [...] "The song without words", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of [...] "intruder words" [...] is on the [...] "Not for You" [...] lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the Sisyphus myth ("Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock").

The dirt smudges on the football player's helmets and uniforms were intentionally designed to look like smudges on construction paper. This was done to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with construction paper in [...] "The Spirit of Christmas" [...] and the pilot episode, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". The characters Butters Stotch and Clyde Donovan are featured during the football game, although neither had been identified by name yet in the series. During a football crowd scene, a white character can be seen that looks identical to Token Black, an African-American character introduced later in the series. The background character is wearing the same shirt Token wears, which Parker explained was the result of an animator placing a different head on the body {{in order to create a}} filler character for the crowd.
