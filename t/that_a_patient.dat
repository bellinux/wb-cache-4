5|$|Four years later, in 1798, a M.Tessier of Versailles {{hospital}} contacted Percy {{to notify}} him <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy {{that he had}} swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could {{find some way to}} remove it. Percy, however, recognised him as suffering from advanced tuberculosis. A month later, Tarrare began to suffer from continuous exudative diarrhoea, dying shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} can {{be difficult}} to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting. There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction that the patient is suffering from. Photopatch tests are patch tests conducted when it is believed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is experiencing certain symptoms due to an allergy that will only occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, the patient is given a low dosage of UVA radiation.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E

50|$|The Artificial Cardiac Pump {{temporarily}} {{takes over}} the function of breathing and pumping blood for <b>a</b> <b>patient.</b> It has two parts, the pump and the aerator.

25|$|In {{most cases}} however, a hiatal hernia {{does not cause}} any symptoms. The pain and {{discomfort}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> experiences {{is due to the}} reflux of gastric acid, air, or bile. While there are several causes of acid reflux, it occurs more frequently in the presence of hiatal hernia.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the ethical}} issues {{considered}} most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them. Another important principle is informed consent, the idea <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing. Some {{of the most common}} complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct, and involvement in child custody evaluations.|$|E
25|$|Cold cured or cold pour dentures, {{also known}} as {{temporary}} dentures, do not look very natural, are not very durable, tend to be highly porous and are only used as a temporary expedient until a more permanent solution is found. These types of dentures are inferior and tend to cost much less due to their quick production time (usually minutes) and low cost materials. It is not suggested <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> wear a cold cured denture {{for a long period}} of time, for they are prone to cracks and can break rather easily.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of {{the medical}} considerations, Jehovah Witnesses {{advocate}} that physicians should uphold {{the right of a}} patient to choose what treatments they do or do not accept (though a Witness is subject to religious sanctions if they exercise their right to choose a blood transfusion). Accordingly, US courts tend not to hold physicians responsible for adverse health effects <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> incurred out {{of his or her own}} requests. However, the point of view that physicians must, in all circumstances, abide by the religious wishes of the patients is not acknowledged by all jurisdictions, such as was determined in a case involving Jehovah's Witnesses in France.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem with}} using a {{specific}} collagen type II biomarker from {{the breakdown of}} articular cartilage is {{that the amount of}} cartilage is reduced (worn away) over time with progression of the disease so a patient can eventually have very advanced osteoarthritis with none of this biomarker detectable in their urine. Another problem with a systemic biomarker is <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> can have osteoarthritis in multiple joints at different stages of disease at the same time, so the biomarker source cannot be determined. Some other collagen breakdown products in the synovial fluid correlated with each other after acute injuries (a known cause of secondary osteoarthritis) but did not correlate with the severity of the injury.|$|E
25|$|The immunosuppressants {{that are}} needed to prevent organ {{rejection}} also introduce some risks. By lowering the body's ability to mount an immune reaction, these medicines also increase the chances of infection. Antibiotics may be prescribed in order to treat or prevent such infections. In turn, infection may {{increase the risk of}} rejection, and generally an interaction may prevail between both risks. Certain medications may also have nephrotoxic or other potentially harmful side-effects. Other medications may also be prescribed in order to help alleviate these side effects. There is also the risk <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> may have an allergic reaction to the medications. Close follow-up care is required in order to balance the benefits of these drugs versus their potential risks.|$|E

25|$|Finally, motor-skill {{rehabilitation}} {{has been}} proposed as another possible way in which games {{can be used for}} rehabilitation purposes. Stroke patients suffering upper extremity motor difficulties have been the primary focus of this subject and, in this case, a variety of gaming environments have been experimented with. Output has shown that their Fugl-Meyer UE scores and their Functional Independence Measure scale score increase after a period of engaging in virtual rehabilitation, suggesting that their mobility dysfunction decreased and their degree of independence increased due to the intervention. Additionally, output has suggested improved motor skills on a higher level, having several researchers suggesting positive improvements in their stroke patients as a result of virtual rehabilitation methods. At this higher level, researchers have suggested improved ability to walk, or ambulation, and improved use of larger motor skills after intervention. One other class of patients that has been studied less frequently in this category of rehabilitation is cerebral palsy patients. Ability to walk certain distances without the use of an assistive device was the method of measurement for this category. After a period of working with a Wii-based system, it was shown <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> who struggled with walking large distances before, was able to walk a noticeably longer distance. This suggests an improvement in larger motor skills, whereas the stroke patients demonstrated an improvement in finer motor skills, focused strictly on their use of upper extremities during the gaming rehabilitation.|$|E

House overdoses on physostigmine, a medication for Alzheimer's disease, {{and his mind}} flashes back to the bus scene before the accident. [...] "The answer" [...] reminds House that, since he values reason above all else, {{there must be a}} reason for her presence in his mind. She keeps asking House what her necklace is made from, until he realizes that it's made of amber. [...] "The answer" [...] transforms into Amber Volakis, and when Wilson and Cuddy manage to resuscitate House from his overdose-induced cardiac arrest, he immediately informs Wilson that Amber's life is in danger as he now remembers the crash. In the crash, Amber was injured with a bar through her leg and House later saw her being carried away to an ambulance. Wilson has not spoken to Amber since before the accident. Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) checks the patient roster and sees <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> admitted to a different hospital matches Amber's description.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two ways}} to give consent: {{explicit}} consent or implied consent. Explicit consent is when <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> clearly communicates to a healthcare worker, verbally or in writing or in some other way, that relevant confidential information can be shared. Implied consent, means <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> consent to share personal confidential information is assumed.

30|$|Depression is {{associated}} with physical symptoms, and improvements in these symptoms are correlated with improvements to depressive symptoms, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> ability to obtain remission from depression may be {{directly related to the}} reduction in physical symptoms [15].

2500|$|Beyond this distinction, Searle {{thinks there}} are certain {{phenomena}} (including all conscious experiences) that are ontologically subjective, i.e. can only exist as subjective experience. For example, although it might be subjective or objective in the epistemic sense, a doctor's note <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> suffers from back pain is an ontologically objective claim: it counts as a medical diagnosis only because the existence of back pain is [...] "an objective fact of medical science".
