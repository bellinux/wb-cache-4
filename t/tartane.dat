5|$|The British arrival was {{reportedly}} greeted with derision by the French sailors, until a boarding party clambered onto the frigate from Bedfords deck, {{to be met}} by resistance from the French crew. Mann then ordered his ship's Royal Marines to fire into the French sailors, killing several and driving many more over the side into the harbour. This attack broke their resolve and the French surrendered, several leaping into the sea to escape capture, only to be collected by the boats of Captain. As Modeste was subdued, the boats of Speedy approached the tartanes. As the boat parties boarded the small French warships, the crew of one surrendered while the other resisted the British boarders. A short melee broke out {{on the deck of}} the <b>tartane,</b> resulting in the captain and one other French sailor wounded and the <b>tartane</b> firmly in British hands. The raid completed, the British squadron withdrew from Genoa with their prizes. British sources reported that one French sailor had been killed in the operation and ten wounded, while the British boarding parties had survived unscathed, while French sources claimed five killed and 30 wounded or in the most extreme accounts, as many as 50 killed.|$|E

50|$|Génie, {{which the}} British {{described}} as a ketch, was armed with three 18-pounder guns and four swivel guns. She had a crew of 60 men, {{under the command of}} enseigne de vaisseau Pioch. She was one of 28 merchant <b>tartanes</b> that the French Navy acquired between March and June 1794 at Sète and Agde. Génie, however, was apparently purchased, at Agde, and commissioned in June 1796. The French Navy armed the <b>tartanes</b> with large guns to serve as gunboats.|$|R

Aventure was a privateer brig carrying sixteen 4-pounder guns and a crew of 62 men, under the command of Citizen Peltier. She was two days out of Calais on her first cruise and had not captured any prizes. <b>Tartane</b> was also a brig, mounting sixteen 4-pounder guns and carrying 60 men, on a cruise from Dieppe. She had not taken any prizes, and in his report on the capture, Young paid tribute to Captain Cheshire of the 18-gun sloop , who having seen the chase, manoeuvred to cut off Tartanes escape. Young commanded Greyhound until March 1797, when he took command of the 32-gun [...]|$|E

60|$|There {{was just}} then a splash, and two bronzed figures were seen setting forth from the <b>tartane</b> to swim to shore. The Turkish Reis had {{despatched}} them, to ascertain whether the vessel had drifted, and who the inhabitants might be.|$|E
60|$|It was on {{the second}} day after the capture of the <b>tartane</b> that the sun set in a purple angry-looking bank of cloud, and the sea began to heave in a manner which renewed the earlier distresses of the voyage to such as were bad sailors. The sails both of the corsair and of the <b>tartane</b> were taken in, and it was plain that a rough night was to be expected. The {{children}} were lashed into their berths, and all prepared themselves to endure. The last time Arthur saw Madame de Bourke's face, {{by the light of the}} lamp swinging furiously from the cabin roof, as he assisted in putting in the dead lights, it bore the same fixed expression of fortitude and resignation as when she was preparing to be boarded by the pirates.|$|E

5000|$|On 31 March 1813, {{an attack}} was made, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Shaw of Volontaire, by the marines of the frigates Volontaire and , and the brigs Redwing and [...] on a strongpoint at Morgion, near Marseille. The marines landed during the night, and at daybreak {{captured}} two batteries. They threw the guns, five 36-pounders in one, and two 24-pounders in the other, into the sea, and destroyed all their ammunition. The boats of the ships then captured eight <b>tartanes</b> and three settees, laden with oil, nuts, hides and firewood, while Redwing provided close protection. Casualties amounted to only one man killed and four wounded, while the French lost four killed, five wounded, and a lieutenant and 16 men of the 62nd Regiment taken prisoner.|$|R
60|$|It looked {{extremely}} beautiful {{when the}} French <b>tartane</b> entered it, {{rising from the}} sea like a magnificent amphitheatre, {{at the foot of}} the mountains that circled round it, and guarded by stern battlemented castles, while the arches of one of the great old Roman aqueducts made a noble cord to the arc described by the lower part of the town.|$|E
60|$|Arthur {{found himself}} {{virtually}} {{the head of}} the party, and, after consultation with Ibrahim Aga and Maitre Hebert, it was agreed that there would be far more safety, as well as better accommodation, in the British ship than in the French <b>tartane,</b> and Arthur went down to communicate the proposal to Estelle, whom the close, little, evil-smelling cabin was already making much paler than all her privations had done.|$|E
6000|$|A {{good while}} elapsed {{before one of}} these scouts returned. There {{was a great deal}} of talk and gesticulating round him, and Lanty, {{mingling}} with it, brought back word that the place was the Bay of Golo, not far from Djigheli, and just beyond the Algerine frontier. The people were Cabeleyzes, a wild race of savage dogs, which means dogs according the Moors, living in the mountains, and independent of the Dey. A considerable number rushed to the coast, armed, and in great numbers, perceiving the <b>tartane</b> to be an Italian vessel, and expecting a raid by Sicilian robbers on their cattle; but the Moors had informed them that it was no such thing, but a prize taken in the name of the Dey of Algiers, in which an illustrious French Bey's harem was being conveyed to Algiers. From that city the <b>tartane</b> was now about a day's sail, having been driven to the eastward of it during the storm. 'The Turkish commander evidently does not like the neighbourhood,' said Arthur, 'judging by his gestures.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{resulted}} in four men {{being placed on}} guard at the hatchway leading to the cabin, while all the rest, including Arthur, Hebert, Laurence, were driven toward the prow, and made to understand by signs that they must not move on peril of their lives. A Tuck was placed at the helm, and the <b>tartane's</b> head turned towards the pirate captor; and all the others, who were not employed otherwise, began to ransack the vessel and feast on the provisions. Some hams were thrown overboard, with shouts of evident scorn as belonging to the unclean beast, but the wine was eagerly drank, and Maitre Hebert uttered a wail of dismay as he saw five Moors gorging large pieces of his finest pate.|$|R
60|$|The harbour, a finer one {{naturally}} {{than that}} of Algiers, contained numerous <b>tartanes</b> and other vessels, for, as Ibrahim Aga, who could talk French very well, informed Arthur, the inhabitants were good workers in iron, and drove a trade in plough-shares and other implements, besides wax and oil. But it was no resort of Franks, and he insisted that Arthur should only come on shore in a Moorish dress, which had been provided at Algiers. Thanks to young Hope's naturally dark complexion, and the exposure of the last month, he might very well pass for a Moor: and he had learnt to wear the white caftan, wide trousers, broad sash, and scarlet fez, circled with muslin, so naturally {{that he was not}} likely to be noticed as a European.|$|R
25|$|Modeste was a Magicienne-class frigate {{built at}} Toulon between February 1785 and January 1787, having been {{launched}} there on 18 March 1786. In September 1793 {{she entered the}} neutral port of Genoa, where according to British reports, her captain was seized by the French Republican agent in the port, who suspected the frigate as having come from the Royalist-held Toulon on some secret mission. The British had been dissatisfied with {{the actions of the}} neutral Genoa, in allowing the Modeste and two French <b>tartanes</b> to 'insult' and 'molest' the frigate Aigle while she was also in Genoa. Furthermore the French were alleged to have seized a ship travelling under an assurance of safe passage from Lord Hood. The British envoy in Genoa, Francis Drake, was instructed to seek reparations from the Genoese, and {{to put a stop to}} the shipment of grain to the French Republicans.|$|R
60|$|He must, he said, {{remove all}} the Genoese, but he would send on board the <b>tartane</b> only seven men on whom he could {{perfectly}} depend for respectful behaviour, so that the captives {{would be able to}} take the air on deck as freely as before. There was no doubt that he was in earnest, and the lady accepted his offer with thanks, all the stronger since she and all around her were panting and sick for want of fresh air.|$|E
60|$|The <b>tartane</b> was a {{beautiful}} object, a one-decked, single-masted vessel, with a long bowsprit, and a huge lateen sail like a wing, and the children {{fell in love with}} her at first sight. Estelle was quite sure that she was just such a ship as Mentor borrowed for Telemachus; but the poor maids were horribly frightened, and Babette might be heard declaring she had never engaged herself to be at the mercy of the waves, like a bit of lemon peel in a glass of eau sucree.|$|E
60|$|They were not, however, {{out of the}} bay {{when the}} wind {{suddenly}} veered, and before the great lateen sail could be reefed, it had almost caused the vessel to be blown over. There was a pitching and tossing almost as violent as in the storm, and then wind and current began carrying the <b>tartane</b> towards the rocky shore. The Reis called the men to the oars, but their numbers were too few to be availing, and in a very few minutes more the vessel was driven hopelessly towards a mass of rocks.|$|E
50|$|Alexandre Brun painted many marines (oils on wood, on canvas, watercolors), {{representing}} life at sea, {{scenes of}} life (The {{departure of the}} sailor, 1885, After a sinking, 1888), fishing or bathing (Of sea, 1883), views of ports or ships (mainly three-masted and <b>tartanes).</b> He also produced illustrations of important events (The capture of Sfax, 1882, President Carnot embarking aboard the Formidable 1890), watercolors of historic ships (Le Soleil Royal, Royal Louis) and lithographs of warships: The Marengo, The Ocean, Le Suffren and L'Epervier). Many of his marine paintings were entrusted to the National Museum of the Navy in 2002, where, after a long and meticulous restoration campaign, they were studied, classified, inventoried, restored and photographed. Most of them are currently held in the Marine Museum's reserves at Chaillot, and will be transferred in 2016 to the new Conservation Center in Dugny. Some paintings were exhibited temporarily, notably in 2003 for Souvenirs de rivages and in 2009 for Ten Years of Acquisitions. Two paintings are published in the book Escales at the Musée de la Marine published in January 2016 by Gallimard.|$|R

500|$|On 23 June the Spanish fleet {{anchored}} off Porto Longone, {{where it}} was decided during a war council to relieve Orbetello after the most essential repairs had been made. Two days later several Dunkirkers were dispatched to force the Talamone's port mouth, and 8 ships arrived from Naples at Porto Santo Stefano, destroying or capturing about 70 <b>tartanes</b> and barges which contained the supplies of Thomas of Savoy's army during the operation. Du Daugnon, meanwhile, returned to Toulon. Despite his failure, reinforcements could later be carried to Talamone aboard five ships, and Linhares' attempts to dislodge the French siege lines were unsuccessful. Linhares disembarked 3.300 soldiers led by Pimienta, who divided them in two corps and advanced upon the French lines. The first one managed to occupy a hill on [...] which a French cavalry attack was repulsed, but the second corps was dislodged after a 6-hour battle and forced to reembark. 400 wounded men were evacuated; the killed were left on the battlefield. The siege was not lifted until an army under the Duke of Arcos and the Marquis of Torrecuso stormed the besieger camp a month later, killing or capturing over 7,000 men and taking all the artillery and the baggage, which turned the whole French campaign into a failure.|$|R
