5|$|Analysis of {{algorithms}} is {{a branch}} of computer science that studies the performance of algorithms (computer programs solving a certain problem). Logarithms are valuable for describing algorithms <b>that</b> <b>divide</b> a problem into smaller ones, and join the solutions of the subproblems.|$|E

Over 200 of these freeze/thaw cycles occur each year in Bryce Canyon. Frost wedging exploits and widens the nearly vertical joint planes <b>that</b> <b>divide</b> the Pink Member of the Claron Formation.|$|E
5|$|During the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), {{emperors}} chose their consorts {{primarily from}} one of the eight Banner families, administrative divisions <b>that</b> <b>divide</b> all native Manchu families. To maintain the ethnic purity of the ruling dynasty, after the Kangxi Period (1662–1722), emperors and princes were forbidden to marry non-Manchu wives. Imperial daughters however were not covered by this ban, and as with their preceding dynasties, were often married to Mongol princes to gain political or military support, especially {{in the early years of}} the Qing dynasty; three of the nine daughters of Emperor Nurhaci and twelve of Emperor Hongtaiji's daughters were married to Mongol Princes.|$|E

5|$|The hills {{are largely}} formed from Carboniferous Limestone, which is quarried at several sites. Three nationally {{important}} semi-natural habitats {{are characteristic of}} the area: ash–maple woodland, calcareous grassland and mesotrophic grassland. With their temperate climate these support a range of flora and fauna including birds, butterflies and small mammals. The dry stone walls <b>that</b> <b>divide</b> the pasture into fields are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (Draba muralis).|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the royal tombs were decorated with religious texts and images. The early tombs were decorated with scenes from Amduat ('That Which is in the Underworld'), which describes the journey of the sun god through the twelve hours of the night. From the time of Horemheb, tombs were decorated with the Book of Gates, which shows the sun god passing through the twelve gates <b>that</b> <b>divide</b> the nighttime and ensures the tomb owner's own safe passage through the night. These earliest tombs were generally sparsely decorated, and those of a non-royal nature were totally undecorated.|$|E
5|$|The spores are hyaline (translucent), smooth, and {{ellipsoid}} {{with the}} ends truncate. They have dimensions of 11.5–20 by 5–9µm, and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous cells interspersed among the asci, or spore-producing cells) are 5–8µm wide at the tip, branched, septate (with partitions <b>that</b> <b>divide</b> the cells into compartments), and constricted at the septa. The asci are cylindrical, and measure 300–360 by 10–13µm; {{the tips of}} the asci stain blue with Melzer's reagent. The finely cylindrical paraphyses have slightly swollen tips and are forked at the base.|$|E

5|$|M-185 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the U.S. state of Michigan that circles Mackinac Island, a popular tourist destination on the Lake Huron side of the Straits of Mackinac, along the island's shoreline. A narrow paved road of , it offers scenic views of the straits <b>that</b> <b>divide</b> the Upper and the Lower peninsulas of Michigan and Lakes Huron and Michigan. It has no connection to any other Michigan state trunkline highways—as it is on an island—and is accessible only by passenger ferry. The City of Mackinac Island, which shares jurisdiction over the island with the Mackinac Island State Park Commission (MISPC), calls the highway Main Street within the built-up area on the island's southeast quadrant, and Lake Shore Road elsewhere. M-185 passes by several important sites within Mackinac Island State Park, including Fort Mackinac, Arch Rock, British Landing, and Devil's Kitchen. Lake Shore Road carries the highway next to the Lake Huron shoreline, running between the water's edge and woodlands outside the downtown area.|$|E

50|$|Divided {{governments are}} seen by {{different}} groups as a benefit {{or as an}} undesirable product of said separations. Those in favor of <b>divided</b> government believe <b>that</b> the separations encourage more policing of those in power by the opposition, as well as limiting spending {{and the expansion of}} undesirable laws. Opponents, however, argue <b>that</b> <b>divided</b> governments become lethargic, leading to many gridlocks. In the late 1980s, Terry M. Moe, {{a professor of political science}} at Stanford University, examined the issue. He concluded <b>that</b> <b>divided</b> governments lead to compromise which can be seen as beneficial. But he also noticed <b>that</b> <b>divided</b> governments subvert performance and politicize the decisions of executive agencies.|$|R

25|$|Stone {{buildings}} are often ornamented with projecting courses {{which may be}} flat fillets or rounded mouldings. These are sometimes carved with patterns, particularly chevrons. An arched doorway that is set into a thick wall may be deeply recessed, and have three or more bands of moulding around it. Doorways sometimes have colonnettes with small capitals, as are also found on the transoms <b>that</b> <b>divide</b> paired windows. Sometimes capitals and corbels are carved with floral motifs or figures.|$|E
25|$|These central mountains, {{which have}} several high plateaus, are {{irregular}} in elevation and form. The northern section is narrow and very rugged; the country's highest peak, Fan Si Pan, rises to 3,142 meters {{in the extreme}} northwest. The southern portion has numerous spurs <b>that</b> <b>divide</b> the narrow coastal strip {{into a series of}} compartments.

The 15th had long been considered the more Republican of the two districts <b>that</b> <b>divide</b> Columbus, but had become slightly less Republican as a result of the 2000 round of redistricting.|$|E
