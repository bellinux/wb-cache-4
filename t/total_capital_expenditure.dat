Using quarterly time series data, a clear pattern emerges of pre-election manipulations of fiscal policy by incumbent governments, mainly {{in the form of}} increased development spending and overall primary expenditure, followed in some cases by retrenchment in post-election periods. These findings are consistent with the predictions of rational opportunistic political business cycle theory. It is noteworthy that revenue was not statistically significantly related to elections, either in the pre- or post-election period. In this regard, electoral swings in fiscal deficits reflect a preference for influencing expenditures rather than taxation.

HSPA+ networks were also launched in limited availability in markets such as Jamaica, where upgraded towers were limited to as well as termed as '4G Experience Centres'. These centres were located in New Kingston business district, Portmore Mall (and its environs) and the Fairview Town Centre in Bogue, Montego Bay. '4G Experience Centres' were introduced in almost every LIME market but they did little to inhibit churn from main competitor, Digicel, and their widely available HSPA+ offerings in most of their markets. In 2014, after former Centrica chief executive, Phil Bentley took the helm of Cable & Wireless Communications, the company announced a $250 million USD investment programme nicknamed 'Project Marlin', aimed at improving CWC's mobile and fixed-line networks. The project would involve a <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of $1.07 billion USD {{at the end of}} its 3-year run in March 2017. The plan began with an announcement of an islandwide HSPA+ network in Jamaica in March 2014 (which concluded deployment in November 2015). This was crucial to the company's turnaround plan as their competitor, Digicel Jamaica, had gone nationwide with their HSPA+ & DC-HSDPA network since 2012. HSPA & HSPA+ network rollouts in all their other markets concluded in 2015. FLOW also has island-wide HSPA+ coverage in all of its markets. In Jamaica, FLOW's largest market, the network covers around 2.8 million people and according to the Office of Utilities Regulations (OUR), serves 1 million mobile subscribers (or about ~3.5x the population of Barbados). According to internal company counting policies (in accordance with Liberty Global's counting policy), FLOW Jamaica had 886,200 mobile subscribers in August 2016 and now, as of August 8, 2017, has 933,900 mobile subscribers of which 914,900 are prepaid subscribers.

The <b>total</b> environmental <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of 8. 7 billion by our sample firms during 1989 - 2000 supports the focus on this industry.
