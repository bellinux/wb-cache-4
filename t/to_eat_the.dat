5|$|Although no {{specific}} {{studies have been}} done on the black catbird's feeding ecology, it is thought to be an omnivore, like its close relatives are. It is known <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> fruits of Bursera simaruba and Ficus cotinifolia, two deciduous trees found in the Neotropics.|$|E
5|$|Cortinarius violaceus {{mushrooms}} are considered edible, {{but they are}} not choice; instead, the primary appeal of the species to mushroom hunters, according to Arora, is its beauty. Its similarity to some other (inedible or toxic) webcaps renders it risky <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> <b>The</b> taste after cooking is reportedly bitter.|$|E
5|$|A higher {{percentage}} of female workers of the bee species Apis cerana are reported to activate their ovaries than those of Apis mellifera or Apis florea. When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days. However, policing workers continued <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> worker-laid eggs, suggesting that the mechanism of policing in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.|$|E

5000|$|Viscum {{species are}} {{poisonous}} <b>to</b> humans; <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> fruit causes a weak pulse and acute gastrointestinal problems including stomach pain and diarrhea. [...] At {{least one of}} the active ingredients is the lectin viscumin, which is an intensely toxic. It inhibits protein synthesis by catalytically inactivating ribosomes. In spite of this, many species of animals are adapted <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> fruit as a significant part of their diet.|$|R
50|$|Sources {{describe}} {{the building of}} the fort as a matter of self-defence. The Bábí's spent many months under attack in <b>the</b> fort, resorting <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> leather of their own clothes to remain alive.|$|R
5|$|Lobster {{fishing was}} done {{on a small scale}} {{especially}} in Cardigan Bay, but was reserved almost exclusively for export. Welsh fisherman would be more likely <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> less profitable crabs. Cockles have been harvested since Roman times and are still harvested in a traditional manner with a hand rake and scraper. Cockle picking still happens in the Gower peninsula, but due to the difficulty in getting licences and reduced yield, villages near the Carmarthen Bay no longer gather them.|$|E
5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> {{leaves of the}} tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.|$|E
5|$|Southeast Asian {{traditional}} beliefs, as well {{as traditional}} Chinese medicine, consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating. The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative method is <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> durian in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or people {{with high blood pressure}} are traditionally advised not to consume durian.|$|E

50|$|While Paxillus involutus has in {{the past}} been erroneously {{considered}} edible, it is now known to be poisonous and has been linked to a number of recorded fatalities. The deadly poisonings appear to have been due <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> mushrooms raw.|$|R
5|$|The diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fruit and insects, although small reptiles and frogs have been recorded. The fruits consumed are often from the plant families Lauraceae, Annonaceae, and Rubiaceae, although a few other plant families have also been reported in their diet. They are one of many species recorded following army ants. They occasionally will eat high protein fruits, but they prefer <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> other fruits on their menu.|$|E
5|$|The medical text Balatantra {{mentions}} Putana as {{the common}} name of 16 {{sisters of the}} demon king Ravana, who are permitted <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> flesh of infants. The Buddhist text, Saddharmapundarika Sutra and the 1131 CE encyclopedia Manasollasa by Western Chalukya king Someshvara III lists multiple demons, including a group of Putanas. The Brahmanda Purana and Harita Samhita mention Putanas as a sub-group of Matrikas and Grahinis, whose individual names include Kali and Dakini.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominent}} flower spikes are {{visited by}} many birds and insects. Honeyeaters are common visitors, particularly the New Holland honeyeater, {{as well as}} the fuscous honeyeater, western wattlebird and western spinebill. Other birds recorded foraging include the grey butcherbird and species of thornbill. Insects recorded include ants, bees, wasps, butterflies, moths, flies and beetles. The short-billed black cockatoo breaks off old cones with follicles <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> seed, often doing so before the seed is ripe.|$|E

There are also trials with genetically modified male A.aegypti that after release into the wild mate with females, and render their offspring unable to fly.|$|E
5|$|With the {{remnants}} of Khal Drogo's khalasar, Daenerys Targaryen crosses the Red Waste hoping to find shelter. The trip is hard, with her newborn dragons unwilling <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> meat they are offered, and horses dying of exhaustion. Finally, Daenerys sends riders on their remaining horses to explore in three separate directions.|$|E
5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> <b>The</b> next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E

5000|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} edible mushroom, and [...] "quite popular", {{according}} to David Arora, who reports its use raw in salads, or candied like grapefruit rinds. Some people report a negative reaction <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> mushroom. The fungi {{are sold in}} traditional markets in the Mexican municipalities of Ozumba and Chalco.|$|R

5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by {{the responses of the}} animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for food {{on dry land}} at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E

5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with their teeth. They fly back to their roosts <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> fruit, sucking out the juice and {{spitting}} the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal. The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14g (0.11–0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E
5|$|It has a {{low rate}} of fruiting, with less than 1% of flowers {{developing}} into follicles, {{and more than half}} of the inflorescences failing to form any follicles at all. Seed survival rates are similarly low. More than half of a plant's seed crop may be lost to the larvae of moths and weevils, which burrow into the cobs <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> seeds and pupate in the follicles; and further seed losses are caused by granivorous birds such as cockatoos, which break off the cobs to eat both the seeds and the insect larvae.|$|E
5|$|Most species live in forests, {{although}} a few are found in other habitats. Insects and other arthropods form {{the most important part}} of their diet, although small vertebrates are occasionally taken. Most species feed in the understory and midstory of the forest, {{although a}} few feed in the canopy and a few on the ground. Many join mixed-species feeding flocks, and a few species are core members. To various degrees, around eighteen species specialise in following columns of army ants <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> small invertebrates flushed by the ants, and many others may feed in this way opportunistically.|$|E

50|$|John MacCormac was one {{of several}} European {{residents}} called to testify before the British Parliament in 1830 regarding the governance of Sierra Leone and the effectiveness of maintaining the Colony.

5000|$|Although {{the flesh}} of Hodgsonia fruit is {{inedible}} and considered worthless, the large, oil-rich seeds are {{an important source of}} food. The kernels are occasionally eaten raw; they are slightly bitter, possibly due to an unidentified alkaloid or glucoside, but [...] "perfectly safe" [...] <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> More commonly, <b>the</b> seeds are roasted, after which they taste like pork scraps or lard; many mountain peoples consider these roasted seeds a delicacy. In addition <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> seeds alone, the Naga incorporate them into various types of curry.|$|R
