25|$|Again, {{suppose it}} were like this: people-seeds drift about in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> pollen, {{and if you}} 	open your windows, one may drift in and take root in your carpets or upholstery. You don’t want children, so you fix up your windows with fine mesh screens, the very best you can buy. As can happen, however, and on very, very rare {{occasions}} does happen, one of the screens is defective; and a seed drifts in and takes root.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 AMP Energy 500 - {{the fall}} race at Talladega, Ryan Newman was spun {{backwards}} {{at high speed}} in a late race crash, and then flipped backwards (landing upside down on Kevin Harvick's hood) and ended up on his roof. Mark Martin also barrel rolled in a crash during the same race, but instead of lifting in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> Newman, his car was hit from behind, causing {{the weight of the}} car to shift to one side and pull the car onto its roof, rolling once.|$|E

25|$|In 1827, Wheatstone {{introduced}} his 'kaleidophone', a device for rendering the vibrations of a sounding body apparent to the eye. It {{consists of a}} metal rod, carrying at its end a silvered bead, which reflects a 'spot' of light. As the rod vibrates the spot is seen to describe complicated figures in <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>like</b> a spark whirled about in the darkness. His photometer was probably suggested by this appliance. It enables two lights to be compared by the relative brightness of their reflections in a silvered bead, which describes a narrow ellipse, so as to draw the spots into parallel lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue jay}} mainly feeds on nuts and seeds such as acorns, soft fruits, arthropods, and {{occasionally}} small vertebrates. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, though it sometimes hawks insects from <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Like</b> squirrels, blue jays {{are known to}} hide nuts for later consumption. It builds an open cup nest in {{the branches of a}} tree, which both sexes participate in constructing. The clutch can contain two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8–12 days after hatching. They may remain with their parents for one to two months.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{he began}} racing on asphalt ovals {{when he entered}} the American Speed Association (ASA) as well as {{part-time}} in the NASCAR Busch Series (now Xfinity Series). In the same year, Johnson won the ASA Pat Schauer Memorial Rookie title. One year later, he had two wins and finished third in the standings. In 2000, he was announced the driver for Herzog Motorsports in the Busch Series. During the season, he had a spectacular accident on lap 46 during the Lysol 200 at Watkins Glen when his brakes failed entering the first turn. He had to swerve quickly to the right to avoid the 86 of Dennis Demers, but went into the grass on the inside of turn one, then went back across the track, caught some air on the gravel trap before finally crashing head-on into the carafoam barriers {{at the far end of}} the turn while still more than 150+ MPH. Many feared that this accident could have resulted in career ending injuries or potentially have killed him, but he climbed out of the car unscathed and raised his fists in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> he'd won the race, much to the delight of the crowd. Otherwise, in a rather uneventful season which featured one DNQ at Daytona and 6 top-10's, he finished tenth in the point standings. During the 2001 season, Johnson recorded one win, which was at Chicagoland Speedway, and finished eighth in the point standings. He also began racing in the Winston Cup Series (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) for Hendrick Motorsports. In the following season, Johnson left Herzog Motorsports to move to Hendrick Motorsports in the Winston Cup Series, driving the No. 48 Lowe's Chevrolet.|$|E

500|$|At one time, {{porbeagles}} {{were regarded}} as nuisances by some commercial fishers because they damaged lighter fishing gear intended for smaller species and stole hooked fish from lines. This shark is highly valued as a game fish by sport fishers in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It fights strongly on hook-and-line, but does not usually jump into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> the related shortfin mako. Novice anglers often mistake this shark for the mako, which has earned it the affectionate moniker [...] "fako" [...] in New England.

Many reviewers said the mere title demonstrated the crudeness and originality of South Park, then still a relatively new show.

500|$|His bowling {{was smooth}} and effortless, with a {{classical}} action. He could bowl fast, but more often bowled at fast-medium pace. He could make the ball swing in humid weather, and deliver off-spin when conditions were suitable. However, Hammond was reluctant to bowl, particularly for Gloucestershire. Bill Bowes believed {{that he was a}} very good bowler who would not take it seriously. In his obituary, Wisden said that [...] "at slip he had no superior. He stood all but motionless, moved late but with uncanny speed, never needing to stretch or strain but plucking the ball from <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> an apple from a tree." [...] He was also able to field further away from the batsmen than was the norm, particularly in his younger days, as he could chase the ball quickly and had a very good throwing arm.|$|E
500|$|This airship that {{lifted a}} rider {{consisted}} of a cigar-shaped hydrogen balloon that looked like an inverted boat wrapped in netting. It had a velocipede seat and steering bar for a rider. A cloth screw propeller was operated by the rider through a cog wheel and ratchet attachment operated by the rider pedaling. He first called the hybrid invention an [...] "air bicycle", that navigated through <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> driving a bicycle. He later named it a [...] "gas kite", an [...] "aerial velocipede", an [...] "aerial bicycle", [...] and ultimately a [...] "sky-cycle." [...] The propeller acted like a screw of a boat and propelled the airship forward and up with the backward air current generated. It {{could go to a}} thousand feet, be maneuvered, and brought back at will by the rider. Myers' wife was an expert in sky-cycling.|$|E
500|$|Even if the Nazko swarm were {{a warning}} of a {{volcanic}} eruption, Hickson doubted {{it would turn}} out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. [...] "We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava [...] into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event.|$|E

500|$|Traditionally, most {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} Pteranodon would have taken fish by dipping their beaks into the water while in low, soaring flight. However, this was probably {{based on the assumption}} that the animals could not take off from the water surface. It is more likely that Pteranodon could take off from the water, and would have dipped for fish while swimming rather than while flying. Even a small, female Pteranodon could have reached a depth of at least [...] with its long bill and neck while floating on the surface, and they may have reached even greater depths by plunge-diving into the water from <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> some modern long-winged seabirds. In 1994, Bennett noted that the head, neck, and shoulders of Pteranodon were as heavily built as diving birds, and suggested that they could dive by folding back their wings like the modern gannet.|$|E
500|$|Jando Dominique, {{reporting}} for Spectacle: An Online Journal of Circus Arts, summarized audience and critical reception for Circus Juventas's shows by describing them as [...] "always sold out and enthusiastically {{reviewed by the}} press."

[...] Writing for Minnesota Monthly, Amanda Bankston commended the technical skill and professionalism of the performers in 2012's Showdown: [...] "There is nothing child-like about the talent in this show. The budding stars fearlessly swing, flip, and soar through <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> pros." [...] In Spectacle, Dominique noted that Juventas's productions consistently have [...] "a polish and style not often seen in youth circuses, or most professional ones, for that matter." ...|$|E
500|$|The Washington Monument in Washington D.C. {{is often}} seen as {{a prime example of}} phallic {{architecture}} and American masculinity. The towering monument, made of marble, granite, and bluestone gneiss, it is both the world's tallest stone structure and the world's tallest obelisk, standing [...] according to the National Park Service. Construction of the monument began in 1848, was halted from 1854 to 1877, and was completed in 1884. In a Journal review, dated 17 October 1911, Arnold Bennett said of the monument, [...] "Saw Washington monument. Phallic. Appalling. A national catastrophe – only equalled by the Albert Memorial. Tiny doll-like people waiting to go into it." [...] Dan Burstein says of it, [...] "Speaking of sex symbols, there is no more phallic symbol in existence than the Washington Monument, and the Capitol dome can be viewed as breastlike." [...] James Webb used a metaphor to praise the [...] "uplift" [...] power of the Washington Monument as a white phallus, [...] "piercing <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>like</b> a bayonet". In the futuristic film Hardwired, set in the United States where everything noteworthy is commercialized, the Washington Monument is used as a giant Trojan condoms billboard.|$|E
