500|$|It was {{the absence}} of Symonds, sent home from the 2008â€“09 series against Bangladesh for {{skipping}} a team meeting to go fishing, that gave White another opportunity in the ODI team. Although stand-in captain Clarke mirrored the action of Ponting by bringing himself on before the Victoria captain, White claimed a career-best three wickets for five runs off the 10balls he bowled. After the match, White admitted he had to prove he could deal with the pressures of international cricket, but was upbeat, saying [...] "it was nice <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> wickets {{but it would have}} been nice <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> overs under the belt as well." [...] He claimed two more wickets in the second match and, after not being required to bowl in the third, finished the series with an average under 10.|$|E

500|$|With his {{aggressive}} running style which favored {{running over}} players instead of around them, questions began to arise over how long Campbell could stay healthy. [...] "He runs {{with a lot}} of reckless abandon," [...] said Ron Johnson, a former running back whose own career was cut short. [...] "You can run like that in college. But you can't do that for 10 years and hope to survive." [...] Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris said [...] "Knocking over people can look very good but you can't do it forever. Sometimes it's going to be somebody else who knocks you over ... so the most important thing I think isn't <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> extra yards every time but to make sure you're healthy enough to play." [...] Bum Phillips, though, favored Campbell's running style. [...] "I've been looking for a back like Earl," [...] he said. [...] "I'm not going to change his style. Why would I? You don't want a guy who gets hit and then flops on the ground. Earl does the same thing other backs do, only better." ...|$|E

500|$|Casting for {{the film}} became a hot topic. When Sean Penn met Malick, he told him, [...] "Give me a dollar and tell me where to show up". Scripts were also sent to Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and Tom Cruise. In 1995, once word went out that Malick was making another movie after many years, {{numerous}} actors approached him, flooding the casting directors until they had to announce they wouldn't be accepting more requests. Some A-list actors including Brad Pitt, Al Pacino, Gary Oldman, and George Clooney offered {{to work for a}} fraction and some even offered to work for free. Bruce Willis even went as far as offering to pay for first-class tickets for the casting crew, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> lines for the movie. At Medavoy's home in 1995, Malick staged a reading with Martin Sheen delivering the screen directions, and Kevin Costner, Will Patton, Peter Berg, Lukas Haas, and Dermot Mulroney playing the main roles. In June of that year, a five-day workshop was scheduled at Medavoy's with Pitt dropping by, and culminating with Malick putting on the soundtrack of Where Eagles Dare and playing Japanese taiko drums. Malick met with an interested Johnny Depp about the project at the Book Soup Bistro on the Sunset Strip.|$|E
500|$|... "Jury Duty" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and was considered}} by many critics {{to be a major}} {{step in the right direction}} for the series. Brian Marder from the New York Post wrote that, [...] " [...] was a step, if not a leap, in the right direction for the showwhich, let's be honest, is showing its fatigue and staleness; possibly nearing its end; clearly suffering without Steve Carell." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times gave the episode a positive review, calling the episode [...] "fun and surprisingly sweet." [...] McQuinn enjoyed the episode's developments, most notably the idea that both Jim and Dwight can bond as fathers and explained that he hoped the producers would not [...] "forget about it like almost every other development this season." [...] New York writer Michael Tedder complimented the writers for improving on the first half of the season and wrote that the episode felt more [...] "tightly written". He also complimented Krasinski's [...] "understated" [...] performance as well as Wilson's acting, citing the scene near the end of the episode wherein Dwight learns Angela's baby might be his. Despite this, he criticized the cold opening and the [...] "miming chill pill" [...] scene. Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar gave the episode a glowing review, saying, [...] "After a solid cold opening of Andy dancing ..., the rest of this week's episode of The Office is a success. ... This is one of my favorite episodes I can remember in a long time. Not too plot driven and chock-full of solid comedic writing plus a handful endearing moments that just made me feel good. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of my favorite lines, just keep reading." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also {{one of the}} {{important}} ritual actions performed by the devotees of Ayyavazhi is to take this ritual bath, drawing water from the well.

Jennifer Adeeko from the organisation behind the MOBO Awards said, [...] "Within the song Lewis is able to show how spectacular her vocal range is, with her softer sounding vocals to her more powerful, belting vocals. [...] Bound <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> guys flustered if their girlfriends listen to the track and follow the lyrics; we predict {{that this is going}} to be one of her biggest track to date". Entertainment Weekly critic Michael Slezak wrote that [...] "while [...] "Happy" [...] is a solidly written, professionally produced song with a Velcro-ey hook, it has the emotional resonance of a so-so, big-budget romantic comedy. [...] In the hands of a singer who could achieve both technical perfection and emotional depth, 'Happy' might've been my early autumn jam. But delivered in Lewis's lovely-but-vacant style, I'm gonna have to rifle through my iPod for a more substantial diva anthem".|$|E
