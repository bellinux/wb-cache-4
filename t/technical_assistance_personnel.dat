40|$|Detailed {{analyses}} {{of poverty and}} wellbeing in developing countries, based on household surveys, have been ongoing {{for more than three}} decades. The large majority of developing countries now regularly conduct a variety of household surveys, and their information base with respect to poverty and wellbeing has improved dramatically. Nevertheless, appropriate measurement of poverty remains complex and controversial. This is particularly true in developing countries where (i) the stakes with respect to poverty reduction are high; (ii) the determinants of living standards are often volatile; and (iii) related information bases, while much improved, are often characterized by significant non-sample error. It also remains, to a surprisingly high degree, an activity undertaken by <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>personnel</b> and consultants based in developed countries. This book seeks to enhance the transparency, replicability, and comparability of existing practice. It also aims to significantly lower the barriers to entry to the conduct of rigorous poverty measurement and increase the participation of analysts from developing countries in their own poverty assessments. The book focuses on two domains: the measurement of absolute consumption poverty and a first-order dominance approach to multidimensional welfare analysis. In each domain, it provides a series of computer codes designed to facilitate analysis by allowing the analyst to start from a flexible and known base. The volume covers the theoretical grounding for the code streams provided, a chapter on "estimation in practice", a series of eleven case studies where the code streams are operationalized, a synthesis, an extension to inequality, and a look forward...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In the {{thirteen}} years, Brazil has produced about 353 thousands tons/year of passion fruit and processed 123. 55 thousands/year. The {{per capita consumption}} was 1. 5 kg/person/year of fresh fuit and 0. 33 kg/person/year as juice and pulp. Additionally, it can be emphasized that the production in the fruit market as sourness passion fruit in Brazilian Savannahs in the year 2000, reached 50. 5 thousand tons/year, from which 35 % was destined to industry. This study was conducted as field research interview, {{carried out in the}} 1998 / 2000 period, considering a sample of 11 % of a population, composed by passion fruit producers, <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>personnel,</b> nursery producers, and industry managers, involving twelve production municipalities. Additionally, they were obtained some secondary data related to the passion fruit production chain. Considering the importance of this crop production for the investigated region, this work was established aiming to analyze the crop production system, including its relationship with the market, in order to identify and characterize the main agents that affect the commercialization process. Beside this, it was intended to raise important information in order to establish, at least a partial view, on the passion fruit production chain. It was observed that the economical sustainability of passion fruits in the area, especially in the segment of commercialization of fresh fruits, depends on several actions: definition of an adequate crop system, including provision for seeds with good genetic quality; development of new varieties, more resistant do diseases and with satisfactory degree of adaptation to local climatic conditions; implementation of an efficient program for pest control and soil-water plant nutrition; establishment of an adequate system for controlling the quality and the sanitary aspects of young plants and seeds; financial support to improve farming system organization and to increase crop productivity; and technical assitance to improve farmers managing capability. 200...|$|E

Abstract: The focus of this article is on whether, and to what extent, the major UN bodies for environmental issues – the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), the Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD), and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) – have had any impact upon how China addresses and approaches its environmental issues. The UN bodies seem to have had some degree of day-to-day influence in a range of fields. UNEP has provided assistance in terms of policy formulation, <b>technical</b> <b>assistance,</b> training of <b>personnel,</b> public awareness and networking. The CSD seems to have made fewer practical and concrete contributions to China’s environmental policies; it serves as an arena for learning and discussion of environmental issues, rather than as a body for policy implementation. The GEF, on the other hand, has been shown to be an important source for the implementation of environmental policies in China. As to China’s contribution to environmental issues on the global arena, China does not seem to give priority to the international level of environmental policies. It is an active participant and stakeholder in international bodies such as UNEP an...|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses the results of GAO's review of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and capacity-building programs. <b>Technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs {{can be defined as}} training designed to improve the performance or management of program recipients, such as teaching one-on-one procurement regulations to housing authority staff. Capacity building can be generally defined as funding to strengthen the capacity or capability of program recipients or providers [...] typically housing or community development organizations [...] thereby building the institutional knowledge within those organizations. The overall goal of both <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and capacity building is to enhance the delivery of HUD's housing and community development programs. HUD administers 21 <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs through five program offices. From fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2002, the annual funding for HUD <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> ranged between $ 128 million and $ 201 million, accounting for less than 1 percent of HUD's overall budget each year. Although the general purpose of HUD's <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> is to help program participants carry out HUD program goals, each program office designs <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> specifically related to its programs. Recipients could be states and units of local government, public or Indian housing agencies, private and nonprofit organizations, or individuals. Providers could be HUD officials or, more commonly, state or local governments, profit and nonprofit organizations, or public housing agencies. HUD awards funding for 17 of the 21 <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs competitively. The funding for the remaining programs is awarded noncompetitively. HUD uses three types of funding instruments and determines which type to use {{on the basis of its}} relationship with the awardee and the level of federal involvement anticipated.

After giving {{a brief history}} of tecnhical assistance and the problems commonly associated with it, he describes classifications of <b>technical</b> <b>assistance,</b> proposes a new typology to be used for project appraisal, suggests methods for screening projects, and discusses different levels of economic analysis. He shows how the typology and economic analysis could be applied to 40 projects in the Europe and Central Asia region, Although some of the suggested approaches are sophisticated and demanding, much of it relies on fairly simple techniques. The author estimates that roughly 60 percent of the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> in his sample was suitable for quantitative analysis. Using four case studies, he demonstrates how quantitative economic analysis could be used more frequently in the appraisal process. The author recommends that all <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> be classified according to the methodology suitable for its appraisal and evaluation. In cases in which little or no quantitative analysis is used, the staff officer can and should provide a justification -in which case it should still be possible to conceptualize the problem in economic terms. Essential <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> should be included when calculating the economic rate of return on a project. When <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> is excluded from this calculation, a strong justification for such assistance should be given or it should be omitted from the project. In his sample, the author estimates that about 80 percent of the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> in investment projects was not essential for project implementation.

A content analysis was conducted to assess size using traditional transactional and transformational change definitions, and a survey questionnaire was used to assess size from the perspective of the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> recipients.
