25|$|The {{breakdown}} of dioxin requires {{exposure of the}} molecular ring to a sufficiently high temperature so as to trigger thermal {{breakdown of}} the strong molecular bonds holding it together. Small pieces of fly ash may be somewhat thick, and too brief an exposure to high temperature may only degrade dioxin {{on the surface of}} the ash. For a large volume air chamber, too brief an exposure may also result in only some of the exhaust gases reaching the full breakdown temperature. For this reason there is also a <b>time</b> <b>element</b> to the temperature exposure to ensure heating completely through the thickness of the fly ash and the volume of waste gases.|$|E
25|$|Les Baigneuses, {{along with}} other {{compositions}} by Gleizes and his fellow Salon Cubists from this period (1911-1912), tend to coordinate a variety of views of the same subject, or a multiplicity (in the Bergsonian sense) of different angles in one picture. This attempt clearly shows the importance of both the <b>time</b> <b>element</b> and the mobile properties in the sequence of events. According to Gleizes, the artist would accommodate either several successive moments in time projected onto a single space, or multiple spaces projected onto the canvas at the same time. These kinematic compositions that took into account both staticity and dynamism were not just a new description of the external world created by the artist, but also the inner world.|$|E

There are so many little additions to the design it's impossible to list them all". There was particular praise given to the innovative internal clock feature, with Frank Povo of GameSpot, noting: [...] "The first major addition to Pokémon GS {{is the presence of}} a <b>time</b> <b>element...</b> Although it may sound like a gimmick, the addition of a clock adds quite a bit of variety to the game". Povo went on to give the games a [...] "great" [...] 8.8 rating. Nintendo Power listed the Gold and Silver versions of it combined as the sixth best Game Boy/Game Boy Color video game, praising it for its new Pokémon, features, and full-color graphics.|$|E
2500|$|Decimal {{fractions}} may {{be added}} {{to any of the}} three time elements. However, a fraction may only {{be added to}} the lowest order <b>time</b> <b>element</b> in the representation. A decimal mark, either a comma or a dot (without any preference as stated in resolution 10 of the 22nd General Conference CGPM in 2003, but with a preference for a comma according to ISO 8601:2004) is used as a separator between the <b>time</b> <b>element</b> and its fraction.

40|$|A natural {{approach}} to representing and reasoning about temporal propositions (i. e., statements with time-dependent truth-values) is to associate them with <b>time</b> <b>elements.</b> In the literature, {{there are three}} choices regarding the primitive for the ontology of time: (1) instantaneous points, (2) durative intervals and (3) both points and intervals. Problems may arise when one conflates different views of temporal structure and questions whether some certain types of temporal propositions can be validly and meaningfully associated with different <b>time</b> <b>elements.</b> In this paper, we shall summarize an ontological glossary with respect to <b>time</b> <b>elements,</b> and diversify {{a wider range of}} meta-predicates for ascribing temporal propositions to <b>time</b> <b>elements.</b> Based on these, we shall also devise a versatile categorization of temporal propositions, which can subsume those representative categories proposed in the literature, including that of Vendler, of McDermott, of Allen, of Shoham, of Galton and of Terenziani and Torasso. It is demonstrated that the new categorization of propositions, together with the proposed range of meta-predicates, provides the expressive power for modeling some typical temporal terms/phenomena, such as starting-instant, stopping-instant, dividing-instant, instigation, termination and intermingling etc...|$|R

2500|$|Despite hearing heavy gunfire {{from the}} north, {{including}} distinct volleys at 4:20pm, Benteen concentrated on reinforcing Reno's badly wounded and hard-pressed detachment rather than continuing on toward Custer's position. Benteen's apparent reluctance to reach Custer prompted later criticism {{that he had}} failed to follow orders. Around 5:00pm, Capt. Thomas Weir and Company D moved out to make contact with Custer. They advanced a mile, to what is today Weir Ridge or Weir Point, and could see in the distance native warriors on horseback shooting at objects on the ground. By this time, roughly 5:25pm, Custer's battle may have concluded. The conventional historical understanding is that what Weir witnessed was most likely warriors killing the wounded soldiers and shooting at dead bodies on the [...] "Last Stand Hill" [...] at the northern end of the Custer battlefield. Some contemporary historians have suggested that what Weir witnessed was a fight on what is now called Calhoun Hill. The destruction of Keogh's battalion may have begun with the collapse of L, I and C Company (half of it) following the combined assaults led by Crazy Horse, White Bull, Hump, Chief Gall and others. Other native accounts contradict this understanding, however, and the <b>time</b> <b>element</b> remains a subject of debate. The other entrenched companies eventually followed Weir by assigned battalions, first Benteen, then Reno, and finally the pack train. Growing native attacks around Weir Ridge forced all seven companies to return to the bluff before the pack train, with the ammunition, had moved even a quarter mile. The companies remained pinned down on the bluff for another day, but the natives were unable to breach the tightly held position.|$|E
60|$|There is one puzzling {{thing about}} these prehistoric {{memories}} of mine. It is the vagueness of the <b>time</b> <b>element.</b> I lo not always know {{the order of}} events;--or can I tell, between some events, whether one, two, or {{four or five years}} have elapsed.

60|$|There {{is another}} point about spirit {{communications}} which is worth noting. This is their uncertainty wherever any <b>time</b> <b>element</b> comes in. Their estimate {{of time is}} almost invariably wrong. Earth time is probably a different idea to spirit time, and hence the confusion. We had the advantage, as I have stated, {{of the presence of}} a lady in our household who developed writing mediumship. She was in close touch with three brothers, all of whom had been killed in the war. This lady, conveying messages from her brothers, was hardly ever entirely wrong upon facts, and hardly ever right about time. There was one notable exception, however, which in itself is suggestive. Although her prophecies as to public events were weeks or even months out, she in one case foretold the arrival of a telegram from Africa to the day. Now the telegram had already been sent, but was delayed, so that the inference seems to be that she could foretell a course of events which had actually been set in motion, and calculate how long they would take to reach their end. On the other hand, I am bound to admit that she confidently prophesied the escape of her fourth brother, who was a prisoner in Germany, and that this was duly fulfilled. On the whole I preserve an open mind upon the powers and limitations of prophecy.|$|E

Round and round I ran him, me {{travelling}} on the inner circle, eating jerked meat and salmon berries on the run, and snatching winks of sleep between. Of course, he'd get desperate at times and turn. Then I'd head for soft ground where the creek spread out, and lay anathema upon him and his ancestry, and dare him to come on. But he was too wise to bog in a mud puddle. Once he pinned me in against the walls, and I crawled back into a deep crevice and waited. Whenever he felt for me with his trunk, I'd belt him with the hand-axe till he pulled out, shrieking fit to split my ear drums, he was that mad. He knew he had me and didn't have me, and it near drove him wild. But he was no man's fool. He knew he was safe as long as I stayed in the crevice, and he {{made up his mind}} to keep me there. And he was dead right, only he hadn't figured on the commissary. There was neither grub nor water around that spot, so {{on the face of it}} he couldn't keep up the siege. He'd stand before the opening for hours, keeping an eye on me and flapping mosquitoes away with his big blanket ears. Then the thirst would come on him and he'd ramp round and roar till the earth shook, calling me every name he could lay tongue to. This was to frighten me, of course; and when he thought I was sufficiently impressed, he'd back away softly and try to make a sneak for the creek. Sometimes I'd let him get almost there--only a couple of hundred yards away it was--when out I'd pop and back he'd come, lumbering along like the old landslide he was. After I'd done this a few times, and he'd figured it out, he changed his tactics. Grasped the <b>time</b> <b>element,</b> you see. Without a word of warning, away he'd go, tearing for the water like mad, scheming to get there and back before I ran away.
