5|$|Previous year's MVP, <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> {{scored a}} game-high 17 points {{and led the}} East Sunrisers to a 60–57 victory over the West Sunsetters. Owens, an American {{football}} star for Dallas Cowboys, was also named as the Celebrity Game MVP for the second successive year. The game was marked by a surprise appearance by another Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman {{in the middle of}} the game, where she joined and played with the East Sunrisers. ESPN play-by-play commentator Mike Breen also made a surprise appearance as the referee for the game.|$|E
5|$|The Packers {{lost to the}} San Francisco 49ers in a Wild Card Round {{playoff game}} in 1998. Favre had rallied the team with a {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Antonio Freeman with 1:56 remaining in the game to put the Packers up 27–23. However, Steve Young responded with a touchdown of his own to wide receiver <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> with three seconds remaining to end the Packers season. Favre and the Packers failed {{for the first time}} since 1994 to at least reach the NFC Championship.|$|E
25|$|In the game, <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> {{broke his}} finger.|$|E
25|$|NFC – <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> 6-yard {{pass from}} Jeff Garcia (Nick Folk kick), 12:29. NFC 35–30. Drive: 9 plays, 80 yards, 5:46.|$|E
25|$|NFC – <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> 6-yard {{pass from}} Tony Romo (Nick Folk kick), 7:58. AFC 24–14. Drive: 8 plays, 51 yards, 4:10.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2003 season, Garcia, the three-time Pro Bowler, was released, {{along with}} several other 49er players {{including}} RB Garrison Hearst and WR <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the February 2006 {{edition of}} GQ Magazine, he was {{selected}} number three on their list of the top ten most hated athletes, behind Barry Bonds and <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also, <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> (3 receptions for 89 {{yards and}} 2 {{touchdown}}s) reached 132 career touchdown catches, placing him 2nd on the NFL's all-time touchdown receptions list (behind only Jerry Rice's record of 197).|$|E
25|$|In Week 9 {{against the}} Miami Dolphins Moss added 6 catches for 147 yards and 1 {{touchdown}}. The touchdown reception was the 140th of his career, which moved {{him into a}} tie for 2nd place with <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dez Bryant {{also made}} Cowboys history by {{catching}} 2 touchdown passes, {{giving him a}} total of 16 touchdown receptions on the year, breaking <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> previous single season touchdown reception record of 15 in 2007 (the second touchdown was originally called incomplete by the refs, but was overturned after review).|$|E
25|$|On March 12, 2012, Moss {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the San Francisco 49ers for undisclosed financial terms after a workout with the team's head coach Jim Harbaugh. On September 9, 2012, Moss caught his 154th touchdown reception, and subsequently passed <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> for sole possession of 2nd on the all-time receiving touchdown list.|$|E
25|$|The Eagles {{achieved}} the best regular season {{record in the}} conference during the combined 2001, 2002, and 2003 seasons {{with a total of}} 35 wins out of 48 games, but lost the NFC Championship Game in each of those 3 years. Prior to the 2004 season, the Eagles traded for wide receiver <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> to be the impact player to help get them to the Super Bowl.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week, in a {{prime time}} Sunday night matchup against the Indianapolis Colts, Moss had 179 {{yards and two}} touchdowns, including a 63-yard touchdown in the 2nd quarter that moved him ahead of <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> for sole possession of 2nd place in career touchdown receptions. In the same game, he became just the 11th player in NFL history with 900+ receptions and the 7th player to reach 14,000+ career receiving yards.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} quarter, 49ers linebacker Julian Peterson intercepted a pass from Kerry Collins at the San Francisco 24-yard line after it {{bounced off the}} hands of running back Ron Dayne. On the next play, 49ers quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a {{moderate}} pass to <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens,</b> who broke two tackles and took it 76 yards to the end zone. New York responded with an 11-play, 65-yard drive, that ended with Collins' 12-yard touchdown pass to Amani Toomer, tying the game at 7.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Cincinnati crept closer as QB Carson Palmer {{completed}} an 18-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh. In the fourth quarter, the Bengals got within one point as Graham kicked a 40-yard field goal, yet the Cowboys responded with Romo completing a 57-yard TD pass to WR <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens.</b> The Bengals {{tried to come}} back as Palmer completed a 10-yard TD pass to Houshmandzadeh (with a failed two-point conversion), but Dallas pulled away as Romo completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.|$|E
25|$|Warner's top {{target was}} Fitzgerald, who caught seven passes for 127 {{yards and two}} {{touchdown}}s. Fitzgerald set a single postseason record with seven touchdown receptions, passing Jerry Rice, who had six in the 1988 postseason. Fitzgerald as well as Holmes each had 100 yards receiving, marking {{the fourth time in}} Super Bowl history, one player from each team had over 100 yards in a Super Bowl. Michael Irvin and Andre Reed were the first in Super Bowl XXVII, followed by Deion Branch and Muhsin Muhammad in Super Bowl XXXVIII and Branch again a year later along with <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> in Super Bowl XXXIX.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} game against the New England Patriots, Revis {{recorded}} 7 tackles and held Wes Welker to 6 catches for 61 yards in the 38–14 loss. He recorded the first interception of his career against the division-rival Buffalo Bills during their week 8 matchup. Revis would show great progression throughout the season, remaining as the Jets' solid starter and one of their best defensive players. Starting at 16 games, Revis ended his rookie season with 87 total tackles, one sack, one forced fumble and 3 interceptions. Revis was only beaten for touchdowns three times during his rookie season by Braylon Edwards, Lee Evans, and <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens.</b>|$|E
25|$|San Francisco {{increased}} their lead to 24-7 {{early in the}} third quarter, driving 46 yards in 10 plays to score with Gary Anderson's 34-yard field goal. But the Vikings responded with Cunningham's 53-yard completion to Reed setting up a 3-yard touchdown reception by Carter, narrowing the gap to 24-14. Replays showed the officials blew the call on Reed's reception because his second toe came down on the end line, but it didn't make much difference because the 49ers {{came back with a}} 75-yard touchdown drive with Kirby rushing for gains of 22 and 14 yards on the first two plays. Young's 15-yard pass to <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> made the score 31-14.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} divisional road {{win over the}} Redskins, the Cowboys went home, donned their throwback uniforms, and played a Week 12 game with the San Francisco 49ers. In the first quarter, Dallas trailed early as 49ers kicker Joe Nedney made a 23-yard and a 22-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Cowboys took a lead as QB Tony Romo {{completed}} a 75-yard TD pass to WR <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens,</b> LB Carlos Polk blocked an Andy Lee punt {{into the back of}} the 49ers' endzone for a safety, kicker Nick Folk making a 48-yard and a 41-yard field goal, and Romo throwing a 45-yard pass to T.O., Then completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Martellus Bennett.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} {{impressive}} divisional road {{win over the}} Bears, the Vikings flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 7 intraconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, Minnesota trailed early as Cowboys QB Tony Romo completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens.</b> The Vikings would respond with rookie RB Adrian Peterson getting a 20-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Minnesota had an abnormal defensive touchdown, as LB Ben Leber picked up a Patrick Crayton fumble, ran a couple of yards, lateraled the ball to CB Cedric Griffin, who would eventually fumble and recover the ball at Dallas' 28-yard line, and then run into the endzone for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|In Marshall's {{first game}} back from suspension, he caught 18 passes for 166 {{yards and a}} touchdown, in a 39–38 home victory over the San Diego Chargers. The 18 receptions were a Broncos single-game record, and tied for the second most in NFL history, {{trailing}} only <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens,</b> who caught 20 passes for the San Francisco 49ers in a game during the 2000 NFL season. Marshall's 18 receptions gave him 55 total receptions over five games, which is an NFL record. He is the first receiver in NFL history to register at least 10 receptions in {{four out of five}} games. His performance against the Chargers also earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
25|$|In the 3rd, Tony Romo found <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> for a 12-yard {{touchdown}} pass {{that broke the}} tie. Then, a 33-yard field goal by Nick Folk sent the Cowboys into the 4th quarter with a 13–3 lead. Midway through the 4th, Jeff Reed connected on a 41-yard field goal to cut the Cowboys' lead to 13–6. Then, Ben Roethlisberger and Tight End Heath Miller hooked up for a 6-yard Steelers touchdown that tied the game at 13. On the ensuing Dallas possession, Tony Romo was intercepted by Deshea Townsend who returned it 25 yards for a touchdown, and Pittsburgh led 20–13. After the kickoff, the Cowboys failed to convert on a 4th-and-10 and the Steelers got the ball back. They were then able to run the clock out and seal the victory.|$|E
25|$|Branch and <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> {{each had}} 100 yards {{receiving}}, marking {{the third time}} in Super Bowl history, one player from each team had over 100 yards in a Super Bowl. Michael Irvin and Andre Reed were the first in Super Bowl XXVII, and Branch and Muhsin Muhammad the second a year earlier in Super Bowl XXXVIII. Branch also became the fourth player to have at least 100 yards receiving in back-to-back Super Bowls, joining John Stallworth, Jerry Rice and Antonio Freeman. Also, Mike Vrabel and David Givens became just the 14th and 15th players to score a touchdown in consecutive Super Bowls. Vrabel is the most surprising person on this list because he is a linebacker and he scored his on offense. They also became just the 7th and 8th players to catch a touchdown in back-to-back Super Bowls.|$|E
25|$|This {{draft is}} {{considered}} one of the best draft classes ever for the position of wide receiver. Keyshawn Johnson, Terry Glenn, Eddie Kennison, Marvin Harrison, Eric Moulds, Bobby Engram, <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens,</b> Muhsin Muhammad, Amani Toomer, Jermaine Lewis, and Joe Horn have all achieved success in the pros, with all except Kennison, Engram, and Toomer having reached the Pro Bowl at least once, and a total of 26 Pro Bowl appearances for the group. In addition to the class having had several successful receivers, none of the five wide receivers drafted in the first round have been busts, as all of them spent at least a reasonable amount of time as starters in the NFL. Combined, 1996 wide receivers (through the end of the 2006 season) have totalled 7,646 receptions for 105,866 yards, eclipsing any other class by more than 1,000 receptions and 10,000 yards.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to build}} on their home win over the Redskins, the Buccaneers flew to Texas Stadium for a Thanksgiving game against the Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, the Bucs capped off their opening driver with FB Mike Alstott getting a 1-yard TD run. However, the Cowboys responded with QB Tony Romo getting a 30-yard TD pass to WR Terry Glenn. In the second quarter, Romo and Glenn hooked up with each other again on a 2-yard TD pass. The Bucs could only respond with kicker Matt Bryant getting a 46-yard field goal. Dallas would respond with Romo getting a 1-yard TD pass to RB Marion Barber. In the third quarter, Romo and Barber would hook up with each other again on a 2-yard TD pass, with Romo also hooking up with WR <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> on a 7-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter, kicker Mike Vanderjagt would close out the scoring with a 22-yard field goal. With the loss, the Bucs fell to 3–8.|$|E
25|$|Later on, Green Bay {{managed a}} drive deep into San Francisco territory, but Favre {{committed}} a 15-yard intentional grounding penalty on third and 14, and Longwell missed a 47-yard field goal {{attempt on the}} next play. On the 49ers ensuing drive, they drove 52 yards in nine plays, including Young's 48-yard completion to <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> on third down and 26, to reach the Packers 10-yard line. Young nearly completed a touchdown pass to J. J. Stokes, but Stokes landed with one foot out of bounds {{in the end zone}} and the 49ers settled for a Gary Anderson field goal, cutting the score to 10-3 with less than a minute left in the half. Only 51 seconds remained after Green Bay got the ball back, but Favre got his team into scoring range with a 40-yard completion to Freeman, and Longwell capitalized with a 43-yard field goal as time expired, giving the Packers a 13-3 halftime lead.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the third}} quarter commenced, the Seahawks {{took the time to}} move the ball deep into the Dallas red zone. They were stopped on third down at the Dallas 7, and elected to go for their third field goal. This drive took 5:23, the longest drive thus far in the game. On Dallas' next possession, cornerback Marcus Trufant intercepted an endzone pass that was {{intended}} for wideout <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens.</b> The Seahawks offense was unable to capitalize on the turnover, as they were unable to convert for the first down. Dallas followed with an unsuccessful drive that ended on their second punt of the game. The Seahawks faced their second three-and-out of the quarter on their ensuing possession; their punt led Dallas to field their offense at the Dallas 44. After two plays, Romo threw to Owens for a 33-yard gain. Owens scored a touchdown off a 19-yard catch on the next play, extending the Cowboys' lead to 31–9. Seattle failed again to produce a score during the two minutes left in {{the third quarter}}.|$|E
25|$|McNabb finally amassed {{the kind}} of numbers that placed him firmly {{as one of the}} elite NFL quarterbacks statistically. He {{averaged}} 8.26 yards per attempt, completed 64.0 percent of his passes, threw 31 touchdown passes (he also ran for three more), and only eight interceptions. These numbers translated to a passer rating of 104.7. Furthermore, he became the first quarterback in league history to throw over 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a single season. This dramatic improvement coincided with a massive upgrading of the Eagles' receiving corps, namely the arrival of <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens,</b> who caught 1200 yards and 14 touchdowns in only 14 games. As a result, the Eagles won their first seven games of the season {{for the first time in}} franchise history, clinched first place in their division with five weeks still to play in the regular season (becoming only the third team in modern NFL history to do this) and won the NFC East by a record-tying seven-game margin in posting a 13-3 record, the franchise's best 16-game season ever.|$|E
25|$|In what was, at the time, the most-watched NFL {{regular season}} game since 1996, the Patriots faced the Cowboys, the NFC's only {{remaining}} unbeaten team. The Patriots' first drive {{of the game}} spanned 74yards and ended in a 6-yard touchdown catch by Moss from Brady. After three punts, the Patriots' lead increased to 14–0 after another Brady touchdown pass, this one from 35yards out to Welker. In the second quarter, the Cowboys got on the scoreboard when they culminated a 64-yard, 10-play drive with a 38-yard field goal by Nick Folk. On their ensuing possession, the Patriots advanced 12yards before Brady was strip-sacked by defensive end Greg Ellis; defensive end Jason Hatcher recovered the ball and returned it 29yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 14–10. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 72-yard drive that ended on a 12-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Welker, his second of the day. The Cowboys then moved the ball 84yards, keeping pace with the Patriots when Tony Romo threw to <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> for a 12-yard touchdown grab of his own, giving the game a 21–17 score at halftime.|$|E
25|$|The Bears {{returned}} home to play a Sunday night match with the Dallas Cowboys. The game was close early as the Bears' Robbie Gould and the Cowboys' Nick Folk each hit field goals {{to make it a}} 3–3 tie at halftime. The Cowboys took the opening drive of the third quarter and ended it with a Tony Romo to Jason Witten touchdown pass. The Bears responded on the ensuing drive with a Cedric Benson goal line plunge. The Cowboys struck again {{before the end of the}} third quarter, Romo connecting on his second touchdown pass, this time to running back Marion Barber. Folk converted a 44-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter, and on the next play from scrimmage, Bears quarterback Rex Grossman threw an interception to Cowboys cornerback Anthony Henry, who ran it back for the score. With the lead in hand, the Cowboys proceeded to kill the clock, which they did effectively with Barber, who capped the scoring with a one-yard touchdown run. Barber ended the night with over 100 yards rushing, and Cowboys wide receiver <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> caught eight passes for 145 yards. The Cowboys improved to 3–0, while the Bears dropped to 1–2.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Packers went 11–5 and met the San Francisco 49ers in the first-round of the NFC playoffs. It was {{the fourth}} {{consecutive}} year these teams had met in the playoffs, and the sixth overall contest since the 1995 season. The Packers had won all previous games, and the media speculated that another 49ers loss {{would result in the}} dismissal of San Francisco head coach Steve Mariucci. Unlike the previous playoff matches, this game was hotly contested, with the teams frequently exchanging leads. With 4:19 left in the 4th quarter, Brett Favre and the Packers embarked on an 89-yard drive, which concluded with a Favre touchdown pass to receiver Antonio Freeman. This play appeared to give Green Bay the victory. But San Francisco quarterback Steve Young led the 49ers on an improbable touchdown drive, which culminated when <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens</b> caught Young's pass between several defenders to give the 49ers a lead with three seconds remaining. Afterwards, the game was mired in controversy. Many argued that during the 49ers game-winning drive, Niners receiver Jerry Rice fumbled the ball but officials stated he was down by contact. Television replays appeared to confirm these sentiments, and the next season the NFL re instituted an instant replay system. In the end, this game {{turned out to be the}} end of an era in Green Bay. Days later Mike Holmgren left the Packers to become Vice President, General Manager and Head Coach of the Seattle Seahawks. Much of Holmgren's coaching staff went with him, and Reggie White also retired after the season (but later played one season for the Carolina Panthers in 2000).|$|E
25|$|McNabb's 2005 {{season began}} with turmoil and ended {{on the injured}} reserve list. While not {{speaking}} with his main target, <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens,</b> and all the distractions {{that came with the}} Owens controversy, McNabb was named the NFC's Player of the Month for September. That month, McNabb threw for 964 yards, eight touchdowns and only two interceptions in three games, leading the Eagles to a 2-1 record. McNabb carried that momentum into October as he went 33-for-48 (68.8 completion percentage), threw for 369 yards and three touchdowns en route to leading the Eagles to a memorable come-from-behind victory at an unfriendly Arrowhead Stadium against the Kansas City Chiefs. McNabb could not keep the momentum rolling, however, as the Eagles lost four straight games. Over that span, McNabb posted a quarterback rating higher than 72 only once, on November 6, at the Washington Redskins. After playing with a sports hernia and sore thumb, McNabb's season was finally over after a disastrous effort at home on November 14 on Monday night against the rival Dallas Cowboys. McNabb was intercepted by Roy Williams {{towards the end of the}} game, and tried to tackle the defender when Scott Shanle came in and tackled McNabb to the ground. McNabb had injured his groin on the play and was placed on the injured reserve list later that week. Mike McMahon replaced him at quarterback, and went 2–5 as a starter, with the Eagles finishing the season with a 6–10 record overall. Though low for his standards, McNabb put up respectable numbers in 2005. In nine games, he threw for 2,507 yards, 16 touchdowns and nine interceptions. To go along with that, he completed 59.1% (211-357) of his passes. Prior to his season-ending injury, McNabb was on pace to throw for 4,457 yards, which would have easily eclipsed his career high of 3,875, set in 2004.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the Eagles hired {{head coach}} Andy Reid and drafted quarterback Donovan McNabb. From 1999 until 2004, the team {{continually}} improved, going from 5–11 in 1999, {{returning to the}} playoffs in with an 11–5 record in 2000, surpassing the Buccaneers in the Wild Card round before losing in the divisional. Moreover, the Eagles played in four straight NFC Championship Games between 2001 and 2004. In 2001, the Eagles stayed at 11–5, beating the Buccaneers and Bears {{to advance to the}} NFC championship, where they lost to the St. Louis Rams. In 2002, the Eagles drafted running back Brian Westbrook, got the 1st round bye with the 2nd seed in the NFC with a 12–4 record, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers got their revenge in the Championship and eliminated the Eagles. In 2003, they won the NFC first seed, but Westbrook went down in Week 17, culminating in a loss to the Carolina Panthers in their 3rd straight NFC Championship. In 2004, the Philadelphia Eagles had their best season since 1960, going 13–1 before resting their starters and losing their next 2, clinching the 1st seed {{for the second year in}} a row. McNabb set career highs, completing 64% of his passes for 3,875 yards, though he didn't play all 16 games. McNabb became the first quarterback ever to throw more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season. His success could be attributed to the fact that he had a reliable receiver, <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens,</b> who got 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns in 14 games. After beating the Vikings and Falcons the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they dueled the New England Patriots. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14–14 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles and scored ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate. The Eagles have never appeared in a Super Bowl since, but this was their closest one at winning.|$|E
500|$|Even {{after winning}} the NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award for the 2005 season, a 2006 [...] Sports Illustrated poll of 361 NFL players named Urlacher the second most overrated {{player in the league}} behind <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens.</b> In response, Urlacher has stated [...] "Just watch the film. I don’t know what people are saying, but I’m not too worried about it anymore. All I can do is go out there and play hard and try and help my team win, and that's what I’m going to keep doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Streets had modest {{success as}} a {{professional}} in five seasons with the 49ers. [...] He began as a fourth wide receiver on a team with perennial Pro Bowl receivers Jerry Rice and <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens,</b> but he eventually became a starter {{before moving on to}} play his final season with the Lions. [...] His career was highlighted by playoff performances in which he caught at least four receptions for at least 50 yards in all three playoff games. [...] He recorded two fourth quarter playoff touchdowns one of which was the game-winner in a 24-point comeback victory and the other of which was a game-tying touchdown in a losing effort.|$|E
500|$|The San Francisco 49ers, who had Jerry Rice, <b>Terrell</b> <b>Owens,</b> and J. J. Stokes, did {{not need}} a wide {{receiver}} right away and gambled on the projected 2nd-round selection with their sixth round pick. [...] Head coach Steve Mariucci said that the team had evaluated his prospect as an injured athlete and had determined {{him to be a}} good selection for later rounds despite his injury. Streets was the only 1999 draftee not to sign in July when the other draftees signed, but he signed just {{before the end of the}} month. [...] Just before the season started, Streets was placed on the reserve non-football injury list in order to make roster space for Na'il Benjamin and Damon Griffin. [...] Streets was activated onto the 53-man roster prior to week 13 of the season to replace the injured R. W. McQuarters. He activated for the gameday roster three weeks later for the final two games. In his second game, he caught his first two NFL receptions on the Monday Night Football season finale.|$|E
