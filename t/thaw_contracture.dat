40|$|The resting {{anterior}} byssal retractor muscle of Mytilus edulis (ABRM) contains 1 - 1. 2 μmol ATP and 0. 6 - 0. 8 μmol ADP per g wet weight, {{traces of}} AMP and 0. 1 - 0. 2 μmol GTP plus UTP. The ATP {{content and the}} ratio of ADP : ATP remains almost constant during contraction, catch and subsequent serotonin induced relaxation, IMP could not be detected, not even during <b>thaw</b> <b>contracture.</b> Consequently the catch (viscous tone, fused state) is a reversible rigor distinct from rigor in vertebrate skeletal muscle which is caused by ATP deficiency. ATP produces a very much stronger contraction in isolated actomyosin systems of ABRM than UTP, ITP and GTP...|$|E
