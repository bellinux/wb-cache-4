5|$|In mid-1967, New York City mayor John Lindsay {{sought to}} develop closer ties {{with leaders of}} impoverished neighborhoods. Prompted in part by {{concerns}} voiced by the New York Police Department (NYPD), the mayor dispatched one of his aides, Barry Gottehrer, to meet with Clarence13X. Belying his fearsome reputation, Clarence13X had a congenial meeting with Gottehrer, during which he requested more bus routes and school funding. Clarence13X subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence. The city provided buses for Five Percenters to travel to a Long Island park, and {{with help from the}} National Urban League, obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school. It became known as the Allah School in Mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools. Tensions soon formed between the Five Percenters and the school's overseers; Clarence13X desired more control over <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> <b>and</b> had difficulty finding qualified teachers. Police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized. In 1975, Gottehrer chronicled his friendship with Clarence13X in The Mayor's Man. The book was well received by some Five Percenters, who republished portions of it after it went out of print. They have not reprinted the entire book, owing to a passage in which Gottehrer relates that Clarence13X offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter.|$|E

5|$|The {{school was}} {{remarkable}} for its time in several respects. It did not discriminate against pupils {{on the grounds}} of religious persuasion (at a time when most public schools had an Anglican emphasis); it included pupils from non-conformist and Jewish families. Also, unlike other established independent schools, it was a day school (although there were in early days a handful of boarders, no boarding department ever became established). It also promoted a practical and progressive scheme of education which was well ahead of its time. It was the first school in England to include science on <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> <b>and</b> to include scientific experiments as part of its teaching. It also offered education in commercial subjects. This did not, however, diminish the excellence of its teaching in the subjects traditionally favoured by independent schools, and it sent classical and mathematical scholars to Oxford and Cambridge throughout the nineteenth century. These included the classicist, theologian and Shakespearean scholar Edwin Abbott Abbott (whose mathematical exploration of a world in other than three dimensions, Flatland, is still in print and who returned to the school as headmaster) and H. H. Asquith, who though educated as a classical scholar {{went on to become the}} British Prime Minister.|$|E
