40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{costs associated}} to hospital treatment of urinary lithiasis in the Brazilian public health {{system as well}} as to evaluate demographic and epidemiological data referred to <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> in the Brazilian public health system (or unified health care system). Methods: Data from the Informatic Department of Brazilian public health system were obtained as referred to costs in <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for urinary lithiasis during 2010 and also epidemiological data from 1996 through 2010. Results: There were 69, 039 <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for urinary lithiasis, totaling 0. 61 % of all <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> in the Brazilian public health system. The mean cost of each of these <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> was US$ 240, 23 or R$ 423. 42 having as result an overall cost of US$ 16, 240, 378. 00 or R$ 29. 232. 682, 56. <b>Hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for urinary lithiasis in the Brazilian public health system increased 69 % from 1996 to 2010 (43, 176 versus 69, 309; p < 0. 001; OR = 1. 69).

MethodBetween 1974 and 1992, 22044 middle-aged individuals participated in a health screening, which included spirometry (without broncho-dilation), as well as recording of respiratory symptoms and smoking habits. Information on <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> until 31 December 2002 was obtained from local and national registers. The <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> rates due to all causes, obstructive lung disease and cardiovascular disease were analysed among individuals with symptoms of chronic bronchitis and among those with airflow limitation corresponding to GOLD stages 1 – 4 using ordinal regression with adjustment for age and with individuals with normal lung function and without symptoms of chronic bronchitis as reference group. ResultsSymptoms of chronic bronchitis and GOLD stages 1 – 4 showed increased <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> rates (<b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> rates due to obstructive lung disease excluded) among smokers of both genders. Furthermore, symptoms of chronic bronchitis showed increased <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> rates due to obstructive lung disease among smoking women.

To provide more information on the economic burden of preventable adverse drug events of outpatients, we performed a cost study on the data collected in the <b>Hospital</b> <b>Admissions</b> Related to Medication (HARM) study. In this study we examined the frequency, preventability, and risk factors for <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> related to medication. MethodsThe average costs for a preventable medication-related <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> were calculated by summing the direct medical costs and the production losses of all the preventable admissions, taking into account the different types of hospitals (academic and general) and the age of the admitted patients.

The findings suggest that bushfire smoke was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of respiratory <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> in Brisbane (p 50. 05). The health impact assessment needs to be considered in the control and management of bushfires...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Previous {{systematic}} reviews {{have found}} that drug-related morbidity accounts for 4. 3 % of preventable <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions.</b> None, however, has identified the drugs most commonly responsible for preventable <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions.</b> The aims {{of this study were}} to estimate the percentage of preventable drug-related <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions,</b> the most common drug causes of preventable <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> and the most common underlying causes of preventable drug-related admissions. Methods: Bibliographic databases and reference lists from eligible articles and study authors were the sources for data. Seventeen prospective observational studies reporting the proportion of preventable drug-related <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions,</b> causative drugs and/or the underlying causes of <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> were selected. Included studies used multiple reviewers and/or explicit criteria to assess causality and preventability of <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions.</b> Two investigators abstracted data from all included studies using a purpose-made data extraction form. Results: From 13 papers the median percentage of preventable drug-related <b>admissions</b> to <b>hospital</b> was 3. 7 % (range 1. 4 - 15. 4). From nine papers the majority (51 %) of preventable drug-related admissions involved either antiplatelets (16 %), diuretics (16 %), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (11 %) or anticoagulants (8 %). From five studies the median proportion of preventable drug-related admissions associated with prescribing problems was 30. 6 % (range 11. 1 - 41. 8), with adherence problems 33. 3 % (range 20. 9 - 41. 7) and with monitoring problems 22. 2 % (range 0 - 31. 3). Conclusions: Four groups of drugs account for more than 50 % of the drug groups associated with preventable drug-related <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions.</b> Concentrating interventions on these drug groups could reduce appreciably the number of preventable drug-related <b>admissions</b> to <b>hospital</b> from primary care...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} daily urban air pollution and acute effects on respiratory health. STUDY DESIGN: Time series analysis following the procedure defined in the APHEA protocol. SETTING: City of Milan, Italy, from 1980 - 89. Two air pollutants, total suspended particulates (TSP) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2), and two health outcomes, deaths and <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> were considered. The last was analysed according to two age groups. SUBJECTS: Daily deaths and general <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for respiratory causes in residents who died in Milan or were admitted to local hospitals in that city. MAIN RESULTS: There was {{an increased risk of}} respiratory death and of <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> associated with increased concentrations of SO 2 and TSP. The relative risks were similar for both pollutants, and were higher for respiratory deaths than for <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions.</b> No changes in relation to season were seen in the SO 2 effect on respiratory deaths, but there was a suggestion of a higher effect on <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> in the cool months. The seasonal pattern of the TSP effect was inconsistent: for mortality it was higher in the warm period while for <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> it seemed to be higher in the cool months. This last result might be due to chance, although some role could have been played by the <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> data on all general admissions for respiratory causes (ICD- 9 : 460 - 519) as these are a much less specific end point. CONCLUSION: In Milan, a positive association was found between the daily SO 2 or TSP concentrations and the number of deaths or <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for respiratory causes. This confirms results from other European and North American cities...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Numerous {{epidemiological}} {{studies have reported}} effects of air pollution on the prevalence of respiratory diseases in children. Association between air pollution and <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for respiratory diseases among children has not been investigated in our country yet. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine impact of ordinary air pollutants (sulfur dioxide and black smoke) in concentrations regularly reported during monitoring on <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for respiratory diseases among children. Methods. We compared daily data of sulphur dioxide and black smoke concentrations in air with data of daily <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for respiratory diseases in children 0 - 14 years of age in two periods (1992 - 1995 and 2002 - 2005) in Niš, Serbia. Results. There were totally 4 283 and 3 842 <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for respiratory diseases in children in the first (1992 - 1995), and the second (2002 - 2005) period observed, respectively. The highest number of <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> was registered in children aged 0 - 4 years, and the lowest one in children aged 10 - 14 years. Statistically significant influence of pollutants on the number of <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for respiratory diseases was observed in the period 1992 - 1995 in children aged 0 - 4 years. Overall, a 10 μg/m 3 increase in black smoke concentration was associated with a 3. 95 % (95 % CI 1. 29 - 6. 67 %) increase in the rate of <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> for respiratory diseases after three days, 4. 50 % (1. 77 - 7. 30 %) after four days and 7. 15 % (1. 21 - 13. 44 %) after seven days. A 10 μg/m 3 increase in sulphur dioxide concentration was associated with a 1. 29 % (0. 03 - 2. 56 %) increases in the rate of <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> for respiratory illness after three days. Influence of air pollution on the number of <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> in older groups of children, as well as in the period 2002 - 2005 was not statistically significant. Conclusion. Our study suggested that air pollution concentration measured during regular monitoring, out of episodes of pollution, appear to be risk for <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for respiratory diseases in children age 0 - 4 years...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Adverse drug events (ADEs) {{can cause}} serious harm to {{patients}} {{and can lead to}} hospitalization or even death. ADEs are a burden not only {{to patients and}} their relatives, but also to society and have the potential to involve high costs. To provide more information on the economic burden of preventable adverse drug events of outpatients, we performed a cost study on the data collected in the <b>Hospital</b> <b>Admissions</b> Related to Medication (HARM) study. In this study we examined the frequency, preventability, and risk factors for <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> related to medication. Methods: The average costs for a preventable medication-related <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> were calculated by summing the direct medical costs and the production losses of all the preventable admissions, taking into account the different types of hospitals (academic and general) and the age of the admitted patients. Results: The average medical costs for one preventable medication-related <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> were (sic) 5461. The average production loss costs for one admission were (sic) 1712 for a person younger than 65 years of age. Combining the medical costs and the costs of production losses resulted in average costs of (sic) 6009 for one, potentially preventable, medication-related <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> for all ages. Conclusions: The costs of potentially preventable <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> related to medication are considerable. Therefore, patient safety interventions to prevent ADEs and <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> may be cost-effective or even cost saving.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Racial disparities exist across {{most major}} disease categories, which {{result in a}} disproportionately large number of <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> for many conditions. Estimates for the {{financial}} impact of the racial admission differences for the State of South Carolina are assessed. METHODS: South Carolina hospital discharge data for 1998 - 2002 {{was used for the}} analysis. The database includes all-payer billing data for inpatient <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> as received on the UB- 92 billing file for the covered episode. Charges were inflation adjusted to 2002 constant dollars. RESULTS: For 1998 - 2002, there were an estimated dollar 1. 6 billion in total charges for <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> in South Carolina that were attributed to higher age-adjusted admission rates for African-American patients. In addition, African Americans had consistently higher <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> rates for disease categories that are often associated with a failure to obtain ambulatory and preventive care. CONCLUSION: This simple analysis reveals that age-adjusted <b>hospital</b> <b>admission</b> rates for African Americans in South Carolina are higher than for Caucasians, and the gap appears to be widening over time. Given the magnitude of the financial implication, interventions with even a small impact on the conditions underlying the racial disparities in <b>hospital</b> <b>admissions</b> are likely to be cost effective...|$|R
