40|$|Currently {{available}} motorcycle helmet standards employ headforms {{to assess}} <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>absorption</b> capability of helmets. The mass {{and size of}} the headforms {{are similar to those of}} the human head. This fact implies that the standards rely on the assumption that the effect of the rest of the body on the performance of <b>the</b> helmet during <b>impact</b> is negligible. In this study, by using validated finite element (FE) models of a commercially available helmet and of the human body, full-body helmet impacts are simulated. Even within the short duration of <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> (less than 10 ms), the body interacts with the head, leading to further crushing of the helmet liner. To include this effect in <b>the</b> headform <b>impacts,</b> <b>the</b> mass of the headform is increased. The added mass is determined for various impact configurations. It is found that the added mass is not dependent on the properties of the helmet; thus, it can be adopted by <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>absorption</b> test of standards...|$|R

Hybridization of two different actuators (pneumatic elastic actuators with the features of lightness and intrinsic visco-elasticity, and servo motors that have stable torque and a large range of motion in combination with an antagonistic mechanism) was employed to achieve the development of the shoulder prosthesis. A two-link, two-degree-of-freedom arm was used to test the different hybridization configurations in order to investigate <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>absorption.</b> A dynamic simulation platform based on four bimanual activities of daily living was established to obtain the required range of motion and torque for joints of a two-link, four-degree-of-freedom arm.

40|$|In {{most common}} {{bilateral}} landings of vertical jumps, {{there are two}} peak forces (F 1 and F 2) in the force-time curve.

Thirty semi-professional football players made five countermovement jumps and the highest jump of each player was analyzed. They were instructed to perform the jumps with maximum effort and to land first with the balls of their feet and then with their heels. All the data were collected using a Kistler Quattro Jump force plate with a sample rate of 500 Hz. Quattro Jump Software, v. 1. 0. 9. 0., was used. There was neither significant correlation between T 1 and F 1 nor between T 1 and F 2. There was a significant positive correlation between flight height (FH) and F 1 (r = 0. 584, p = 0. 01) but no significant correlation between FH and F 2.

Furthermore, it is difficult for small residual stumps to provide sufficient <b>impact</b> <b>absorption</b> for safe manipulation in daily living, as intact arms do. Therefore, substitution of upper limb function in transhumeral amputees requires a sufficient range of motion and sufficient viscoelasticity for shoulder prostheses under critical weight and dimension constraints. We propose the use of two different types of actuators, ie, pneumatic elastic actuators (PEAs) and servo motors. PEAs offer high power-to-weight performance and have intrinsic viscoelasticity in comparison with motors or standard industrial pneumatic cylinder actuators. However, the usefulness of PEAs in large working spaces is limited because of their short strokes. Servo motors, in contrast, can be used to achieve large ranges of motion.

It has been shown that the use of ankle brace is effective to prevent these injuries by increasing the mechanical stability of the ankle at the initial contact of the foot with the ground. Objective: To investigate the effects of ankle brace on the ground reaction force (GRF) during the simulation of a basketball rebound jump. Method: Eleven young male basketball players randomly carried out a simulated basketball rebound jump under two conditions, with and without ankle brace (lace-up). Dynamic parameters of vertical GRF (take-off and landing vertical peaks, time to take-off and landing vertical peaks, take-off impulse peak, impulse at 50 milliseconds of landing, and jump height) and medial-lateral (take-off and landing medial-lateral peaks, and time to reach medial-lateral peaks at take-off and landing) were recorded by force platform during rebound jumps in each tested condition. The comparisons between the tested conditions were performed by paired t test (P 0. 05). Conclusion: The use of ankle brace during basketball rebound jumps attenuates the magnitude of medial-lateral GRF on the landing phase, without changing the vertical GRF.

Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) material has become widely accepted as a mouthguard material; however, many studies indicate the necessity of improving <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>absorption</b> ability by considering the design and developing new materials. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the shock-absorbing ability of a novel dual component material comprising EVA and porous rubber with that of EVA alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups of samples were tested: Group 1  = EVA (thickness, 4  mm), Group 2  = type 1 material (2 -mm thick porous rubber sheet sandwiched between two sheets of 1 -mm thick EVA sheets), and Group 3  = type 2 material (1 -mm thick porous rubber sheet sandwiched between EVA sheets with 1 and 2 -mm thickness, respectively). Shock absorption was determined by means of a hammer impact testing device equipped with strain gauge, accelerator, and load cell.

The strong field intensities of these modes could significantly enhance desired nonlinear optical responses in fiber, provided <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of <b>absorption</b> is addressed. © 2014 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (060. 3735) Fiber Bragg gratings; (190. 1450) Bistability; (190. 4870) Photothermal effects...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} we {{demonstrate}} how Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) {{can be employed}} to solve <b>the</b> Adaptive <b>Impact</b> <b>Absorption</b> (AIA) problem. We consider a truss structure which is subjected to impact loads. Stiff bars can be replaced by elastoplastic fuses which control theirs dynamical response. The point of optimization is to maximize or minimize a given objective function by redesigning the structure. This is realized by redistributing the initial mass, finding proper fuse localizations and adjusting, in real-time, the elastoplastic limits. Comparing to the previous results, we show that PSO is capable of achieving results at least as good as gradient-based optimization, having {{at the same time}} much larger flexibility regarding the definition of the objective function. This gives significantly broader field of potential applications. In particular, we present how PSO can be used to solve the simultaneous optimization problem: mass redistribution and fuse positioning for a set of expected, various impacts...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Rapid Prototyping Journal and the definitive published version is available at [URL] - This paper aims to investigate whether the trabecular architecture found in natural bone can be effectively replicated through the selective laser sintering process of Nylon P 2200. Design/methodology/approach - Trabecular bone was idealised into a scaled up hexagonal cell proven to replicate the natural structure. The structure was modelled in Solidworks 2013 to form a network of interlinking cells. The specific property analysed was the structure toughness through the measurement of the energy absorbed before sample fracture. Findings - It was found that <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>absorption</b> can be increased with the integration of {{a greater number of}} trabecular cells producing a finer resolution and not necessarily by increasing the trabecular size. The information gained from this research may be useful in <b>the</b> design of <b>impact</b> and shock absorbing components, with an emphasis on efficient use of material mass. Research limitations/implications - Designers and engineers may find biomimetic methods of absorbing shock and impact an efficient alternative consideration in design applications. Practical implications - The trabecular architecture should be designed so as to be weaker than the bounding surfaces, ensuring that the individual trabecular experience failure first, maximising their energy absorbing capability through increasing the period of deceleration. The simplest way of doing this is to ensure the rod thickness is less than the bounding material thickness. Originality/value - This work documents original testing of both the RP material and consolidated design of samples of idealised bone structures. It builds on previous work in the area and through the results of empirical testing, derives recommendations for further considerations in this area of design and manufacture of biomimetic structures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Thin-walled {{structures}} {{have been}} widely used in various structural applications asimpact energy absorbing devices. During an impact situation, thin-walled tubesdemonstrate excellent capability in absorbing greater energy through plastic deformation. In this paper, a review of thin-walled tubes as collapsible energy absorbers is presented. As a mean of improving <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> energy <b>absorption</b> of thin-walled tubes, the influence of geometrical parameters such as length, diameter and wall thickness on the response of thin-walled tubes under compression axial loading are briefly discussed. Several design improvements proposed by previous researchers are also presented. The scope of this review is mainly focus on axial deformation under quasi-static and dynamic compressive loading. Other deformations, such as lateral indentation, inversion and splitting are considered {{beyond the scope of this}} paper. This review is intended to assist the future development of thin-walled tubes as efficient energy absorbing elements...|$|R
