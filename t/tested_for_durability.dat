The building and heritage conservation industries {{are in need of}} an environmentally friendly wood-based product whose service life meets the expectations of its users. The wood preservative industry aims to mitigate this gap in the present-day wood industry by minimizing wood’s vulnerability to the consumptive natural environment.

The future of wooden heritage conservation is dependent upon ecologically sensitive preservative systems that incorporate sustainable forestry practice and species.

30|$|A {{total of}} 27 and 9 {{specimens}} from LMWP-resin-treated and untreated lamina, respectively, with dimensions of 27  mm thick, 120  mm wide and 500  mm long were prepared.

After they were planed, additional surface planing of the LMWP-resin-treated lamina to thicknesses of 0, 2 and 4  mm was conducted to investigate the effect of surface removal on the bonding quality of LMWP-resin-treated lamina. Finally, one group of untreated lamina specimens with a thickness of 26  mm and three groups of LMWP-resin-treated lamina specimens with thicknesses of 26, 22 and 18  mm were used for a bonding quality test. A spread rate of 300  g/m 2 was applied to one surface of the specimen. Three 3 -ply assemblies made from each group of lamina specimen were bonded using resorcinol-phenol formaldehyde resin adhesive (Dianol D- 40) provided by Oshika Shinko Co., Ltd. Viscosity, non-volatile content and specific gravity of the adhesive were 0.30  Pa s, 58.9  % and 1.14, respectively. The assemblies were then pressed in a cold press at 980  kPa for 24  h. The bonding quality test consisted of a shear bond strength test and a <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>durability</b> of the bonded interface. These tests were conducted according to the Japanese Agriculture Standard for Structural Glulam [10]. A total of 16 shear block specimens with a shear plane area of 25  ×  25  mm were prepared from the assembly made from each group of lamina for the shear bond strength test. A load was applied at a speed of 1  mm/min using the universal testing machine, and the maximum load and wood failure percentage were recorded. The <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>durability</b> of the bonded interface was conducted using the delamination test. The 3 -ply assembly was cross-sectionally cut to a length of 75  mm <b>for</b> the delamination <b>test.</b> The delamination test {{took the form of}} two types of test, which were a cyclic-boiling and a cyclic-dipping test. A total of eight specimens were prepared from the assembly made from each group of lamina for both cyclic-boiling and cyclic-dipping test. The method used <b>for</b> the cyclic-boiling <b>test</b> has two cycles.

After that the specimen was dried at a temperature of 70  °C until its weight reached 100 – 110  % of its initial weight. The ratio of delamination to bonded interface length was then calculated. Like the cyclic-boiling test, the cyclic-dipping test also has two cycles. In each cycle, the specimen was immersed in water at a temperature of 25  °C for 24  h. After that the specimen was dried at a temperature of 70  °C until the weight of the specimen reached 100 – 110  % of its initial weight.
