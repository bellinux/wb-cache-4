Objectives: This study was performed to identify the additional <b>tests</b> needed <b>for</b> LREs. Methods: First, a literature review {{of the development of}} ISO test standards, wheelchair standards testing studies and wheelchair evaluations in LREs was performed.

After they were planed, additional surface planing of the LMWP-resin-treated lamina to thicknesses of 0, 2 and 4 Â mm was conducted to investigate the effect of surface removal on the bonding quality of LMWP-resin-treated lamina. Finally, one group of untreated lamina specimens with a thickness of 26 Â mm and three groups of LMWP-resin-treated lamina specimens with thicknesses of 26, 22 and 18 Â mm were used for a bonding quality test. A spread rate of 300 Â g/m 2 was applied to one surface of the specimen. Three 3 -ply assemblies made from each group of lamina specimen were bonded using resorcinol-phenol formaldehyde resin adhesive (Dianol D- 40) provided by Oshika Shinko Co., Ltd. Viscosity, non-volatile content and specific gravity of the adhesive were 0.30 Â PaÂ s, 58.9 Â % and 1.14, respectively. The assemblies were then pressed in a cold press at 980 Â kPa for 24 Â h. The bonding quality test consisted of a shear bond strength test and a <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>durability</b> of the bonded interface.

A total of 16 shear block specimens with a shear plane area of 25 Â Ã—Â  25 Â mm were prepared from the assembly made from each group of lamina for the shear bond strength test. A load was applied at a speed of 1 Â mm/min using the universal testing machine, and the maximum load and wood failure percentage were recorded. The <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>durability</b> of the bonded interface was conducted using the delamination test. The 3 -ply assembly was cross-sectionally cut to a length of 75 Â mm <b>for</b> the delamination <b>test.</b> The delamination test {{took the form of}} two types of test, which were a cyclic-boiling and a cyclic-dipping test. A total of eight specimens were prepared from the assembly made from each group of lamina for both cyclic-boiling and cyclic-dipping test. The method used <b>for</b> the cyclic-boiling <b>test</b> has two cycles.

After that the specimen was dried at a temperature of 70 Â Â°C until its weight reached 100 â€“ 110 Â % of its initial weight. The ratio of delamination to bonded interface length was then calculated. Like the cyclic-boiling test, the cyclic-dipping test also has two cycles. In each cycle, the specimen was immersed in water at a temperature of 25 Â Â°C for 24 Â h. After that the specimen was dried at a temperature of 70 Â Â°C until the weight of the specimen reached 100 â€“ 110 Â % of its initial weight.
