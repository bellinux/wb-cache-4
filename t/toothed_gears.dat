2500|$|Amongst {{the various}} {{contemporary}} agricultural practices {{mentioned in the}} Nong Shu, Wang listed and described the use of ploughing, sowing, irrigation, cultivation of mulberries, etc. It listed and described many of the various foodstuffs and products of the many regions of China. The book outlined the use of not only agricultural tools, but food-processing, irrigation equipment, different types of fields, ceremonial vessels, various types of grain storage, carts, boats, mechanical devices, and textile machinery used in many applications. [...] For example, {{one of the many}} devices described and illustrated in drawing is a large mechanical milling plant operated by the motive power of oxen, with an enormous rotating geared wheel engaging the <b>toothed</b> <b>gears</b> of eight different mills surrounding it. Of great interest to sinologist historians, Wang also outlined the difference between the agricultural technology of Northern China and that of Southern China. The main characteristic of agricultural technology of the north was technical applications fit for predominantly dryland cultivation, while intensified irrigation cultivation was more suitable for southern China. Furthermore, Wang used his treatise as a means to spread knowledge in support of certain agricultural practices or technologies found exclusively in either South or North that could benefit the other, if only they were more widely known, such as the southern hand-harrow used for weeding in the south, yet virtually unknown in the north.|$|E

50|$|For heavier cables {{that are}} used for {{electric}} light and power as well as submarine cables, the machines are somewhat different in construction. The wire is still carried through a hollow shaft, but the bobbins or spools of covering material are set with their spindles {{at right angles to}} the axis of the wire, and they lie in a circular cage which rotates on rollers below. The various strands coming from the spools at various parts of the circumference of the cage all lead to a disk {{at the end of the}} hollow shaft. This disk has perforations through which each of the strands pass, thence being immediately wrapped on the cable, which slides through a bearing at this point. <b>Toothed</b> <b>gears</b> having certain definite ratios are used to cause the winding drum for the cable and the cage for the spools to rotate at suitable relative speeds which do not vary. The cages are multiplied for stranding with a large number of tapes or strands, so that a machine may have six bobbins on one cage and twelve on the other.|$|E

They are applied as stationary devices in drive systems of road vehicles, ships and crafts {{as well as}} airplanes and helicopters. One of the problems related to the <b>toothed</b> <b>gears</b> usage is the determination of their technical state or its evolutions. Assuming that the gear slippage velocity is attributed to vibrations and noises generated by cooperating toothed wheels, {{the application of a}} simple cooperation model of rolled wheels of skew teeth is proposed for the analysis of the mesh evolution influence on the gear dynamics. In addition, an example of utilising an ordinary coherence function for investigating evolutionary mesh changes related to the effects impossible to be described by means of the simple kinematic model is presented...|$|E

The wrench is introduced inside the pipe (especially a close nipple, which has threading its entire length, and therefore no surface for an outside wrench).

As with a regular pipe wrench, the mechanism is such that the grip on the pipe increases with the torque applied on the wrench.|$|R
40|$|TheÂ known {{attempts}} {{to create a}} continuously-adjustable gear train withÂ solidÂ gears have led to development of some so-called adaptive gears. The most structurally simple version of continuously- adjustable gear train is a two-wheel planetary gear. It is an obvious fact that an active regulation of gear ratio for the gear {{should be based on}} the presence of con- trolled elements (parameters) and a mechanism for their control. In respect of the mentioned gear one of the controlledÂ elements that isÂ a compound central <b>toothed</b> <b>gear</b> has such controlled parameter as a nominal pitch diameter. In this case it can rotate or remain motionless. Other controlled element which is a planetary carrier has its own radius as a controlled parameter and makes a rotary motion with a great speed of a leading element. The purpose of theÂ controlÂ mechanism is to ensure radial displacement of central <b>toothed</b> <b>gear</b> and planet gear sectors in the working gear. The paper describes the mechanism modifications and considers two variants for transfer of control action from its source to an object to be controlled. The transfer is ensured by mechanical gears (two variants) and hydraulics. </p...|$|R
