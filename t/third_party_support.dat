5|$|From 1993 to 1996, Apple {{developed}} a marketing strategy that promised free and unlimited live-telephone support on certain products {{for as long}} as the original purchaser owned those products; by 1997, however, changes in Apple's AppleCare support policy led Apple to rescind the offer, resulting in a consumer class action lawsuit for breach of contract. Apple denied wrongdoing but, in settlement of the claims, Apple ultimately reinstated the telephone support for the duration of original ownership of the otherwise obsolete products and customers affected by the change were given a limited reimbursement if they had been refused telephone support, had been charged per incident, or had incurred <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>support</b> charges.|$|E
25|$|On January 26, 2006 Sony {{announced}} that it would discontinue AIBO and several other products {{in an effort to make}} the company profitable. It also stopped development of the related QRIO robot. Sony's AIBO customer support was withdrawn gradually, with support for the final ERS-7M3 ending in March 2013. Some <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>support</b> is available, such as repair and battery refurbishment.|$|E
25|$|Nintendo {{initially}} showcased {{three games}} for the Virtual Boy. It planned to release three titles at launch, {{and two or three}} per month thereafter. Given the system's short lifespan, only 22 games were released. Of them, 19 games were released in the Japanese market, while 14 were released in North America. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> <b>support</b> was extremely limited compared to previous Nintendo platforms. According to Gunpei Yokoi, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi had dictated that only a select few third party developers be shown the Virtual Boy hardware prior to its formal unveiling, in order to limit the risk of poor-quality software appearing on the system.|$|E

500|$|Ken Horowitz of Sega-16 {{took note}} of Sega's {{reluctance}} to commit to releasing the service in North America {{as part of the}} reason for its lack of titles, noting, [...] "Companies were most likely waiting for confirmation of the modem’s release before they began to commit themselves, and as time has attested, few were waiting to go ahead with development in light of Sega's 'wait and see' attitude." [...] Horowitz went on to criticize this issue as a problem Sega would have again with the Sega 32X in 1994, stating, [...] "History would repeat itself in the harshest of manners only five years later. Sega's expectations of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>support</b> for something it showed little enthusiasm for were entirely unrealistic and ultimately meant that no games would be in the pipeline." ...|$|E
500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>support</b> and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E

We were inserting ourselves in the world, at least in workshops with different relevant actors, a microcosmos as it were, to help participants to anticipate and decide through better understanding of ongoing dynamics and insight into the repercussions of possible actions.|$|R

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new {{theoretical}} framework {{to explain the}} role of third-party facilitators in interest-based negotiation, and applies the framework in a qualitative case study of a collective bargaining process at an aluminium smelter in Australia. The theoretical framework describes the activities of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> {{in terms of the}} objectives they seek to meet to support bargaining, and the consulting approach they deploy to do so. The case study demonstrates that <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> undertake a range of distinct activities to facilitate bargaining between management and unions, dominated by, although not limited to, a 'process' approach to consulting. Moreover, <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> <b>support</b> the development of three types of relationship: their own with the individual parties, as well as relationships between the parties and within each party. While the framework needs confirmation in future research, the article offers rare insights into how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> participate in interest-based negotiation...|$|R

Whereas Sega and Nintendo took an isolationist approach, focusing on first party development while generally leaving <b>third</b> <b>party</b> developers to their own devices, Sony took efforts to streamline game production by providing a range of programming libraries which were constantly updated online, organising <b>third</b> <b>party</b> technical <b>support</b> teams, {{and in some cases}} giving direct development <b>support</b> to <b>third</b> <b>party</b> companies.|$|R

40|$|International audienceOften, {{when several}} norms are present {{and may be}} in conflict, {{individuals}} will display a self-serving bias, privileging the norm that best serves their interests. Xiao and Bicchieri (J Econ Psychol 31 (3) : 456 - 470, 2010) tested the effects of inequality on reciprocating behavior in trust games and showed that-when inequality increases-reciprocity loses its appeal. They hypothesized that self-serving biases in choosing to privilege a particular social norm occur when the choice of that norm is publicly justifiable as reasonable, even if not optimal {{for one of the}} parties. In line with the literature on motivated reasoning, this justification should find some degree of <b>support</b> among <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> The results of our experimental survey of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> <b>support</b> the hypothesis that biases are not always unilateral selfish assessments.
