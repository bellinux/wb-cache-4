As Fassl holds {{up a piece of}} paper to show it to the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. He looks up and sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer.|$|E

He was separated from his family for a total of four years, three months and six days, during which time the Shawn Hornbeck Foundation and Search and Rescue Team were established. Both boys were reunited with their families after their discovery.|$|E
500|$|Alistair Brownlee and Jonathan Brownlee were {{considered}} strong favourites before the race. The 2000 men's Olympic triathlon champion, Canadian Simon Whitfield, said that, [...] "If you run this Olympic race ten times, {{one of the}} Brownlee brothers will win {{nine out of ten}} times. But they won’t win it that 10th time, and you try to be that person <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> capitalise on it that 10th time.” Among other contenders were Javier Gómez of Spain, who was the ITU Triathlon World Champion in both the 2008 World Championships and the 2010 World Championships; New Zealander Bevan Docherty; Whitfield of Canada and the 2008 Olympic champion Jan Frodeno from Germany.|$|E
500|$|In 1952, King George VI died, {{the third}} of Queen Mary's {{children}} to predecease her; her eldest granddaughter, Princess Elizabeth, ascended the throne as Queen Elizabeth II. The death of a third child profoundly affected her. Mary remarked to Princess Marie Louise: [...] "I have lost three sons through death, but I have never been privileged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> say a last farewell to them." [...] Mary died the next year on 24 March 1953 {{at the age of}} 85, only ten weeks before her granddaughter's coronation. Mary let it be known that, in the event of her death, the coronation was not to be postponed. Her remains lay in state at Westminster Hall, where large numbers of mourners filed past her coffin. She is buried beside her husband in the nave of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.|$|E

500|$|From 1940 to 1946, the Bears {{displayed}} their {{dominance in}} the game, playing in five NFL championship games, winning four, and posted a 54–17–3 regular season record. In 1942, the Bears posted a perfect 11–0record and outscored their opponents, 376–84, however they lost the championship game to the Redskins. Although the T-formation had been used many years before Luckman joined the Chicago Bears, he was central to Chicago's successful use of this style of play because of his game-sense and versatility. Perfecting Halas' complex offensive scheme of fakes, men in motion, and quick hitting runs, Luckman added the dimension of accurate downfield throwing. He was instrumental in his team's record-setting 73–0 win over the Washington Redskins in the 1940 NFL championship game. Sportscaster Jimmy Cannon once said in reference to Luckman's years at Columbia, [...] "You had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> realize how great Sid was." [...] Luckman later became a sought-after tutor and instructor for universities wishing to install the T-formation as an offense.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} the [...] "Great War", {{both the}} GTA and the PVE attempt to focus on the {{rebuilding}} of their systems and dealing with the remnants of the Shivan forces, although the alliance between them is in a fragile state. In order to ensure the alliance does not collapse, GTA command assigns the GTI to the task of preserving it, while assisting in protecting valuable research projects and dealing with the remaining Shivan forces. During engagements, a science vessel that had been recorded as being officially destroyed during the war with the Shivans, the GTSC Einstein, turns up during an operation to protect Vasudan craft. Although the crew escape before the vessel is destroyed, suspicions surrounding the science vessel's appearance are aroused, when recovery of the ship's escapes pods is compounded by confusion in communications and two of the GTI's ships, the GTD Krios and the GTD Repulse, arriving and claiming <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> recover the pods, the latter later proving they were assigned the responsibility.|$|E
500|$|Initially {{only the}} Public Ledger {{reported}} on the case, but once it became known that noblemen had taken an interest and visited the ghost at Mr Bray's house on 14January, the story {{began to appear in}} other newspapers. [...] The St. James's Chronicle and the London Chronicle printed reports from 16–19 January (the latter the more sceptical of the two), and Lloyd's Evening Post from 18–20 January. [...] The story spread across London and by the middle of January the crowds gathered outside the property were such that Cock Lane was rendered impassable. [...] Parsons charged visitors an entrance fee to [...] "talk" [...] with the ghost, which, it was reported, did not disappoint. [...] After receiving several requests to intercede, Samuel Fludyer, Lord Mayor of London, was on 23January approached by Alderman Gosling, John Moore and Parsons. [...] They told him of their experiences but Fludyer was reminded of the then recent case of fraudster Elizabeth Canning and refused to have Kent or Parsons arrested (on charges of murder and conspiracy respectively). [...] Instead, against a backdrop of hysteria caused in part by the newspapers' relentless reporting of the case, he ordered that Elizabeth be tested at Aldrich's house. [...] Meanwhile, Elizabeth was again the subject of study, in two séances held 23–24January. [...] Parsons accepted the Lord Mayor's decision, but asked that [...] "some persons connected with the girl might be permitted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there,</b> <b>to</b> divert her in the day-time". [...] This was refused, as were two similar requests, Aldrich and Penn insisting that they would accept only [...] "any person or persons, of strict character and reputation, who are housekeepers". [...] Aldrich and Penn's account of their negotiations with Parsons clearly perturbed the clerk, as he defended his actions in the Public Ledger. [...] This prompted Aldrich and Penn to issue a pointed retort in Lloyd's Evening Post: [...] "We are greatly puzzled to find Mr. Parsons asserting that he hath been always willing to deliver up the child, when he refused a gentleman on Wednesday evening the 20th inst. [...] What is to be understood, by requiring security"? ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} for the cover, {{directed}} by Pete Angelus and Roth, {{was released in}} February 1985. Roth stars as a tour guide, showing tourists (one played by Jane Leeves, {{who went on to}} play Frasiers Daphne Moon) the beach and swimsuit models. The female bodybuilder featured in the video is Roth's personal fitness trainer, Kay Baxter. The scenes follow the lyrics with bikini-clad women from all regions of the United States. An oft-imitated scene has Roth dancing down a sidewalk bordered by models frozen like mannequins. [...] "That is Diamond Dave, the character," [...] he observed. [...] "That is definitely a part of me: I grew up in that whole Southern California thing. I dee-lite in it! But you don't have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> celebrate the spirit." [...] The clip was nominated for several 1985 MTV Video Music Awards. In an interview with Howard Stern, Roth explained that he edited the video while wearing thick skiing goggles that greatly impaired his vision. Each time the editor increased the red saturation, Roth told him to turn it higher, finally proclaiming, [...] "Now THAT'S red!" [...] The video was parodied in one for The Dresden Dolls' [...] "Shores of California".|$|E
2500|$|Support for the {{possible}} involvement {{of people in}} high places (whether {{it was to have}} Marlowe assassinated or to fake his death) has recently come to light with the discovery that the inquest was probably illegal. The inquest should have been supervised and enrolled by the local County Coroner, with the Queen's Coroner being brought in by him only if he happened to know that it was within 12 (Tudor) miles of where the Queen was in residence (i.e. that it was [...] "within the verge") and, if so, for it to be run by both of them jointly. Marlovians argue that therefore the only way for Danby to have finished up doing it on his own—given that it was only just within the verge, the Court in fact some 16 of today's statute miles away by road—would be because he knew about the killing before it actually occurred, and just [...] "happened" [...] <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> take charge. If there was a deception, they say, Danby must have been involved in it and thus almost certainly with the tacit approval of the Queen. This does, of course, give as much support to David Riggs's theory that the Queen ordered Marlowe's death as it does to the faked death theory.|$|E

[...] "He was {{the real reason for}} my Aikido pilgrimage to Japan. I had read quite a bit about this miraculous old man and having seen the pictures – I wanted the real thing. I knew what he did was special and wanted to be like that too – but I did not feel the same 'Wow – this is something else!" [...] kind of response that others report. I was impressed and intrigued – but not overawed. My journey to Japan was a personal spiritual quest and I realised that this man was someone you only get to be around once – he was a true mystic. Over the coming months and years I was to see him on a daily basis (when he was in Tokyo). As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. I had made a huge effort by modern standards <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] for no good reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced that this man was incredible." ...|$|E
