40|$|The HL A {{system is}} an {{antigenic}} polymorphism detectable on most human tissues except erythrocytes. At present two loci, LA and 4 have been identified. They have about 14 and 17 alleles respectively and {{are separated by}} a recombination fraction of 0. 8 %. The high level of polymorphism, reflected in the low frequency of homozygosity observed in the HL A system, about 13 % in Europeans compared with 58 % for the mean of ABO, MN, Rh, Fy and K, allows the system to contribute as much information to population studies as most other polymorphisms combined. HL A antigens are usually detected on peripheral lymphocytes in a complement dependent cytotoxic assay using sera from multiparous women or immunized donors as antibody. In the 5 th International Histocompatibility <b>Testing</b> <b>Workshop</b> 27 laboratories typed 54 populations for HL A and other polymorphisms. The studies showed marked differences in antigen frequencies, sometimes characteristic {{of a group of}} populations, e. g. HL A 3 and 8 in Caucasoids, absent in Mongoloids, sometimes peculiar to a single population, e. g. HL A 9 in Yemenite Jews, HL A 10 in Australia aborigines. Frequencies of haplotypes, pairs of antigens, one from each locus inherited as a unit, one from each parent, were seen to be characteristic for groups. Clines in haplotype frequencies were observed, e. g. the HL A 1, 8 and 3, 7 haplotypes declined from north to south in Caucasoids with HL A 11, 5 going in the opposite direction. Three antigens, absent in Caucasoids, were identified; two, MO* and MWA found only in Negroids and one, Malay mainly in Mongoloids. American Indians showed greatly increased homozygosity for HL A compared with other polymorphisms and with other groups suggesting strong selective pressure on the HL A system, possibly connected with disease resistance mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|The {{transient}} in-reactor fuels <b>testing</b> <b>workshop</b> {{was held}} on May 4 – 5, 2009 at Idaho National Laboratory. The purpose of this meeting {{was to provide a}} forum where technical experts in transient testing of nuclear fuels could meet directly with technical instrumentation experts and nuclear fuel modeling and simulation experts to discuss needed advancements in transient testing to support a basic understanding of nuclear fuel behavior under off-normal conditions. The workshop was attended by representatives from Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique CEA, Japanese Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), Department of Energy (DOE), AREVA, General Electric – Global Nuclear Fuels (GE-GNF), Westinghouse, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), universities, and several DOE national laboratories. Transient testing of fuels and materials generates information required for advanced fuels in future nuclear power plants. Future nuclear power plants will rely heavily on advanced computer modeling and simulation that describes fuel behavior under off-normal conditions. TREAT is an ideal facility for this testing because of its flexibility, proven operation and material condition. The opportunity exists to develop advanced instrumentation and data collection that can support modeling and simulation needs much better than was possible in the past. In order to take advantage of these opportunities, test programs must be carefully designed to yield basic information to support modeling before conducting integral performance tests. An early start of TREAT and operation at low power would provide significant dividends in training, development of instrumentation, and checkout of reactor systems. Early start of TREAT (2015) is needed to support the requirements of potential users of TREAT and include the testing of full length fuel irradiated in the FFTF reactor. The capabilities provided by TREAT are needed for the development of nuclear power and the following benefits will be realized by the refurbishment and restart of TREAT. •TREAT is an absolute necessity in the suite of reactor fuel test capabilities •TREAT yields valuable information on reactivity effects, margins to failure, fuel dispersal, and failure propagation •Most importantly, interpretation of TREAT experiment results is a stringent test of the integrated understanding of fuel performance...|$|E

Third-order low-pass Butterworth and Elliptic filters are considered {{in order to prove}} the feasibility of the proposed approach. A topology with a non-linear element in an additional feedback loop is employed for converting the Circuit Under Test (CUT) into an oscillator.

Two methods are used, the describing function approach for the treatment of the non linearity and the root-locus method for analysing the circuit and predicting the oscillation frequency and the oscillation amplitude. In order to establish the accuracy of these predictions, the oscillators have been implemented in SWITCAP (K. Suyama, S. C. Fang, Users' Manual for SWITCAP 2 Version 1. 1, Columbia University, New York, 1992). Results of a catastrophic fault injection in switches and capacitors of the filter structure are reported.
