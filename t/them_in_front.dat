5|$|Celtic {{qualified}} for the European Cup after winning the 1965–66 Scottish First Division, their 21st title, by two points over rivals Rangers. Celtic entered at the first round where they faced Swiss side Zürich. Celtic won 2–0 at home, with goals from Tommy Gemmell and Joe McBride. They then won the away leg 3–0 as Stevie Chalmers scored and Gemmell got a brace. Celtic faced French side Nantes in the second round, and won the away leg 3–1. Nantes had taken the lead through Francis Magny, before McBride had equalised to level the match at 1–1. In the second half, Bobby Lennox and Bertie Auld scored to seal a victory. Celtic won the home leg by the same scoreline. Jimmy Johnstone put <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> before Gérard Georgin equalised. Celtic again scored twice in the second half, as Chalmers and Lennox secured the victory.|$|E
5|$|Kurt is menaced {{by school}} bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and badly shaken; while Sue sympathizes with Kurt's plight, she can only punish Karofsky if he {{physically}} attacks Kurt. Glee club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) convinces the glee club girls {{to have their}} football-playing boyfriends defend Kurt, but her own boyfriend, Finn, refuses, concerned that it may jeopardize his position as quarterback. Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling) and Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) do confront Karofsky, and demand that he leave Kurt alone. Karofsky retaliates, and Sam defends them by fighting with him. Quinn is impressed by Sam's actions, and decides to accept his promise ring. Karofsky later sees Kurt and Finn practicing a wedding dance and taunts <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Burt. Burt is angered by this, but becomes livid when Kurt admits that Karofsky has threatened to kill him. He instigates a meeting with Sue, Karofsky's father (Daniel Roebuck) and the two boys, at which Sue expels Karofsky.|$|E

5|$|Tapping felt {{acting on}} the new show went a little easier when filming Carter scenes with Bill Dow ("Bill Lee"), {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} worked on Stargate SG-1. She said another factor that made acting on Atlantis easier was the welcoming cast and crew of the series. Tapping's hair was longer than it was during her time on SG-1, and the military approved of the change {{as long as it was}} worn up. To save money on visual effects, the crew built set pieces to represent some of the buildings on M7R-227 and placed <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the puddle jumper set. Another measure taken as a substitute to visual effects was to cast mime artists as the frozen Asurans.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} around Topusko, {{which was}} besieged by the Serb rebels on 28 July. The same day, heavy fighting also erupted near Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica. In Dvor, Sundać and several soldiers from his platoon {{arrived at the}} regional SAO Krajina military headquarters threatening the commanding officer, holding him responsible for losses the platoon had suffered in the fighting. The group also demanded that the authorities turn any prisoners over to them, but the demand was refused. Finally, {{they went to the}} medical centre in Dvor, where they forced eight wounded Croat civilians and two policemen, out of the building and beat <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of 100 onlookers. There are conflicting reports that all ten were killed, or that only an unspecified number of female patients were killed. On 29 July, the remaining Croatian civilian population in Struga, Unčani, Divuša and Golubovac Divuški accepted an offer made by the JNA to evacuate them to Hrvatska Kostajnica. When the column of evacuating civilians reached Kozibrod, the population of that village also joined them, followed by the police and ZNG troops stationed in Kozibrod. The move left the SAO Krajina and the JNA in control of the bulk of Banovina.|$|E

25|$|Glasses, {{also known}} as {{eyeglasses}} or spectacles, are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a person's eyes, typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears. Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness. Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for {{the sides of the}} eyes {{as well as in the}} lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash. Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses.|$|E
500|$|Other sources {{place this}} event as {{occurring}} in Alexandria, Egypt during the Egyptian {{campaign against the}} Ottoman Empire. [...] This variant may {{have been inspired by}} Napoleon's letter to General Auguste de Marmont just prior to the 1799 Battle of Abukir when Marmont was in Alexandria. [...] It urged Marmont to provide an attack warning system by securing [...] "a large quantity of dogs which can be made use of by posting <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of your fortifications". [...] After this event, the Colonel of the grenadier regiment is said to have formally placed Moustache on the roll as a grenadier and gave him a collar bearing the regiment's name. [...] Additionally, he ordered that Moustache receive the field rations entitled to a grenadier and that he be combed by the unit's barber once per week.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{wrote that}} [...] "as preposterous moneymakers go, it's ambitious and well-made. The acting {{from the large}} cast is of a high standard, Craig and Ford {{were more or less}} born into their roles, and {{director}} Jon Favreau actually develops his characters and gives them things to do, instead of posing <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of special effects." [...] He lamented [...] however that the film was not a pure Western, saying of the aliens, [...] "here is more genuine suspense when [...] starts shooting up the town than when countless aliens appear". Salons Andrew O'Hehir offered a mixed response, claiming the film to be well made and clever, and singling out Craig and Ford for their performances. O'Hehir was, however, critical of the combination of western and science-fiction elements, calling it [...] "a mediocre western clumsily welded to a mediocre alien shoot-'em-up".|$|E

500|$|P.D. Hingley {{calls it}} [...] "One {{of the most}} charming and {{visually}} attractive of the many aids to astronomical self-instruction produced {{in the early nineteenth}} century". On its main gimmick, the holes in the stars meant to show the constellation when held in front of a light, he notes that, as the size of the holes marked correspond to the magnitude of the stars, a quite realistic depiction of the constellation is provided. Ian Ridpath mostly concurs. He describes the device as an [...] "attractive feature", but notes that, due to the light at the time being provided primarily by candles, many cards likely burned up due to carelessness when trying to hold <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the flame. He notes three other attempts to use the same gimmick—Franz Niklaus König's Atlas céleste (1826), Friedrich Braun's Himmels-Atlas in transparenten Karten (1850), and Otto Möllinger's Himmelsatlas (1851), but states that they lack Urania's Mirrors artistry.|$|E

Holly advises Puck and Lauren (Ashley Fink) that the sex tape they plan to make is illegal, as both are minors, and helps Brittany (Heather Morris) and Santana (Naya Rivera) start {{to come to terms with}} their true feelings for each other, later performing [...] "Landslide" [...] with <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the club.

At the end of the episode, Holly begins a relationship with Will.|$|E
500|$|The {{championship}} belt {{was introduced}} on March 5, 2010, {{when it was}} given to the newly crowned inaugural champion Eddie Edwards. The physical championship belt was designed All Star Championship Belts d/b/a ASCB, LLC. The title's base is a black leather strap that is covered with four small silver plates. The center of the title has one large silver plate. All plates have an inner blue covering. The two small outer plates have a caricature of the earth and a satellite in orbit. The middle plates have figures resembling a cameraman filming a television production. Underneath each figure, lies the ROH logo and the words [...] "Ring of Honor Wrestling".
