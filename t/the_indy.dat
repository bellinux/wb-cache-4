It was to be the fifth consecutive year the race was held in the series, and the tenth Indy Japan 300, counting the period from 1998 to 2002 when it was a CART event. Uniquely in the 2007 season, the race took place at a non-American location. <b>The</b> <b>Indy</b> Japan 300 was the third race scheduled for 2007 by the IRL, out of 17. At this early stage in the season, Dixon held the lead in the point standings with 80 points. Castroneves and Wheldon were tied for second with 75 points, and Kanaan and Hornish Jr. were fourth and fifth on 65 and 61 points, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Hélio Castroneves, the {{defending}} champion of <b>the</b> <b>Indy</b> Japan 300, won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying. In the race, Wheldon gained the lead from Castroneves on lap 44 and led {{for more than half}} of the 200 laps, but a pit stop with 14 laps remaining forced him to relinquish the top position. Kanaan took the lead because of a late pit stop by Dixon, and held off a late challenge by Wheldon to secure first place.|$|E

5|$|Both of Mario Andretti's sons, Michael and Jeff, were auto racers. Michael {{followed}} in his father's footsteps {{by winning the}} IndyCar title, with Mario's nephew John Andretti joining the series in 1988. This meant that the Andrettis became the first family to have four relatives compete in the same series. With Mario sharing driving duties with sons Michael and Jeff at the 1991 Rolex 24 at Daytona, driving a Porsche 962, the Andretti clan finished 5th. Mario's grandson Marco completed his first full season in <b>the</b> <b>Indy</b> Racing League (IRL) in 2006, driving for his father Michael's Andretti Green Racing team.

In 1524 the Council of <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> was established.

5|$|Early on, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice between three {{different}} game modes, each with unique cutscenes, puzzles to solve and locations to visit: the Team Path, the Wits Path, and the Fists Path. In the Team Path, protagonist Indiana Jones is joined by his partner Sophia Hapgood who will provide support throughout the game. The Wits Path features an abundance of complex puzzles, while the Fists Path focuses heavily on action sequences and fist fighting, the latter of which is completely optional {{in the other two}} modes. Atypical for LucasArts titles, it is possible for the player character to die at certain points in the game, though dangerous situations were designed to be easily recognizable. A score system, <b>the</b> <b>Indy</b> Quotient Points, keeps track of the puzzles solved, the obstacles overcome and the important objects found.|$|E
5|$|Franchitti was {{considered}} one of the favorites to win the race having won the event two years previously and hoped to keep a recent string of good results in the 2001 season going at the track. Bräck expected to perform well despite retiring from the previous year's event and hoped he could regain the momentum he built {{from the start of the}} season. The race's defending champion Michael Andretti had secured six of his 40 career victories in Toronto and stated that he did not know if luck played a part but noted his driving style was suited to the circuit. Having finished in the points-scoring position in three of the previous four races, Alex Tagliani said it encouraged him heading into <b>the</b> <b>Indy</b> Toronto.|$|E

40|$|Page range: 43 - 58 A {{reconsideration}} of Anton Mussert, party {{leader of the}} Dutch Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging (NSB, National-Socialist Movement), who wrote and spoke regarding the significance of <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> to <b>the</b> Netherlands before and during World War II. An <b>Indies</b> branch of <b>the</b> NSB was established in 1930, and its attempts to shape a program and message illustrate the dilemmas encountered by a fascist party in a colonial outpost. The colonial authorities in <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> sought to control the potentially inflammatory rhetoric of the fascists, and Mussert dissuaded NSB members in <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> from criticizing and challenging those same authorities. Mussert wanted to protect and sustain <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> branch of <b>the</b> NSB {{in large part because}} funds collected from it helped support his efforts in Holland. As the war approached, the party splintered, divided by disagreements over the role and status of Indo (mixed-blood) members of <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> NSB, who constituted 75 percent of the membership.

A total of seven Brazilian drivers would compete in the race, including Ana Beatriz, Hélio Castroneves, Tony Kanaan, Raphael Matos, Vitor Meira, Mario Moraes and Mario Romancini. Of those seven, four drivers—Beatriz, Castroneves, Moraes and Romancini—are natives of São Paulo.
