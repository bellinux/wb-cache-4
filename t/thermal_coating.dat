40|$|Key words: <b>thermal</b> {{insulation}} <b>coating,</b> {{energy saving}} performance, building energy saving, economic analysis, exterior insulation Abstract. At present, {{the more common}} materials of exterior insulation in our country are the external heat-insulation wall of polystyrene panel, aerated concrete blocks and <b>thermal</b> insulation <b>coating.</b> Paper analyzes {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of these three technologies. The results show that with the same thermal insulation property, the cost of <b>thermal</b> insulation <b>coating</b> is obviously lower than the other two. Meanwhile, the <b>thermal</b> insulation <b>coating</b> has a significant improvement on the anti-fire properties, which can eliminate the potential fire risk which may be caused by the external wall of polystyrene panels. In addition, the <b>thermal</b> insulation <b>coating</b> is more simple to construction. Finally, this paper introduces the development prospects of <b>thermal</b> insulation <b>coating...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study using}} a two-flux approximation of the radiative transfer equation {{was performed to}} examine the effects of an opaque reflective layer on the thermal behavior of a typical semitransparent <b>thermal</b> barrier <b>coating</b> on an opaque substrate. Some ceramic materials are semitransparent in the wavelength ranges where thermal radiation is important. Even with an opaque layer on each side of the semitransparent <b>thermal</b> barrier <b>coating,</b> scattering and absorption can have an effect on the heat transfer. In this work, a <b>thermal</b> barrier <b>coating</b> that is semitransparent up to a wavelength of 5 micrometers is considered. Above 5 micrometers wavelength, the <b>thermal</b> barrier <b>coating</b> is opaque. The absorption and scattering coefficient of the thermal barrier was varied. The thermal behavior of the <b>thermal</b> barrier <b>coating</b> with an opaque reflective layer is compared to a <b>thermal</b> barrier <b>coating</b> without the reflective layer. For a thicker <b>thermal</b> barrier <b>coating</b> with lower convective loading, which would be typical of a combustor liner, a reflective layer can significantly decrease the temperature in the <b>thermal</b> barrier <b>coating</b> and substrate if the scattering is weak or moderate and for strong scattering if the absorption is large. The layer without the reflective coating can be about as effective as the layer with the reflective coating if the absorption is small and the scattering strong. For low absorption, some temperatures in the <b>thermal</b> barrier <b>coating</b> system can be slightly higher with the reflective layer. For a thin <b>thermal</b> barrier <b>coating</b> with high convective loading, which would be typical of a blade or vane that sees the hot sections of the combustor, the reflective layer is not as effective. The reflective layer reduces the surface temperature of the reflective layer for all conditions considered. For weak and moderate scattering, the temperature of the TBC-substrate interface is reduced but for strong scattering, the temperature of the substrate is increased slightly...|$|R

50|$|Thermal {{spraying}} is {{a process}} of applying coatings by heating a feedstock of precursor material and spraying it on a surface. Different specific techniques are used depending on desired particle size, coat thickness, spray speed, desired area, etc. The coatings applied by thermal spraying of any kind, however, rely on adhesion to the surface. As a result, the surface of the superalloy must be cleaned and prepared, usually polished, before application of the <b>thermal</b> <b>coating.</b>|$|E

The heat shield has several outer coverings: a pore seal, a moisture barrier (a white reflective coating), and a silver Mylar <b>thermal</b> <b>coating</b> that looks like aluminum foil.|$|E
5000|$|To {{stabilize}} the weapon after {{release from the}} aircraft, a tail cone assembly {{is attached to the}} aft end of the cargo section. The tail cone assembly houses four, spring-actuated folding fins. The fins are spring-loaded to the open position and secured in the closed position during ground handling by a fin release-band assembly. The fin release band is secured in the closed position by a safety cotter pin and by the fin release wire. A yellow band around the forward end of the cargo section indicates the explosive content of the weapon. The Mk 7 Mods 3, 4, and 6 bomb dispensers have the Mk 339 Mod 1 fuze, which provides the pilot with in-flight selection of the fuze function time.

5000|$|Once the {{interior}} scaffolding was installed, a thorough evaluative survey of {{the interior}} coatings was executed. The acknowledged presumption of most involved in the restoration was that all coatings would {{be removed from the}} interior metals, that repairs would be made, that metals would be recoated, and the interior would be adequately weatherproofed. The preexisting interior coatings on both the secondary wrought iron framework and the wrought iron central pylon would be removed along with the multiple layers of coal tar and paint that had been applied to the internal copper sheathing. A New York Times article from February 8, 1984, mentioned that the interior copper which was at that time painted [...] "government green" [...] would be cleaned to resemble the salmon color of a new penny. That outermost [...] "government green" [...] layer was a vinyl paint applied in 1975. Because certain sections that had corroded were hidden beneath the layers of coatings, no attempt was made to salvage any of the seven layers of paint, (consisting of a base coat of red lead primer plus six additional coats) and the two layers of bituminous paint (a coal tar coating) that had been used as a water sealant in the statues interior around 1911. The three available coating removal methods tested, developed (or not) and implemented (or not) were: <b>thermal</b> <b>coating</b> removal, abrasive coating removal and chemical coating removal. The methods contemplated for the removal of the coatings on the interior copper differed from that of the other interior metals. For the preparation of the wrought iron parts of the statue, an abrasive removal method also known as dry sandblasting was implemented in order to prevent against flash rusting, The low dusting abrasive material used in the dry sandblasting technique was aluminum oxide.|$|E
40|$|AZ-Tek's AZW-LA-II low solar {{absorptance}} white paint was previously flown as a flight experiment, {{and is being}} flown as a calorimeter. However {{it has never been}} flown as a <b>thermal</b> <b>coating</b> of radiators on an operational spacecraft before. This paint has the lowest {{solar absorptance}} among all white paints, and a very small degradation. Its cost is many times more expensive than white paints that have a higher solar absorptance.

40|$|Objectives: Many {{advantages}} {{have been}} attributed to dental zirconia ceramics in terms of mechanical and physical properties; however, the bonding ability of this material to dental structure and/or veneering ceramics has always been a matter of concern. On the other hand, hydroxyapatite (HA) shows excellent biocompatibility and good bonding ability to tooth structure, with mechanically unstable and brittle characteristics, that make it clinically unacceptable for use in high stress bearing areas. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to introduce two simple yet practical methods to deposit the crystalline HA nanoparticles on zirconia ceramics. Materials and Methods: zirconia blocks were treated with HA via two different deposition methods namely <b>thermal</b> <b>coating</b> and air abrasion. Specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results: In both groups, the deposition techniques used were successfully accomplished, while the substrate showed no structural change. However, <b>thermal</b> <b>coating</b> group showed a uniform deposition of crystalline HA but in air abrasion method, there were dispersed thin islands of HA. Conclusions: <b>Thermal</b> <b>coating</b> method has the potential to significantly alter the surface characteristics of zirconia. The simple yet practical nature of the proposed method may be able to shift the bonding paradigm of dental zirconia ceramics. This latter subject needs to be addressed in future investigations.
