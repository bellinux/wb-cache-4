Mervyn's, which had not previously had a retail presence in Georgia, competed for mall space with JCPenney and received <b>top</b> <b>anchor</b> spots at several area malls, such as the Town Center Mall, Shannon Mall, North DeKalb Mall, Gwinnett Place Mall and North Point Mall.

25|$|Also in 2003, KYW-TV {{became a}} factor in the Philadelphia news race {{for the first time in}} over 20 years. The {{previous}} summer, it persuaded WPVI-TV's longtime 5 p.m. anchor, Marc Howard, to jump ship to anchor its 11 p.m. news. Kathy Orr, weekend weathercaster at WCAU, also moved to channel 3. Then, in September 2003, the station lured Larry Mendte away from WCAU. Mendte had been the lead anchor at that station when it defeated WPVI in the ratings for the first time in 30 years. Alycia Lane, a weekend anchor at Miami's WTVJ, was added to compliment Mendte, and they became the station's new <b>top</b> <b>anchor</b> team, anchoring KYW's 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts.|$|E
25|$|Lead {{climbing}} is a climbing technique. The lead climber ascends {{with the}} rope passing through intermittent anchors that are below them, {{rather than through}} a <b>top</b> <b>anchor,</b> as in a top-roped climb. A partner belays from below the lead climber, by feeding out enough rope to allow upward progression without undue slack. As the leader progresses he or she clips the rope into, using a runner and carabiners, intermediate points of protection such as active cams, or passive protection such as nuts; this limits {{the length of a}} potential fall. The leader also may clip into pre-placed bolts. Indoor gyms might have short runners pre-attached to fixed anchor points in the wall.|$|E

25|$|The {{climbing}} rope is of a fixed length; the climber can only climb {{the length of}} the rope. Routes longer than the rope length are broken up into several segments called pitches; this is known as multi-pitch climbing. At the top of a pitch, the leader, the first climber to ascend, sets up an anchor and then belays the second climber up to the anchor; as the second climber follows the route taken by the leader, the second climber removes (cleans) the carabiners and anchors placed along the way in order to use them again on the next pitch. Once both climbers are at the <b>top</b> <b>anchor,</b> the leader begins climbing the next pitch and so on until the top of the route is reached.|$|E

50|$|The main {{difference}} between Action News and Eyewitness News {{was that the}} former was far more tightly formatted. Time limits were placed on packages - for instance, a reporter package could be no longer than 90 seconds. This difference enabled the station to cover more stories than its competitors. Another key difference was {{the focus on the}} surrounding Philadelphia suburban areas - a response to the movement of residents from the city to the suburbs. Finally, WPVI placed more emphasis on young talent - while WCAU-TV and KYW-TV used older, well-known news anchors such as Vince Leonard, Tom Snyder, and John Facenda, WPVI had a young Larry Kane as its <b>top</b> <b>anchor.</b> Later, the station would add the very popular Jim O'Brien as its main weathercaster.|$|E

50|$|For {{the better}} part of the last four decades, KUSA's newscasts (currently titled as 9NEWS) have {{dominated}} Denver's local news ratings. In February 1976, Ed Sardella and John Rayburn anchored the weeknight editions of the 10:00 p.m. newscast, helping that program overtake longtime leader KMGH-TV for first place in the ratings; Rayburn was succeeded by Mike Landess in 1977. Landess and Sardella would remain as channel 9's <b>top</b> <b>anchor</b> team until Landess left for KUSA's Atlanta sister station WXIA-TV in late 1993. Adele Arakawa, who had been an anchor at WBBM-TV in Chicago, was hired to succeed Landess. Sardella retired from the anchor desk in 2000, and was succeeded by Jim Benemann, but returned briefly in 2003 to replace Benemann when he left for KCNC-TV. Landess, after anchoring at WTTG in Washington, D.C., returned to Denver at rival KMGH-TV in 2002.|$|E
50|$|There is {{sometimes}} confusion {{about how much}} theoretical mechanical advantage {{is provided by the}} trucker's hitch. If the trucker's hitch were to be used as in the pulley diagram at right, to lift a weight off the floor, the theoretical mechanical advantage would be only 2:1. However in the common use of the trucker's hitch, a static hook, ring, or rail, serves as the lower pulley, and the rope {{across the top of the}} load is the portion being tensioned. Thus, the standing part of the rope is represented by the <b>top</b> <b>anchor</b> point in the diagram, and the theoretical ratio is indeed 3:1 when the working end is tensioned. That is, in a frictionless system, every unit of force exerted on the working end would produce 3 units in the standing part of the rope over the load. In the typical use of the trucker's hitch, where it is used to tighten a rope over a load, when the end is secured to the loop of the Truckers hitch and let go, the tension in the two segments of rope around the ring will rise 50%, unless the rope slackens when it is being tied off, in which case the tension may drop to any value or even zero if enough slack is allowed. But when the trucker's hitch is used as in the diagram, after tying off, the load on the attachment point above the top pulley will drop to 400 lb and the tension in the two lines going to the lower pulley will not change.|$|E
40|$|Background: Stability is {{determined}} {{as one of}} the requirements in use of Temporary Anchorage Devices (TAD) in orthodontics. Miniscrew has been a widely used Bone Anchor. Compared with mini-implant that necessitates osseointegration; mechanical retention is a determining factor for primary stability of miniscrew. Studies investigated various ways to increase primary stability. The aim {{of this study is to}} introduce a new configuration of miniscrew system which is believed to obtain more primary stability. Material and Methods: Freshly ovine mandibles were cut in blocks. Twenty-seven miniscrews (diameter 1. 6 × 8 mm; G 2, Dual <b>Top</b> <b>Anchor</b> System, Jeil Medical, Seoul, Korea) were inserted in the blocks and divided in 2 experimental groups: single miniscrew and the innovated design “Seifi Twin Screw (STS) ”. Primary stability was evaluated by Periotest “M”® device. Results: Independent t-test showed a significant difference between 2 experimental groups in periotest evaluation (p< 0. 05). STS demonstrated higher primary stability due to its mechanical configuration and design. Conclusions: The STS provides higher primary stability and was found to be effective in increased success rate of miniscrew systems from the standpoint of primary stability...|$|E

50|$|Lead {{climbing}} {{is employed}} by climber where points of protection are formed by girthing the tree's limbs with slings. Once the lead climber ascends the tree, {{he or she}} may create a belay or <b>top</b> rope <b>anchor</b> or else simply rappel down. In the event that an anchor is created, other climbers can subsequently climb the tree on belay without having to lead. Drawbacks to this method include the probability of hitting a lower limb or the main trunk {{in the event of a}} fall.|$|R
