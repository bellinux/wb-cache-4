500|$|The cathedral {{is widely}} {{considered}} a masterpiece of Armenian architecture. It is {{the largest and most}} impressive structure of Ani, and has been described by Armen Kazaryan as the most significant structure of the entire Bagratid period. The cathedral is known for its novel design features. Authors of Global History of Architecture wrote that it [...] "deserves to be listed among the principal monuments of the time because of its pointed arches and clustered columns and piers." [...] Josef Strzygowski argued that the cathedral is the most valuable achievement of Armenian architecture from the European viewpoint. David Marshall Lang wrote that the cathedral's building techniques are [...] "far ahead of the contemporary Anglo-Saxon and Norman architecture of western Europe." [...] H. F. B. Lynch wrote: [...] "The impression which we take away from our survey of these various features is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> introduced to a monument of the highest artistic merit, denoting a standard of culture which was far in advance of the contemporary standards in the West." [...] Sirarpie Der Nersessian wrote that it [...] "deserves to be listed among the important examples of medieval architecture." [...] The New International Encyclopedia characterized it as the [...] "most interesting church of Armenia." [...] David Roden Buxton suggested that the cathedral deserves far more fame than it actually has. Richard Phené Spiers wrote in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911): ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{interconnections}} between evidence, knowledge, and justification. I defend here the following theses. All evidence <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> knowledge. All knowledge <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> evidence. A piece of evidence supports a proposition p just in case it raises p's probability. A justified belief is a belief that complies with the fundamental norm of belief. The fundamental norm of belief is: one ought to believe that p if and only if one knows that p. It is not the case that one's belief that p is epistemically justified if and only if one's total evidence supports p and one's belief that p is appropriately based on one's evidence. Nevertheless, if one's belief that p is epistemically justified then one's total evidence supports p and one's belief that p is appropriately based on one's evidence. The present thesis comprises a detailed defence of these claims...|$|R

It is just a pity he didn't take care that it didn't happen". Elf was also unhappy with {{the way in which the}} episode had been handled, the company's Commercial Director Michel Bonnet declaring that [...] "We believe the FIA acted in a high-handed manner in disqualifying our two cars so quickly. It should have declared the results provisional and waited for the results of further analysis. Acting the way it did, the FIA has affected the image of large industrial companies, of top F1 teams and of famous drivers. The fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> treated as cheats by a red team – probably red with embarrassment at having finished one lap behind our cars – and by Gerhard Berger is a serious slur against us." [...] Elf also threatened to take the matter to a tribunal if the cars were not reinstated. Company representative Valerie Jorquera also highlighted the need for a consistent chromatographic analysis of fuel samples, drawing attention to the fact that the samples provided during the event had been analysed by a different company than the reference sample, and that the differences may have been caused by the use of different analytical machines and methods. The incident was seen as unfortunate for the sport, which was trying to make a fresh start after several controversies the previous year. From the San Marino Grand Prix onwards, an FIA mobile fuel laboratory accompanied the teams to each event to permit more detailed testing at the track, in addition to ensuring consistency between events.|$|E

On the other hand, barring Lois Lane’s own knowledge of the dual nature of Clark and Superman (thus depriving one of fiction’s greatest reveals), the hero we see in the final moments of Man of Steel is nothing if not the character Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created… with just a bit more in the 'imperfections' column." [...] Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times stated that, [...] "Man of Steel is more than just Avengers-sized escapism; it's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew." [...] Time magazine's Richard Corliss said, [...] "The movie finds its true, lofty footing not when it displays Kal-El’s extraordinary powers, but when it dramatizes Clark Kent’s roiling humanity. The super part of Man of Steel is just okay, but the man part is super." [...] In a review on Roger Ebert's website, Matt Zoller Seitz awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it an [...] "astonishing movie" [...] and praising the conflict between Clark and Zod.
