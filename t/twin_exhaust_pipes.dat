50|$|When {{fitted with}} the C-type head, 2-inch sand-cast H8 carburettors, heavier torsion bars and <b>twin</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes,</b> {{the car was}} {{designated}} XK140 SE in the UK and XK140 MC in North America.|$|E
50|$|Also {{inherited}} from the previous model was the combination of disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear, but now with twin braking circuits as an additional safety feature, and servo-assistance. The 26M received enlarged front brake discs to complement its power-assisted steering, twin halogen headlights, and <b>twin</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|E
50|$|A post-war {{update with}} <b>twin</b> {{fishtail}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes</b> exiting through {{holes in the}} rear facing armoured plate. Cowls were no-longer required. Early type B Comets had armoured covers over the holes through which the fishtail <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes</b> would protrude, retaining the older Model A setup.|$|R
50|$|To further {{update the}} car, they changed its {{polarity}} from positive to negative earth and fitted an alternator {{in place of}} the dynamo. They also devised a new <b>twin</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>exhaust</b> system so that the new engine could breathe more easily.|$|R
50|$|In October 1964 the Velox PB became {{available}} {{with a more}} powerful 3294 cc engine. This made {{it one of the}} fastest European saloons of its day. The 2.6 was retained for some export markets. The update also included a new full-width grille, new tail lights incorporating optional reversing lights, <b>twin</b> rear <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes,</b> 120 mph speedometer (was 110), new interior trim and, {{towards the end of the}} run, a switch from three-speed Hydramatic (PNDLR selector) to two-speed Powerglide (PRNDL). PB Velox models were again assembled at the General Motors New Zealand plant in Petone and special versions were again built for local traffic police. The 3.3 was particularly popular with these government customers.|$|R
50|$|External {{differences}} from the Majestic included a D motif {{on top of}} the bonnet, cast-in V symbols on the ventilation air intakes, six inches added to the length of the car which gave it a longer boot and longer bumper returns, and <b>twin</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes.</b> Front seats could be supplied as individual adjustable seats or as a bench.|$|E
50|$|In vehicle mode, Pipes {{can travel}} 100 mph {{with a range}} of 400 mi and can haul up to 60 tons. His <b>twin</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes,</b> which become his arms in robot mode emit {{corrosive}} gases that can dissolve a 2 in slab of steel in 10 minutes. He is among the strongest of the Autobot mini-bots.|$|E
50|$|The new {{aircraft}} {{was given the}} STAé designation Voisin Type V, while the factory designation was Voisin LAS. The S stood for surélevé (raised) which indicated the raised engine mount. The previous Type III variant had an exhaust system which permitted fumes to escape freely; the Type V incorporated a more effective system of <b>twin</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{convertible}} version was also available, {{for the first}} time in 1987, built by Bertone of Torino/Italy, bringing it to line with competitors, such as the Ford Escort and Volkswagen Golf. For the 1988 model, capacities were raised from 1.3 to 1.4 litres. In the fall of 1986 a new 1,998 cc engine replaced the 1.8 hitherto used on the GSi and Vauxhall Astra GTE in many markets, although the 1.8 continued to be sold in some places. In 1988, a 16-valve twin-cam version was developed for a high-performance GSi/GTE model, yielding [...] in non-catalyzed form, six less horsepower with a catalytic converter fitted. While criticized for a lack of refinement, the GSi 16V was also lauded as the most powerful car available in its class at the time. Aside from the [...] "16V" [...] badging, it could be told from an eight-valve GSi by its <b>twin</b> rectangular <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|R
25|$|This initial batch {{offered little}} {{improvement}} over the BE.2, and was rejected for service in France. Aircraft following this initial batch were completed to a revised design, with a new fin and rudder, its leading edge straight and lacking the earlier comma shaped horn balance, and powered by the Renault-related but more powerful 90hp (67kW) RAF 1a engine. Both crew were placed in a single, extended cockpit with the pilot forward, allowing the observer a more effective field of fire, although in the event few F.K.3s were flown with armament. Trials at Upavon in May 1916 proved that the F.K.3 had a better performance in some respects than the B.E.2c, although it had a smaller useful load. Armstrong Whitworth were given a contract to build 150 aircraft with another 350 being built by Hewlett & Blondeau Limited at Luton. Some of the early batch had <b>twin</b> high <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes</b> that exited above the upper wing in B.E.2 style, but these were later replaced with rams' horns forward stubs.|$|R
50|$|The {{exhaust system}} {{consisted}} of head pipes from each {{bank of cylinders}} with their own pre-catalytic converters, which entered a dual-inlet / single outlet main catalytic converter. A single 2.5 in <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe</b> exited the main converter and went into a resonator, and onto the main, transverse, single inlet muffler with <b>twin</b> <b>exhaust</b> tips in the bumper.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Enfield Fury {{name has}} been used again for a new 499 cc single-cylinder model by Royal Enfield India and forms part of their range for 2011. The new Fury has fuel {{injection}} and is the first Royal Enfield motorcycle in 40 years with <b>twin</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes.</b> The new Fury is supplied with a chrome headlight and digital instruments, with a fibreglass single seat unit incorporating a rear light. With maximum power of 27.2 hp (20.3 kW) at 5250 rpm, however, the new Fury has {{more in common with}} the modern Royal Enfield Electra than the original Fury of 1959.|$|E
50|$|The 335is has stiffer {{engine mounts}} and an {{upgraded}} cooling system, with a heavy-duty radiator fan and two heat exchangers, one an engine oil cooler, {{the other a}} secondary coolant radiator. To accommodate these heat exchangers, which are located ahead of each front wheel, the 335is has larger air openings, similar to the M3. Fog lights {{were removed from the}} coupé version to allow for the openings, although they remain on the convertible version. In addition, the 335is is equipped with a revised, high-flow exhaust system, with the <b>twin</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes</b> finished in matte black, and a rear bumper that incorporates a diffuser-style piece.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2005, Suzuki {{launched}} the Sport {{version of the}} new Swift in Japan named SwiftRS, and in September 2006 the model was introduced in most European markets. Named [...] "Swift Sport", it is powered by an enhanced M16A unit, a high-revving 1.6-litre, naturally aspirated DOHC VVT four-cylinder engine with an 11.1:1 compression ratio, high lift cams, forged pistons, and strengthened valve springs. The 1.6-liter engine produces [...] and 148 Nm torque. At 3765 mm, the car is 70 mm longer than the standard Swift. The Swift Sport features sportier bumpers and spoilers, a stiffer suspension, <b>twin</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes,</b> red sport seats (with Recaro seats optional) and four-wheel disc brakes on 16-inch wheels. The European Swift Sport features five-speed manual transmission, the three-door body variant, 17-inch wheels (16-inch also available) and electronic stability control (ESC).|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} styling and badging {{differences between the}} models, including the Cooper S having a distinctive scoop cut into the bonnet. The Cooper S also has <b>twin</b> <b>exhausts</b> which exit under {{the centre of the}} rear valance. The non-S Cooper has more chrome parts than the Mini One and has a single exhaust. The Mini One D has no visible <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes</b> at all.|$|R
5000|$|The 700S {{continued}} to be developed at the Darley Abbey works in Derbyshire, along with the SPR Production Racing version. [...] Production was slow, with just two motorcycles a week coming off the production line. Customers could select from five colour schemes - British Racing Green, metallic blue or green, black with gold coachlines or plain red. There was also a Scott special edition in purple and cream - and a special scheme similar to Silk Cut cigarettes, which were popular at the time.As a precision engineering company, Silk {{were able to make}} the piston port twin cylinder engine in-house at their Derbyshire workshops. The pressed up, four roller bearing crank had the primary drive taken from the crankshaft centre, to an inverted Velocette Venom four-speed gearbox. The two stroke engine ran on a 50:1 petroil mix, with a separate oil tank reserved for main bearing lubrication fed by Silk's own design of oil pump. When the rider opened the throttle the oil flowed faster, ensuring best possible lubrication. The engine's claimed 48 bhp was developed at 6,000rpm, giving good touring performance, and peak torque was at 3,000rpm, comparable to the Suzuki GT750. <b>Twin</b> siamesed <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes</b> fed an Ossa silencer. The wheels on early models were 18 inch Borrani alloy rims, replaced with six spoke Campagnolo cast wheels on later Silks. The final drive chain was enclosed for longer life.|$|R
40|$|To clarify certain conspicious unsymmetries in the {{radiated}} noise from piston-powered single-engine propeller-driven aeroplanes "air-to-air acoustic measurements" were conducted employing an inherently quiet sail plane as a microphone carrier and {{to fly the}} very test aircraft at various positions relative to it (i. e. above, below and to the side of). The test aircraft, a Dornier DO 27, was equipped with a 6 -piston combustion engine and a 2 -blade propeller with an uneven gear-ratio in between, faciliting the separation of propeller and engine exhaust contributions in the combined radiated acoustic pressure time history (PTH). The engine's <b>twin</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>exhaust</b> system was located {{on the underside of}} the aircraftsuch that its two orifices were acoustically shielded to some extent from an observer above the aircraft.

The S8 followed the naming convention of other high-performance Audi [...] "S" [...] models {{such as the}} Audi A6-derived S6 and was similar in vein of Mercedes-Benz AMG models. In markets such as the UK, the S8 was only available with the automatic transmission. Cosmetically, Audi differentiated the S8 from the A8 with solid aluminium alloy door mirror housings, chrome-effect beltline and lower front grille trim, and polished <b>twin</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes,</b> along with subtle [...] "S8" [...] badging. 14-way power adjustable and heated sports front seats with memory function were fitted as were heated rear seats. Standard alloy wheels were 18-inch cast aluminium alloy [...] "Avus" [...] six-spoke style. After the 1999 facelift, 20-inch polished nine-spoke RS wheels became an option. In 2002, 18-inch nine-spoke RS wheels became a no-cost option.|$|E
40|$|THE greater {{frequency}} of {{cancer of the}} lung in urban over rural populations has been well established. This has prompted {{the evaluation of the}} aetiological relevancy of agents which have been introduced or which have increased in quantity in urban atmosphares in recent years. Thus, Kotin, Falk and Thomas (1954, 1955), sampling the particulate phase of exhausts from both petrol and diesel engines, identified seven polycyclic hydrocarbons spectroscopically, including the traditional animal carcinogen, 3, 4 -benzpyrene, and showed their differential formation with respect to engine speed and load. The present paper records an assay for aromatic hydrocarbons of a sample of petrol exhaust soot produced under the varying conditions of normal automobile running and compares the results with those obtained from a sample of general atmospheric soot.
