Archaeological surveys of Bryce Canyon National Park and the Paunsaugunt Plateau show <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{in the area for}} at least 10,000years. Basketmaker Anasazi artifacts several thousand years old have been found south of the park. Other artifacts from the Pueblo-period Anasazi and the Fremont culture (up to the mid-12th century) have also been found.|$|E

The earliest inhabitants of Bhutan and the adjoining Himalayan areas of South Asia were people from the Indus Valley Civilization.

500|$|Tabloid {{criticism}} of Islam4UK and Choudary since {{news of the}} proposed march first became public has, generally, been vitriolic, calling him a [...] "hate preacher". In January 2010, appearing on the BBC's The Daily Politics, he was asked by its presenter, Andrew Neil, for his opinions on the banning of Islam4UK, before being asked to comment on his financial status, claiming that it was [...] "relevant to our viewers". [...] Choudary told Neil that his finances were a personal matter, {{and that he was}} [...] "doing something, and I don't want to discuss that with you. [...] I'm not on Jobseeker's allowance, {{but at the same time}} I have family allowance, I have very firmly held views which I'm propagating at the same time." [...] Responding to the media's {{criticism of}} him, Choudary said [...] "I do believe <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> whipped up into an anti-Islam anti-Muslim frenzy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{persistence}} of such attitudes {{was fueled by}} resentment {{over the fact that}} Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers. Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had [...] "stolen" [...] black music still found adherents. Notable among African American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was Jackie Wilson, who argued, [...] "A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis." [...] And throughout his career, Presley plainly acknowledged his debt. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, [...] "Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from <b>that.</b> <b>People</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to [...]" [...] Nine years earlier, he had said, [...] "Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years. It used to be called rhythm and blues." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{campaigning for}} {{re-election}} in 2014, Ford visited Danzig Street on {{the second anniversary of}} the mass shooting, dodging questions about his own connection to drug dealers. Councillor Paula Fletcher criticized his attending the event: [...] "You can't have it both ways– you can't be part of it and then crusading to stop it ... You can't technically be condoning guns and gangs and then going out saying how terrible it is <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shot and killed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{performing}} brachial plexus blocks {{for over a}} hundred years, there is as yet no clear {{evidence to support the}} assertion that one method of nerve localization is better than another. There are however numerous case reports documenting cases in which use of a portable ultrasound scanning device has detected abnormal anatomy that would otherwise not have been evident using a [...] "blind" [...] approach. On the other hand, use of ultrasound may create {{a false sense of security}} in the operator, which may lead to errors, especially if the needle tip is not adequately visualized at all times.|$|E
2500|$|Filmed in the round, only a {{small portion}} of these – and the {{stand-up}} sets – were included in the televised special. [...] Presley and the others played and sang while interjecting personal stories of his music and early performances. [...] Referring to music and his religious upbringing in a break between songs, Presley says: [...] "Rock and roll is basically gospel (music), or rhythm & blues (is too). It sprang from <b>that,</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> adding to it." [...] He also makes reference to the leading groups of the time, like The Byrds and The Beatles, and notes how things have improved and not just changed, like the standard of musicians and sound engineering. Presley is also prompted to speak about a Florida concert at which the police had filmed the show, threatening to use the film as evidence to prosecute him for [...] "vulgarity." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{suppose there}} was a time when nobody bothered at all about the shape of the earth, when nobody had even had the idea that the earth could be {{conceived}} as having a shape, and similarly it is true that it is only in recent centuries <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to suppose that {{there was a}} shape to human history. It is indeed not much more than a century since there was any real emergence from theological assumptions and pure romanticism and accidentalism in these matters. Old Adam Smith it was, probing away at the roots of economics, who set going the construction of ampler propositions. From him spring all those new interpretations which have changed the writing of history from a record of dramatic reigns and wars and crises to an analysis of economic forces. How impossible it would be for anyone now to write that great chapter of Gibbon's in which he sweeps together into one contempt the history of sixty Emperors and six hundred years of time. His note of weariness and futility vanishes directly one's vision penetrates the immediate surface. Those Heraclians and Isaurians and Comneni were not history, a schoolboy nowadays knows that their record is not history, knows them for the mere scum upon the stream.|$|E
6000|$|As {{soon as we}} {{appeared}} {{outside the}} beggars of Toledo swarmed upon us; but I hope it was not from them I formed {{the notion that the}} beauty of the place was architectural and not personal, though these poor things were as deplorably plain as they were obviously miserable. The inhabitants who did not ask alms were of course in the majority, but neither were these impressive in looks or bearing. Rather, I should say, their average was small and dark, and in color of eyes and hair as well as skin they suggested the African race that held Toledo for four centuries. Neither here nor anywhere else in Spain are there any traces of the Jews who helped bring the Arabs in; once for all, <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> banished so perfectly that they do not show their noses anywhere. Possibly they exist, but they do not exist openly, any more than the descendants of the Moorish invaders practise their Moslem rites. As for the beggars, to whom I return as they constantly returned to us, it did not avail to do them charity; that by no means dispersed them; the thronging misery and mutilation in the lame, the halt and the blind, was as great at our coming back to our hotel as our going out of it. They were of every age and sex; the very school-children left their sports to chance our charity; and it is still with a pang that I remember the little girl whom we denied a copper when she was really asking for a florecito out of the nosegay that one of us carried. But how could we know that it was a little flower and not a [...] "little dog" [...] she wanted? ...|$|E

60|$|There are, {{and that}} too many, fair pretences of fine discoveries, new inventions, engines, and I know not what, which--being {{advanced}} in notion, and talked up to great {{things to be}} performed when such and such sums of money shall be advanced, and such and such engines are made--have raised the fancies of credulous people to such a height that, merely on the shadow of expectation, they have formed companies, chose committees, appointed officers, shares, and books, raised great stocks, and cried up an empty notion to that degree <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> betrayed to part with their money for shares in a new nothing; and when the inventors have carried on the jest till they have sold all their own interest, they leave the cloud to vanish of itself, and the poor purchasers to quarrel with one another, and go to law about settlements, transferrings, and some bone or other thrown among them by the subtlety of the author to lay the blame of the miscarriage upon themselves. Thus the shares at first begin to fall by degrees, and happy is he that sells in time; till, like brass money, it will go at last for nothing at all. So have I seen shares in joint-stocks, patents, engines, and undertakings, blown up by the air of great words, {{and the name of}} some man of credit concerned, to 100 pounds for a five-hundredth part or share (some more), and at last dwindle away till it has been stock-jobbed down to 10 pounds, 12 pounds, 9 pounds, 8 pounds a share, and at last no buyer (that is, in short, the fine new word for nothing-worth), and many families ruined by the purchase. If I should name linen manufactures, saltpetre-works, copper mines, diving engines, dipping, and the like, for instances of this, I should, I believe, do no wrong to truth, or to some persons too visibly guilty.|$|E
60|$|Near {{the verge}} of a bold {{promontory}} stands the hotel, and looks southeastward over a sweep of sea unbroken to the horizon. Behind it stretches the vast forest, which after two hundred years has resumed the sterile coast wrested from it by the first Pilgrims, and has begun to efface the evidences of the inroad made in recent years by the bold speculator for whom Jocelyn's is named. The young birches and spruces are breast high in the drives and avenues at Jocelyn's; the low blackberry vines and the sweet fern cover the carefully-graded sidewalks, and obscure the divisions of the lots; the children of the boarders have found squawberries in the public square on the spot where the band-stand was to have been. The notion of a sea-side resort at this point was courageously conceived, and to a certain extent it was generously realized. Except for its remoteness from the railroad, a drawback which future enterprise might be expected to remedy in some way, the place has many natural advantages. The broad plateau is cooled by a breeze from the vast forests behind it, which comes laden with health and freshness from the young pines; the sea at its feet is warmed by the Gulf Stream to a temperature delicious for bathing. There are certainly mosquitoes from the woods; but there are mosquitoes everywhere, and the report <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> driven away by them is manifestly untrue, for whoever comes to Jocelyn's remains. The beach {{at the foot of the}} bluff is almost a mile at its curve, and it is so smooth and hard that it glistens like polished marble when newly washed by the tide. It is true that you reach it from the top by a flight of eighty steps, but it was intended to have an elevator, like those near the Whirlpool at Niagara. In the mean time it is easy enough to go down, and the ladies go down every day, taking their novels or their needle-work with them. They have various notions of a bath: some conceive that it is bathing to sit in the edge of the water, and emit shrieks as the surge sweeps against them; others run boldly in, and after a moment of poignant hesitation jump up and down half-a-dozen times, and run out; yet others imagine it better to remain immersed to the chin for a given space, looking toward the shore with lips tightly shut and the breath held. But after the bath they are all of one mind; they lay their shawls on the warm sand, and, spreading out their hair to dry, they doze in the sun, in such coils and masses as the unconscious figure lends itself to. When they rise from their beds, they sit in the shelter of the cliff and knit or sew, while one of them reads aloud, and another stands watch to announce the coming of the seals, which frequent a reef near the shore in great numbers. It has been said at rival points on the coast that the ladies linger there in despair of ever being able to remount to the hotel. A young man who clambered along the shore from one of those points reported finding day after day the same young lady stretched out on the same shawl, drying the same yellow hair, who had apparently never gone upstairs since the season began. But the recurrence of this phenomenon in this spot at the very moment when the young man came by might have been accounted for upon other theories. Jocelyn's was so secluded that she could not have expected any one to find her there twice, and if she had expected this she would not have permitted it. Probably he saw a different young lady each time.|$|E
