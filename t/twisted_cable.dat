It was gold lit on the left hand, {{catching}} the sunlight, and below and to the right clear and cold in the shadow. Above the shadowy grey Council House that stood in the midst of it, the great black banner of the surrender still hung in sluggish folds against the blazing sunset. Severed rooms, halls and passages gaped strangely, broken masses of metal projected dismally from the complex wreckage, vast masses of <b>twisted</b> <b>cable</b> dropped like tangled seaweed, and from its base came a tumult of innumerable voices, violent concussions, and the sound of trumpets. All about this great white pile was a ring of desolation; the smashed and blackened masses, the gaunt foundations and ruinous lumber of the fabric that had been destroyed by the Council's orders, skeletons of girders, Titanic masses of wall, forests of stout pillars. Amongst the sombre wreckage beneath, running water flashed and glistened, and far away across the space, out of the midst of a vague vast mass of buildings, there thrust the twisted end of a water-main, two hundred feet in the air, thunderously spouting a shining cascade. And everywhere great multitudes of people.|$|E

50|$|Sculpture: spirals—At the {{periphery}} is a sharp flange-like carina Above this, {{about one-third of}} the distance to the suture, is a second, almost equally strong and prominent, which forms a shoulder to the whorls. The space between this and the suture is divided pretty equally by two threads, the lower of which is feeble. On the upper whorls all of these are closely beaded, on the body whorl only the two highest are so. Below the carina is another remote strong thread, which meets the outer lip. Within it is another, not quite so strong nor so distan. Occupying the space from this to the middle are five flat close-set threads, followed by three rather more separated and roughly beaded threads. The innermost of which, like a <b>twisted</b> <b>cable,</b> forms a sort of columella with a chink between it and the sharp edge of the columellar region of the inner lip, and advances into a small tooth at the angle where it joins the outer lip on the base.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of current distribution and redistribution in superconducting cables requires {{the knowledge of}} the electric coupling among strands, and in particular the interstrand resistance and inductance values.

In this paper we describe a model of a multi-stage <b>twisted</b> <b>cable</b> with arbitrary geometry {{that can be used to}} study the range of interstrand resistances and inductances that is associated with variations of geometry.

40|$|Abstract: Inverted {{pendulum}} is {{a classical}} example and a famous tool for testing {{the effectiveness of}} many control schemes. Owing to their nonlinearity and unstable characteristic, a controller development either for swinging-up or stabilizing its upright position had been a great interest of many researchers. In this paper, the swinging-up control of the inverted pendulum using energy control will be presented. However, the saturation function in its control law could harm the experimental equipments. In addition, this swinging-up method did not consider limited sector of the arm angle to avoid another hazard, for instance, the <b>twisted</b> <b>cable</b> in the apparatus. Therefore, in this paper the position control of the arm angle using simple PD control {{in accordance with the}} energy control is proposed. Consequently, the limited arm sector angle can be achieved and the saturation function can also be replaced effectively by the PD control...|$|E
40|$|Polymerization of {{a series}} of novel acetylenic {{monomers}} bearing different hydrophilic entities such as ethylene glycols (1), amino acids (2), saccharides (3), and nucleosides (4) has been studied. The monomers can be successfully polymerized by Rh-based complexes, but not by metathesis catalysts such as WCl 6 and MoCl 5. 1 H NMR spectroscopy revealed strong signals characteristic of cis olefinic protons of the polymers, indicative of their high stereoregularities. Such signals, however, became unclear (broader) for the amino acid-containing polyacetylenes when less polar solvents like chloroform, dichloromethane, were used, demonstrating that their polymer chains were folded and their molecular motions were hence restricted by internal hydrogen bonding. Polyacetylene is a symmetric chain of conjugated macromolecule, whose chain symmetry can, however, be broken by external and internal perturbations, generating spirally rotating molecular wires. The external approach involves the use of asymmetric force field and interactive complexing agents, while the internal one involves the covalent attachment of stereogenic pendants to the conjugated backbone at the molecular level. Incorporation of above naturally occurring building blocks (2 - 4) into the polyacetylene structure therefore results in the formation of not only amphiphilic but also optically active polymers, whose chain helicity can be continuously and reversibly tuned by simple external stimuli such as solvent, pH, temperature, and additive. Such tuned behaviors have been fully imaged in their corresponding circular dichroism activities and optical rotations, illustrating that stabilization of their single-handed helical conformations relies on intra- and inter-chain hydrogen bonds and is affected by bulkiness of the pendant groups of the macromolecular chains. The amphiphilic polyacetylenes, in response to the changes in their environments, self-associate into robust organizational morphologies reminiscent of natural hierarchical structures such as helix, sphere, <b>twisted</b> <b>cable,</b> twisted ribbon, vesicle, tubule, twisted tubule, hairpin loop, extended fibril, coiling ribbon, honeycomb pattern, and mollusk shape. Some of the structures have been rarely reported in scientific literature. AFM and TEM observations revealed co-existence of the vesicular and nanotubular structures, strongly supporting that formation of the tubules resembles the biological architectural process, as resulted from coalescence of the vesicles. Further variation of the tubular structure promoted the formation of multi-stranded helical tubes by winding up the single-stranded nanotubules. The ethylene glycol-containing amphiphiles are capable of forming micellar structures, driving crystal growth of carbazole molecules to form unique intriguing morphologies depending on the structure of the pendant groups. Biological studies revealed that the amino acid-containing polyacetylenes are generally biocompatible with HeLa cells without serious cytotoxicity effects up to a dosage of 22. 24 μg/cm 2. Growth of the HeLa cells can be stimulated by the addition of a small amount of a monosaccharide-containing polyacetylene...|$|E
