5|$|US Internet also {{provides}} wired fiber optic connections that were available, as of April 2014, to around 12,600 residents of Minneapolis.

Later that year, the company announced plans to bring its internet services farther afield <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area and nationally. US Internet announced in December of the same year that it would bring 10 Gbit/s service to Minneapolis making it the first municipality in the world to have access at that speed.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, {{a credit}} dispute between {{universal}} primer technology and DNA barcoding came to light. Verma {{has argued that}} DNA barcoding, a technique independently described by zoologist Paul D N Hebert in 2003, {{is essentially the same}} as universal primer technology (UPT) and that both utilize standardized, short stretch of DNA from mitochondrial genome, amplified using the specific universal primers, to assign the identity of an unknown biological sample to a particular species. Verma claimed that UPT was described earlier than DNA barcoding in his patents, and publication; therefore, it should be fairly credited. However, Hebert argued that he was not aware of UPT because its patents were not visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> scientific community due to a substantial interval from its filing in 2001 to grant in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} USB1.0 specification, {{which was}} introduced in January 1996, defined data transfer rates of 1.5Mbit/s Low Speed and 12Mbit/s Full Speed. Microsoft Windows 95, OSR 2.1 provided OEM support for the devices. The first widely used version of USB was 1.1, which was released in September 1998. The 12Mbit/s data rate was intended for higher-speed devices such as disk drives, and the lower 1.5Mbit/s rate for low data rate devices such as joysticks. Apple Inc.'s iMac was the first mainstream product with USB and the iMac's success popularized USB itself. Following Apple's design decision to remove all legacy ports from the iMac, many PC manufacturers began building legacy-free PCs, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> PC market using USB as a standard.|$|E
5|$|When the French colonized Madagascar in 1896, initial Betsimisaraka {{satisfaction}} {{with the fall of}} the Merina government rapidly evolved into displeasure with French control. This led to an uprising the same year among Betsimisaraka, particularly including the bandits and other outlaws who had long been living according to their own law in the eastern rainforests; the movement extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> Betsimisaraka population, who mounted a strong resistance to French rule between 1897-1899. These efforts were eventually subdued. After regaining control, the French colonial authority took steps to address the repercussions of historical subjugation of the Betsimisaraka by the Merina kingdom, providing increased access to basic education as well as opportunities for paid labor at plantations, but often on former Betsimisaraka land that the French authorities had forced local inhabitants to relinquish to colonists.|$|E
5|$|On {{becoming}} king in 1272, Edward I reestablished royal power, overhauling {{the royal}} finances and appealing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>broader</b> English elite by using Parliament to authorise {{the raising of}} new taxes and to hear petitions concerning abuses of local governance. This political balance collapsed under Edward II and savage civil wars broke out during the 1320s. Edward III restored order once more {{with the help of}} a majority of the nobility, exercising power through the exchequer, the common bench and the royal household. This government was better organised and on a larger scale than ever before, and by the 14th century the king's formerly peripatetic chancery had to take up permanent residence in Westminster. Edward used Parliament even more than his predecessors to handle general administration, to legislate and to raise the necessary taxes to pay for the wars in France. The royal lands—and incomes from them—had diminished over the years, and increasingly frequent taxation was required to support royal initiatives. Edward held elaborate chivalric events in an effort to unite his supporters around the symbols of knighthood. The ideal of chivalry continued to develop throughout the 14th century, reflected in the growth of knightly orders (including the Order of the Garter), grand tournaments and round table events.|$|E
