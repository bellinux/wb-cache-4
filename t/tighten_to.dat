5|$|Sose {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to New Caledonia early on April 8, passing about 280 km (175 mi) to the northeast. A strong area of high pressure over New Zealand served to <b>tighten</b> <b>to</b> surface pressure gradient {{well to the}} south of Sose's center, contributing to an overall very large envelope of gale-force winds. In turn, the cyclone affected numerous islands on both side of its path, despite never having made landfall. As it progressed on its southeastward track, the cyclone began to show signs of weakening, at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough. At the same time, a mid-level ridge to the east forced the storm to turn due south; the conflicting wind patterns undermined the cyclone's circulation, causing its center at the surface to separate from the deep convection. Both the FMS and the JTWC reflected steady weakening, and by early on April 10, the center had become exposed and ill-defined. Sose then entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand, where it continued to deteriorate. The JTWC issued its last warning on 19P at 0600 UTC on April 11, while the system was located about 335km (210mi) northeast of Norfolk Island. TCWC Wellington soon downgraded Sose to a tropical depression as it underwent an extratropical transition. Drifting south-southwestward, the cyclone lost its tropical identity early on April 12. The remnant low ultimately moved over the Tasman Sea, where it was absorbed by a broad low pressure system about to travel over New Zealand's North Island. Abundant residual tropical moisture acted on the low pressure environment to create widespread precipitation across northern New Zealand.|$|E

50|$|Existing {{regulation}} in local capital market like taxes, information asymmetry and foreign ownership restrictions usually act as barriers and prevent foreign investors entering those markets. In addition, local investors in segmented domestic capital markets {{in order to}} undertake the risk <b>tighten</b> <b>to</b> the local market usually require a risk premium. In order to counter these problem domestic firms can adopt policies such as listing in a foreign exchange in order to offset {{the negative effects of}} market segmentation and offer several other straightforward advantages that stem from lower transaction costs (Khurana et al., 2005). Further more, cross border listing serves as a mean for foreign investors to save any transaction costs associated with dealing in a foreign currency as well as to effectively bend any existing foreign exchange regulations since they are allowed to trade share in their own currency. Taken into account that cross-listing serves to lower barriers to foreign investment cross-border listing serves effectively in reducing the firms costs related to market segmentation and therefore lowers the cost of external financing (Alexander et al. cited in Khurana et al., 2005).|$|E

5000|$|Reported from Mendha, this {{is active}} method {{of the fish}} trapping. Kurjar is a dome of bamboo (shaped just like a {{satellite}} antenna disc) made up of 12 bamboo sticks (locally called kurjar guta) arranged in circle and <b>tighten</b> <b>to</b> each other {{with the help of}} rope. To these sticks, nylon mesh is tightly attached (initially instead of nylon threads fiber from the boyal tree were in use). Mesh size measured 15×15 mm at lower wide end and 20×20 mm towards rear end. After assembly, circumference of the dome becomes 21.5 ft and height becomes 130 cm. Its application is very interesting: during monsoon flood when the shoal of migrating fishes seen by a knowledgeable individual, running from the bank into river kurjar drop on migrating fishes. Fish trapped under kurjar are collected by hand. Observation during its application reveals that it was not much effective; as it is very much time consuming compared with the low yield. To use kurjar {{it is important to have}} knowledge about the migratory behavior of the fishes.(Heda, 2007) ...|$|E
50|$|Different {{phases of}} {{digestion}} take place including: the cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase {{occurs at the}} sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food {{at this point and}} thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine.The intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to <b>tighten</b> <b>to</b> prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.|$|E
50|$|Epiretinal {{membrane}} is {{a disease}} of the eye in response {{to changes in the}} vitreous humor or more rarely, diabetes. It is also called macular pucker. Sometimes, as a result of immune system response to protect the retina, cells converge in the macular area as the vitreous ages and pulls away in posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). PVD can create minor damage to the retina, stimulating exudate, inflammation, and leucocyte response. These cells can form a transparent layer gradually and, like all scar tissue, <b>tighten</b> <b>to</b> create tension on the retina which may bulge and pucker (e.g., macular pucker), or even cause swelling or macular edema. Often this results in distortions of vision that are clearly visible as bowing ←→ when looking at lines on chart paper (or an Amsler grid) within the macular area, or central 1.0 degree of visual arc. Usually it occurs in one eye first, and may cause binocular diplopia or double vision if the image from one eye is too different from the image of the other eye. The distortions can make objects look different in size (usually larger = macropsia), especially in the central portion of the visual field, creating a localized or field dependent aniseikonia that cannot be fully corrected optically with glasses. Partial correction often improves the binocular vision considerably though. In the young (under 50 years of age), these cells occasionally pull free and disintegrate on their own; but in the majority of sufferers (over 60 years of age) the condition is permanent. The underlying photoreceptor cells, rod cells and cone cells, are usually not damaged unless the membrane becomes quite thick and hard; so usually there is no macular degeneration.|$|E

40|$|Market Committee (FOMC) affect market {{perceptions}} {{of the degree of}} uncertainty about the future course of interest rates. The FOMC influences expectations about interest rates most directly by changing its target for the federal funds rate and by announcing its bias with respect to possible future target changes.

Furthermore, starting with its May 18, 1999, meeting, the FOMC has announced its adopted bias for possible future target changes at the conclusion of each meeting.
