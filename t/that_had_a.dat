5|$|At {{the same}} time, there was common resentment against the reactionary attitudes {{prevailing}} in Court circles {{even before the}} uproar sparked by the notorious banquet precipitated the political aspects of the march.

5|$|In 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin {{detected}} {{bursts of}} radio signals coming from Jupiter at 22.2MHz. The period of these bursts matched {{the rotation of}} the planet, and they were also able to use this information to refine the rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> duration of less than a hundredth of a second.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Berkeley {{scientists}} {{claimed the}} discovery of element 103 in the reaction of californium with boron and carbon ions.

They assigned this to 255102 without giving a reason for the assignment. The values do not agree with those now known for 255No, although they do agree with those now known for 257No, and while this isotope probably played a part in this experiment its discovery was inconclusive.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Hans Kelker {{succeeded in}} synthesizing a {{substance}} <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> nematic phase at room temperature, MBBA, {{which is one}} of the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research. The next step to commercialization of liquid-crystal displays was the synthesis of further chemically stable substances (cyanobiphenyls) with low melting temperatures by George Gray. That work with Ken Harrison and the UK MOD (RRE Malvern), in 1973, led to design of new materials resulting in rapid adoption of small area LCDs within electronic products.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, heat-seeking {{missiles}} were developed <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> range {{greater than the}} visual acuity of pilots. Aircraft camouflage now had two major threats {{that it was not}} able to fully defeat—radar and infrared detection. Camouflage accordingly became less important. However, by the 1980s, aircraft such as the ground attack A-10 Thunderbolt (Warthog) were painted in camouflage schemes that included both disruptive ground coloration and automimicry (deceptive self-imitation), {{in the form of a}} false canopy on the underside.|$|E

5|$|It is the {{eleventh}} {{entry in the}} Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series and the successor to , a tactical shooter <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> larger focus on narrative. However, Patriots was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, and the team decided to reboot the franchise. The team evaluated {{the core of the}} Rainbow Six franchise and believed that letting players impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual counter-terrorism units, and looked at real-life examples of sieges. Powered by AnvilNext 2.0, the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to create destructible environments.|$|E
