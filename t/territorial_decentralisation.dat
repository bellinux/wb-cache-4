A significantly lower level of urban development appears in the south, while increase in entrepreneurial activities as a “part of urban development” occurs in northern parts. Urban governance in southern European regions is determined by institutional and <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralisation</b> and a week participation in urban development programmes.|$|E
40|$|After {{thirty years}} of the Spanish {{territorial}} model being implemented, an important number of citizens in different regions are supporting higher levels of self-government. This article analyses the causal mechanisms put forward by the literature on <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralisation</b> to explain this phenomenon. The Spanish case is employed to quantitatively test the various explanations regarding support for decentralisation. Using a linear hierarchical model we show that, even in those regions without a different sub-national identity, citizens ’ evaluation of the regional governments ’ public policies is crucial in explaining support for a stronger regional government. In analysing political attitudes towards decentralisation, we highlight the importance of party competition as a crucial determinant, {{as well as the}} necessity to consider decentralisation as an endogenous process, in which parties and citizens interact and affect the final territorial model...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of national administrative institutions on contemporary reforms {{has often been}} noted but insufficiently tested. This article enriches the comparative perspective of administrative reform policies by focusing on four interrelated dimensions: the choices of reformers, institutional constraints, timing and sequencing and long-term trajectories. This article tries to determine whether most similar administrative systems exhibit analogous contemporary reform trajectories in content, timing and sequence. By comparing the administrative reform policies of two ‘most similar’ Napoleonic countries, France and Spain, this article analyses the commonalities and divergences of <b>decentralisation,</b> <b>territorial</b> state reorganisation, civil service reforms and policies that focus on performance management and organisational design. The article identifies the ‘causal mechanisms’ that characterise the specific role of institutions and considers both the role of context {{and the importance of}} policy intersections...|$|R
40|$|This article explores {{under what}} {{conditions}} regional governments tend to have larger or smaller cabinets. The main contention is that cross-regional variation in cabinet size is partly explained by the dynamics {{set up by the}} multilevel system of government, mainly <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralisation,</b> multilevel government (in) congruence or the existence of nationally distinct regions. The hypotheses are tested with a new and original dataset built upon the Spanish case (1979 – 2015). Findings show that regions with more welfare state policies, especially when the region’s economic capacity is high, and nationally distinct regions tend to have bigger executives. In contrast, decentralisation in the form of basic state functions and government incongruence do not have a significant effect. Results have important implications for our understanding of sub-national territorial institutions and their interaction with decentralisation dynamics...|$|E
30|$|Within the {{processes}} of <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralisation,</b> the city region {{has emerged as a}} significant framework of sub-national economic analyses and development planning (Coombes and Champion 2011). This focus has received additional impetus recently by the promotion of ‘Regional Urbanisation’ (Soja 2000), ‘Metropolitan Regions’ (Katz and Bradley 2013), and the apparent linkages between city-region governance systems and economic performance (Ahrend et al. 2014). Academics and policy-makers have long been concerned that “metropolitan regions are chaotic and ungovernable” places (Storper 2013 : 1). Often, the planning and implementation of economic interventions at the city-region scale requires the co-ordination of many different institutional actors (Brenner 2004), and the alignment of local institutional arrangements with functional economic areas (Crouch 2011). The result is that local public authorities have to spend considerable time building and maintaining city region-wide governance and leadership in order to establish effective municipal cooperation (Ahrend and Schumann 2014; Nelles 2013).|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of the key issues in public economics arising from the process of <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralisation</b> that has taken place in Spain since the restoration of democracy and the Constitution of 1978, and which resulted in the emergence of the “Autonomic State”. The first section focuses on the assignment of competencies between central and regional levels of government and explains in some detail the methodology used to quantify the “effective cost” of the services devolved to the Autonomous Communities (hereinafter ACs). We have paid special attention to health services, which is the most significant item for regional budgets in quantitative terms. The second section deals with revenue assignment, transfers and borrowing, and describes the two systems established to finance regional expenditure. These are the “common system” (régimen común) applied in the majority of the ACs and the “charter system” (régimen foral), which is based on the historical rights accorded to the Basque Country and Navarre. The last section appraises the decentralisation process and notes some emerging issues of debate. Decentralization, revenue assignments...|$|E

Meanwhile, the SDF allegedly offered training to young people in how to stage an effective street demonstration.|$|R

It examines the Bolivian state <b>territorial</b> reconfiguration through <b>decentralisation,</b> with a focus on the impact the process of municipalisation had on indigenous territoriality and social differentiation within Andean communities. It is argued in this thesis that the scope of the Popular Participation Law proves to be more complex in practice than the aims stated by the promoters of the law and by the associated literature. The thesis shows how the municipalisation in fact comes to play a concomitant role in the neoliberal strategy of land property structure modernisation. It also explores how the incorporation of rural Andean indigenous communities into 'national life' as an element of the neoliberal strategies framed on widening the reach of the market come to affect Andean strategies of space management.

40|$|Reform of the {{statutes}} of autonomy was begun in 2005, three decades afterSpain {{began the process}} of <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralisation</b> and two decades afterhaving been sucessfully incorporated into the European Community. Thesereforms took on {{issues related to the}} participation of these Spanish regionsin Europe. Up to now these issues were not dealt with in the Spanish constitutionof 1978 and conflicts could only be resolved through the constitutionalcourt and some other legal and conventional mechanisms (legislativeacts, multilateral agreements or bilateral arrangements, etc.). Although each of the new statutes of autonomy adopted in 2006 in Catalonia,Valencia, Andalusia, and other communities has its own approach (especiallythe rejected proposal of the Basque Country in 2005), either bilateral ormultilateral, their treatment of the participation of autonomous communities in Europe is quite similar. On one hand, the European clauses of thenew statutes aim to strengthen and to open up the different ways that theSpanish regions participate in European Parliament —through its legislativeregional assemblies, in work groups, in the Council of Ministers, in the committeesof the European Commission, in the European Courts, in the Committeeof Regions and also in the development of European regional cooperation. And, on the other hand, the new regional statutes are devoted to improvingthe implementation of EU law, the application of EU policies, the transpositionof European regulations into community legislation, and the channellingof European funds by autonomous administrations...|$|E

ABSTRACT: There {{is no doubt that}} decentralisation has acquired a prominent place in the development policy debates but unfortunately it cannot be a panacea for all development ills. To many, decentralisation of governments and planning is a self-evidently good thing. It will avoid the ills of over-centralization such as insensitivity to local conditions and will also bring fuller organization and participation at sub national level. Decentralisation is viewed as providing an outline which enables lower level units of governance to execute duties and get benefits from natural resources in line with the subsidiary principle. The subsidiary principle posits that duties which can be performed at the local level should be devolved to the local level. Decentralisation seems to combine appeals for planning and democracy. Can it live to these hopes in reality? The limits to government decentralisation include its need for manpower, finance and technical demands. Functional and <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralisation</b> has been blanketed into conflict between objectives of equity, growth, coordination, participation and national integration. The study used participant observation and literature review. One of the conclusions of the study {{is that there is a}} need to strengthen a more democratic and accountable local government in order to be able to implement the decentralized responsibilities. The apparent consequence of devolution is that the central government would be left with core responsibilities such as foreign affairs. Devolution would enable the people of Mashonaland East Province in Zimbabw...|$|E
40|$|Italy is a {{multi-level}} polity where policymaking {{and implementation}} involves {{both public and}} private actors. Both territorial and functional decentralisation {{have an impact on the}} 8 nal results of policy making. In fact, <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralisation</b> implies the delegation of functions to wide multi-purpose tiers of sub-national governance, which has been a central dynamic of Italian governance. Furthermore functional decentralisation stresses the assignment of functions, vertically and horizontally, to single-purpose quasiautonomous agencies. Multi level governance (MLG) aims at understanding the nature and explaining the structure of governance networks, their inter-relationship with control, capacity, accountability and e 9 ciency of political systems (Bache and Flinders, 2004; Piattoni, 2010). To date, only a limited use has been made of this important instrument of analysis, at least in Italy, in transport policy, in general, and in the road sector, in particular. Research in various domains such as political geography (Shaw et al., 2009), regional and urban studies (Kern and Bulkeley, 2009) and institutional economics (Marsden et al., 2009) have all stressed the crucial role governance plays in the transport sector notwithstanding the lack of a common framework of analysis. The paper synthetically reports the de 8 nitions of MLG proposed, describing their characteristics and clarifying their implications for the transport sector, as well as discussing the implications of a speci 8 c MLG for the transport sector regulatory system and for the role of local public authorities. Management and programs of the local road sector in Italy are discussed with a particular focus on the di:erent types of solutions adopted and to the impact on the level of integration among di:erent governance levels. Finally a critical discussion of the situation of the local road sector in Italy, its governability and some suggestions for the future are reported...|$|E
40|$|Inter{{national}} audienceIn {{the shadow}} of a French national narrative which demonises and rejects local specificities, highly differentiated territorial political spaces have been created, shaped by the dynamics of identity, decentralisation, and public policy. This book analyses regions as loose and flexible political spaces, in which institutionalisation is far from being a one-way process. A variety of actors contribute to the upward, downward and horizontal dynamics which make up these spaces. Institutionalising regional space comprises three dimensions: institutionalisation as a result of cultural, social and political mobilisation; via the implementation of policies for territorial justice and decentralisation; and finally via the deployment of a system of regional governance. This analysis of regional power in France paints a picture of a controversial central state undergoing fundamental changes, and of a decentralised republic at a crossroads. It is essential reading for students and researchers working on issues of <b>territorial</b> governance and <b>decentralisation</b> in France and more widely in Europe...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{theoretical}} in nature, {{falling into the}} field of political economy. It provides a theoretical analysis of two hitherto underappreciated principles of political organisation: unbundling the functions of government and devolving responsibilities to non-territorial jurisdictions. This is motivated by inherent limitations of bundled, territorially monopolistic governance. Political economists {{are well aware of}} how majoritarian democratic decision-making necessitates various conflicts and compromises. <b>Territorial</b> <b>decentralisation</b> also bears efficiency limitations because its sorting mechanism requires citizens sacrifice economic and social preferences to satisfy political preferences. Political bundling generates trade-offs that impede preference satisfaction when the bundles offered do not conform to preferences over the fully suite of policies. The theory of unbundled and non-territorial governance is analysed as a means to overcoming these problems. Economic theory from multiple schools (i. e., new institutional, public choice, Austrian) are used to find that greater efficiency and citizen welfare follows from non-territorial unbundling, and clarify the conditions under which it might ever eventuate. The history of these ideas in political-economic thought are traced, and past and contemporary cases of non-territorial unbundling are uncovered. The &lsquo;pure&rsquo; version of the theory has yet to fully arise in practice, but emerging examples of cryptographic &lsquo;virtual states&rsquo; come close to realising non-territorial unbundled forms of political organisation. Next the &lsquo;political-jurisdictional Coase theorem&rsquo; is used to describe how political systems and jurisdictions change. It is the relative imposition of transaction cost over different modes of jurisdictional change as well as wealth effects that enable or prevent non-territorial unbundling. In addition the &lsquo;political-jurisdictional possibilities frontier&rsquo; describes the space of possible allocations of property rights and political authority, given the prevalence of market, political, and jurisdictional transaction costs; and the &lsquo;political-jurisdictional transformation frontier&rsquo; shows the compact trajectory of actual allocations that obtain, given the prevalence of ideas, interests, and wealth effects. Together these explain the conditions of possible emergence or implementation of non-territorial unbundling. A model of partial internal exit captures the competitive dynamic between incumbent and potential governments in a non-territorial unbundled system. This model particularly applies to &lsquo;cryptosecession&rsquo; which appears the most likely avenue for non-territorial unbundling. Fiscal exploitation is reduced and eventually eliminated as the capability of citizens to move to non-territorial and unbundled jurisdictions increases. As a model of cryptosecession, the balance of citizen opacity and government legibility determines the balance of fiscal exploitation versus equivalence. Follwing Austro-evolutionary theory, the &# 039;knowledge problem of the nation-state&rsquo; is the task of designing a political-jurisdictional order given that requisite knowledge is dispersed throughout a polity. Redrawing borders or executing population transfers have proven failures in rational constructivist planning. Conversely, spontaneously ordered political jurisdictions is the general solution to the knowledge problem of the nation-state, which is termed a &lsquo;constellaxy. &rsquo; The pure theory of non-territorial unbundling resembles to a constellaxy, {{and in the absence of}} a constitutional mechanism, a solution can be found in technologies of cryptosecession. While speculative in nature, such discussions are necessary to advance the quality of governance and meet with the challenges of an increasingly complex future...|$|E
