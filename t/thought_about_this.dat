25|$|But {{the other}} day I was kind of tired, and my dad {{suddenly}} sprung on me {{the fact that my}} submarine had been causing a tremendous amount of difficulty in the mouth of the Columbia River. Hadn't <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> thing for years. Of course, it's all shot to ribbons, this thing. It's got jagged steel sticking out at all ends and angles, and it's a big submarine! It's a— I don't know, {{about the size of the}} first Narwhal that we built. And the fishermen coming in there and fishing are dragging their nets around in that area, and it's just tearing their nets to ribbons— they've even hired a civilian contractor to try to blow the thing up and get it the devil out of there— and has evidently been raising bob with postwar fishing here for more years than I'd care to count.|$|E
25|$|At the North Pole, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} attempt to save their fellow base personnel, who have been taken over by crab-like creatures. Their effort is interrupted as the Doctor and Clara arrive on the scene. While introductions are being made, however, they come under attack from the crabs, only to be rescued by Santa, who also provides a specimen of one of the creatures. The Doctor identifies the creatures as Dream Crabs – aliens that induce pleasant, euphoric dreams on their intended victims as a distraction whilst the crabs devour their brains. During this time, both the Doctor and Clara reveal that they had lied to each other during their last meeting: Clara lied about her dead boyfriend, Danny Pink, having returned from the Nethersphere, while the Doctor falsely claimed to have found Gallifrey. While investigating the Dream Crabs, the Doctor sends Clara to recover Santa's specimen, only for him to remember that they use telepathic connections to their intended victims to see their surroundings, but only when they are being <b>thought</b> <b>about.</b> <b>This</b> causes the specimen in the lab to come alive and attack Clara.|$|E
500|$|Under Georgia law, appeals {{of death}} penalty cases had {{to be based on}} errors of law, not a reevaluation of the {{evidence}} presented at trial. The appeals process began with a reconsideration by the original trial judge. The defense presented a written appeal alleging 115 procedural problems. These included claims of jury prejudice, intimidation of the jury by the crowds outside the courthouse, the admission of Conley's testimony concerning Frank's alleged sexual perversions and activities, and the return of a verdict based on an improper weighing of the evidence. Both sides called forth witnesses involving the charges of prejudice and intimidation; while the defense relied on non-involved witness testimony, the prosecution found support from the testimony of the jurors themselves. On October 31, 1913, Judge Roan denied the motion, adding, [...] "I have <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> case more than any other I have ever tried. With all the thought I have put on this case, I am not thoroughly convinced that Frank is guilty or innocent. But I {{do not have to be}} convinced. The jury was convinced. There is no room to doubt that." ...|$|E

Szilárd and Einstein knew each other well and had worked together years previously, but Einstein had never <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> possibility for nuclear energy until Szilard reported it to him, {{at the beginning of his}} quest to produce the Einstein-Szilárd letter to alert the U.S. government.|$|E

Qiao Zhou became worried {{but he could not}} find someone to talk to, so he wrote a 12-character mantra on a pillar which foreshadowed the conquest of Shu by Wei a year later. After the fall of Shu, when people praised Qiao Zhou for making an accurate prediction, he said, [...] "I may have <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> myself, but I only came up with it after expanding and deriving from the sayings of Du Qiong.

However, after a few weeks, the First World War began, closing the Russian border for an indefinite period. A year later he married Bella Rosenfeld and they had their first child, Ida. Before the marriage, Chagall had difficulty convincing Bella's parents that he would be a suitable husband for their daughter. They were worried about her marrying a painter from a poor family and wondered how he would support her. Becoming a successful artist now became a goal and inspiration. According to Lewis, [...] "he euphoric paintings of this time, which show the young couple floating balloon-like over Vitebsk—its wooden buildings faceted in the Delaunay manner—are the most lighthearted of his career".

2500|$|Frequently in interviews, Maus {{advocates for}} [...] "truth" [...] in music. Flavorwires Tom Hawking argues that [...] "he's an {{interesting}} case because his music doesn’t necessarily discuss {{the ideas that}} seem to inform it" [...] unless one considers that the [...] "relative simplicity of his songs, both lyrically and musically, {{is a way of}} getting at fundamental truths." [...] Jordan Redmond of Tiny Mix Tapes writes that Maus [...] "bristles at the sort of obfuscated discourse often created and upheld by, as he would have it, the sophisticated and exclusionary contemporary art world," [...] and that rather than aspiring to be [...] "anti-intellectual," [...] his music [...] "only seeks to be the pinnacle of inclusion, and by embracing a form that has stroked the ears of the general populace {{for the better part of}} three decades, Maus looks to not only generate enjoyment but also discussion." [...] Slant Magazines Matthew Cole dismissed Maus' philosophical writings as [...] "a parody of post-structuralist social theory" [...] and his music as [...] "obviously some kind of art-school mindfuckery". According to Maus, he does not think about aesthetic theory when [...] "working over the keyboard, or musing over musical ideas in my head. But when discussing it, we want to have some new <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> new music. I wouldn't claim that my music is new, but generally speaking pop music begs for some kind of radical new way of talking about it."
