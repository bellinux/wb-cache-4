25|$|Levko Revutsky further {{developed}} the methods of Lysenko and Leontovych. He enriched Ukrainian music with his individual stylistic discoveries. The composer's style of Revutsky was formed {{on the basis of}} deep and comprehensive understanding of Ukrainian folk melody and traditions of modern professional music. Life-asserting attitude, lyricism, restraint, breadth and riches of emotions, are inherent in the works of <b>this</b> <b>artist.</b> His measured, expressive melody unites with the saturated, difficult harmony. Revutsky exposed reality and in lyrical-dramatic, and in lyrical-epic keys.|$|E
25|$|Let us admit, in any case, {{that among}} us now – if mostly still hidden – are many {{or all of}} the seeds of our future art, and not in museums overseas, and not in the homes of famous foreign dealers. Let us honor the rare ones, our rebellious spirits who, like <b>this</b> <b>artist,</b> before denying others, find {{affirmation}} in themselves; that instead of destroying, seek to build. Let us honor those who struggle so that the soul of our country can be more beautiful.|$|E
25|$|Tansen, born in Behat, {{trained in}} music at Vrindavan, served Raja Ramchandra Waghela of Bandhawgarh, {{then went to}} Agra under the {{patronage}} of Akbar. An exponent of the Hindustani classical music's dhrupad style, he was counted among the Nine Jewels of the Royal Court. After the death of Tansen in Fatehpur Sikri and cremation in Agra, his ashes were buried in Gwalior. In remembrance of <b>this</b> <b>artist</b> there is a tomb constructed in Gwalior called the Tansen Tomb. Tansen Festival started in the 1930s.

25|$|One of {{the most}} famous people to come from Papantla is artist Teodoro Cano Garcia, who was a disciple of Diego Rivera. During much of the 20th century, <b>this</b> <b>artist</b> worked to promote Papantla’s native Totonac heritage. He is {{responsible}} for most of the sculptures and other public art works that {{can be seen in the}} town today. Some of these include the “Evolution of the Totonac Culture” mural on the side of the main church, the “History of Papantla” mural which is on the side of the Chapel of Cristo Rey and the Monumento del Volador, a giant statue which is on a hill in the center of the city.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for <b>this</b> <b>artist</b> at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E
25|$|The Rochester Bestiary is a {{parchment}} manuscript {{dating from}} c. 12301240. Its principle contents are a bestiary, {{but it also}} contains a short lapidary (a treatise on stones) in French prose and, as the flyleaves, two leaves of a 14th-century service book. It is illustrated with 55 finished miniatures of various animals, each {{at the end of}} the passage describing that animal. On some pages, instructions to the illuminator are visible, briefly describing what the planned picture should depict. About a third of the way through the manuscript (f. 52v and following, after the vulture), the illustrations cease: while spaces remain where they were intended to be placed, no illustrations were ever added. The style of the miniatures shows some evidence that the illustrations were made as much as a decade or more after the initial production of the text, and it is possible that the artist did not fully understand the projected plan envisioned by the scribe: by adding a fourth picture of a lion, instead of the planned three, he forced subsequent illustrations to be placed after the animals they described, instead of before. Three other extant manuscripts feature illuminations by this artist: Cambridge, University Library, MS. Ee.2.23 (a Bible), Peterborough, Cathedral Library, MS. 10 (a Bible), and Stockholm, National Museum, MS. B. 2010 (a psalter). A fourth manuscript (Turin, Biblioteca Nazionale, Cod. L.IV.25) contained two full-page miniatures from <b>this</b> <b>artist,</b> but was destroyed in 1904.|$|E

500|$|In 1876 Laurance P. Roberts {{wrote in}} his Dictionary of Japanese Artists that Kunichika {{produced}} prints of actors and other subjects in the late Kunisada tradition, reflecting the declining taste of the Japanese and the deterioration of color printing. Roberts described him as, [...] "A minor artist, but represents {{the last of the}} great ukiyo-e tradition." [...] The cited biography reflects the author's preference for classical ukiyo-e. Richard A. Waldman, owner of The Art of Japan, said of Roberts's view, [...] "Articles such as the above and others by early western authors managed to put <b>this</b> <b>artist</b> in the dustbin of art history." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "The Voice Within" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Chuck Taylor of Billboard praised the [...] "breathtaking and organically flowing" [...] melody, noting that [...] "Aguilera delivers {{what is perhaps}} her most assured vocal yet, punching through the clouds and taking her place as a fist-shaking member of the heavenly choir." [...] Taylor also highlighted that the track [...] "is an inspired recording and a showcase for all that <b>this</b> <b>artist</b> can accomplish when she lets the voice precede that offputting image." [...] Josh Kun from Spin labelled it a [...] "swoony Celine-for-teens ballad". Sal Cinquemani for Slant Magazine gave the song a very positive review, naming it an [...] "inspirational" [...] ballad and praised her powerful vocals. CD Universe also praised Aguilera's [...] "rich, throaty style" [...] vocals on the track and compared the song to works by Mariah Carey. Sputnikmusic's critic Amanda Murray commented that the song is [...] "tacky" [...] yet [...] "powerful all the same". Rachel McRady of Wetpaint complimented the song's inspiration melody, declaring that it [...] "basically reduces us to tears every time we hear it".|$|E
500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from <b>this</b> <b>artist</b> in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E
