It was claimed by Sergeant Roberts of A Squadron, 23rd Hussars, 11th Armoured Division in a Sherman tank near Beauvais, although {{it had already been}} disabled and abandoned by its crew following damage to its tracks and final drive. There is a photograph showing <b>this</b> <b>vehicle</b> after its final action in a beet field with its turret turned 90°. <b>This</b> <b>vehicle</b> is currently on display at Bovington Tank Museum, in Dorset, UK.|$|E

5|$|The {{most famous}} of the fake Wrecks is a 1931 Ford Model A Cabriolet known as the Centennial Wreck. <b>This</b> <b>vehicle</b> was {{refurbished}} along with the real Wreck in 1985. The vehicle followed the Ramblin' Wreck onto the field all of the 1985 football season and was raffled for $250,000 by Pete George and Georgia Tech in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and the mid-1940s, several {{variants}} of the Panzer I were designed, {{especially during the}} later years of its combat history. Because they were obsolescent from their introduction, incapable of defeating foreign armor, and outclassed by newer German tanks, the PanzerI chassis were increasingly adapted as tank destroyers and other variants. One of the best-known variants was the kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen ("small armoured command vehicle"), built on the Ausf. A and Ausf. B chassis—200 of these were manufactured. The Panzer I Ausf. B chassis was also used to build the German Army's first tracked tank destroyer, the Panzerjäger I. <b>This</b> <b>vehicle</b> was armed with a Czech 47-millimeter (1.85in) anti-tank gun.|$|E
5|$|Bovington Tank Museum, Dorset, UK. Tiger II {{with early}} {{production}} turret is on display. <b>This</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{was the second}} soft steel prototype made and did not see active service. This Tiger II's engine was removed {{for use in the}} restoration of Tiger 131, the only working example of a Tiger I. A production turret Tiger II is on loan from the Defence Academy, Shrivenham, UK. See below.|$|E

5|$|Engine {{starting}} {{was achieved}} {{by a combination of}} compressed air and a hand-turned magneto; however, starting problems were encountered during pre-race testing at Calshot due to moisture in the air and water contamination of the fuel. A complicated test procedure was devised to ensure clean fuel for competition flights since more than 0.3% water content made it unusable. As expected, minor engine failures continued to be experienced, and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted Rolls-Royce Phantom I motor car. Travelling mostly after dark, <b>this</b> <b>vehicle</b> became known as the Phantom of The Night.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Dull began {{a search}} for a new {{official}} symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search would entail newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate <b>this</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960. Dean Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Lexus {{introduced}} the IS line, {{a series of}} entry-level sport sedans. In 2001, the first convertible was introduced, {{as well as the}} SC 430, a redesigned ES 300 and the third generation LS 430. The GX 470 mid-size SUV debuted in 2002, followed by the second generation RX 330 in 2003. The following year, Lexus recorded its 2 millionth U.S. vehicle sale, and the first luxury-branded production hybrid SUV, the RX 400h. <b>This</b> <b>vehicle</b> used Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system that combined gasoline and electric motors.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the museum}} building, an ex-Iraqi Army T-55 tank {{was put on}} display at the main {{entrance}} in August 2008. <b>This</b> <b>vehicle</b> was captured by the Royal Engineers during the opening stages of the Iraq War in 2003. The spot had previously been occupied by an Iraqi ZSU-23-4 Shilka anti-aircraft gun. Captured by the Royal Artillery after the 1991 Gulf War, it was moved from Imperial War Museum Duxford and displayed to mark the museum's fifth anniversary in July 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{next stage}} of {{development}} was to use the T1E2 configuration on the longer chassis of the M3 Half-track, since it could store more ammunition. <b>This</b> <b>vehicle,</b> originally designated as the T1E4, was accepted into production as the M13 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage on 27 July 1942. A total of 1,103 examples of this variant were produced from 27 July 1942 to 15 May 1943. Half of them (583) were converted into M16s by the White Motor Company before reaching the army. Deliveries began in late 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck, {{the iconic}} 1930 Ford Model A Sport coupe {{that serves as}} the {{official}} mascot of the student body, was acquired in this era. The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions, and leads the football team into Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, a duty it has performed since 1961. Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull recognized a need for an official Ramblin' Wreck when he observed the student body's fascination with classic cars. Fraternities, in particular, would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit and enthusiasm. It was considered a rite of passage to own a broken-down vehicle. In 1960, Dull began a search for a new official symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search employed newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate <b>this</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960 when Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot. When Johnson returned to his car, he found a note from Dull attached to his windshield. Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson, after great deliberation, agreed to take $1,000; he eventually returned the money in 1984 so that the car would be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund. The Ramblin' Wreck was officially transferred to the Athletic Association on May 26, 1961.|$|E
