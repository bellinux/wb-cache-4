The key informant was both an Aboriginal spiritual advisor and expert on gangs in the Canadian Prairies. Through <b>thematic</b> narrative <b>analysis,</b> this study provides a narrative depiction of a life that is strongly connected to gangs and presents a number of themes related to desistance from gang life. <b>Thematic</b> narrative <b>analysis</b> of the interview revealed a series of themes including process elements, factors that facilitate desistance and factors that are barriers to desistance...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} explore key stakeholder perceptions on the implementation of POC diagnostics in rural primary healthcare (PHC) clinics in South Africa. Method: We conducted a qualitative study encompassing in-depth interviews with multiple key stakeholders of POC diagnostic services for rural and resource-limited PHC clinics. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim prior to <b>thematic</b> content <b>analysis.</b> <b>Thematic</b> content <b>analysis</b> was conducted using themes guided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) quality-ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User friendly, Rapid and to enable treatment at first visit and Robust, Equipment free and Delivered to those who need it) criteria for POC diagnostic services in resource-limited settings. Results: 11 key stakeholders participated in the study. All stakeholders perceived the main advantage of POC diagnostics as enabling access to healthcare for rural patients. Stakeholders perceived the current POC diagnostic services to have an ability to meet patients’ needs, but recommended further improvement of the following areas: research on cost-effectiveness; improved quality management systems; development of affordable POC diagnostic and clinic-based monitoring and evaluation. Conclusions: Key stakeholders of POC diagnostics in rural PHC clinics in South Africa highlighted the need to assess affordability and ensure quality assurance of current services before adopting new POC diagnostics and scaling up current POC diagnostics...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: to {{describe}} a ‘hearts and minds’ approach to community Baby Friendly Initiative implementation developed from the views of multidisciplinary professionals. Design: a qualitative descriptive study utilising focus groups and interviews, with <b>thematic</b> networks <b>Analysis</b> conducted. Setting: forty-seven professionals were consulted from two primary health-care facilities located in the North-West of England. Findings: <b>thematic</b> networks <b>analysis</b> generated a global theme of a ‘hearts and mind sapproach’ to BFI implementation, which embodies emotional and rational engagement. The three underpinning organising themes (and their associated basic themes) : ‘credible leadership’, ‘engagement of key partners’ and ‘changing attitudes and practice’ reflect the context, processes and outcomes of a ‘hearts and minds’ approach. Conclusions and implications for practice: a ‘hearts and minds’ approach transcends the prescriptive aspects of a macro-level intervention with its emphasis upon audits, training, statistics and ‘hard’ evidence through valuing other professionals and engaging staff at all levels. It offers insights into how organisational change may move beyond traditional top-down mechanisms for driving change to incorporate ways that value others and promote cooperation and reflection...|$|R
