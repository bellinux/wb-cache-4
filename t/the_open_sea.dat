50|$|Gradually, however, {{countries}} {{agreed that}} <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>seas</b> {{should be free}} to all shipping in peacetime and to neutral shipping in wartime. Great Britain accepted the principle in 1805; Russia, in 1824; and the United States (tacitly) in 1894. Many treaties, including the Treaty of Versailles, have dealt with <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>seas,</b> and currently <b>the</b> United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea formalizes this freedom.|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades the global {{security}} situation has seen some drastic changes. The operational scope of the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN) has expanded from operations on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>seas</b> to operations both on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>seas</b> and in littoral waters. A considerable part of the relevant operations now take place outside NATO territory. This shift in focus will result in an increasing number of expeditionary operations. Expeditionary operations consist of the following phases: departure – transit – arrival in the littoral – military operations in the littoral. Traditional anti-submarine warfare on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>seas</b> is based on a mobile task group in transit in which the opponent’s operations are restricted by the speed of advance of the task group. After arrival in the littoral, however, the task group operates stationary, e. g. as part of a sea base. Such stationary operations are relatively new and new types of problems emerge: different types of threat may come from various directions, the possibility of blue-on-blue engagements increases, current sensor and weapon systems have not been optimised for stationary operations, etc...|$|R
5|$|Transparency is common, even dominant, {{in animals}} of <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> {{especially}} those that live in relatively shallow waters. It is found in plankton of many species, as well as larger animals such as jellyfish, salps (floating tunicates), and comb jellies.|$|E
5|$|A dolphinarium is an {{aquarium}} for dolphins. The dolphins are usually {{kept in a}} large pool, though occasionally they may be kept in pens in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> either for research or for public performances. Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public, others are part of larger parks, such as marine mammal parks, zoos or theme parks, with other animals and attractions as well.|$|E
5|$|As Christopher Landsea et al. point out, many {{tropical}} cyclones {{that formed}} on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>sea</b> {{and did not}} affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s. They estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly {{take into account the}} typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E

50|$|Rescue is an arcade game {{in which}} the player navigates a {{helicopter}} over <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>seas</b> to rescue stranded paratroopers from enemy forces and sharks. It was designed by Chris Oberth and published by Stern in 1982.|$|R
5|$|Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% {{of the main}} taxa of deep-sea animals produce light. Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.|$|E
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse {{and told them that}} this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fish are}} covered with highly {{reflective}} scales, giving the appearance of silvered mirror glass. Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in fish of <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> especially those {{that live in the}} top 100 metres. Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as sardine and herring are camouflaged by silvering.|$|E

5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are unisexual {{but some}} stony corals are hermaphrodite. The germ cells {{originate in the}} endoderm {{and move to the}} gastrodermis where they differentiate. When mature, they are liberated into the coelenteron and thence to <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> with fertilisation being external. To make fertilisation more likely, corals emit vast numbers of gametes, and many species synchronise their release in relation to the time of day and the phase of the moon.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as gastropods, bivalves, and decapods. It has a greater list of known prey than any other sea turtle. Other food items include sponges, corals, sea pens, polychaete worms, sea anemones, cephalopods, barnacles, brachiopods, isopods, Portuguese men o' war, insects, bryozoans, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers, starfish, fish (eggs, juveniles, and adults), {{hatchling}} turtles (including members of its own species), algae, and vascular plants. During migration through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>sea,</b> loggerheads eat jellyfish, floating molluscs, floating egg clusters, squid, and flying fish.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>sea.</b> British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
2500|$|Several new {{technologies}} {{will be needed}} for shallow-water naval operations. [...] Since acoustic sensors (i.e., passive hydrophones and active sonar) perform less effectively in shallow waters than in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>seas,</b> {{there is a strong}} pressure to develop additional sensors.|$|R
