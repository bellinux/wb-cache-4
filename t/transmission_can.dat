5|$|Horizontal {{transmission}} {{is the most}} common mechanism of spread of viruses in populations. <b>Transmission</b> <b>can</b> occur when: body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity, e.g., HIV; blood is exchanged by contaminated transfusion or needle sharing, e.g., hepatitis C; exchange of saliva by mouth, e.g., Epstein–Barr virus; contaminated food or water is ingested, e.g., norovirus; aerosols containing virions are inhaled, e.g., influenza virus; and insect vectors such as mosquitoes penetrate the skin of a host, e.g., dengue.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.|$|E

25|$|Zoonotic <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> {{occur in}} any {{context in which}} there is companionistic (pets), {{economic}} (farming, etc.), predatory (hunting, butchering or consuming wild game) or research contact with or consumption of animals, animal products, or animal derivatives (vaccines, etc.).|$|E
25|$|According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the fecal-oral {{cycle of}} <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> be {{disrupted}} by cooking food properly, preventing cross-contamination, instituting barriers such as gloves for food workers, instituting health care policies so food industry employees seek treatment {{when they are}} ill, pasteurization of juice or dairy products and proper hand washing requirements.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to waterborne sources, fecal–oral <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> also occur, {{for example in}} day-care centers, where children may have poor hygiene practices. Those who work with children are also {{at risk of being}} infected, as are family members of infected individuals. Not all Giardia infections are symptomatic, and many people can unknowingly serve as carriers of the parasite.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} health {{researchers}} and organizations {{object to the}} no-nit policy. Opponents to the no-nit policy mention that visible nits may only be empty egg casings which pose no concern as <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> only occur via live lice or eggs. This {{has led to the}} perception that the no-nit policy serves only to ease the workload of school nurses and punish the parents of infested children.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transmission</b> <b>can</b> also be indirect, via another organism, {{either a}} vector (e.g. a {{mosquito}} or fly) or an intermediate host (e.g. tapeworm in pigs {{can be transmitted}} to humans who ingest improperly cooked pork). Indirect transmission could involve zoonoses or, more typically, larger pathogens like macroparasites with more complex life cycles. Transmissions can be autochthonous (i.e. between two individuals in the same place) or may involve travel of the microorganism or the affected hosts.|$|E
25|$|Transmission {{is usually}} through the fecal-oral route of {{contaminated}} {{food or water}} caused by poor sanitation. Most cholera cases in developed countries {{are a result of}} transmission by food, while in the developing world it is more often water. Food <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> occur when people harvest seafood such as oysters in waters infected with sewage, as Vibrio cholerae accumulates in planktonic crustaceans and the oysters eat the zooplankton.|$|E

5000|$|Spread-spectrum <b>transmissions</b> <b>can</b> share a {{frequency}} band with {{many types of}} conventional transmissions with minimal interference. The spread-spectrum signals add minimal noise to the narrow-frequency communications, and vice versa. As a result, bandwidth can be used more efficiently.|$|R
25|$|Twisted nematic {{displays}} contain liquid crystals that {{twist and}} untwist at varying degrees to allow light to pass through. When no voltage {{is applied to}} a TN liquid crystal cell, polarized light passes through the 90-degrees twisted LC layer. In proportion to the voltage applied, the liquid crystals untwist changing the polarization and blocking the light's path. By properly adjusting {{the level of the}} voltage almost any gray level or <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> be achieved.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to producing projection images, PCI, like conventional <b>transmission,</b> <b>can</b> {{be combined with}} tomographic techniques to obtain the 3D distribution of the real part of the refractive index of the sample. When applied to samples that consist of atoms with low atomic number Z, PCI is more sensitive to density variations in the sample than conventional transmission-based X-ray imaging. This leads to images with improved soft tissue contrast.|$|E
25|$|A {{parasite}} may be passively transported into a nest by a {{group member}} or may actively search for the nest; once inside, parasite <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> be vertical (from mother to daughter colony into the next generation) or horizontally (between/within colonies). In eusocial insects, the most frequent defence against parasite uptake into the nest is to prevent infection during and/or after foraging, and {{a wide range of}} active and prophylactic mechanisms have evolved to this end.|$|E

Some <b>transmissions</b> <b>can</b> be received in Greater Manchester across the Pennines due to the height of the antenna on the tower and the strong signal.|$|R
25|$|The {{other problem}} is that while radio <b>transmissions</b> <b>can</b> be {{broadcast}} in all directions, lasers are highly directional.

25|$|There is a {{long history}} of oral {{transmission}} of teachings in Tibetan Buddhism. Oral transmissions by lineage holders traditionally can take place in small groups or mass gatherings of listeners and may last for seconds ({{in the case of a}} mantra, for example) or months (as in the case of a section of the Tibetan Buddhist canon). It is held that a <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> even occur without actually hearing, as in Asanga's visions of Maitreya.|$|E
25|$|Parallel relay {{transmission}} {{may be used}} where serial relay transmission {{suffers from}} multi-path fading. For outdoors and non-line-of-sight propagation, signal wavelength may be large and installation of multiple antennas are not possible. To increase the robustness against multi-path fading, parallel relay <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> be used. In this topology, signals propagate through multiple relay paths in the same hop and the destination combines the signals received {{with the help of}} various combining schemes. It provides power gain and diversity gain simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Many {{microbial}} symbionts, including human microbiota, can {{be transmitted}} both vertically and horizontally. Mixed-mode <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> allow symbionts to have the “best of both worlds” – they can vertically infect host offspring when host density is low, and horizontally infect diverse additional hosts when a number of additional hosts are available. Mixed-mode transmission make the outcome (degree of harm or benefit) of the relationship more difficult to predict, because the evolutionary success of the symbiont is sometimes but not always tied {{to the success of}} the host.|$|E
30|$|As the PFA and PMD {{coincide}} with the ones of K sensors with classical transmission/detection employing an OR rule at the FU, {{it can be concluded}} that with the proposed scheme, the number of <b>transmissions</b> <b>can</b> be reduced by a factor of 2 with no penalty in the ROC.|$|R
50|$|The {{other problem}} is that while radio <b>transmissions</b> <b>can</b> be {{broadcast}} in all directions, lasers are highly directional.

25|$|MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more {{commonly}} referred to as MP3 (or mp3), is an audio coding format for digital audio. It uses a form of lossy data compression to encode data using inexact approximations and the partial discarding of data. This allows a large reduction in file size when compared to uncompressed audio, which is important for both transmission and storage concerns, while still retaining a comparable level of sound quality. Also designed as a streamable format, segments of a <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> be lost without affecting the ability to decode later segments.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation RX's new <b>transmission</b> <b>can</b> lock-up its torque {{converter}} from 2nd through 6th gears to improve fuel economy. By dropping the center locking differential, a new Active Torque Control all-wheel drive system diverts anywhere from 50% {{or up to}} 100% power to the front wheels for reduced drivetrain associated efficiency losses which in turn increases fuel efficiency. An Electric Power Steering (EPS) system replaces the previous belt-driven hydraulic pump. A double wishbone rear suspension setup replaces the previous MacPherson strut design for improved handling and greater cargo space, while an optional Sports Package adds a performance-tuned suspension.|$|E
25|$|Noroviruses are {{transmitted}} directly {{from person to}} person (62–84% of all reported outbreaks) and indirectly via contaminated water and food. They are extremely contagious, and fewer than twenty virus particles can cause an infection (some research suggests as few as five). <b>Transmission</b> <b>can</b> be aerosolized when those stricken with the illness vomit, and can be aerosolized by a toilet flush when vomit or diarrhea is present; infection can follow eating food or breathing air near an episode of vomiting, even if cleaned up. The viruses continue to be shed after symptoms have subsided and shedding can still be detected many weeks after infection.|$|E
