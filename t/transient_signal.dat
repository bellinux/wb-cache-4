Many receivers have automatic gain control (AGC) circuits with time constants that take many milliseconds to recover their sensitivity and volume level after a strong <b>transient</b> <b>signal</b> is presented to their antenna input port. Without modifications or AGC circuit re-design such receivers are not suitable for QSK operation. In cases of slow responding AGC circuitry operators may accept the thumping noise and loss of AGC functionality and choose to turn their receiver AGC function off, instead operating their receivers using only manual gain control during QSK operation.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} takes a functional-analytic {{approach to}} the problem of <b>transient</b> <b>signal</b> detection and estimation. Here, the class of transient signals is viewed as a nonparametric subspace of an appropriate Hilbert space. Specifically, we consider the generalized class of transient signals in a Sobolev space setting which consists of time-limited and band-limited signals. In this setting, we show that the optimal estimator, in the "mixed-norm" sense, for the general class of transient signals both in time and frequency domains is a subclass of L-spline functions. Using this fact together with a correspondence between spline smoothing problems and that of least-square estimation problems, the <b>transient</b> <b>signal</b> estimation problem is formulated in a state-space approach, thereby allowing us to perform <b>transient</b> <b>signal</b> estimation procedures in a recursive manner. To evaluate the performance of these types of nonparametric estimators, we consider several <b>transient</b> <b>signal</b> models contaminated by white noise. We use a spline smoother as the optimal estimator for the modelled class of transient signals. Results from a Monte Carlo study demonstrate that the estimation procedure possesses an excellent capability for reconstructing the signal. (See Figure 1. 1 and related comments below.) We then use these spline smoothing estimates to derive a threshold detector for transient signals [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of spectral cues in size discrimination of <b>transient</b> <b>signals</b> was investigated, {{and a model}} for this ability, tAIM, was created based on the biological principles of human hearing.

It was found possible to scale the sphere signals in order to confuse listeners into believing the signal source was a different size, but two methods of scaling signals in order to sound the same size as another proved inconclusive, suggesting the possibility that <b>transient</b> <b>signals</b> cannot be scaled in a linear fashion as has been shown possible for vowels.
