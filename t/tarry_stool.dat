25|$|Upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding {{is from a}} source between the pharynx and the ligament of Treitz. An upper source is characterised by hematemesis (vomiting up blood) and melena (<b>tarry</b> <b>stool</b> containing altered blood). About half of cases are due to peptic ulcer disease (gastric or duodenal ulcers). Esophageal inflammation and erosive disease are the next most common causes. In those with liver cirrhosis, 50–60% of bleeding is due to esophageal varices. Approximately half of those with peptic ulcers have an H. pylori infection. Other causes include Mallory-Weiss tears, cancer, and angiodysplasia.|$|E
50|$|Although {{some cases}} present with black, <b>tarry</b> <b>stool</b> (melena), the blood loss can be subtle, with the anemia {{symptoms}} predominating. Fecal occult blood testing is positive when bleeding is active. If bleeding is intermittent the test may be negative at times.|$|E

50|$|Swallowing {{any amount}} of abrin can lead to severe {{symptoms}}. Early symptoms include nausea, vomiting, pain in the mouth, throat, and esophagus, diarrhea, dysphagia (trouble swallowing), and abdominal cramps and pain. As the symptoms progress, bleeding and inflammation begins in the gastrointestinal tract. The affected person can vomit up blood (hematemesis), have blood in their feces, which creates a black, <b>tarry</b> <b>stool</b> called melena, and more internal bleeding. Loss of blood volume and water from nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding causes blood pressure to drop and organ damage to begin, which {{can be seen as}} the person begins to have somnolence/drowsiness, hematuria (blood in the urine), stupor, convulsions, polydipsia (excessive thirst), and oliguria (low urine production). This ultimately results in multi-system organ failure, hypovolemic shock, vascular collapse, and death.|$|E
50|$|A lethal {{infection}} in mink, the Aleutian disease virus lies dormant in ferrets until stress or injury {{allows it to}} surface. While the parvovirus itself causes little or no harm to the ferret host, {{the large number of}} antibodies produced in response to the presence of the virus results in a systemic vasculitis, resulting in eventual renal failure, bone marrow suppression and death.The symptoms are chronic, progressive weight loss, lethargy, splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), anemia, rear leg weakness, seizures and black <b>tarry</b> <b>stool.</b> Additional symptoms include poor reproduction and/or oral bleeding/gastrointestinal bleeding. Lesions can also be found within the pelt depending on the severity of the disease. This virus can unfortunately reduce fitness of wild mink especially, by disturbing both the productivity within adult females and the overall survivor rates of both juveniles and adults. Likewise, in the mink kits that survive, it infects the alveolar cells and ultimately causes respiratory distress, possibly leading to death.|$|E
50|$|Heyde's {{syndrome}} {{is now known}} to be gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasic lesions due to acquired vWD-2A deficiency secondary to aortic stenosis, and the diagnosis is made by confirming the presence of those three things. Gastrointestinal bleeding may present as bloody vomit, dark, <b>tarry</b> <b>stool</b> from metabolized blood, or fresh blood in the stool. In a person presenting with these symptoms, endoscopy, gastroscopy, and/or colonoscopy should be performed to confirm the presence of angiodysplasia. Aortic stenosis can be diagnosed by auscultation for characteristic heart sounds, particularly a crescendo-decrescendo (i.e., 'ejection') murmur, followed by echocardiography to measure aortic valve area (see diagnosis of aortic stenosis). While Heyde's syndrome may exist alone with no other symptoms of aortic stenosis, the person could also present with evidence of heart failure, fainting, or chest pain. Finally, Heyde's syndrome can be confirmed using blood tests for vWD-2A, although traditional blood tests for von Willebrand factor may result in false negatives due to the subtlety of the abnormality. The gold standard for diagnosis is gel electrophoresis; in people with vWD-2A, the large molecular weight von Willebrand factors will be absent from the SDS-agarose electrophoresis plate.|$|E

40|$|A case of pedunculated Brunner’s gland hamartoma (BGH) of the {{duodenum}} causing upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is reported. The {{patient was}} a 47 -year-old man who visited our hospital for further evaluation of <b>tarry</b> <b>stools</b> and shortness of breath. Endoscopic {{examination of the}} upper digestive tract revealed a large peduncular polyp with bleeding, about 30 mm in diameter, arising from {{the wall of the}} second portion of the duodenum.

Histological examination of the specimen revealed that the main body of the polyp contained several lobules of mature Brunner’s gland with areas of cystic dilatation.

50|$|Hemosuccus pancreaticus, {{also known}} as pseudohematobilia or Wirsungorrhage is a rare cause of {{hemorrhage}} in the gastrointestinal tract. It {{is caused by a}} bleeding source in the pancreas, pancreatic duct, or structures adjacent to the pancreas, such as the splenic artery, that bleed into the pancreatic duct, which is connected with the bowel at the duodenum, {{the first part of the}} small intestine. Patients with hemosuccus may develop symptoms of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, such as blood in the stools, maroon stools, or melena, which is a dark, <b>tarry</b> <b>stool</b> caused by digestion of red blood cells. They may also develop abdominal pain. It is associated with pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer and aneurysms of the splenic artery. Hemosuccus may be identified with endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy), where fresh blood may be seen from the pancreatic duct. Alternatively, angiography may be used to inject the celiac axis to determine the blood vessel that is bleeding. This may also be used to treat hemosuccus, as embolization of the end vessel may terminate the hemorrhage. However, a distal pancreatectomy—surgery to removal of the tail of the pancreas—may be required to stop the hemorrhage.|$|E

50|$|Patients with {{bleeding}} gastric varices {{can present}} with bloody vomiting (hematemesis), dark, <b>tarry</b> <b>stools</b> (melena), or rectal bleeding.

Treatment with intravenous octreotide is also useful to shunt blood flow away from the stomach's circulation. More aggressive treatment including splenectomy (or surgical removal of the spleen) or liver transplantation may be required in some cases.|$|R

40|$|EDITORIAL SYNOPSIS These {{experimental}} {{observations on}} patients in whom blood was {{introduced into the}} caecum at appendicectomy suggest {{that the rate of}} passage of the blood rather than the level of its insertion determines the colour of the stool. In Great Britain a melaena stool is usually defined as a black, <b>tarry</b> <b>stool.</b> The appearance is thought to be due to haematin and perhaps other pigments resulting from the breakdown of haemoglobin (Harrison, 1957). It is usually considered to indicate bleeding from the upper alimentary tract (Abrahams, 1954) although melaena has been observed in bleeding from a carcinoma of the caecum (Aver...|$|E

500|$|This {{ligament}} is {{an important}} anatomical landmark of the duodenojejunal flexure, separating {{the upper and lower}} gastrointestinal tracts. For example, bloody vomit or melena, black <b>tarry</b> <b>stools,</b> usually indicate a gastrointestinal bleed from a location in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, hematochezia, bright red blood or clots in the stool, usually indicates gastrointestinal bleeding from {{the lower part of the}} gastrointestinal tract. It is an especially important landmark to note when looking at the bowel for the presence of malrotation of the gut, a syndrome often suspected in young children when they have episodes of recurrent vomiting. Visualising a normal location of the ligament of Treitz in radiological images is critical in ruling out malrotation of the gut in a child; [...] it is abnormally located when malrotation is present.|$|R
