The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> baking powder can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> soy flour and one <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water, and half a <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, it can even be whipped up like egg whites.|$|E

25|$|The J.M. Smucker Company, American {{manufacturer}} of Crisco (the original partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening), in 2004 released a new formulation made from solid saturated palm oil cut with soybean oil and sunflower oil. This blend yielded an equivalent shortening {{much like the}} previous partially hydrogenated Crisco, and was labelled zero grams of trans fat per 1 tablespoon serving (as compared with 1.5grams per <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> original Crisco). As of 24 January 2007, Smucker claims that all Crisco shortening products in the US have been reformulated to contain less than one gram of trans fat per serving while keeping saturated fat content less than butter. The separately marketed trans fat free version introduced in 2004 was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Fillings in {{pastries}} {{are sometimes}} made of finely ground poppy seeds mixed with butter or milk and sugar. The ground filling {{is used in}} poppy seed rolls and some croissants and may be flavored with lemon or orange zest, rum and vanilla with raisins, heavy cream, cinnamon, and chopped blanched almonds or walnuts added. For sweet baked goods, sometimes instead of sugar a <b>tablespoon</b> <b>of</b> jam, or other sweet binding agent, like syrup is substituted. The poppy seed for fillings are best when they are finely and freshly ground because this will {{make a big difference}} in the pastry filling's texture and taste. Some recipes for Mohnstriezel use poppy seed soaked in water for two hours or boiled in milk. A recipe for Ukrainian poppyseed cake recommends preparing the seeds by immersing in boiling water, straining and soaking in milk overnight.|$|E

Another hypoglycemia formula is 1gram of glucose for every kilogram (2.2lb) of the animal's body weight. Since sugar acts quickly, a response should be seen within a minute or two.|$|E

They attended a dinner with Churchill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Alan Brooke, and General Harold Alexander, {{who was about to}} assume control of Middle East Command, the post responsible for the overall conduct of the campaign in the North African desert. Four operations were designed to create a diversion from Rommel's attempt on El Alamein: attacks on Benghazi (Operation Bigamy), Tobruk, Barce, and the Jalo oasis. [...] These all started out from Kufra, an oasis 800 miles inland. [...] Maclean's convoy drove to the Gebel across the Sand Sea at its narrowest point, Zighen, and made it there undetected, although [...] "bazaar gossip" [...] from an Arab spy indicated that the enemy expected an imminent attack. When Maclean's group reached the outskirts of Benghazi, they were ambushed and had to retreat. [...] Axis planes repeatedly bombed them, destroying many of the vehicles and most of their supplies.
