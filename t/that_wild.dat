5|$|Analysis {{of central}} European cattle, {{including}} Limousins, {{indicates that the}} origin {{of male and female}} DNA can be traced directly to cattle domesticated in the Near East. This is in contrast to the DNA of northern European cattle, which suggests <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> Eurasian aurochs were at one time mated to domesticated cows, and of southern European cattle, which indicates <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> Eurasian aurochs cows were mated to domesticated bulls.|$|E

5|$|Artificial selection, the {{deliberate}} selective breeding of domestic animals, {{is being used}} to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{generally}} have thin tooth enamel compared to anthropoid primates. This {{may result in}} extra wear and breakage to the anterior (front) teeth due to heavy use in grooming, feeding, and fighting. Little other dental health information is available for lemurs, except <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve occasionally exhibit abscessed maxillary canines (seen as open wounds on the muzzle) and tooth decay, possibly due to the consumption of non-native foods.|$|E

40|$|The starch {{powdered}} {{samples were}} analyzed for their Rheological properties using Rapid Visco Analyser. From {{the graph of}} RVU versus Time, {{it was discovered that}} in aerial yam as the temperature is increased, the starch granules swell and increase the viscosity of the starch paste until the peak viscosity is reached(390. 92). A highpeakviscosity corresponds with a high thickening power of starch, this peak is higher than <b>that</b> of <b>wild</b> yam (- 2. 92). The pasting time for aerial yam (86. 50) was the same with <b>that</b> of <b>wild</b> yam(86. 35). Also the breakdown for aerial yam (20. 50) was higher than <b>that</b> of <b>wild</b> yam(0. 50). The set back(retrogradation) for aerial yam(128. 83) was higher than <b>that</b> of <b>wild</b> yam(0. 50). The peak time for aerial yam(5. 60) was lower than <b>that</b> of <b>wild</b> yam(7. 00).

5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> Asiatic dayflower populations found growing on copper mine spoils in eastern China {{exhibited}} very high concentrations of copper within the plants, {{more so than the}} 48 species tested. Commelina communis had sequestered some 361mg/kg of copper, while the plant with the next highest concentration, Polygonum macrathum, had 286mg/kg. Five of the species examined, including the Asiatic dayflower, also showed high concentrations of other metals such as zinc, lead, and cadmium. The results suggest that the Asiatic dayflower is a good candidate for copper mine spoil revegetation and phytoremediation.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{developed}} a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an antecedent period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in southwest Asia, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Current models indicate <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> stands that had been harvested previously started to be planted, but were not immediately domesticated.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{asserts that}} all wild trees grow from seed or from roots. He {{mentions}} that the philosophers spoke of spontaneous generation, as when Anaxagoras claims the air contains {{the seeds of}} every plant, whereas Diogenes believed plants arose when water mixed with earth. In places like Crete, Theophrastus writes that native plants spring up if the ground is simply disturbed, and <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> trees are generally more vigorous than cultivated ones, give fruit later, and like cold and hilly terrain. He asserts that trees which can grow both on hill and plain grow better and taller when grown on the plain.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to habitat destruction, the pygmy slow loris is seriously threatened by hunting and trade. Within its geographic range and neighbor countries, {{the trade in}} the pygmy slow loris has recently increased due to economic changes and human population growth, and the trend is expected to continue. Decreased sightings {{in the field and}} at animal markets indicate <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> populations are being depleted since the low reproduction rate of the pygmy slow loris cannot keep pace with these large-scale off-takes. Accordingly, conservationists and field biologists fear local extinctions in the near future. Between 1998 and 2006, 70% of pygmy slow lorises seized by authorities died before reaching a sheltering zoo, resulting in replacement demand and additional captures from the wild.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look like they have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a photo album.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation {{plays a major role}} in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover. Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan. Although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification, there is some evidence <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover, and that their removal encourages erosive processes.|$|E

Professor Oak explains to the player <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> Pokémon may be living there, and encountering them alone {{can be very}} dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, a rival aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and the rival are both instructed to select a starter Pokémon for their travels out of Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander. Oak's Grandson will always choose the Pokémon which is stronger against the player's starting Pokémon.

5|$|Two {{populations of}} pallid {{sturgeon}} in the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers of Montana are both {{at risk of}} extinction, and current projections are <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> pallid sturgeon populations in Montana will be extinct by 2018. Though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996, until pallid sturgeon females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15years of age, recovery efforts in Montana will not be readily measurable. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has been conducting spring pulse water releases from the Tiber Dam every four to fiveyears to try to recreate a semblance of an annual spring flood to restore and rejuvenate downstream floodplains. These pulse releases are done {{in an effort to}} restore suitable habitat for numerous fish species.|$|E
5|$|Between 1692 and 1806, {{only four}} {{descriptions}} of frozen mammoths {{were published in}} Europe. None of the remains of those five were preserved, and no complete skeleton was recovered during that time. While frozen woolly mammoth carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728, the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the Lena River in 1799 by Ossip Schumachov, a Siberian hunter. Schumachov let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the ivory trade. While in Yakutsk in 1806, Michael Friedrich Adams heard about the frozen mammoth. Upon arrival at the location, Adams discovered <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> animals had eaten most of the organs and flesh of the mammoth, including the trunk. He examined the carcass and realised what was left would still be the most complete mammoth recovered by that time. Adams recovered the entire skeleton, apart from the tusks, which Shumachov had already sold, and one foreleg, most of the skin, and nearly 18kg (40lb) of hair. During his return voyage he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed {{were the ones that}} Shumachov had sold. Adams brought it to the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the task of mounting the skeleton was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius. The Kunstkamera, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference. This {{was one of the first}} attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal. Most of the reconstruction is correct, but Tilesius placed each tusk in the opposite socket, so that they curved outward instead of inward. The error was not corrected until 1899, and the correct placement of mammoth tusks was still a matter of debate into the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|The {{practical}} side of Hadley's proposal {{rests on}} two key principles: a guardianship system, {{according to which}} knowledgeable guardians would be appointed to represent animal property holders in land management decision-making, {{and the use of}} animals' territory-marking behaviour to determine the limits of their property. Hadley rejects first occupancy and labour-mixing accounts of appropriation, and instead suggests that there are two ways that his account might fruitfully be justified. First, it might be justified directly, with reference to the interests of animals. This relies upon the fact <b>that</b> <b>wild</b> animals require their territory in order to satisfy their basic needs and the claim that this results in an interest in territory strong enough to ground a right. If animals have a right to use their territory, Hadley claims, then they necessarily have a property right in that territory. Second, it might be justified indirectly, as animals (of some species, at least) might be given property rights as a means of protecting natural environments. Hadley presents his proposal against the backdrop of an explicit pragmatism, and holds that animal property rights theory has the potential to reconcile animal and environmental ethics.|$|E
