500|$|While {{still in}} Poland, Rotblat had {{realised}} that nuclear fission might possibly {{be used to}} produce an atomic bomb. He first thought that he should [...] "put the whole <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my mind", but he continued because he thought {{the only way to}} prevent Nazi Germany from using a nuclear bomb was if Britain had one to act as a deterrent. He worked with Chadwick on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project.|$|E
500|$|Vašek expresses his confusions in a short, sad song ("I can't {{get it out}} of my head"), but is {{interrupted}} by the arrival of a travelling circus. The Ringmaster introduces the star attractions: Esmeralda, the Spanish dancer, a [...] "real Indian" [...] sword swallower, and a dancing bear. A rapid folk-dance, the skočná, follows. Vašek is entranced by Esmeralda, but his timid advances are interrupted when the [...] "Indian" [...] rushes in, announcing that the [...] "bear" [...] has collapsed in a drunken stupor. A replacement is required. Vašek is soon persuaded to take the job, egged on by Esmeralda's flattering words ("We'll make a pretty <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you").|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of Neon Ballroom, Silverchair's three-album {{contract}} with Sony Music had ended. The group eventually signed with Atlantic Records for North and South America, and formed their own label with Watson, [...] (distributed by EMI), for Australia and Asia. In November 2000, after the group had left the label, Sony issued The Best of Volume 1 without the band's involvement. Johns disavowed the compilation, [...] "We thought about putting out ads in the street press to make people aware that we weren't endorsing it, {{but that would have}} blown the whole <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> proportion ... If people want to buy it, they can buy it but I wouldn't buy it if I was a silverchair fan." ...|$|E

500|$|James Whale {{lived as}} an openly gay man {{throughout}} {{his career in the}} British theatre and in Hollywood, something that was virtually unheard of in the 1920s and 1930s. He and David Lewis lived together as a couple from around 1930 to 1952. While he did not go {{out of his way to}} publicize his homosexuality, he did not do anything to conceal it either. As filmmaker Curtis Harrington, a friend and confidant of Whale's, put it, [...] "Not in the sense of screaming it from the rooftops or coming out. But yes, he was openly homosexual. Any sophisticated person who knew him knew he was gay." [...] While there have been suggestions that Whale's career was terminated because of homophobia, and Whale was supposedly dubbed [...] "The Queen of Hollywood", Harrington states that [...] "nobody made a <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it as far as I could perceive".|$|E
500|$|Treasury Secretary Mellon also {{recommended}} to Congress that {{income tax rates}} be cut. He asked that the excess profits tax on corporations be abolished. The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed Mellon's proposals, but some congressmen, who wanted to raise tax rates on corporations, fought the measure. Harding was unsure what side to endorse, telling a friend, [...] "I can't make a damn <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this tax problem. I listen to one side, and they seem right, and then—God!—I talk to the other side, and they seem just as right." [...] Harding tried compromise, and gained passage of the bill in the House {{after the end of}} the excess profits tax was delayed a year. In the Senate, the tax bill became entangled in efforts to vote World War I veterans a soldier's bonus. Frustrated by the delays, on July 12, Harding appeared before the Senate and urged it to pass the tax legislation without the bonus. It was not until November that the revenue bill finally passed, with higher rates than Mellon had proposed.|$|E
2500|$|Doug Moon {{left the}} band {{because of his}} dislike of the band's {{increasing}} experimentation outside his preferred blues genre. Ry Cooder told of Moon's becoming so angered by Van Vliet's unrelenting criticism that {{he walked into the}} room pointing a loaded crossbow at him, only to have Van Vliet tell him, [...] "Get that fucking <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here, get out of here and get back in your room", which he did. (Other band members dispute this account, though Moon is likely to have [...] "passed through" [...] the studio with a weapon.) Moon was present during the early demo sessions at Original Sound studio, above the Kama Sutra/Buddah offices. The works Moon laid down did not see the light of day, as he was replaced by Cooder when they continued on material at Sunset Sound with Marker. Marker then fell by the wayside when recording was moved by Krasnow and Perry to RCA Studio. This would {{have a profound effect on}} the quality of the Safe as Milk work, as the former studio was 8-track and the subsequent studio a 4-track.|$|E

2500|$|The mission took a {{diversion}} into investigating a possible coup by ARVN officers when General Dương Văn Minh {{expressed an interest}} in meeting McNamara and Taylor, either alone or together. After an extensive series of discretionary arrangements were made, Taylor joined Minh in a game of doubles on the tennis court of the Saigon Officers Club. McNamara watched on as Taylor played with Minh, waiting anxiously for any signals from Minh to [...] "broad hints of our interest in other subjects which we gave him during breaks in the game". Minh revealed nothing of his thoughts about a possible coup, leaving his guest bewildered to his intentions in inviting them. McNamara later grumbled to Kennedy that [...] "I sat on a sideline two feet from Big Minh for over an hour and I couldn't get a damn <b>thing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him." [...] Taylor got one of the tennis players, Colonel Raymond Jones, to contact Minh about the situation, to which Minh replied with a complaint about a perceived lack of support from Washington for a coup. Minh claimed that he thought McNamara and Taylor were seeking nothing but a match of tennis and offered to discuss military affairs at any time.|$|E
