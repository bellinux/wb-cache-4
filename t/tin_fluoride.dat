This {{material}} is stable in bulk form at room temperature and has commercial applications that include fluorinated toothpaste. Bulk <b>tin</b> <b>fluoride</b> has a pair of fluorine atoms bridging two tin atoms. In the recent past the electronic properties of 2 D tin with honeycomb structure have been discussed thus generating a wealth of literature that emphasizes its non-topologically-trivial electronic properties due to {{the combination of a}} Dirac-like dispersion and a strong spin-orbit coupling given its large atomic mass. Nevertheless the stability of such freestanding structures has been contested recently. As it turns out, the most stable form of fluorinated tin does not possess a graphane-like structure either. In the most stable phase to be discussed here, fluorine atoms tilt away from (graphane-like) positions over/below tin atoms; in an atomistic arrangement similar to the one seen on their parent bulk structure. Electronic properties depend on atomistic coordination, and the most stable form of fluorinated tin does not possess non-trivial topological properties. Nevertheless it represents a new paradigm for valleytronics in 2 D. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{experimentally}} that subinhibitory concentrations {{of a number}} of toxic, or other agents that are typically inhibitory (copper, cadmium, tributyl <b>tin</b> <b>fluoride,</b> reduced salinity), may stimulate the growth of colonies of the hydroid Campanularia flexuosa, exhibiting a phenomenon known as hormesis. It is suggested that the stimulation of growth is not due to the specific properties of the different toxicants, but to an adaptive response of the hydroid to the inhibitory effect that they have in common. Growth is regulated by a control mechanism and it is proposed that the increased growth is a consequence of overcorrections to low levels of an inhibitory challenge. Examination of the toxicological literature shows that hormesis is a more common occurrence that is generally supposed, and it is suggested that the explanation given here might apply in other cases of hormesis...|$|E

In addition to removal of causal factors (sugars and acids), in the man-agement of those conditions, silver and <b>tin</b> (stannous) <b>fluorides</b> have recently received much attention.

50|$|Unlike {{the other}} tin tetrahalides, tin(IV) chloride, tin(IV) bromide, and tin(IV) iodide, which contain tetrahedrally coordinated <b>tin,</b> tin(IV) <b>fluoride</b> {{contains}} planar layers of octahedrally coordinated tin, where the octahedra share four corners {{and there are}} two terminal, unshared, fluorine atoms trans to one another. The melting point of SnF4 is much higher (700 °C) than the other tin(IV) halides which are relatively low melting, (SnCl4, −33.3 °C; SnBr4, 31 °C; SnI4, 144 °C). The structure can also be contrasted with the tetrafluorides of the lighter members of group 14, (CF4, SiF4 and GeF4) which in the solid state form molecular crystals.|$|R
50|$|Sodium <b>{{fluoride}},</b> <b>tin</b> difluoride, and, most commonly, sodium monofluorophosphate, {{are used}} in toothpaste. In 1955, the first fluoride toothpaste {{was introduced in the}} United States. Now, almost all toothpaste in developed countries is fluoridated. For example, 95% of European toothpaste contains fluoride. Gels and foams are often advised for special patient groups, particularly those undergoing radiation therapy to the head (cancer patients). The patient receives a four-minute application of a high amount of fluoride. Varnishes, which can be more quickly applied, exist and perform a similar function. Fluoride is also contained in prescription and non-prescription mouthwashes and is a trace component of foods manufactured using fluoridated water supplies.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFluorides {{are common}} {{ingredients}} in pharmaceutical products for oral hygiene {{due to their}} recognized effect {{in the prevention of}} tooth decay. In dental products, fluorides can be added in several different forms, such as sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate, <b>tin</b> <b>fluoride,</b> or in the form of different amines. This work describes potentiometric determination of fluorides in the samples of toothpastes and mouthwash. The method was optimized for the particular analytical purpose; namely, for the analysis of toothpastes and mouthwash by applying different sample preparation protocols depending on the fluoride source. Good recovery (93 – 103 %) confirmed the correctness of the sample preparation procedures. Calculated limit of detection and limit of quantification for the optimized method were 1  ×  10 − 3  mg/L and 2. 8  ×  10 − 3  mg/L fluoride, respectively. In the minority of the analyzed samples, calculated contents agreed well with the certified values, whereas the samples of mouthwash demonstrated better agreement...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, <b>tin</b> <b>fluoride</b> colloid (SnF-c) was prepared, {{labeled with}} yttrium- 90 (90 Y), and {{characterized}} {{with respect to}} its physicochemical properties and biological behavior in an animal model. Particle size of SnF-c, at constant concentration of SnF 2, was dependent on pH, concentration of sodium fluoride (NaF), temperature, and time. The particle size of SnF-c decreased {{with an increase in}} NaF concentration and a decrease in reaction mixture pH. Radiolabeling yield of 90 Y–SnF-c at higher temperature increased and it was greater than 98 % for the preparation at 95 ◦C. The 90 Y–SnF-c demonstrated high in vitro stability both in human serum and human synovial fluid at 37 ◦C up to 7 days. In vivo distribution studies in healthy male Wistar rats of 90 Y–SnF-c (particles 1 :m) was well retained in the synovial space for 96 h after intra-articular injection, whereas leakage of 90 Y from the joint was 1. 96 % over this period. Because of high labeling yield and stability, 90 Y–SnF-c might be a promising agent for radiosynovectomy or therapy o...|$|E
40|$|In {{the solid}} state, (-) -tris([1 R, 2 S, 5 R]-menthyl) <b>tin</b> <b>fluoride,</b> Men 3 SnF (6), {{exhibits}} a dimeric structure {{in which one}} tin atom is four-coordinate and the other five-coordinate. This novel dimeric association mode is attributed to {{the orientation of the}} unsymmetrical menthyl groups, which are arranged to allow a minimum Sn···Sn separation of 4. 84 Å within the dimer. The exocyclic isopropyl groups of the menthyl groups point in opposite directions on each tin atom of the dimer, thus preventing further association (Sn···Sn separation outside the dimer 10. 49 Å). 119 Sn and 19 F MAS NMR spectroscopy were utilized to probe the diverse coordination numbers found by X-ray crystallography for the geometries of the two tin and fluorine sites. In solution, 6 is a monomer at both room temperature and - 100 °C. However, upon addition of Bu 4 NF, 6 is in equilibrium with [(Men 3 SnF) 2 F]- (6 a), [Men 3 SnF 2] - (6 b), and noncoordinating fluoride anions. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} structural, optical {{transmittance}} and electrical properties of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) thin films deposited using an inkjet printer. The FTO ink was synthesized from {{a mixture of}} tin chloride pentahydrate (SnCl 4. 5 H 2 O) and ammonium fluoride (NH 4 F) solutions. The thin films were deposited on glass substrates at ambient temperature or heated at 40 oC and 60 oC. The surface electronic state and the elemental composition of the thin films were analyzed using XPS spectroscopy. The spectra of the FTO thin films revealed that <b>tin,</b> oxygen, <b>fluoride</b> and carbon {{were present in the}} samples. The signals corresponding to Sn 3 d 5 / 2, O 1 s, and F 1 s were found at 486. 6 eV, 530. 5 eV and 684. 5 eV, respectively. XRD analysis showed that the FTO films were in the form of crystalline with cassiterite shape. The optical and electrical properties of the films were affected by the deposition temperatures.

40|$|Solutions {{containing}} <b>tin</b> and <b>fluoride</b> exhibit remarkable anti-erosive properties with tin ions {{as a major}} agent. To elucidate its {{mechanism of}} action in dentine, the tin uptake on and in the tissue was investigated and related to histological findings and substance loss. Samples were treated twice daily, each treatment lasting for 2 min, with fluoride solutions [pH 4. 5; 1, 500 parts per million (p. p. m.) F] containing 2, 100, 1, 400, or 400 p. p. m. Sn as SnCl(2). In experiments 1 and 2, samples were eroded with citric acid (pH 2. 3) six times each day, each treatment lasting for 5 min; in experiment 2, the demineralized organic matrix was continuously digested by collagenase; in experiment 3, no erosive challenges were performed. Sample surfaces and cross-sections were investigated using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and profilometry. Surface retention of tin was found in almost all treatment groups and was highest in experiment 2. On cross-sections, tin was retained within the organic matrix; in mineralized areas, tin was found mainly within a depth of 10 mum. Test solutions inhibited substance loss significantly; in experiment 2, the effect was dose-dependent. Erosion inhibition seemed to depend mainly on the incorporation of tin in the mineralized dentine when the organic portion was preserved, but on surface precipitation when the organic portion was continuously digested...|$|R
40|$|Correlation of {{laboratory}} and field observations of mineral assemblages in quartz-cassiterite veins and adjacent greisen alteration zones in the Southeast Asian tin belt with equilibrium constraints generated from thermodynamic alculations {{can be used}} to assess the composition of the hydrothermal solutions responsible for the transport and deposition of tin. The hydrothermal mineral assemblage in the Southeast Asian tin deposits consists of quartz, cassiterite, muscovite, K-feldspar, topaz, magnetite, and rarely, hematite, fluorite, tourmaline, and zinnwaldite. Depth estimates and fluid inclusion homogenization and freezing temperatures indicate that this assemblage formed at • 350 øC and • 500 bars in the presence of an electrolyte solution containing • 1 molal (m) total chloride. Thermody-namic calculations indicate that the solution pH, fugacity of oxygen, fugacity of H 2 S, activity of K +, activity of Ca + 2, and the total molality of F- were • 4. 5, • 10 -al, •< 10 - 1, • 0. 1, • 10 - 3, and • 10 -a'•, respectively, during the mineralizing process. Tin was apparently transported in solution primarily as stannous chloride and hydroxide complexes. The presence of topaz precludes significant ransport of <b>tin</b> as <b>fluoride</b> complexes. Solubility calculations indicate a minimum total tin concentration in solution on the order of 10 ppm. The intimate association of cassiterite and the greisenized wall rock adjoining the veins suggests hat tin mineralization occurred in response to increasing solution pH accompanying hydrothermal alteration of the host rock...|$|R

In these products, fluorides {{can be added}} in several different forms, such as sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate, <b>tin</b> <b>fluoride,</b> or {{in the form of}} different amines. This paper describes the potentiometric method with flow injection and continuous analysis for determination of hydrolysis of sodium monofluorophosphate and fluoride in the samples of toothpastes and pills. The measurements were performed in a home-made cell under appropriate flow conditions (2. 86 mL min – 1, 0. 2 mL samples, 10 – 6 M sodium fluoride and Ac-buffer pH= 5. 5). Na 2 FPO 3 complete hydrolyzed at a concentration of 1 × 10 – 4 mol L– 1 by addition of 1. 0 mL 6. 0 M HCl in the measurements with the FIA. Measurements carried out with CA shows that even after addition of 4. 0 mL 6. 0 M HCl does not come to a complete hydrolysis Na 2 FPO 3.

40|$|Fluorine doped {{tin oxide}} (FTO) {{coatings}} {{have been prepared}} using the mid-frequency pulsed DC closed field unbalanced magnetron sputtering technique in an Ar/O 2 atmosphere using blends of tin oxide and <b>tin</b> <b>fluoride</b> powder formed into targets. FTO coatings were deposited with a thickness of 400 nm on glass substrates. No post-deposition annealing treatments were carried out. The effects of the chemical composition on the structural (phase, grain size), optical (transmission, optical band-gap) and electrical (resistivity, charge carrier, mobility) properties of the thin films were investigated. Depositing FTO by magnetron sputtering is an environmentally friendly technique {{and the use of}} loosely packed blended powder targets gives an efficient means of screening candidate compositions, which also provides a low cost operation. The best film characteristics were achieved using a mass ratio of 12 % SnF 2 to 88 % SnO 2 in the target. The thin film produced was polycrystalline with a tetragonal crystal structure. The optimized conditions resulted in a thin film with average visible transmittance of 83 % and optical band-gap of 3. 80 eV, resistivity of 6. 71 × 10 − 3 Ω·cm, a carrier concentration (Nd) of 1. 46 × 1020 cm− 3 and a mobility of 15 cm 2 /Vs...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the nature of}} ion {{mobility}} in cryolite and lead fluoride based compounds is investigated by computer simulation. The phase transition of cryolite is characterised in terms of rotation of AIF_ 6 octahedra, and the conductive properties are shown to result from diffusion of the sodium ions. The two processes appear to be unrelated. Very good agreement with NMR experimental results is found. The Pb" 2 "+ ion has a very high polarisability, yet treatment of this property in previous simulations has been problematic. In this thesis a more physically accurate method is used) and the methods of overcoming problems associated with highly polarisable anions and cations in close proximity are discussed, leading to a successful model for the representation of lead fluoride. The ion hopping processes detected by NMR in the #alpha# form of lead fluoride are reproduced in simulation, and the analysis of this motion is greatly assisted by {{the application of a}} new method of lattice site definition. The effects of potassium and yttrium dopants on the structure and conduction are investigated in detail, and their roles both above and below the superionic transition temperature are contrasted. By observation of clusters in low temperature heavily yttrium doped simulations a structure for the short lived defect clusters in superionic lead fluoride is proposed. Very good agreement with the experimental observables is found; in particular the diffuse scattering, which experimentally gives an indication of the correlations between nearby defects is well-reproduced. The most stringent test of simulation model transferability is presented in the studies of lead <b>tin</b> <b>fluoride,</b> in which significant 'covalent' effects are apparent. Other similarly-structured compounds are also investigated, and the reasons behind the adoption of such an unusual layered structure, and the mobility and site occupation of the anions is quantified.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} theoretical {{study of the}} stability of the gas-phase diatomic dications SnF 2 +, SnCl 2 +, and SnO 2 + using ab initio computer calculations. The ground states of SnF 2 +, SnCl 2 +, and SnO 2 + are thermodynamically stable, respectively, with dissociation energies of 0. 45, 0. 30, and 0. 42 eV. Whereas SnF 2 + dissociates into Sn 2 + + F, the long range behaviour of the potential energy curves of SnCl 2 + and SnO 2 + is repulsive and wide barrier heights due to avoided crossing act as a kind of effective dissociation energy. Their equilibrium internuclear distances are 4. 855, 5. 201, and 4. 852 a(0), respectively. The double ionisation energies (T-e) to form SnF 2 +, SnCl 2 +, and SnO 2 + from their respective neutral parents are 25. 87, 23. 71, and 25. 97 eV. We combine our theoretical work with the experimental results of a search for these doubly positively charged diatomic molecules in the gas phase. SnO 2 + and SnF 2 + have been observed for prolonged oxygen (O- 16 (-)) ion beam sputtering of a tin metal foil and of <b>tin</b> (II) <b>fluoride</b> (SnF 2) powder, respectively, for ion flight times of about 10 (- 5) s through a magnetic-sector mass spectrometer. In addition, SnCl 2 + has been detected for O- 16 (-) ion surface bombardment of stannous (tin (II)) chloride (SnCl 2) powder. To our knowledge, SnF 2 + is a novel gas-phase molecule, whereas SnCl 2 + had been detected previously by electron-impact ionization mass spectrometry, and SnO 2 + had been observed before by spark source mass spectrometry as well as by atom probe mass spectrometry. We are not aware of any previous theoretical studies of these molecular systems. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} chemical {{distribution of}} five elements in several undecalcified sections of teeth {{was determined by}} the electron mi-croprobe method. The calcium (Ca) ! phos-phorus (P) weight percent ratios were de-termined in scans through the enamel and dentin, and characteristic curves for the concentration of the trace elements mag-nesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and chlorine (Cl) were obtained. The electron microprobe permits the qual-itative and quantitative analysis of elements in a continuing or spot scan of an extremely smooth dental or other mineralized surface. This instrument has been widely and suc-cessfully used in the fields of metallurgy and geology and in the study of semicon-ductors. Smith and co-workers'- 5 have de-veloped correction formulae for quantitative analyses of chemically complex systems and have shown that values obtained are accurate within 1 - 5 %. Several laboratories have been doing bio-logical analyses using the microprobe from the time it was first marketed in this coun-try. The earlier work was primarily on sam-ples that could be analyzed for elements heavier than sodium and was generally limited to biologically hard parts such as bone. 6 Hoerman et a 17 have reported the uptake of tin and fluorine in human enamel in situ by the topical applications of stan-nous <b>fluoride.</b> <b>Tin</b> concentrations were de-termined by the electron microprobe, and fluorine (F) determinations were made chemically.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this in vitro {{study was to investigate}} the effect of different fluoride solutions on enamel erosion. Human enamel specimens were pretreated with 1 of 10 different fluoride solutions (n = 20) : TiF(4), NaF, AmF, ZnF(2), or SnF(2), each at native pH (pH range: 1. 2 - 7. 8) or buffered pH (pH = 4). The control group samples received no fluoride pretreatment. All samples were then eroded by citric acid (pH 2. 6) for 6 x 1 min daily over 5 days. Between the erosive cycles, the samples were stored in artificial saliva. Erosion effects were investigated by surface profilometry (n = 10), scanning electron microscopy (n = 4), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (n = 6) after fluoride pretreatment and after erosion. To test the effects of pH only, additional experiments were carried out with fluoride-free solutions at similar pH to that of fluoride solutions. In general, AmF solution was more effective in protecting enamel erosion compared to all other fluoride agents. However, the application of native TiF(4), native and buffered SnF(2), and native and buffered AmF solutions also resulted in significantly less enamel loss compared to the control group. A Ti-rich coating was formed after application of native TiF(4), but partially dissolved due to erosive attack. Samples pretreated with SnF(2) showed a significant increase in surface <b>tin</b> content. Surface <b>fluoride</b> concentration was significantly increased by native TiF(4), native and buffered AmF, buffered ZnF(2), and buffered NaF application. Under the current experimental setting, the fluoride agents at lower pH had better protective potential.

40|$|The {{blending}} of polymers {{is a relatively}} inexpensive method of manipulating their properties and is common practice in the industry. Phosphate glass/polymer hybrids are an emerging class of nanomaterial with peculiar characteristics derived from nano-micro interactions of their components. Inorganic phosphate glasses {{are made up of}} chain-like molecules and are similar to polymer chains in their structure. These glasses are also unique in exhibiting similar processing temperatures to polymers, which opens up the possibility of co-processing and of greatly extending the range of obtainable properties. Both components being fluid during processing allow controlling and tailoring hybrid morphologies, and avoiding the problem of the intractable viscosity inherent from a high solid filler concentration. This work investigates the {{blending of}} an organic semi-crystalline polymer, polyamide 11 (PA 11), with different compositions of phosphate glasses. Experimental and theoretical studies of miscibility and phase behaviour of these unusual blends were analysed. In particular the research investigated the effect of glass composition on the rheological and thermo-chemical properties and nano/microstructure of these new materials, focusing on the <b>tin</b> <b>fluoride</b> (SnF 2) content in the glasses. The Flory Huggins equilibrium depression point model was employed to correlate and predict miscibility behaviour in these new systems. The experimental results showed that a high amount of SnF 2 could act as a proper compatibilizer for the novel Rilsan ® PA 11 matrix. Experiments showed that the halogen content lowered the glass transition temperature (Tg) and softening point (Ts) of the glasses, allowing both phases being fluid during melt-blending. However the water stability of the glasses was improved with increasing SnF 2 content in the network. The particle size of glass in the hybrids was inversely correlated with SnF 2 in the glass composition. This phenomenon resulted in lowering the equilibrium melting point (Tm 0) in the hybrids. The load force (F) generated during the extrusion process and the hybrid viscosities decreased, without compromising chemical and thermal stability of the materials. The Tg of PA 11, measured as shifts of the major peak in dissipation factor against temperature plot, was inversely correlated with SnF 2 content in the v glass composition, phenomenon often attributed to the partial miscibility of components in a system. The stiffness of the hybrid was improved by higher amount of SnF 2 in the glass compositions with polyamide reinforced by the glass having the lowest Tg (60 SnF 2 mol...|$|E
40|$|A C 60 -cyclopentadiene cycloadduct was readily synthesized, by a Diels-Alder {{reaction}} between C 60 {{and freshly}} cracked cyclopentadiene. The functionalized C 60 and norbornene were then pre-mixed in varying molar ratios and co-polymerized using a ROMP approach with catalytic amounts of Grubbs second generation catalyst. A series of C 60 -containing polymers were also synthesized by the co-polymerization of a C 60 -cyclopentadiene cycloadduct and N-(cycloheptyl) -exo-norbornene- 5, 6 -dicarboximide in varying ratios using similar procedures. The polymerization was facilitated {{by use of}} a catalytic amount of Grubbs second generation catalyst. The C 60 co-polymers formed were investigated by FT-IR, UV-visible, 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Functionalization of C 60 was achieved by using a 1, 3 -dipolar addition of azomethine ylides to C 60 that resulted in fulleropyrrolidines containing 2 - and 3 -thiophenecarboxaldehyde. Finally, the two C 60 derivatives, together with different ratios of either thiophene or 3 -hexylthiophene, were oxidatively copolymerized using FeCl 3 as catalyst. Either nitrogen-doped or undoped carbon nanotubes were synthesized from ferrocene, pyridine and toluene and decomposition of acetylene over a catalyst respectively, were functionalized using azomethine ylides from the thermal condensation of N-methylglycine and 5 -norbornene- 2 -carboxaldehyde. The polymerization from the side walls of the carbon nanotubes using bicyclo[2. 2. 1]hept- 2 -ene as a monomer was achieved using the Grubbs‟ second generation catalyst. The synthesised CNTs and polymer-attached carbon nanotubes were subsequently characterised. The attachment of different organic functional groups to the carbon nanotubes from the thermal condensation of N-methylglycine and 2 -thiophenecarboxaldehyde was achieved. The functionalized carbon nanotubes, and either thiophene or 3 -hexylthiophene were used in copolymerization reactions by oxidative polymerization, using FeCl 3 as catalyst. The copolymers containing the nanotubes, {{were found to be}} more regioregular than pure poly(3 -hexylthiophene). The synthesised CNTs and polymer-attached carbon nanotubes were then characterised.
