50|$|The OS/360 Object File Format is the {{standard}} object module file format for the IBM DOS/360, OS/360 and VM/370, Univac VS/9, and Fujitsu BS2000 mainframe <b>operating</b> <b>systems.</b> In <b>the</b> 1990s, the format was given an extension with the XSD-type record for <b>the</b> MVS <b>Operating</b> <b>System</b> to support longer module names in the C Programming Language. This format is still in use by <b>the</b> z/VSE <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> (<b>the</b> follow-on to <b>the</b> DOS/360 <b>Operating</b> <b>System).</b> In contrast, it has been superseded by the GOFF file format on <b>the</b> MVS <b>Operating</b> <b>System</b> (<b>the</b> follow-on to <b>the</b> OS/360 <b>Operating</b> <b>System)</b> and on <b>the</b> z/VM <b>Operating</b> <b>System</b> (<b>the</b> follow-on to <b>the</b> VM/370 <b>Operating</b> <b>System).</b> Since <b>the</b> MVS and z/VM loaders will still handle this older format, some compilers have chosen to continue to produce this format instead of the newer GOFF format.|$|R

Still, {{some aspects of}} the BitLocker (such as turning autolocking on or off) had to be managed through a command-line tool called manage-bde.wsf.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of these developments, a {{dedicated}} community, centered on forums such as XDA Developers, emerged surrounding the creation of custom firmware ("ROMs") built from the Android source code.

5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E
5|$|As part of Microsoft's {{unification}} strategies, Windows {{products that}} are based on Windows 10's common platform but meant for specialized platforms are marketed as editions of <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> rather than as separate product lines. An updated version of Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system for smartphones, and also tablets, was branded as Windows 10 Mobile. Editions of Enterprise and Mobile will also be produced for embedded systems, along with Windows 10 IoT Core, which is designed specifically for use in small footprint, low-cost devices and Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios and is similar to Windows Embedded.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s {{very few}} {{specialized}} digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried {{the risk of}} modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Microsoft {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers, paying Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested that Microsoft write a new operating system for their computers called OS/2. Microsoft wrote <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{several months}} {{after the release of}} Net-2, William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz wrote {{replacements}} for those six missing files, ported BSD to the Intel 80386-based microprocessors, and called their new operating system 386BSD. They released 386BSD via an anonymous FTP server. The development flow of 386BSD was slow and after a period of neglect, a group of 386BSD users decided to branch out on their own and create FreeBSD so that they could keep <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> up to date. The first version of FreeBSD was released on November 1993.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Virtualization enables {{installation}} and running of multiple virtual machines on <b>the</b> same computer <b>system.</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>system</b> that communicates directly with hardware {{is known as}} <b>the</b> host <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> whereas virtual <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> have all <b>the</b> features of a real <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> but they run inside <b>the</b> host <b>operating</b> <b>system.</b> A virtual machine is separated from the computer hardware resources and it runs on the emulated hardware. Performance of <b>the</b> virtual <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> running on <b>the</b> same computer system hardware depends {{on the performance of}} <b>the</b> host <b>operating</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper we study how different host <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> influence virtual machine performance.
