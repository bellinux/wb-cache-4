25|$|Once {{she started}} experimenting with the gum-bichromate process, Hahn started {{stitching}} into her photographs. Printing onto canvas and other fabrics {{allowed her to}} use thread to highlight {{certain aspects of the}} photograph. In combining her photographs with conventional practices, Hahn successfully intertwines formal and conceptual aspects. Not only does she speak to the mundane tasks of everyday life, but also about routine and normativity. In highlighting the ordinary in her work, Hahn elevates and revives <b>that</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> been lost in the practice of daily life. Embroidery references femininity, as Hahn underlines the feminist issue of the anonymity of women's handicraft. Her embroidery often emphasized flowers with its three-dimensionality, furthering the idea of femininity; she later on pursued this as a symbol and incorporated it in several of her other series.|$|E

500|$|After passing October 1902 to May 1903 at Menton on the French Riviera, Kruger {{moved back}} to Hilversum, then {{returned}} to Menton in October 1903. In early 1904 he moved to Clarens, a small village in the canton of Vaud in western Switzerland where he {{spent the rest of}} his days looking over Lake Geneva and the Alps from his balcony. [...] "He who wishes to create a future must not lose track of the past", he wrote in his final letter, addressed {{to the people of the}} Transvaal.

It is true: much that has been built is now destroyed, damaged, levelled. But with unity of purpose and unity of strength <b>that</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> been pulled down can be built again." [...] After contracting pneumonia, Paul Kruger died in Clarens on 14 July 1904 at the age of 78. His Bible lay open on a table beside him.|$|E
500|$|There is {{widespread}} {{frustration with the}} land title system. [...] Privatising home ownership {{and the creation of}} a market economy with long term leases is seen by some commentators as the best option to move forward on Palm. [...] This proposal is described as giving Indigenous people [...] "skin in the game" [...] and empowerment. [...] In the period 1999 to 2007 35houses were replaced due to damage. [...] Noel Pearson of the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership argues that housing degradation in these communities has more to do with overcrowding and poor construction than it does with poor tenancy. [...] However he adds that Aboriginal people naturally take much better care of property that they have constructed or paid for themselves, than they do <b>that</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> been handed to them 'on a plate' and which they have had little personal engagement in. [...] The push for privatisation of title was led by the Australian Government (through Mal Brough, Indigenous Affairs Minister), Noel Pearson, and some families on the island (the community is very divided on this issue). The proposal had partial (or cautious) support from the then Federal Australian Labor Party Opposition.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the various}} {{uses of the}} word today, [...] "nature" [...] often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, {{and in some cases}} to the {{processes}} associated with inanimate objects–the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the [...] "natural environment" [...] or wilderness–wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, [...] "human nature" [...] or [...] "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as <b>that</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term [...] "natural" [...] might also be distinguished from the [...] or the supernatural.|$|E
500|$|Attempting to {{reconcile}} these disparate positions, Eastern Orthodox theologian Dr. Mario Baghos notes that [...] "when taken {{at face value}} the saint seems to be contradicting himself in these passages; {{on the one hand}} he asserted the salvation of all and the complete eradication of evil, and, on the other, that the fire needed to purge evil is ‘sleepless’, i.e. everlasting. The only solution to this inconsistency is to view any allusion to universal salvation in St Gregory as an expression of God’s intention for humanity, which is in fact attested to when his holy sister states that God has “one goal [...] some straightway even in this life purified from evil, others healed hereafter through fire for the appropriate length of time.” That we can choose either to accept or ignore this purification is confirmed by the saint’s many exhortations that we freely undertake the virtuous path." [...] Dr. Ilaria Ramelli has made the observation that for Gregory free will was compatible with universal salvation, since every person would eventually accept the good having gone through purification. However, Gregory conceded that some sinners, such as Judas, might never be completely purified when he wrote, [...] "that which never existed is to be preferred to <b>that</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> existed in such sin. For, as to the latter, on account of the depth of the ingrained evil, the chastisement in the way of purgation will be extended into infinity".|$|E
500|$|Campbell's {{plans for}} Unknown {{were laid out}} in the February 1939 issue of Astounding, in the {{announcement}} of the new magazine. He argued that [...] "it has been the quality of the fantasy that you have read in the past that has made the very word anathema ... will offer fantasy of a quality so far different from <b>that</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> appeared in the past as to change your entire understanding of the term". The first issue, the following month, led with Russell's Sinister Barrier, the novel that had persuaded Campbell to set his plans for a fantasy magazine into motion: the plot, involving aliens who own the human race, has been described by sf historian Mike Ashley as [...] "a strange mixture of science fiction and occult fantasy". Campbell asked Russell for revisions to the story to emphasize the fantastic elements, but still demanded that Russell work out the logical implications of his premises. This became a defining characteristic of the fiction published in Unknown; in Ashley's words, Campbell [...] "brought the science fiction rationale to fantasy". [...] The first issue also contained Horace L. Gold's [...] "Trouble with Water", a comic fantasy about a modern New Yorker who offends a water gnome; in its whimsicality and naturalistic merging of a modern background with a classic fantasy trope, [...] "Trouble with Water" [...] was a better indication than Sinister Barrier of the direction Unknown would take. [...] Campbell commented in a letter at the time that Sinister Barrier, [...] "Trouble with Water", and Where Angels Fear ... by Manly Wade Wellman were the only stories in the first issue that accurately reflected his goals for the magazine.|$|E

500|$|Of more {{importance}} to the science fiction and fantasy genres were several other magazines that debuted in 1939. [...] The first to appear, from Standard Magazines, were Startling Stories and Strange Stories, launched in January and February respectively as companions to Thrilling Wonder Stories; Mort Weisinger edited all three. [...] Startling included a lead novel and a [...] "Hall of Fame" [...] reprint section in every issue; the latter was possible because the publisher, Standard Magazines, owned the back catalog of Wonder Stories. [...] At that time no other sf pulp was including novels; readers approved, and Startling quickly {{became one of the}} most popular sf magazines. [...] Strange Stories was launched as a direct competitor to Weird Tales, and the first issue featured many of Weird Tales most popular authors, including Robert Bloch, August Derleth, Henry Kuttner and Manly Wade Wellman. Bloch, Derleth, and Kuttner were all frequent contributors over the magazine's life, but Ashley regards it as a poor imitation of Weird Tales, fewer of its stories having been anthologized since. [...] At the end of 1938 Weird Tales owner, B. Cornelius, sold his interest in the magazine to William J. Delaney, the publisher of Short Stories, a general fiction magazine. [...] Delaney's offices were in New York, and Weird Tales editor, Farnsworth Wright, moved there from Chicago. [...] Delaney made several changes to page count and frequency to try to increase circulation, but none were successful. [...] While this took place, another competitor to Weird Tales was launched, this time by Street & Smith. [...] The new magazine, titled Unknown, was a companion to Astounding and was also edited by John W. Campbell. [...] Campbell's declared policy for the magazine was to [...] "offer fantasy of a quality so far different from <b>that</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> appeared in the past as to change your entire understanding of the term"; the goal was to bring [...] "the science fiction rationale to fantasy", in Ashley's words. [...] Unknowns first issue was dated March 1939, with L. Ron Hubbard and L. Sprague de Camp soon among the most frequent contributors.|$|E
