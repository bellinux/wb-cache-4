5000|$|They first {{investigated}} and confirmed the floating escape gear & then approached the sub, having strict instructions {{not to go}} along side. Standing off they made contact. The sub was Russian - unbelievable! - They’d had a fire, 9 dead, three injured. The dead were on the casing aft of the fin. Men, smouldering from the heat were appearing from the aft hatch wearing breathing apparatus <b>to</b> be <b>splashed</b> <b>down</b> with sea water by their comrades. The lifeboat asked {{to speak to the}} captain. There was some confusion and then one stepped forward.|$|R

While {{preparing}} for the liftoff from the lunar surface, Armstrong and Aldrin discovered that, in their bulky spacesuits, they had broken the ignition switch for the ascent engine; using part of a pen, they pushed the circuit breaker in to activate the launch sequence.

2500|$|The {{destroyer}} quickly {{settled into}} the by now familiar cycle of training and upkeep. The only break came in {{the second week of}} November, when she served as an alternate recovery ship during the Apollo 4 unmanned capsule flight test. Unfortunately, the crash and loss of a DASH drone marred an otherwise uneventful mission. Misfortune dogged Carpenter when another drone crashed on 10 January 1968. Despite those mishaps, however, the ship passed all her inspections early in the year and resumed local operations in March. Departing Pearl Harbor on 29 March, the destroyer proceeded north of Midway on a secondary recovery station for another unmanned capsule flight.

50|$|On 24 June, {{during the}} {{preliminary}} bombardment, the minesweeping force of which Thunder was a member, arrived off Point Barfleur in mid-afternoon. German shore-based gunfire began <b>to</b> <b>splash</b> <b>down</b> around the minesweepers after an hour, leading the escorting United States Navy destroyers to deploy a smokescreen and order the minesweepers to cut sweeps and retire. The following {{day during the}} assault, the minesweepers were deployed again. Shore-based gunfire began raining down on the minesweepers again. Thunder was hit by shrapnel from a near miss and the destroyers were once again forced to lay a smokescreen.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2009, an Italian court sentenced the pilot, Chafik Garbi, to 10 {{years in}} prison for manslaughter. Prosecutors said that after the planes engines stopped functioning, Garbi failed to follow {{emergency}} procedures, and that he could possibly have reached runway 25 of Falcone-Borsellino Airport, or even the standard runway 20. Witnesses say he succumbed to panic and began praying out loud, rather than attempting to maneuver the plane to the nearest airport. The last five minutes of the cockpit voice recorder audio have a few scattered seconds of religiously oriented interjections such as [...] "God save us!", with the pilot repeatedly telling ATC that the plane is too far out to make it to land, carefully selecting a ship <b>to</b> <b>splash</b> <b>down</b> near to, and repeatedly trying to restart the engines.|$|E

40|$|NASA is {{developing}} the Orion capsule {{as a vehicle}} for transporting crewmembers to and from the International Space Station (ISS) and for future human space exploration missions. Orion and other commercial vehicles are designed <b>to</b> <b>splash</b> <b>down</b> in the ocean where nominally support personnel will assist crewmembers in egressing the vehicle. However, off-nominal scenarios will require crewmembers to egress the vehicle unaided, deploy survival equipment, and ingress a life raft. PURPOSE: To determine the heart rate (HR) responses to unaided Orion side hatch egress and raft ingress {{as a part of the}} NASA Crew Survival Engineering Team's evaluation of the PORT Orion mockup in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL). METHODS: Nineteen test subjects, including four astronauts (N= 19, 14 males/ 5 females, 38. 6 +/- 8. 4 y, 174. 4 +/- 9. 6 cm, 75. 7 +/- 13. 1 kg), completed a graded maximal test on a cycle ergometer to determine VO 2 peak and HRpeak and were divided into five crews of four members each; one subject served on two crews. Each crew was required to deploy a life raft, egress the Orion vehicle from the side hatch, and ingress the life raft with two 8 kg emergency packs per crew. Each crew performed this activity one to three times; a total of ten full egresses were completed. Subjects wore a suit that was similar in form, mass, and function to the Modified Advanced Crew Escape Suit (MACES) including helmet, gloves, boots, supplemental O 2 bottles, and a CO 2 -inflated life preserver (approx. 18 kg); subjects began each trial seated supine in the PORT Orion mockup with seat belts and mockup O 2 and communication connections and ended each trial with all four crewmembers inside the life raft. RESULTS: VO 2 peak was 40. 8 +/- 6. 8 mL/kg/min (3. 1 +/- 0. 7 L/min); HRpeak was 181 +/- 10 bpm. Total egress time across trials was 5. 0 +/- 1. 6 min (range: 2. 8 - 8. 0 min); all subjects were able to successfully complete all trials. Average maximum HR at activity start, at the hatch opening, in the water, and in the raft, was 108, 137, 147, and 153 bpm, respectively; these values corresponded to 59 +/- 10 %, 73 +/- 8 %, 82 +/- 3 %, and 84 +/- 6 % of HRpeak, respectively. The highest HRs were seen after raft ingress and ranged from 72 - 99 % HRpeak. Across all trials, cumulative averages of 5. 4, 3. 0, 1. 1, and 0. 2 min were spent at HRs > 60 %, > 70 %, > 80 %, and > 90 % HRpeak, respectively. CONCLUSION: Unaided Orion side hatch egress in the NBL is a relatively short-duration activity that elicits a high HR response for several min. Although all crewmembers successfully completed this activity, additional factors such as high seas, poor visibility, an incapacitated crewmember, neurovestibular perturbation, and neuromuscular deconditioning characteristic of a true operational environment may increase the physiologic demand (or decrease crewmembers' physiologic capacity) of unaided Orion side hatch egress. Additionally, landing conditions may require the crewmembers to egress from the top hatch, which is expected to be even more physiologically demanding; this condition will be evaluated in subsequent collaborative testing with the NASA Crew Survival Engineering Team...|$|E
