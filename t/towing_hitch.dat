5000|$|The Type 1 Ho-Ha {{had a pair}} of road {{wheels in}} front, {{supported}} by a pair of short caterpillar tracks to the rear. [...] It was equipped a tow coupling in the front and a <b>towing</b> <b>hitch</b> at the rear to haul artillery or a supply trailer. The maximum armor thickness was 8 mm with sloping armor plates. As with the Type 1 Ho-Ki, the hull was welded construction and it was [...] "open-topped".|$|E
50|$|In French service, this {{weapon is}} {{normally}} towed by the VTM 120 (Véhicule Tracteur Mortier de 120 mm), a wheeled armored vehicle {{that is a}} derivative of the VAB 4x4 series of armored personnel carrier. Towing is accomplished by a <b>towing</b> <b>hitch</b> that is screwed onto the muzzle of the weapon. The VTM 120 also carries 70 rounds for the mortar and offers basic ballistic protection from small arms fire and shrapnel for the crew. The RT-61 can also be towed by the AMX-10 TM (Tracteur de Mortier), which is {{a version of the}} AMX-10P tracked APC. The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force have a self-propelled version of the RT-61 with 50 rounds, the Type 96.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} forms of <b>tow</b> <b>hitch,</b> {{including}} a ball <b>hitch,</b> <b>tow</b> bar, pintle and lunette ring, three-point, fifth wheel, coupling, and drawbar, among others.|$|R

5000|$|The first-generation 2002-2005 model years TrailBlazer {{is based}} on a truck {{platform}} called GMT360, with all models having four-wheel drive as an option with both automatic engagement and the more traditional [...] "4 High" [...] and [...] "4 Low" [...] gearings, except the SS model which features an All wheel drive system. The TrailBlazer features an independent front suspension, and a five-link rear suspension. A G80 locking rear differential is available as an option on all models except for the SS which has a G86 LSD standard. An LTZ version, has upgraded interior features (leather), better sound system (Bose), alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes. All TrailBlazers came factory equipped with a detachable <b>towing</b> <b>hitch.</b>|$|E
50|$|TSP or Trailer Stability Program is {{one feature}} {{which has been}} added to some vehicles, to help correct the ‘snaking’ action of a trailer. With such {{advanced}} technology, some braking systems have even evolved further by being operated electronically, without the need for hydraulics. Braking can become more controlled with faster braking efficiency when towing. Some suspension systems can now detect a trailer and allow for a more level towing adjustment when the load is applied on the <b>towing</b> <b>hitch.</b> ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) systems are meant to ‘detect’ a trailer {{in order to create a}} greater braking distance between vehicles.It might be considered unwise to bypass such vehicles' trailer detection systems as these vehicles may be designed to behave in a different way when a trailer is attached.|$|E
50|$|A {{jockey wheel}} is a {{retractable}} adjustable-height wheel {{used on the}} front of trailers with either a single axle (two running wheels) or more close-coupled axles at or near the centre of gravity whereby without additional support, the trailer would not remain 'level'. The jockey wheel is situated close to the <b>towing</b> <b>hitch</b> and has a built-in screw jack to enable the trailer nose to be lifted over the tow ball of a car or other powered vehicle. The screw jack can then be used to gently lower the trailer nose onto the tow ball. Once securely attached to the towing vehicle, the jockey wheel's jacking action is fully retracted for stowage. The jockey wheel is also unclamped and lifted as far as possible to give the greatest ground clearance before reclamping prior to a journey being made.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of <b>towing</b> <b>hitches</b> {{designed}} to carry other vehicles, there are more specialized types, described immediately below.|$|R
50|$|Automobile mounted bike {{carriers}} can {{be attached}} to the roof, rear trunk, or rear <b>tow</b> <b>hitch,</b> depending on the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Semi-trailer - 1 axle (2 wheels), {{without the}} front axle {{but have a}} landing gear. Large {{semi-trailer}} of truck size is designed for connection via the fifth wheel on the tractor unit or the semi-trailer truck. Small semi-trailer such as travel trailer and boat trailer is design for connection via a <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> of a passenger vehicle. Either the fifth wheel or the <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> takes up to half to load of the semi-trailer.|$|R
50|$|A trailer hitch, fifth-wheel {{coupling}} or {{other type of}} <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> is needed to draw a trailer with a car, truck or other traction engine.|$|R

50|$|A trailer <b>hitch</b> or <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> is {{a device}} {{mounted on a}} {{motorcycle}} that enables it to tow a motorcycle trailer. Legislation often restricts them to carrying baggage and not passengers.|$|R
5000|$|Of note, snatch straps {{should never}} be {{attached}} to <b>tow</b> <b>hitches,</b> as they are not designed to take the massive load that snatching places upon them. A broken towball attached to a snatch strap can be lethal.|$|R
5000|$|Ringfeders {{are used}} in nearly all aspects of world transport, the most common being LGVs (Large Goods Vehicles) {{throughout}} Europe, and road trains in Australia. America uses a similar product known as a [...] "Pintle Hook" [...] or <b>tow</b> <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The GMT800-based Suburbans were {{introduced}} in late 1999 for the 2000 model year. They were sold in two series: 1/2-ton 1500 and 3/4-ton 2500. Suburbans came in Base, LS and LT trims. Optional was pushbutton 4WD with low-range transfer case. A <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> with trailer wiring plug was optional.|$|R
5000|$|County Rider (France, 1993): Intended {{to appeal}} to equestrians, the County Rider was {{equipped}} with a rear floor liner, rub-strips and wheel-arch protectors, mudflaps, floor mats, an adjustable <b>tow</b> <b>hitch,</b> and a saddle rack. Available as either a three- or five-door, all were painted green with special decals.|$|R
25|$|On November 6, 2013 another fire {{broke out}} after a Model S struck a <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> on the roadway, causing damage beneath the vehicle. The {{incidents}} led Tesla to extend its vehicle warranty to cover fire damage and to apply a software update to increase ground clearance when operating at highway speed.|$|R
5000|$|The 2009 {{model year}} brought more unusual {{standard}} {{equipment such as}} a seven-pin blade trailer wiring harness for Canadian models and a class III <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> for all models. [...] The 2013 model year brought with it a rearview camera to round out the unusual list of standard equipment for the Honda Ridgeline.|$|R
5000|$|Movement of {{the yard}} ramp - Yard ramps are {{typically}} moved around using a simple tow bar which is pinned into the <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> {{on the back of}} most standard fork trucks, though some designs offer alternative methods, such as pushing the ramp around using pockets which accept the standard forks of a fork truck.|$|R

50|$|Across Europe around 25% of {{vehicles}} have tow balls fitted—but there are distinct regional variations, being {{more common in}} Benelux and Scandinavia. In Sweden, around 2.2 million cars of around 4.3 million (just over 50%) have tow balls. In the United Kingdom the popularity of caravans is responsible for a high percentage number of 4x4 (SUV) type vehicles being fitted with <b>tow</b> <b>hitches.</b>|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{generation}} Prius is 2.4 in longer, 0.6 in wider and 0.8 in lower, {{at the rear}} a double wishbone independent suspension replaces its predecessors' torsion beam. The front uses standard LED headlamps. Toyota has claimed {{that it has a}} , better than the 0.25 claimed for the third-generation model. A <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> option is available in the UK for up to 1600 lb.|$|R
5000|$|The toter {{is often}} {{confused}} or {{mistaken for a}} semi-trailer tractor. The key {{difference between the two}} is in the method of coupling. Toters are equipped with a 2-5/16" [...] (59 mm) diameter ball that couples with the <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> on the tongue of a mobile or manufactured home or the removable transport frame of a modular home. Semi-trailer tractors have fifth wheel couplings designed to couple to a semi-trailer.|$|R
50|$|The low <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> {{position}} and small tow ring means {{they were really}} only suitable for towing behind an M7, as they dragged at quite an angle when hitched to a Weasel. An M7 tractor could tow two loaded M19 trailers on solid going such as an ice or snow-covered road, and when rougher ground was to be traversed it would drop one unit and shuttle them across the rougher ground one at a time.|$|R
50|$|Toyota {{made the}} new Tundra useful for many {{construction}} workers by including extra large door handles, deck rail system, integrated <b>tow</b> <b>hitch,</b> and head restraints that can fit a worker with a hardhat. The Tundra also includes as standard: an electronic automatic limited-slip differential (Auto LSD), Vehicle Stability Control, traction control, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist, anti-lock brakes and tailgate assist. However, its starting was {{more expensive than}} the Chevrolet Silverado Work Truck and the base Ford F-150.|$|R

50|$|A {{semi-trailer}} {{designed as}} automobile rescue equipment. It {{is designed to}} couple to the concerned automobile's powered wheel, i.e. the front wheel of a Front-wheel drive automobile, or the rear wheel of a rear-wheel drive automobile, by locking the powered wheels onto the tow dolly's tray. The tow dolly is <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> connected to a tractor or truck. Tow dollies are legal in all 50 US states and Canada. In the U.S. and Canada brakes are required on any loaded car tow dolly.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tow</b> <b>hitch</b> (or <b>tow</b> bar) is {{a device}} {{attached}} to the chassis of a vehicle for towing, or a towbar to an aircraft nose gear. It can {{take the form of}} a tow ball to allow swiveling and articulation of a trailer, or a tow pin, or a tow hook with a trailer loop, often used for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the pivot pin allows similar movements. Another category is the towing pintle used on military vehicles worldwide.|$|R
2500|$|Starting in 1971, the AMI-built Matador was {{available}} in sedan and wagon body styles. Standard equipment included automatic transmission, power steering, power windows, air conditioning, and an AM radio. The engine was AMC's [...] V8, following its introduction in the 1970 Rebel. Among the options were an exterior mounted sun visor, vinyl roof cover, <b>tow</b> <b>hitch,</b> and mud flaps. The cars were targeted at the top market segment and advertised as [...] "the American luxury limousine made for Australians" [...] and built for Australian conditions.|$|R
50|$|The M-63 Plamen {{consists}} of 32 Ø128mm tubes, which can fire original Plamen-A and Plamen B rockets {{with a range}} of 8,600m. The effect of each rocket on the target is equivalent to the effect of a 105mm artillery shell. All 32 rockets can be fired in either 6.4, 12.5 or 19.2 seconds. The launcher is mounted on a single axle trailer which can be towed by vehicles with an 800mm high <b>tow</b> <b>hitch.</b> The <b>towing</b> vehicle carries reserve rockets, so the battle complement is 64 missiles.|$|R
