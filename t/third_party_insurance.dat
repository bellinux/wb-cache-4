40|$|This paper {{treats the}} {{differences}} in terms of insurance between optional and compulsory <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability <b>insurances.</b> It also treats {{the purpose of the}} compulsory <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability <b>insurances</b> and their accordance with that purpose. The primary purpose of the optional <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability <b>insurance</b> is to ensure the policyholder financial resources to cover possible claims for damages. The primary purpose of the compulsory <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability <b>insurance</b> is to render possible the compensation of a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> for damage done. The policyholders financial ability to pay damages is of subordinate interest, and the purpose of compulsory <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability <b>insurances</b> is thus twofold. Estate agents, insurance agents and accountants are required by law to have a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability <b>insurance</b> linked to their enterprises. The terms of the compulsory <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability <b>insurances</b> are, unlike the optional insurances, dictated by the legislator. As a result, the compulsory insurance has not been developed at the same pace as the optional. This is a consequence of an unwillingness on behalf of the authorities, to compromise and to adapt the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability <b>insurance</b> {{in order to make it}} more in accordance with its purpose. Therefore, the insurance companies have also been less inclined to grant insurance on the exposed premises, which has resulted in the above-mentioned enterprise-owners risking insurance distress. The legislation of each trade offers the possibility to leave other security than the holding of a compulsory <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability <b>insurance</b> to protect the <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> According to this paper, this possibility has not been enough emphasised. The conception"third party protection"should, according to the author, be emphasised in each legislation, irrespective of the form chosen. The risk exposure the enterprise-owners are exposed to can cause problems for the insurance companies in determining what liabilities should be covered by the compulsory <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability <b>insurance.</b> Damage prevention activities are carried out to different extent within each trade organisation, but compulsory <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability <b>insurances</b> are better suited within legislations where the insurance companies have good control over the proportions of the damages and as a result can assess the risk of damage more easily...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the popularization of motor vehicles and legal system construction, our daily lives become more convenient. But traffic accidents also have brought pain and heavy economic burden to the public. As the first compulsory insurance in China, the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability <b>insurance</b> aims at protect the injured in traffic accident sufficiently. In the recent years, however, {{the loss of the}} <b>third</b> <b>party</b> liability compulsory <b>insurance</b> of motor vehicle has aroused the concern of the whole society.

50|$|There {{are many}} types of {{peer-to-peer}} insurance. The first type was created by Insurance broker (as opposed to insurance companies). In this broker model, insurance policyholders will form small groups online. A part of the insurance premiums paid flow into a group fund, the other part to a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>insurance</b> company. Minor damages to the insured policyholder are firstly paid out of this group fund. For claims above the deductible limit the regular insurer is called upon. When there is no insurance claim, the policyholder gets his/her share refunded from the group pool or credited towards the next policy year. If the group pool happens to be empty, a special insurance comes into force.|$|E
50|$|Another {{considerable}} inter-provincial imbalance is {{a person}} who is insured by Quebec and obtains healthcare in another province or territory. Quebec does not have any physician payment agreements with any other provinces or territories of Canada. As a result, someone that sees a physician outside Quebec, even in another part of Canada, must either pay the cost themselves and submit a request to the RÃ©gie de l'Assurance Maladie du QuÃ©bec (RAMQ Medicare) for reimbursement (even then, expenses are often denied), or take out a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>insurance</b> plan. The same situation also applies to a resident of any other part of Canada visiting Quebec, only they submit any claims to their respective provincial healthplan. All provinces and territories of Canada, however, do have reciprocal hospital agreements, so hospital admissions, for example, are covered throughout Canada.|$|E
