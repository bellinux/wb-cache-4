5|$|Botanists {{study how}} plants produce food {{and how to}} {{increase}} yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems. Ethnobotany {{is the study of}} the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany. Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> of Canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants. This relationship <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> had with plants was recorded by ethnobotanists.|$|E

50|$|After independence, the {{government}} of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman began to promote Bengali nationalism which was also the basis of Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. However, the nationalism based on the Bengali ethnicity left <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> of Bangladesh dejected. Sheikh Mujib, rejecting the demands of constitutional recognition for the tribal culture and identity, urged upon <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> to become Bengalis. Dissatisfied with the acts of <b>the</b> government, <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> from Chittagong Hill Tracts formed Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti, a political party, to demand autonomy.|$|R
5|$|Coyotes were {{occasionally}} {{eaten by}} trappers and mountain men during the western expansion. Coyotes sometimes {{featured in the}} feasts of the Plains Indians, and coyote pups were eaten by <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> of San Gabriel, California. The taste of coyote meat has been likened {{to that of the}} wolf, and is more tender than pork when boiled. Coyote fat, when taken in the fall, has been used on occasion to grease leather or eaten as a spread.|$|E
5|$|The Museo del Niño Rural (the Rural Kid Museum) {{was created}} as an {{initiative}} of teacher Carlos Leyton and his students. It {{is a modern}} building that utilises traditional architecture.

Wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested. The most common varieties of strawberry were domesticated from Eastern North America. Two major crops, pecans and Concord grapes, were utilized extensively in prehistoric times but {{do not appear to}} have been domesticated until the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The Chagos Islands are {{a cluster}} of 60 islands and seven atolls in the Indian Ocean. First {{occupied}} by lepers from Mauritius, France acquired the islands in the late 18th century, and slaves were brought in from Africa and India to maintain coconut plantations placed there. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, the islands were ceded to the British in the Treaty of Paris, who administered them as a dependency of the Colony of Mauritius. Although the slaves were given their freedom in 1835, many remained on the Chagos Islands as contract workers, and their descendants and later immigrants are considered <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> - the Chagossians.|$|E
5|$|The Sibu Central Market is {{the biggest}} indoor market in Sarawak. It is located at Channel Street, {{opposite}} the Sibu wharf terminal.

5|$|The {{fruit of}} Ficus aurea is edible {{and was used}} for food by <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> and early {{settlers}} in Florida; it is still eaten occasionally as a backyard source of native fruit. The latex was {{used to make a}} chewing gum, and aerial roots may have been used to make lashings, arrows, bowstrings and fishing lines. The fruit was used to make a rose-coloured dye. F. aurea was also used in traditional medicine in The Bahamas and Florida. Allison Adonizio and colleagues screened F. aurea for anti-quorum sensing activity (as a possible means of anti-bacterial action), but found no such activity.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> of {{the high}} desert region are the Northern Paiute people. These Native Americans were once {{semi-nomadic}} hunter-gatherers who relied on nuts, roots, seeds, berries, and eggs, and animals such as deer, pronghorn, geese, quail, rabbits, and bear, following their food to high and low elevations depending {{on the time of}} year. They make sandals, traps, and fishing nets, and weave baskets. Made out of sagebrush, willow, tule plant, Indian hemp, and sumac fibers, the baskets are tight enough to carry water. Archaeological evidence from near Fort Rock has shown that people wove baskets in the area at least 9,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|The island's {{proximity}} {{to the river and}} the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people,</b> mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise artisan fishing, just to supply their own daily needs. Pirogues cut from the trunks of kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.|$|E
5|$|According to Brelsford, {{the elderly}} Harrison Clark {{remained}} highly respected among <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> and was sometimes {{called upon to}} settle disputes. His last job was personnel manager at a local mine. He dedicated his final years to the writing of {{a book about his}} life, the manuscript for which was lost when his house burned down. Clark alleged that the BSAC orchestrated the fire to stop him from publishing unflattering information about the early days of Company rule. He died from heart disease in Broken Hill on 9 December 1927, aged about 67, and was buried in the Protestant section of the town cemetery. The modest savings he possessed {{at the time of his}} death were left to his sister in Port Elizabeth.|$|E

5|$|Its name {{derives from}} potlatch, {{a type of}} {{ceremony}} held by <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> of the Pacific Northwest; one such tribe lived along the river {{for hundreds of years}} before the arrival of whites. Pioneers settled the watershed and established farms and ranches in the late 19th century. After that, logging eliminated most of the forests within the watershed and the ecology of the river is {{still in the process of}} recovery. Fishing, hiking and camping are popular recreational activities on the river; 14 percent the watershed lies on public lands. Before logging and agriculture, many varieties of riparian and forest plants once populated the catchment, and several species of fish still swim the river and its tributaries.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the stated}} {{purposes}} for writing the account was Las Casas's fear of Spain coming under divine punishment and {{his concern for}} {{the souls of the}} native peoples. The account {{was one of the first}} attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict the unfair treatment that <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> endured during the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Greater Antilles, particularly the island of Hispaniola. Las Casas's point of view can be described as being heavily against some of the Spanish methods of colonization, which, as he described them, inflicted great losses on the indigenous occupants of the islands. His account was largely responsible for the adoption of the New Laws of 1542, which abolished native slavery for the first time in European colonial history and led to the Valladolid debate.|$|E
5|$|Other {{options were}} explored, {{including}} the Kalmyk Project, a Soviet plan {{to launch a}} surprise attack on the north-west frontier of India via Tibet and other Himalayan buffer states such as Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, Thailand, and Burma through the Buddhist Kalmyk people. The intention was to use these places as a staging ground for revolution in India, as they offered the shortest route to the revolutionary heartland of Bengal. Historians suggest that the plan may have been prompted by Mahendra Pratap's efforts and advice to the Soviet leadership in 1919 when—along with other Indian revolutionaries—he pressed for a joint Soviet-Afghan campaign into India. Under {{the cover of a}} scientific expedition to Tibet headed by Indologist Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, the plan was to arm <b>the</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> in the North-East Indian region with modern weaponry. The project had the approval of Lenin.|$|E
