500|$|Evans {{contributed to}} many recordings, {{including}} {{singing in the}} chorus of [...] "Yellow Submarine". He played single organ notes on [...] "You Won't See Me", and harmonica on [...] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!". McCartney explained that he showed Evans where the notes were on the organ, and <b>then</b> <b>nodded</b> his head when he wanted Evans to play, and shook it when he wanted him to stop.|$|E
60|$|Lawson {{stared at}} him for a moment with his green eyes and <b>then</b> <b>nodded.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Henchy {{waited a}} few moments and <b>then</b> <b>nodded</b> in the {{direction}} of the door.|$|E
60|$|Harding {{looked at}} him steadily, and <b>then,</b> <b>nodding</b> gravely, turned to Maccario.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then,</b> <b>nodding</b> to one another, {{the last}} of the patriots, {{satisfied}} with this night's work, passed out into the night.|$|R
6000|$|Hawkeye {{regarded}} him a moment, like {{one who knew}} not how to take the question; <b>then</b> <b>nodding</b> his head, he answered, still laughing, though inaudibly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|He looked {{once again}} all round him with {{puckered}} eyes, and <b>then</b> <b>nodded</b> assentingly to my proposal.|$|E
60|$|When we reappeared in {{the outer}} room, Mr. Magg eyed us for a moment sharply, and <b>then</b> <b>nodded.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{paused and}} whistled {{a few more}} bars, <b>then</b> <b>nodded</b> to Psmith and Mike, and left the room. They heard him {{shuffling}} downstairs.|$|E
6000|$|... (Doctor Stanton {{writes the}} figures in his book, glances sharply [...] at Eileen, and <b>then</b> <b>nods</b> {{significantly}} to Mrs. Turner who is [...] standing beside him.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Brooke {{read the}} letter, and <b>then,</b> <b>nodding</b> toward Dorothea, said, [...] "Casaubon, my dear: {{he will be}} here to dinner; he didn't wait to write more--didn't wait, you know." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>nodding</b> to me {{with the}} same inscrutable face he left the room. I was too well {{accustomed}} to his methods to think much of his unceremonious withdrawal, and made no doubt he was off to investigate some clue which had suddenly occurred to his active intelligence.|$|R
6000|$|The {{boatswain}} {{was impressed}} by the fervour of the boy. He looked at him in surprise for a few seconds, <b>then</b> <b>nodded</b> his head, and said, [...] "Fire away!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{matter was}} talked {{over for a}} while longer, and the three boys went off to {{interview}} Captain Dale. He listened to them with a smile, and <b>then</b> <b>nodded.</b>|$|E
60|$|They {{had lost}} the date. When I {{told him it was}} Sunday, the 22nd, he frowned, making some mental calculation, <b>then</b> <b>nodded</b> twice sadly to himself, staring at nothing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{novel is}} stylistically unusual {{in that it}} is written mainly in the present tense. For example, a typical passage reads:"He turns his head from side to side, and <b>then</b> <b>nods</b> at her. Uncumber realises that he wants her to do the same. She feels herself {{blushing}} at the ridiculousness of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{some little}} time he {{leaned on the}} tomb {{thinking}} of this dead man of his own blood, and {{of the house in}} Devonshire; <b>then,</b> <b>nodding</b> to the plains: [...] "Yes; it's a big work all of it even my little share. He must have been worth knowing.... Bukta, where are my people?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Nauseous in the extreme, {{it might}} have served the purpose of an emetic had not the {{digestion}} of the boys been ostrich-like, but, on hearing how it came into existence, Charlie put it a third time to his lips, took a good gulp, and <b>then,</b> <b>nodding</b> {{his head as he}} wiped his mouth with his cuff, declared that it was [...] "wonderful." ...|$|R
6000|$|Haco {{shook his}} head for a moment, <b>then</b> <b>nodded</b> it, and said cheerily, [...] "Well, I hope it may be so for your sake, lass. An' what sort o' {{preparations}} are ye goin' to make?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He looked {{thoughtful}} when Alvarez told him, and <b>then</b> <b>nodded.</b> [...] "All right. You'll {{get some}} of the guns to-morrow and another lot is on the way. Go ahead; I'll help you put the business over." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Stormont {{gave the}} names the {{secretary}} opened the register and <b>then</b> <b>nodded.</b> [...] "If {{all who are}} present and the others Mr. Stormont mentions agree, it would give a larger majority than our constitution requires." ...|$|E
60|$|Bella met {{the steady}} {{look for a}} moment with a wistful, musing little look of her own, and <b>then,</b> <b>nodding</b> her pretty head several times, like a dimpled philosopher (of the very best school) who was moralizing on Life, heaved a little sigh, and gave up things in general for a bad job, as she had {{previously}} been inclined to give up herself.|$|R
60|$|Chalmers glanced towards Mrs. Bollington Smith, {{whose eyes}} were closed. <b>Then</b> he <b>nodded</b> towards the stage.|$|R
50|$|With such {{electronic}} auto-darkening helmets, the welder {{no longer}} has {{to get ready to}} weld and <b>then</b> <b>nod</b> their head to lower the helmet over their face. The advantage is that the welder does not need to adjust the position of welding helmet manually which not only saves time but also reduces the risk of exposure to the harmful light generated by the welding process.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I {{tell you}} {{something}} more?" [...] she said, with a rather fearful smile. [...] "I don't think he did it, and you don't either." [...] Father Brown returned her gaze with a long, grave stare, and <b>then</b> <b>nodded,</b> yet more gravely.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Busier. I'm slack just now. I {{finished}} a large mourning order {{the day before}} yesterday. Doll I work for, lost a canary-bird.' The person of the house gave another little laugh, and <b>then</b> <b>nodded</b> her head several times, as who should moralize, 'Oh this world, this world!' ...|$|E
60|$|Harry, {{sitting in}} his father's chair, read the paper, and ate {{everything}} he could lay his hands on, with a funny assumption of his father's morning manner. Aunt Betsey looked on much amused, and now and <b>then</b> <b>nodded</b> to the children as if she thought things were going nicely.|$|E
60|$|He {{considered}} the suggestion a moment, a deep flush spreading over his face; <b>then</b> he <b>nodded</b> gravely.|$|R
60|$|Alvina told him. He ducked and went. Madame {{listened for}} his final departure. <b>Then</b> she <b>nodded</b> sagely at Alvina.|$|R
60|$|Evan {{gazed at}} the garden wall, gravely {{for more than a}} minute, and <b>then</b> he <b>nodded</b> without a word.|$|R
60|$|The girl's loose bodice {{rose and}} fell as she laid down the rifle, but she was swift, and in less than another minute Muller had bound his captive's hands {{securely}} {{behind his back and}} cross-lashed them from wrist to elbow. He inspected the work critically and <b>then</b> <b>nodded,</b> as if contented.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Quest {{advanced}} and {{knocked at the}} window, which his wife opened. When he saw Edward Cossey he hesitated a little, <b>then</b> <b>nodded</b> to him, while the Colonel came forward, and placing his gun by the wall entered the room, shook hands with Mrs. Quest, and bowed coldly to Edward Cossey.|$|E
60|$|Frona's lips spread apart; {{she tried}} to speak but failed, <b>then</b> <b>nodded</b> her head that she had heard. They swung along in rapid rhythm under the rainbow-wall, {{looking for a place}} where it might be quickly cleared. And down all the length of Split-up Island they raced vainly, the shore {{crashing}} behind them as they fled.|$|E
60|$|The {{physician}} {{approached the}} sleeping girl and gently lifted the lids of her eyes. <b>Then</b> he <b>nodded</b> with satisfaction.|$|R
500|$|... "Today, of course, {{there is}} {{exponentially}} more news coverage {{than there was}} in 1964 — not to mention exponentially more attempts to slot attention-getting events into simple, truthy stories about human nature. The gap between the famous version of the Genovese story and the true one, then, is worth remembering, if only as a check on our natural tendency to hear a story and <b>then</b> <b>nod</b> along and say, 'Of course that’s what happened!'” ...|$|R
60|$|Gabriel {{pointed to}} the statue, on which lay patches of snow. <b>Then</b> he <b>nodded</b> familiarly to it and waved his hand.|$|R
