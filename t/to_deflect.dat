5|$|After the Act of Union of 1707, growing {{prosperity}} in Scotland {{led to a}} spate of new building, both public and private. The threat of Jacobite insurrection or invasion meant that Scotland saw more military building than England in this period. Military structures relied {{on the strength of}} inclined and angled engineered masonry and earthen toppings <b>to</b> <b>deflect</b> and absorb artillery fire. This spate of military building culminated in the construction of Fort George near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts.|$|E
5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, {{the spots}} are {{composed}} of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is <b>to</b> <b>deflect</b> predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of filamentous tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as to the real location of the head, giving them {{a better chance of}} escaping alive and relatively unscathed.|$|E

An {{upper surface}} spoiler that also acts to reduce lift (equivalent <b>to</b> <b>deflecting</b> an aileron upwards), so causing the {{aircraft}} to {{bank in the}} direction of the turn—the angle of roll causes the wing lift to act {{in the direction of}} turn, reducing the amount of drag required to turn the aircraft's longitudinal axis.|$|R
5|$|The Lycaenidae have a {{false head}} {{consisting}} of eyespots and small tails (false antennae) <b>to</b> <b>deflect</b> {{attack from the}} more vital head region. These may also cause ambush predators such as spiders to approach from the wrong end, enabling the butterflies to detect attacks promptly. Many butterflies have eyespots on the wings; these too may deflect attacks, or may serve to attract mates.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} advance {{south by}} the Australians spread them thin on the ground. Due to concerns that their western flank was exposed, the 2/17th Infantry Battalion was sent along the Sattelberg track <b>to</b> <b>deflect</b> any Japanese thrusts from there. At Jivevaneng, the battalion was stopped {{and there the}} Japanese 80th Infantry Regiment launched a series of determined attacks against them, trying to break through to the coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana's realm {{began with the}} capture of his brother Andrianavalonimerina's territory, which he ruled from Ambohitrabiby. The king led his brother {{to believe that they}} were on friendly terms and that they should work together to support one another. When the king launched a surprise attack on Ambohitrabiby, his brother was unprepared <b>to</b> <b>deflect</b> the offensive and Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana successfully seized control of the territory, which he incorporated into his own.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} early morning cage {{orientation}} of nocturnally migrating Swainson's Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) during three fall migration seasons. The results were compared with earlier free-flight release tests under starry skies and {{were found to be}} consistent with continuation of migratory flights in the expected seasonally appropriate direction. Energetic condition proved decisive: fat birds chose directions in accordance with migration across the Gulf of Mexico, whereas lean birds oriented away from the coast, possibly in search of habitats suitable for refuelling. Whereas the orientation of fat Swainson's Thrushes was affected by experimental shifts of the magnetic field, the response during morning tests was larger than expected. A parallel series of orientation cage experiments performed during evening twilight showed a response <b>to</b> <b>deflected</b> magnetic fields that was close to the expected shift, which suggests a difference in integration of directional information between early morning and evening twilight activity. However, within-individual response <b>to</b> <b>deflected</b> magnetic fields was of the same magnitude during both morning and evening tests...|$|R

The Blade of Olympus, a primary weapon in God of War II, is used in this game with the special ability Rage of Sparta for temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} towards {{more effective}} cannons {{was to build}} thicker walls and to prefer round towers, as the curving sides were more likely <b>to</b> <b>deflect</b> a shot than a flat surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures {{had to find a}} way to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled behind a castle's curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.|$|E

5|$|By 1967 {{the debate}} over ABM systems had become a major public policy issue, with almost continual debate on the topic in {{newspapers}} and magazines. It {{was in the midst}} of these debates, on 17 June 1967, that the Chinese tested their first H-bomb in Test No. 6. Suddenly the Nth Country concept was no longer simply theoretical. McNamara seized on this event as a way <b>to</b> <b>deflect</b> criticism over the lack of deployment while still keeping costs under control. On 18 September 1967, he announced that Nike-X would now be known as Sentinel, and outlined deployment plans broadly following the I-67 concept.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 12th century, a range of new keep designs began to appear across France and England, {{breaking}} the previous unity of the regional designs. The use of keeps in castles spread through Iberia, but some new castles never incorporated keeps in their designs. One traditional explanation for these developments emphasises the military utility of the new approaches, arguing, for example, that the curved surfaces of the new keeps helped <b>to</b> <b>deflect</b> attacks, or that they drew on lessons learnt during the Crusades from Islamic practices in the Levant. More recent historical analysis, however, has emphasised the political and social drivers that underlay these mid-medieval changes in keep design.|$|E

40|$|The first {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} a magnetic field around an electric current was observed in 1820 by Hans Christian Oersted (1777 - 1851). He found that a wire carrying current caused a freely pivoted compass needle in its vicinity <b>to</b> be <b>deflected.</b> If the current in a long straight wire is directed from C to D, as shown in Figure 30 - 1, a compass needle below it, whose initial orientation is shown in dotted lines, will have its north pole <b>deflected</b> <b>to</b> the left and its south pole <b>deflected</b> <b>to</b> the right. If the current in the wire is reversed and directed from D to C, then the north pole will be <b>deflected</b> <b>to</b> the right, as seen from above. In terms of the forces acting on the poles, these forces are clearly perpendicular to the direction of the current and to the line from the nearest portion of the wire to the pole itself...|$|R
5|$|Engineers Stimers and Newton {{soon began}} {{repairing}} {{the damage to}} the pilot house and reconfigured the sides from an upright position to a slope of thirty degrees <b>to</b> <b>deflect</b> shot. During this time, Mrs. Worden personally brought news of her husband's progress and recovery and was optimistic, informing the crew his eyesight would soon return but he would be laid up for some time. She also informed them President Lincoln had personally paid Worden a visit extending his gratitude. However Worden was later taken to his summer home in New York and remained unconscious for three months. He returned to Naval service in 1862 as Commander of , another ironclad.|$|E
5|$|Hitler later {{blamed the}} failure of his {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, {{which had to be}} delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece. The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying <b>to</b> <b>deflect</b> blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.|$|E
5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII began {{building}} Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses {{to counter the}} threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort was essentially a firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed <b>to</b> <b>deflect</b> cannonballs.|$|E
