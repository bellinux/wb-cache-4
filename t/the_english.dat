She is perhaps more famous than her father, because at some time between 1013 and 1016 she married Cnut, son of Sweyn Forkbeard, future King of <b>the</b> <b>English.</b> Her son was Harold Harefoot, King of <b>the</b> <b>English.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bolstered by {{the failure}} of <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Short Parliament, the Scottish Parliament {{declared}} itself capable of governing without the king's consent, and in August 1640 the Covenanter army moved into <b>the</b> <b>English</b> county of Northumberland. Following the illness of the earl of Northumberland, who was the king's commander-in-chief, Charles and Strafford went north to command <b>the</b> <b>English</b> forces, despite Strafford being ill himself with a combination of gout and dysentery. The Scottish soldiery, many of whom were veterans of the Thirty Years' War, had far greater morale and training compared to their English counterparts. They met virtually no resistance until reaching Newcastle upon Tyne, where they defeated <b>the</b> <b>English</b> forces at the Battle of Newburn and occupied the city, as well as the neighbouring county of Durham.|$|E

5|$|During the confusion, {{the cavalry}} {{left behind by}} Del Vasto, which {{included}} the Italian and Epirote companies under Appio Conti, Hannibal Gonzaga, George Crescia, the Marquis of Bentivoglio and Nicolo Cefis, reached Zutphen. Count Hannibal Gonzaga and the Albanian captain George Crescia attacked <b>the</b> <b>English</b> on their own, without Del Vasto's orders. Crescia was dismounted and taken prisoner by Lord Willoughby, while Gonzaga, not wearing his close helmet, received a serious slash in the neck and fell from his horse. On <b>the</b> <b>English</b> side, Philip Sidney, governor of Vlissingen, was fatally wounded in a leg in the final charge. The Spanish cavalry then sought protection behind the infantry, which kept <b>the</b> <b>English</b> cavalry at bay. Verdugo, supported by the Albanian captain Nicolao Basta and the Spanish Evangelista de las Cuevas, Commissar General of the cavalry, managed to restore the order in the Spanish ranks. Seeing the good order of Verdugo and Del Vasto's men, <b>the</b> <b>English</b> and Dutch commanders did not renew the action and began to retire back to their camp. A handful of Spanish pikemen, including some low ranking officers, disobeyed their orders and began to pursue <b>the</b> <b>English.</b>|$|E

5|$|Edward {{enjoyed a}} good {{relationship}} with Pope Clement V, despite the King's repeated intervention in the operation of <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed.

5000|$|In a note {{discovered}} {{among his}} papers, J.R.R. Tolkien {{claims to have}} [...] "put it first into Old English".

5|$|English forces laid siege to Loch Leven in 1301, but the {{garrison}} was relieved {{in the same}} year when the siege was broken by Sir John Comyn. King Robert the Bruce (reigned 1306–1329) is known to have visited the castle in 1313 and again in 1323. Following Bruce's death, <b>the</b> <b>English</b> invaded again, and laid siege to Loch Leven Castle in 1335 in support of the pretender Edward Balliol (d. 1364). According to the 14th-century chronicle of John of Fordun, <b>the</b> <b>English</b> attempted to flood the castle by building a dam across the outflow of the loch. The water level rose for a month, until the captain of <b>the</b> <b>English</b> force, Sir John de Stirling, left to attend the festival of Saint Margaret of Scotland. The defenders, under Alan de Vipont, took the opportunity {{to come out of the}} castle at night, and damaged the dam, causing it to collapse and flood <b>the</b> <b>English</b> camp. The story has, however, been doubted by later historians.|$|E

5|$|Following this, Joan {{begins to}} gather troops {{and she takes}} her army to the forests around Orleans. While they camp there, a girl named Isabel comes and begins to {{describe}} the events surrounding siege of the city. Joan sends a messenger to offer <b>the</b> <b>English</b> peace, but <b>the</b> <b>English</b> decline. The French attack <b>the</b> <b>English</b> and, {{as soon as they}} start, a storm starts up and lightning flashes about them. This scares <b>the</b> <b>English</b> and Joan is able to win and enter the city. Soon after, Joan is able to lift the siege. The story continues with various French victories and <b>the</b> <b>English</b> are pushed back from fort after fort. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>English</b> are pushed back to Tourelles. While <b>the</b> <b>English</b> fight their way there, one of the generals, Salisbury, is able to wound Joan. Her companion, Theodore, is able to kill Salisbury in return but he is brought down by the general Talbot. The French soon lay siege to Tourelles and begin a bloody fight to take the fort. During the battle, the French take many captives and the generals wish to execute them. However, Joan intervenes and ensures the safety of the captives' lives.|$|E
5|$|From 1642, Charles {{fought the}} armies of <b>the</b> <b>English</b> and Scottish parliaments in <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Civil War.

Charles refused to accept his captors' demands for a constitutional monarchy, and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the Isle of Wight, Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, {{but by the end}} of 1648 Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army had consolidated its control over England. Charles was tried, convicted, and executed for high treason in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and a republic called the Commonwealth of England was declared. The monarchy was restored to Charles's son, Charles II, in 1660.|$|E
