500|$|Kill the Irishman {{received}} mixed-to-positive {{reviews from}} film critics. Giving the film a positive review, Mike LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, said; [...] "What makes this film special and memorable is {{the character of}} Danny Greene, who is not the usual neighborhood hoodlum you see in movies, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> gets in deep and gradually loses his soul". Marshall Fine, of the Huffington Post, gave the film a mixed review. He criticized it for jumping through different events in a [...] "jerky fashion", but summed up the review by calling it a [...] "movie {{with a lot of}} meat on the bone, even if some of it is tough or stringy. It's not fancy, but it's always tasty".|$|E
500|$|After its release, Born This Way: The Remix {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. It earned an overall score of 57 out of 100, on review aggregator site Metacritic. Jason Lipshultz from Billboard {{commented that the}} album did not re-invent anything new in terms of remix composition, but instead [...] "gives less recognizable artists a platform to tinker with these complex pop schemes." [...] He added that the album is not essential listening for non-Gaga diehards, [...] "but electronica fans who have yet to drink the Mother Monster kool-aid will find plenty of pristinely produced club tracks to groove to. The album is a great avenue for fans to digest new versions of their favorite songs of the year, as well as discover artists {{that are trying to}} command audiences the way Gaga so masterfully does." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "some remixes take considerable liberty, ditching verses or hooks, whatever catches their fancy. So, it’s a remix album not for fairweather travelers but rather the hardcore Little Monsters, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> love every gesture grand or small from Gaga, but it also displays enough imagination to appeal to those listeners who fall into neither camp and are only looking for some darkly elastic dance." [...] Harley Brown of Consequence of Sound website was impressed with the diversity of remixes on the album, prompting him to comment that [...] "just in time for the holiday season, there’s something for everyone on Born This Way: The Remix. And, unlike many remix albums featuring one song reworked again and again, this Remix comprises a diverse tracklist to match the diverse list of remixers." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film largely {{follows the}} novel, {{with a few}} exceptions. The {{character}} of Pellisier, the rival perfumer, never appears in the novel; he is only ever alluded to by Baldini and others. Grenouille himself, although speaking little in the film, speaks much less in the novel. The novel covers at length his solo life in the mountain, and in his cave, which is treated much more briefly in the film, and in the novel he becomes accustomed to living almost in a torpor with no other beings around. After leaving, in the novel he spends considerable time as the guest of [...] Marquis de La Taillade-Espinasse, who wishes to use him to prove pseudoscientific theories about altitude and health; this is cut in the film which describes him travelling directly to Grasse. In Grasse, in the novel, he learns the arts of perfume extraction {{but there is no}} description by Baldini in Paris, of [...] "12 notes" [...] with a [...] "13th note" [...] to command the others, as in the film - in the novel his sole motive is to obtain the scent of a rare kind of person - <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> inspires love.|$|E

60|$|He {{was growing}} angry. But Stephen was from New England, and poor, {{and he thought}} of the size of his purse. A glance at his adversary showed that his blood was up.

6000|$|Her {{attitude}} towards her company was admirable in its simplicity and reserve. It was plain that she respected their personalities and expected {{the same high}} courtesy from them.

The boldest of them did not clap her on the shoulder but once.|$|E

So she saw that he was waiting for a real good chance.|$|E
60|$|There is no {{intention}} of enriching these pages with Miss Lucretia's homilies. Their subject-matter {{may be found in}} the files of the Woman's Hour. She did not always preach, although many people will not believe this statement. Miss Lucretia, too, had a heart, though she kept it hidden away, only to be brought out on occasions when she was sure of its appreciation, and she grew strangely interested in this self-contained girl from Coniston whose mother she had known. Miss Lucretia understood Cynthia, who also was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> kept her heart hidden, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> conceal their troubles and sufferings because they find it difficult to give them out. So Miss Lucretia had Cynthia to take supper with her at least once in the week, and watched her quietly, and let her speak of as much of her life as she chose--which was not much, at first. But Miss Lucretia was content to wait, and guessed at many things which Cynthia did not tell her, and made some personal effort, unknown to Cynthia, to find out other things. It will be said that she had designs on the girl. If so, they were generous designs; and perhaps it was inevitable that Miss Lucretia should recognize in every young woman of spirit and brains a possible recruit for the cause.|$|E
60|$|After this, Virginia even {{strove to}} be kind to him, but it was uphill work. The front door never closed after one of his visits that {{suspicion}} was not left behind. Antipathy would assert itself. Could it be {{that there was a}} motive under all this plotting? He struck her inevitably as <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> would be content to mine underground to attain an end. The worst she could think of him was that he wished to ingratiate himself now, in the hope that, when the war was ended, he might become a partner in Mr. Carvel's business. She had put even this away as unworthy of her.|$|E

60|$|The knowing Pierre {{immediately}} landed {{and took}} to the woods, followed by his squaw laden with their papooses, and a large bundle containing their most precious effects, promising to rejoin the party some distance above St. Charles. There seemed little dependence to be placed upon the promises of a loose adventurer of <b>the</b> <b>kind,</b> <b>who</b> was {{at the very time}} playing an evasive game with his former employers; who had already received two-thirds of his year's pay, and his rifle on his shoulder, his family and worldly fortunes at his heels, and the wild woods before him. There was no alternative, however, and it was hoped his pique against his old employers would render him faithful to his new ones.|$|E
6000|$|To the League belonged most of {{the prosperous}} {{citizens}} of Zenith. They were not all of <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> called themselves [...] "Regular Guys." [...] Besides these hearty fellows, these salesmen of prosperity, there were the aristocrats, that is, {{the men who were}} richer or had been rich for more generations: the presidents of banks and of factories, the land-owners, the corporation lawyers, the fashionable doctors, and the few young-old men who worked not at all but, reluctantly remaining in Zenith, collected luster-ware and first editions as though they were back in Paris. All of them agreed that the working-classes must be kept in their place; and all of them perceived that American Democracy did not imply any equality of wealth, but did demand a wholesome sameness of thought, dress, painting, morals, and vocabulary.|$|E
60|$|I've kept {{a sharp eye}} on {{the young}} women in {{domestic}} service over here, having a fellow-feeling for them, as you can well understand, madam, and since I {{have been in the}} country I've watched the poor folks and seen how they live, and it's just as plain to me as can be that the young women who are maids and waitresses over here are <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> would have tried to be shop-girls and dressmakers and even school-teachers in America, and many of the servants we have would be working in the fields if they lived over here. The fact is, the English people don't go to other countries to get their servants. Their way is like a factory consuming its own smoke. The surplus young women, and there must always be a lot of them, are used up in domestic service.|$|E
