2500|$|Benny {{even had}} a sound-based running gag of his own: his famous {{basement}} vault alarm, allegedly installed by Spike Jones, ringing off with a shattering cacophony of whistles, sirens, bells, and blasts, before ending invariably {{with the sound of}} a foghorn. The alarm rang off even when Benny opened his safe with the correct combination. The vault also featured a guard named Ed (voiced by Joseph Kearns) who had been on post down below before, apparently, the end of the Civil War, the end of the Revolutionary War, the founding of Los Angeles, on Jack's 38th birthday, and even the beginning of humanity. In one appearance, Ed asked Benny, [...] "By the way, Mr. Benny...what's it like on the outside?" [...] Benny responded, [...] "...winter is nearly here, and the leaves are falling." [...] Ed responded, [...] "Hey, that must be exciting," [...] to which Benny replied (in a stunningly risqué joke for the period), [...] "Oh, no—people are wearing clothes now." [...] In one episode of the Benny radio show, Ed the Guard actually agreed when Jack invited him to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>come</b> back to the surface world, only to discover that modern conveniences and transportation, which hadn't been around the last time he'd been to the surface, terrorized and confused him. (Poor Ed thought a crosstown bus was [...] "a red and yellow dragon".) Finally, Ed decides to return to his post fathoms below and stay there. The basement vault gag was also used in the cartoon The Mouse that Jack Built and an episode of The Lucy Show.|$|E
5000|$|Originating {{the role}} in 1980, The Edge of Night's Colin stayed {{for two years}} (eventually marrying her {{on-screen}} love interest Justin Deas). In 1983, Bailey took over the role and admitted Deas didn't agree {{with the idea of}} the character being recast. [...] "Because he and Margaret (Colin), they were not yet together. This was his way of interacting with her at work, he didn’t like the idea that she wasn’t there anymore. I think I handled him the best and that’s why I got the job. Subsequently we became really good friends." [...] In 1989, after six years with the show, Bailey Smith quit the role, admitting she was burned out after her time on As the World Turns. [...] "I wanted {{to spend more time with}} my kids. I felt I had taken Margo to the length I could take her. I needed to do something else. Doug’s feeling was, “Go <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>come</b> back.” I said, “I’d loved to do that, I just need a break.” ...|$|E
