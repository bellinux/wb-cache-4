Two years later, he had a master's degree from the University of Chicago. In 1959 he finished his doctoral degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He retired from Purdue University, was appointed Professor Emeritus, and lived in Canberra, Australia, where he continued <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|England won {{the final}} match by one wicket, but lost the series 2–1. While {{contemporary}} critics did not blame MacLaren, the cricket authorities were less happy. MacLaren {{believed that the}} choices of the selectors had {{made it impossible to}} win, and continued <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> series for many years. He finished the series with 198 runs at 28.28, and ended the season with 1,254 first-class runs at 32.15.|$|E

5|$|The {{first people}} <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> May Revolution were {{participants}} who wrote memoirs, biographies and diaries. However, their works {{were motivated by}} purposes other than historiographic ones, such as to explain {{the reasons for their}} actions, clean their public images, or express their support or rejection of the public figures and ideas of the time. For example, Manuel Moreno wrote the biography of his brother Mariano as propaganda for the revolutions in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself to his sons.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, Vachss worked as an attorney, in New York City, specializing in child abuse cases; {{he also had a}} career as a novelist. The duality of Vachss' work as a lawyer prosecuting and {{defending}} real cases and as a crime fiction author writing about fictional criminals resulted in Vachss being compared to the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. Vachss' eighth novel, Footsteps of the Hawk, in the Burke series featuring a vigilante private investigator of child abuse cases, was released just two months before the publication of Batman: The Ultimate Evil. He had wanted to approach the topic of sex tourism in southeast Asia, but had been unable to find a way for the Burke character to go there; the Batman character offered the chance for him <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> topic.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Reed, who {{was trying}} to get home, was unable to get State Department {{clearance}} for a visa and was detained in Oslo (then called Christiana), Norway, for more than a month. His letters were censored, and Bryant did not hear from him directly until April. On orders from Edgar Sisson of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28. Unable <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E
50|$|During the Soviet-German {{war against}} Nazi Germany and its allies, Gʻafur Gʻulom devoted {{his time and}} efforts <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> war. His poems Sen yetim emassan (You're not an Orphan), Oltin medal (The Golden Medal), Kuzatish (Seeing off), Vaqt (Time), and Sogʻinish (Missing) became highly popular among Uzbeks.|$|R
50|$|Allies was {{a strong}} {{influence}} on his family and after 1883 his daughter Mary was left at home.

He died in London in 1903 and he was buried by his wife who died the year before.|$|R
50|$|In {{her book}} Pablo Picasso, Antonina Vallentin devotes {{a great deal}} of time <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{haunting}} qualities of this painting. She describes her views of the subject as an inmate, who recently attempted suicide and now carries the blank but menacing stare of those unfortunates who found themselves at Saint-Lazare during the early 1900s.|$|R
5|$|Sorkin came up {{with the}} idea <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the {{screenplay}} for The American President. He would work late, with the TV tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter. The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series. Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.|$|E
5|$|White {{said that}} The Troubles in Northern Ireland induced him <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sort of world {{he would like}} to live in, and that he disliked war and militarists. As a youth he wanted to become a doctor, but had to go out to work. Hence he relied on {{epidemics}} and natural disasters to provide the conflicts that stories need to make them interesting. He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often did more good than doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired The Genocidal Healer.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's writing {{technique}} was unpretentious {{with a natural}} element of humour about it. It focused on ordinary people, reminding the reader of next-door neighbours, cousins and the like, thereby providing a greater ability {{to relate to the}} topic. Unlike his national contemporaries, he was able <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> intricacies of Indian society without having to modify his characteristic simplicity to conform to trends and fashions in fiction writing. He also employed the use of nuanced dialogic prose with gentle Tamil overtones based on the nature of his characters. Critics have considered Narayan to be the Indian Chekhov, due to the similarities in their writings, the simplicity and the gentle beauty and humour in tragic situations. Greene considered Narayan to be more similar to Chekhov than any Indian writer. Anthony West of The New Yorker considered Narayan's writings to be of the realism variety of Nikolai Gogol.|$|E

50|$|Trenker {{was accused}} of fascist opportunism after the war, but the charges were {{eventually}} dropped.

After Rakim {{eventually}} left Aftermath Entertainment, {{he stated that}} the reason he departed the label was because of creative differences with Dr. Dre.

25|$|Keillor has {{attributed}} {{the idea for}} the live Saturday night radio program to his 1973 assignment <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Grand Ole Opry for The New Yorker, but he had already begun showcasing local musicians on the morning show, despite limited studio space.
