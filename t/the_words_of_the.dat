5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was filmed and {{released}} in 2000. Filmed inside a nightclub, the video begins with Durand entering the stage while simultaneous images of the band using instruments appear. Durand then {{stands in front of}} a microphone, preparing for an upcoming verse. Various shots of an audience, background dancers and singers, and trumpet performers are also shown. After the second chorus, the clip focuses on Durand, who is now mouthing some of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song; the final chorus resumes the simultaneous images setup.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} Meine Seel erhebt den Herren for the Feast of the Visitation (2July), which commemorates Mary's {{visit to}} Elizabeth as narrated in the Gospel of Luke, 1st chapter, verses 39 to 56. In that narrative <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magnificat, , are spoken by Mary. Traditionally, Luther's {{translation of the}} biblical text is sung to a German variant of the tonus peregrinus or ninth psalm tone, concluding with a doxology, translated from the Gloria Patri, on the same tune. Bach based his BWV10 cantata on Luther's German Magnificat and its traditional setting, working text and melody into the composition {{as he had done}} with Lutheran hymns in other chorale cantatas.|$|E

5|$|In a 2009 poll {{conducted}} by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and publicized just two days before Russia's flag day (22 August), 56% of respondents stated that they felt proud when hearing the national anthem. However, only 39% could recall <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first line of the anthem. This was an increase from 33% in 2007. According to the survey, between 34 and 36% could not identify the anthem's first line. Overall, only 25% {{of respondents said they}} liked the anthem.|$|E
5|$|In the Gospel of Luke <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magnificat are {{spoken by}} Mary when she visits her cousin Elizabeth, both being pregnant, Mary with Jesus and Elisabeth with John the Baptist. In Christianity, the feast commemorating that visit is called Visitation. It is a chosen {{opportunity}} {{to give more}} than ordinary attention to the Magnificat canticle in liturgy, while the feast celebrates the event tied to its origin.|$|E

5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Leonidas' {{actions have}} been the subject of much discussion. It is {{commonly}} stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated. It is also possible that, recalling <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a fight to the death.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams wrote four concertos: for violin (1925), piano (1926), oboe (1944) and tuba (1954); another concertante {{piece is}} his Romance for harmonica, strings and piano (1951). None {{of these works}} has rivalled the {{popularity}} of the symphonies or the short orchestral works mentioned above. Bartók was among the admirers of the Piano Concerto, written for and championed by Harriet Cohen, but it has remained, in <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> critic Andrew Achenbach, a neglected masterpiece.|$|E

5|$|Husayn, however, who {{had been}} {{entrusted}} with the fortress of Ardumusht on the left bank of the Tigris, chose to surrender it instead, and offered his services to the Caliph. He managed to capture the Kharijite leader Harun al-Shari, thereby bringing {{an end to the}} Kharijite revolt in the Jazira. In exchange he secured not only a pardon for his father, but also the lifting of a tribute that the Taghlib had been forced to pay, and the right to form a regiment of 500 Taghlibi cavalry at government expense. This was a major success, laying the groundwork for his own and his family's ascent to power. In <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy, to the caliph he offered a group of experienced warriors under his own skilled and loyal leadership; to the Taghlib, and other people in the Jazira, he offered the prospect of salaries and booty; and to his own family military command and the opportunity of acquiring wealth in government services. It was in fact not as an independent tribal leader, but rather as an intermediary between government and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira that al-Husayn made the family fortune.|$|E

5|$|While Zwingli {{carried on}} the {{political}} work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist originated when Andreas Karlstadt, Luther's former colleague from Wittenberg, published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a real presence in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including de Eucharistia (On the Eucharist). He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word is in <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institution—"This is my body, this is my blood"—means signifies. Hence, the words are understood as a metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the eucharist. In effect, the meal was symbolic of the Last Supper.|$|E
