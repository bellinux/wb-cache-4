5|$|A double LP that {{featured}} the album {{on three sides}} of <b>the</b> <b>vinyl</b> at 180-gram quality and an etching on the fourth side. This release also came with a code to allow purchasers to download the entire album in MP3 format. Due to manufacturing delays, this release came out {{more than two months}} after the previous versions, on May 8, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Like a Virgin & Other Big Hits! {{also made}} {{appearance}} on <b>the</b> <b>Vinyl</b> Albums and Top Current Albums charts, where it charted at numbers five and ninety-eight, respectively. The following week Like a Virgin, {{which had already}} topped the Billboard 200 for three weeks in 1985, was discounted for 99 cents {{to coincide with the}} release. This prompted the album to re-enter the Billboard 200 chart at position 124, bringing a total of 109 weeks on the chart.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Vinyl</b> Conflict is a box {{set by the}} thrash metal band Slayer, {{released}} October 12, 2010. It {{includes all}} ten of Slayer's studio albums since 1986 and their 1991 live album Decade of Aggression. The idea of releasing a second box set was made public in August 2010. It was first released with a price of $199.99. The albums are all in vinyl and are remastered. It received generally positive reception from critics.|$|E
5|$|The shred {{music of}} the 1980s was a major {{influence}} on the progressive rock groups of the 1990s. Some of the newer bands, such as the Flower Kings, Spock's Beard and Glass Hammer, played a 1970s-style symphonic prog but with an updated sound. A number of them began to explore the limits of the CD in the way that earlier groups had stretched the limits of <b>the</b> <b>vinyl</b> LP.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack was {{released}} digitally {{and in two}} physical formats: a two-disc CD edition and a vinyl record edition, the latter of which was limited to 2000units. <b>The</b> <b>vinyl</b> edition contains 16tracks on two sides and comes with a code to download {{the rest of the}} Anniversary soundtrack digitally. The compact disc edition contains thirty-nine tracks and {{was released}} on November 15, 2011.|$|E
50|$|Additional, some of {{the songs}} were {{released}} on <b>vinyls.</b> <b>The</b> <b>vinyls</b> include some songs, which were previously unreleased or exclusive to this album.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>vinyl</b> {{release of}} <b>the</b> album contained a 24-page booklet featuring transcriptions of 22 Gil Scott-Heron compositions. The CD release {{also features a}} different cover than <b>the</b> original <b>vinyl</b> release.|$|R
5|$|A new {{special edition}} was {{released}} in December 2014, commemorating the 20th anniversary of the album. This edition includes <b>the</b> <b>vinyl</b> edition of the full album, plus a three-CD set, the first CD with the full album remastered for the special release, the second with the US mix remastered and the third including a performance at the Astoria in 1994 and an acoustic session for Radio 4 Mastertapes in 2014. The special edition also contains a 40-page book full of rare photos and handwritten lyrics and notes by Richey and by the band.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within <b>the</b> <b>vinyl</b> versions of the album.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule {{must be in the}} s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing <b>the</b> <b>vinyl</b> groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E
50|$|Units 333002 and 333004 {{received}} the new livery by September 2008, but the finish of <b>the</b> <b>vinyls</b> was unsatisfactory. New vinyls were acquired {{and the whole}} fleet was reliveried by mid 2009.|$|R
50|$|The CD {{packaging}} replicates <b>the</b> original <b>vinyl</b> releases with <b>the</b> original <b>vinyl</b> inner sleeves {{serving as}} inserts for the CD slipcases. The packaging is completely replicated from <b>the</b> original <b>vinyl</b> releases, with <b>the</b> exception of Heartbeat City, {{which is now}} released with white color borders instead of the original maroon, this change in color is what the band originally intended for the initial release.|$|R
5000|$|The {{version of}} [...] "A House Is Not A Motel" [...] which appears on CD reissues {{of the album}} is {{slightly}} different from that on <b>the</b> original <b>vinyl</b> release. On <b>the</b> original <b>vinyl</b> <b>the</b> track ends abruptly, with an effect like the needle being lifted from the record. On the CD the track fades away a more conventional way.|$|R
5|$|Only {{three people}} were {{involved}} in the production of Daicon III, Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga and Takami Akai. Takeda, who {{was a part of the}} group, explains in Notenki Memoirs that Anno knew how to make anime, but he never worked with animation cels. They were referred to Animepolis Pero, an anime hobby store chain, but they found that the cost of the cels were too expensive, so a single cel was purchased and taken to a vinyl manufacturer in east Osaka, where they purchased a roll for 2000 yen. After cutting and preparing <b>the</b> <b>vinyl</b> cels, they discovered that the painted cels would stick together when stacked and dry paint would peel off the cels. To keep costs low, they made their own tap to punch holes in the B5 animation paper used in the production.|$|E
5|$|Reborning {{involves}} numerous {{time consuming}} steps. The most basic {{form of the}} process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers of paint, and adding other physical features to the doll. Artists can pick different brands to best suit the doll they wish to create. Reborn artists can also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes <b>the</b> <b>vinyl</b> doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase {{a wide range of}} supplies for creating their own reborn. Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit some steps in the fabrication process and begin with a blank canvas. Many supplies are needed for both external and internal modifications of reborns to make the doll seem more realistic.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the album}} debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 84,000 album-equivalent {{units in the}} week ending March 24, {{according}} to Nielsen Music. In addition, This Is What the Truth Feels Like was also the best-selling album of the week, ranking number 1 on Billboards Top Album Sales chart, with pure album sales of 76,000 copies (90% of overall units). It became Stefani's first number 1 and third top five album as a solo artist. The only time she previously reached the top was with her band No Doubt with their third record Tragic Kingdom (1995). With this feat, she became the fifth woman to first reach number 1 {{as part of a}} band or group, and then later earn their own solo leader. However, it also marked the lowest first week sales for one of her albums, with Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and The Sweet Escape selling 309,000 copies and 243,000 copies in their first weeks, respectively. With the release Stefani peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Artist 100 chart, up approximately 557% from her previous peak of 53, the chart's fourth-highest jump ever. The following week, Billboard reported that the album dropped 16 places on the Billboard 200, with sales decreasing 78% to 17,700 copies. For the next five weeks, the album continued to drop down the charts. In its seventh week, it jumped from number 82 to number 59, the same week she appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden. The record was on the chart for 13 weeks; its final position for the week ending August 6, 2016, was number 114. On May 27, 2016, This Is What the Truth Feels Like was made available on vinyl exclusively at Barnes & Noble in the United States; after its release, it debuted and peaked at number 23 on <b>the</b> <b>Vinyl</b> Albums component chart.|$|E

50|$|The first {{pressing}} of the EP {{consisted of}} 500 red vinyl records and 1,000 black <b>vinyl.</b> <b>The</b> entire red <b>vinyl</b> pressing, and <b>the</b> first 500 copies of <b>the</b> black <b>vinyl</b> version, featured a label that adapted some of Allins line drawings and envelope art, {{as well as}} a hand-drawn version of the Mountain Records logo. The remaining 500 copies were pressed using a standard Mountain Records label. All but 25 copies of <b>the</b> red <b>vinyl</b> and 25 of <b>the</b> black <b>vinyl</b> were sold by December 1990, a sales figure that both amazed Allin (since he didnt think his fans would accept such a musical left turn from him) and made him very pleased, given his pride in how the recordings came out.|$|R

On <b>the</b> original <b>vinyl</b> recording, Ranaldo created a few of the tracks directly in the mastering studio where the cutting of <b>the</b> original <b>vinyl</b> version took place. In addition to the locked grooves, the LP was mastered at 45 RPM (although <b>the</b> <b>vinyl's</b> record label also gave a [...] "varispeed" [...] designation, suggesting that the record could be enjoyed at any speed) and also contained on the album's second side an engraving of the serpent designed by Savage Pencil, which was given its own track number, title, and facetious [...] "infinity" [...] track length.|$|R
