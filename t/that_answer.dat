25|$|We {{abuse the}} Holocaust {{when it becomes}} a cudgel against others who have their claims of suffering. The Shoah must not be misused in the contest of one-downsmanship with other victims of brutality....The Shoah has become our instant raison d'etre, the {{short-cut}} answer to the penetrating questions of our children: 'Why should I not marry out of the faith? Why should I join a synagogue? Why should I support Israel? Why should I be Jewish?' We have relied on a singular imperative: 'Thou shalt not give Hitler a posthumous victory.' <b>That</b> <b>answer</b> will not work. To live in spite, to say 'no' to Hitler {{is a far cry}} from living 'yes' to Judaism.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the product}} {{development}} (i.e., architectural artifact) in each cell or the problem solution embodied by the cell {{is the answer}} to a question from a perspective, typically, the models or descriptions are higher-level depictions or the surface answers of the cell. The refined models or designs supporting <b>that</b> <b>answer</b> are the detailed descriptions within the cell. Decomposition (i.e., drill down to greater levels of detail) takes place within each cell. If a cell is not made explicit (defined), it is implicit (undefined). If it is implicit, the risk of making assumptions about these cells exists. If the assumptions are valid, then time and money are saved. If, however, the assumptions are invalid, it is likely to increase costs and exceed the schedule for implementation.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to Ingrid; {{the spell}} of {{shattered}} sight is finally broken, the shards turn into snow and Storybrooke returns to normal, including Regina and Mary Margaret, who immediately stop fighting and start laughing. Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma to hug her, while Henry runs to Regina and hugs both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the pawnshop and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to <b>that</b> <b>answer</b> by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen’s plan failed, he tells Hook it’s his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma {{and the rest of}} Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't get in his way, she’ll survive. He says once he steps over the line with his magic, they have nothing to fear from him – but says he can’t make that promise {{for the rest of the}} world. Confident that he will go through with his plans, a smug but sinister Gold leaves the pawnshop to walk out into the fresh Storybrooke snowy air.|$|E

500|$|Rumors of Stroud's {{homosexuality}} {{were noted}} at Alcatraz. According to Donald Hurley, {{whose father was}} a guard at Alcatraz, [...] "Whenever Stroud was around anyone, which was seldom, he was watched very closely, as prison officials were very aware of his overt homosexual tendencies." [...] In an interview with Hurley for his book, a former inmate heard Stroud was always in 'dog block' (solitary confinement) or later in the hospital {{because he was a}} 'wolf' (aggressive homosexual) who had a bad temper." [...] In February 1963 Stroud met and talked with actor Burt Lancaster, who portrayed him in The Birdman of Alcatraz. Stroud never got to see the film or read the book it was based on but did share on {{one of the problems that}} prevented parole, that he was an [...] "admitted homosexual."

500|$|Carey {{was unable}} to film an {{accompanying}} music video for the single; {{at the time of}} its release, she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001, and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter. She said, [...] "When I was asked about the video I said, 'I can't do it today'. And nobody could accept <b>that</b> <b>answer.</b> And that's when I started to get mad. I was, like, look, I am too fatigued. I'm overly-tired, I can't do it as a human being. And nobody was hearing those last two words — human being. They were used to the Mariah that always says, 'Come on, let's fight, let's go'. They just weren't used to me ever saying no. I never said no before". Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.|$|E
500|$|Initial reviews were mixed, {{with some}} critics applauding the story's conclusion, and others deriding it. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, opined that the episode worked best [...] "if some of the {{previous}} Samantha-related clues were forgotten", such as when the Alien Bounty Hunter told Mulder {{that she was still}} alive in [...] "End Game". Despite this, he wrote that [...] "it was only right that Samantha be dead since Mulder's life had always been defined by what he has lost, not what he has found". He surmised that the episode was not [...] "perfect", but that its [...] "plusses greatly outweighed any missteps along the way". He was also complimentary towards [...] "the ethereal quality of the final few moments", writing that they [...] "lifted this episode up and made it one of the season's most memorable". Kenneth Silber from Space.com was pleased with the episode, and wrote, [...] "'Closure' is a satisfying episode, one that puts to bed the now-tiresome search for Mulder's sister Samantha." [...] Jeremy Conrad from IGN referred to the episode as [...] "excellent" [...] and noted that a large portion of The X-Files mythology ended with the resolution of Samantha's abduction, saying, [...] " [...] a final, and concrete, answer to the single thing that was driving Mulder for the entire run of the series. In some ways, when he got <b>that</b> <b>answer</b> a major part of The X-Files story ended." ...|$|E

500|$|Many scholars, {{including}} Lonsdale, {{believe that}} the poem's message is too universal to require a specific event or place for inspiration, but Gray's letters suggest that there were historical influences in its composition. In particular, {{it is possible that}} Gray was interested in debates over the treatment of the poor, and that he supported the political structure of his day, which was to support the poor who worked but look down on those that refused to. However, Gray's message is incomplete, because he ignored the poor's past rebellions and struggles. The poem ignores politics to focus on various comparisons between a rural and urban life in a psychological manner. The argument between living a rural life or urban life lets Gray discuss questions <b>that</b> <b>answer</b> how he should live his own life, but the conclusion of the poem does not resolve the debate as the narrator is able to recreate himself in a manner that reconciles both types of life while arguing that poetry is capable of preserving those who have died. It is probable that Gray wanted to promote the hard work of the poor but to do nothing to change their social position. Instead of making claims of economic injustice, Gray accommodates differing political views. This is furthered by the ambiguity in many of the poem's lines, including the statement [...] "Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood" [...] that could be read either as Oliver Cromwell being guiltless for violence during the English Civil War or merely as villagers being compared to the guilty Cromwell. The poem's primary message is to promote the idea of [...] "Englishness", and the pastoral English countryside. The earlier version lacks many of the later version's English aspects, especially as Gray replaced many classical figures with English ones: Cato the Younger by Hampden, Tully by Milton, and Julius Caesar by Cromwell.|$|E
500|$|Derrickson and Marvel had {{originally}} discussed him writing the film alongside his Sinister co-writer C. Robert Cargill, with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel {{felt that they}} would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer, with Jon Spaihts hired to rewrite the script instead. Spaihts, a big fan of Doctor Strange as a child, had started [...] "pestering" [...] Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked [...] "all afternoon, and the fit was right", but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not [...] "take <b>that</b> <b>answer.</b> Call them back, tell them there’s a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room", and after talking with Marvel for [...] "another three or four hours" [...] he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film. Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a [...] "fully-formed" [...] sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that [...] "the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and tell our best version of it." [...] Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as [...] "little things" [...] from Spaihts, [...] "like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple." [...] Derrickson wanted Nightmare to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of [...] "nightmares themselves as being a dimension", but Feige felt [...] "getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension" [...] would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces. Dormammu, [...] "the most present villain in the comics", became the film's main villain.|$|E
