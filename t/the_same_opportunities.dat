25|$|The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), {{adopted in}} 1979 by the UN General Assembly and acceded to by 180 States, sets down rights for women, of freedom from {{discrimination}} and equality under the law. CEDAW has realized {{the rights and}} equality of woman is also {{the key to the}} survival and development of children and to building healthy families, communities and nations. Article 10 pinpoints nine changes that must be changed in order to help Nigerian women and other women suffering from gender disparity. It first states, their must be the same conditions for careers, vocational guidance, and for the achievement of diplomas in educational establishments of all categories in rural as well as in urban areas. This equality shall be ensured in pre-school, general, technical, professional and higher technical education, as well as in all types of vocational training. Second, is access to the same curricula, the same examinations, teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard and school premises and equipment of the same quality. Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education. This is encouraged by coeducation and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programs and the adaptation of teaching methods. Fourth, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>opportunities</b> to benefit from scholarships and other study grants. Similarly, fifth is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>opportunities</b> of access to programs of continuing education, including adult and functional literacy programs, particularly those aimed at reducing, at the earliest possible time, any gap in education existing between men and women. Sixth, is the reduction of female student drop-out rates and the organization of programs for girls and women who have left school prematurely. Seventh concern listed is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>opportunities</b> to participate actively in sports and physical education. Lastly, is access to specific educational information to help to ensure {{the health and well-being of}} families, including information and advice on family planning.|$|E

25|$|Smith figured {{prominently}} {{in the establishment of}} the Mormon doctrine of the redemption of the dead and the later establishment of the practice of baptism for the dead. On January 21, 1836, after the completion of the Kirtland Temple, Joseph Smith claimed to have had a vision of the celestial kingdom. Smith stated that he saw his brother Alvin in this vision, and was surprised at his presence since he had died before the establishment of the church and its associated doctrines. Joseph Smith stated that he then received a revelation concerning the salvation of those who die without hearing the gospel and their ability to receive <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>opportunities</b> as those who had the opportunity to hear it on earth.|$|E
25|$|Described {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{attractive}} educational opportunities ever offered, the Holloway Plan broke the Naval Academy's monopoly as a source for naval officers by offering students at fifty-two colleges and universities <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>opportunities</b> for a commission in the regular Navy and free education at government expense that were provided to Naval Academy midshipmen, without requiring a hard-to-obtain Congressional appointment. In return for a three-year service commitment, the federal government paid for officer candidates to obtain undergraduate degrees at accredited institutions, commissioning them upon graduation into the Naval Reserve. Unlike previous reservists, NROTC graduates could transfer their commissions into the regular Navy, allowing them to compete on the same basis as Naval Academy graduates. NROTC was intended to provide about half of the Navy's new officers every year, with the other half coming from the Naval Academy. There were two main tracks: the standard four-year course for line officers, and a seven-year Naval Aviation College Program (NACP) for naval aviators.|$|E

He was dux of the school in 1880. At Scotch College McCay first met John Monash, who would be dux the following year, and would later become a close friend. McCay entered Ormond College at the University of Melbourne in 1881, the year that the college first opened, and commenced studying for his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. McCay left the university without completing his degree in 1883 and {{took a job as a}} teacher at Toorak Grammar School. In 1885, he bought Castlemaine Grammar School. The school was co-educational; McCay believed that girls should have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>opportunities</b> as boys. Among its students who attended university with McCay's encouragement and support was Sussanah Jane Williams, who later became principal of Janet Clarke Hall at the University of Melbourne, and The Women's College at the University of Sydney.

In the United States in 1995, the Glass Ceiling Commission, a government-funded group, stated: [...] "Over half of all Master's degrees are now awarded to women, yet 95% of senior-level managers, of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies are men.

They outnumbered men in such occupations as public relations managers, financial managers, and human resource managers.|$|E
2500|$|Arguing {{on behalf}} of the United States in support of the respondents, Elliot Schulder focused largely on matters of {{statutory}} interpretation rather than specific outcomes for Amy. When pressed by the justices regarding the educational standards required, he contended that the district court opinion went too far: [...] "the emphasis is not on potential or shortfall from potential, but on the making available to handicapped children <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>opportunities</b> that are available to non-handicapped children to benefit from the regular educational program that the state or local school authorities provide." [...] The justices brought up an issue Kuntz, for the petitioner, touched on: [...] "what's this court supposed to do? Independently make its own judgment or ... all I'm allowed to do is to decide whether the school acted arbitrarily?" [...] Essentially, should the court rule on whether aspects of the individual education program allow a handicapped child to reach their full potential or is the approval of an individual education program sufficient to satisfy the act. Schulder argues a middle ground: [...] "We don't think the court has to measure potential, but we do believe that the court has to make an independent determination whether, in this particular case, for example, the plan as developed provides the child in question access to the same educational opportunity available to non-handicapped children." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic bishops {{issued on}} 25 May 2014, the 23rd {{anniversary of the}} {{independence}} of the state, a pastoral letter that some saw as critical of the Government. An English translation of the document, the original of which is in the Tigrinya language, extends to 17 pages. The bishops spoke of the emigration of the many young Eritreans who risk their lives in the hope of emigrating to other countries. They repeated what they had written in 2001: [...] "o-one leaves a land of milk and honey to seek another country offering <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>opportunities.</b> If one's homeland is a place of peace, jobs and freedom of expression {{there is no reason to}} leave it to suffer hardship, loneliness and exile in an effort to look for opportunity elsewhere." [...] They spoke also of [...] "the delusion engendered as result of the non-achievement of the ends proposed, the uselessness of one’s own aspirations, looking to distant lands as the only alternative for self-fulfilment, are bringing a growing number of people to frustration and desperation. They find themselves looking at a horizon that grows always darker and heavier. Alongside this, the breakup of the family unit inside the country – through military service unlimited in terms of time and monetary reward and through the imprisonment of many young people in actual prison or in punishment camps – is exposing to misery not only elderly parents with no visible means of support, but also entire families and it is having serious consequences at the economic level as well as at the psychological and mental levels." ...|$|E
