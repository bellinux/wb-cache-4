50|$|In 1899 {{shortly after}} being elected mayor, Enright {{replaced}} the 1881 two-storey <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> {{with a new}} two-storeyed brick building. W. G Smith and sons Architects produced plans for the new hotel. Smith and Hansen were contracted as the builders.|$|E
50|$|He {{was educated}} at Christ's Hospital and Keble College, Oxford. He was Fellow and Tutor in Ancient History at Balliol College, Oxford, from 1939 to 1970. During World War II {{he worked at}} the Ministry of Supply in the <b>timber</b> <b>section.</b> Meiggs served as Prefect of the College from 1945 until 1969. His {{eccentricity}} was legendary. His papers are in the Balliol College library.|$|E
30|$|Full-scale fire {{testing for}} {{post-tensioned}} timber frame assemblies has primarily been performed in New Zealand, with summaries provided by Spellman (Spellman 2012) (Spellman, Carradine, Abu, Moss, & Buchanan, 2012). These assemblies consist of large <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> with embedded steel tendons that provide increased structural strength. While the <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> provide inherent fire resistance {{due to their}} depth, {{it is important that}} sufficient protection be provided to post-tensioned connection elements to maintain stability in fire.|$|R
50|$|Prefabrication {{has been}} used since ancient times. For example, it is claimed that the world's oldest known {{engineered}} roadway, the Sweet Track constructed in England around 3800 BC, employed prefabricated <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> brought to the site rather than assembled on-site.|$|R
30|$|Given the {{strength}} loss at elevated temperature in steel, protecting steel connections in timber {{is critically important}} to maintaining stability in fire conditions. This can be achieved using gypsum board or other passive fire protection means, including embedding connections in <b>timber</b> <b>sections,</b> or providing proprietary products (Ostman 2010) (Frangi 2012).|$|R
5000|$|The guns {{remained}} in place through the First World War, when the Grain Tower found an additional purpose as {{one end of}} a boom defence stretching across the Medway to Sheerness. The massive iron chain from the boom is still present, wrapped {{around the base of the}} tower. A fixed <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> of the boom stood between the tower and the shoreline. The tower was disarmed in 1929.|$|E
50|$|Following Tyack's death, {{the hotel}} {{was placed in the}} hands of Queensland Trustees Ltd, who {{transferred}} the various properties to Queen's Hotel Townsville Ltd in 1924-25. At the same time, Queen's Hotel Townsville Ltd acquired three adjoining allotments along the Strand, which permitted the construction of a further 10 bays of the hotel toward the east. The remaining <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> of {{the hotel was}} demolished, and the western tower and Wickham Street wing were completed.|$|E
50|$|The {{dining room}} forms the north-west {{corner of the}} building. Behind it is the western wing {{containing}} the kitchen and a timber bedroom section. The kitchen is in the 1860s building, although this is probably not the original kitchen {{as there is no}} evidence of a chimney. The gabled <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> of the wing probably dates from the conversion to institutional use and contains 7 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Internally the walls are tongue and groove and the casement windows have diamond patterned glazing bars. A besser block laundry is at the end of this wing.|$|E
5000|$|Remnant Kings: The large <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> {{made from}} local ash timber are cradled in a steel cog. This {{structure}} suggests movement, throwing the timber forward and releasing the stones within its folds, like seeds bringing new growth. [...] "Remnant Kings stands proud {{on the hillside}} watching over its kingdom waiting for its chance to scatter".|$|R
50|$|Through {{ties are}} put through {{structure}} openings such as windows. A vertical inside tube crossing the opening {{is attached to}} the scaffold by a transom and a crossing horizontal tube on the outside called a bridle tube. The gaps between the tubes and the structure surfaces are packed or wedged with <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> to ensure a solid fit.|$|R
30|$|Multiple {{references}} {{provide a}} summary of fire test data for engineered timber products exposed to fire. Hopkin provides a comprehensive literature review of fire testing in heavy timber assemblies (Hopkin, 2011). The American Wood Council (AWC) presents design calculation methods of fire resistance of heavy <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> compared to experimental test results (AWC 2003). Generally, results compare favorably with design equations.|$|R
50|$|In the 1860s and 1870s the {{district}} between Enoggera Creek and Kedron Brook was occupied principally by farmers, tanneries along Kedron Brook, {{and middle class}} commuter families residing in semi-rural hilltop retreats - such as Daniel Rowntree Somerset's Rosemount (established in the late 1850s), and Justice Cockle's Oakwal (erected 1864-65). These estates were virtually self-supporting, with vegetable gardens, orchards, domestic livestock and dairies. On some properties, crops were cultivated also. Wilston, established in the mid-1870s {{at the pinnacle of}} William Wilson's career (during his period {{as a member of the}} Queensland Legislative Council), belonged to this tradition.In July 1876, James Cowlishaw called tenders for a villa residence at Enoggera for William Wilson, which is understood to refer to Wilston House. Early photographs (circa late 1870s) show a core in face brickwork, with verandahs on three sides (to the west, south and east), a rendered masonry portico to the southern front entrance, a <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> along the north (rear) side of the house with a bay window at the eastern end, and an attached timber kitchen wing at the rear of the main building. The <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> of the house is understood to have contained one large room at the eastern end, divided by two sets of cedar doors from two smaller rooms, possibly guest bedrooms, at the western end. The cedar doors could be opened out to create a ballroom. Whether this wing was part of the original design, or a slightly later addition, is not clear. The portico to the front entrance may be a later addition, as the roof slates continue behind the portico roof structure. Slightly later photographs, thought to have been taken during the Wilsons' residence and therefore prior to 1885, reveal that the core had been rendered and bay windows to the two front rooms (at the southeast and southwest corners of the house) had been added. These matched in design the bay window of the earlier <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> on the north side of the house. By this period, three terraces on the southern (front) side of the house had been established, with concreted steps leading to each. It is understood that the lower terrace contained a croquet or tennis lawn, on which a portable dance floor and marquee could be erected when the Wilsons entertained.|$|E
50|$|David McConnel {{returned}} to England with his seriously ill wife in 1854 {{and they did}} not return to Cressbrook until 1862, when the partnership between David and John McConnel was dissolved with John McConnel taking exclusive rights at Durundur and David maintaining the ownership of Cressbrook. Upon David and Mary's return to Cressbrook extensive alterations were made to the slab hut, which was from an early date known as the House, to distinguish it from the Cottage which was built nearby. This addition to the House comprised the construction of a <b>timber</b> <b>section,</b> two storeyed in part and generally larger in scale than the wing to which it was abutted. A kitchen wing, another timber slab building, was added to the south of the House.|$|E
50|$|This {{interpretation}} {{rested on}} the occupation of the property by Dr Stephen Simpson {{and so it was}} decided to demolish the <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> at the rear, which was clearly of a later period. When acquired by the Trust, the house was in poor condition. Along with urgent repairs, extensive reconstruction was also carried out. While reflecting the philosophies of the early 1960s, this approach is not acceptable today. Current conservation philosophy, in line with the recommendations of the Burra Charter, favours minimal intervention and interpretation embraces the whole life of the house and its setting. Wolston House has now been owned by the Trust for over thirty years, and is still open to the public as a museum, so that the effects of changes in conservation philosophies and methods over this period can be studied.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is timber-framed, clad predominantly with corrugated iron, with a curved light steel bow string truss roof. The structure is clad to the north-east with timber battens above window sill level and corrugated iron below. The building has timber casement windows {{in groups of}} three. The floor comprises both concrete and <b>timber</b> <b>sections.</b> Timber-framed infills join the building to the former carriage shop.|$|R
50|$|The {{dilapidated}} <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> of the Kirks Bridge, crossing Baerami Creek at Baerami were demolished {{and were}} {{planned to be}} replaced with new concrete sections by 31 August 2007. Unfortunately, flooding during the June 2007 Hunter Region and Central Coast storms delayed the work by around a month. The bridge had previously been partially rebuilt, with both buttresses and two spans at one end having been reconstructed in concrete.|$|R
40|$|The {{simplest}} {{definition of}} built up timber is {{the formation of}} structural members by connecting smaller dimension timber by nailing or gluing. Built up <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> are used as columns, beams and slabs. The commonly used built up timber members are, a) Beams: Glued laminated beams, spaced beam, ply web beams b) Columns: Layered column, spaced column, braced column, box column c) Slabs: Stressed skin panel, laminated veneer lumber, plywood d) Timber Trusse...|$|R
50|$|Barunah Plains {{homestead}} is a large, {{single storey}} bluestone residence, comprising two main sections forming a U-shape around the rear courtyard, infilled in the 1900s to the 1910s. The eastern {{section of the}} building was built in 1866 to Davidson and Henderson's design. This eastern section is asymmetrically composed with a cast iron verandah at the north-east corner. The present front door faces east and is beside a projecting bay window and sheltered by a stone porch; this section may well be an addition. The north side elevation has a projecting bay windowed room with a higher roof crowned by cast iron cresting. Further west is the 1900s to the 1910s wing, comprising principal bedrooms and intact bathrooms. On {{the western side of}} the old courtyard is a bluestone section reputed to be the oldest part and a <b>timber</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
50|$|After World War II {{the former}} {{magazine}} was extended, possibly in 1948, {{the year of}} the dedication of the World War II Honour Board. The extension involved knocking down the east wall of the magazine, and adding a <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> on stumps, with the front door being reused in the north elevation of the extension. A narrow timber dining room was also added along the north elevation of the brick magazine, so that from the road the original brick structure is not visible. However the 1887 brick magazine building is still intact, complete with its original six narrow windows and their timber shutters. A timber coved ceiling, probably original, still exists in the old magazine section, along with a decorative ventilation grille, although a new ceiling extends partway into the old magazine section from the 1940s timber extension. During the 1950s the old floor and its square copper nails was replaced.|$|E
50|$|In 1899 the {{property}} and license were purchased by John Henry Tyack. He raised a £14,000 mortgage on {{the property}}, and called for competitive designs to replace the timber building with a substantial brick structure. The winning entry was submitted by architects Eaton, Bates & Polin, who had opened an office in Townsville c.1901. Eaton & Bates had trained in Sydney, but {{by the turn of}} the century their principal offices were in Brisbane, with branch offices in Rockhampton, Townsville and Toowoomba. Arthur Polin was managing partner of the Townsville office.The original design was more modest in size than the final structure, extending along the Strand only as far as the eastern tower, and around the corner of Wickham Street for eight bays. It was erected in stages, with trade continuing from the original hotel on the corner of Wickham Street and the Strand until 1925. In 1901, Tyack purchased an adjoining block (site of the former North Australian Hotel) along the Strand, which permitted construction of the first section of the new Queen's Hotel, comprising the eastern tower and four bays to its west, c.1902. This section was extant by March 1903. In May 1904, Tyack replaced the first mortgage with one for £20,000, which probably financed construction of the second section, completed by 1905. This involved demolition of part of the timber building along the Strand, and the extension of the brick building a further six bays toward the corner of Wickham Street. The contractor was a Mr Boyle, and work was underway in January 1904. For the next twenty years, Queen's Hotel consisted of a brick wing along the Strand, and a corner <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> which continued back along Wickham Street.|$|E

50|$|To {{the south}} {{east of the}} Homestead and {{connected}} to its verandah with a covered walkway, is a smaller timber building known as the Cottage. Encircling it are wide verandahs on all sides, with an infill section of the south east. This building is constructed of vertical slabs of timber housed in recessed <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> {{at the top and}} base of the wall, and the building features a similar double roof system to that previously described. The verandah is supported on chamfered timber posts.|$|R
2500|$|The tower {{stands on}} a {{concrete}} base. It is conical in shape, built of an internal timber frame, clad with galvanized iron plates riveted together, and painted white. Sunlight is provided through portholes {{and access to the}} top floor is via a square timber staircase surrounding the central weight tube. The intermediate landings are of metal clad wood. The tower is surmounted by a balcony and Chance Brothers [...] diameter lantern room, housing a VRB-25 lantern. The balcony is made of radial cantilevered <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> and is surrounded by an iron balustrade.|$|R
30|$|Standardized {{tests were}} {{performed}} to evaluate the fire performance of unprotected and protected, or exposed and unexposed, steel plates and develop a finite element model to predict the fire resistance of steel plate connections (Erchinger, Frangi, & Mischler, 2006). Exposed steel plates {{were placed on the}} exterior of a <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> and connected with dowels through the timber member. Unexposed steel plates, also called slotted plates, were embedded in the <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> and then connected by dowels through the section.|$|E
30|$|Heavy {{timber frame}} construction, also called heavy frame, or heavy timber construction, is {{characterized}} by beams and columns with <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> sizes that are greater than 6 ” × 6 ” [150  mm × 150  mm]. Engineered timber products offer greater strength and design flexibility and have become increasingly popular as building elements in tall timber construction. Generally, engineered timber/wood consists of derivative timber products that are manufactured to increase the strength and stiffness of the engineered timber element. This includes, glulam, Laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT).|$|E
40|$|A {{problem has}} been {{observed}} by many researchers regarding the cracks caused mainly by moisture variation in timber structures. However, this effect has been neglected over the past decades. In addition, many design codes {{do not have a}} room for a realistic formulation of the moisture diffusion and its effect in causing internal stress, deformation, and cracks. Moreover, if this effect occurs in connection areas, usually the weakest structural section, it has and also had shown a devastating effect on the service life of many wooden structures. In the current work, a Fickian moisture diffusion model is implemented by use of finite element simulation {{with the help of the}} commercial software ABAQUS for a dowelled beam column connection. The results of such moisture diffusion were used to analyse the stress situation inside the <b>timber</b> <b>section.</b> Moreover, an extended finite element method was applied in ABAQUS to investigate how moisture induced crack develops into the <b>timber</b> <b>section.</b> Furthermore, a parametric study was performed by using Python scripting to investigate the effect of dowel spacing (horizontal and vertical) and critical energy release rate on the development of the moisture-induced crack. The results obtained revealed that for the same material property when the dowel spacing increases (either horizontal or vertical) the crack length increases significantly. Likewise, the crack length increases when the critical energy release rate requirement of the timber is decreasing...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve larger spans of timber arch bridges, glulam massive <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> must be spliced on-site by moment {{resisting}} and rotationally stiff joints. In this paper, a novel timber splice connection utilizing long threaded rods and grout-filled couplers is presented. Flexural characteristics of the splice joint were investigated by full-scale experimental tests and 3 D finite element models. An analytical model is proposed for determining the moment capacity and the rotational stiffness of the splice connection. The experimentally measured efficiency of the splice connection with regard to moment capacity and rotational stiffness was 69 % and 66 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|In current timber design, member {{sizes are}} often {{determined}} {{by the need to}} have an adequate section size for jointing. The use of high performance jointing systems has the potential to achieve substantial reductions in the volume of timber used in conventional structures such as roof trusses. In this programme four different jointing systems which are suitable for large <b>timber</b> <b>sections</b> have been tested: Standard black bolts, Split ring/shear plates, resin bonded steel dowels and butt joints with uni-axial glass reinforcement. The results have shown that the shear plates and the glass-reinforced joints offered the best performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the actual state and the {{strengthening}} intervention developed on a large industrial timber building erected in 1921 in Cardona (close to Barcelona) is presented. The external dimensions of the building are 85. 0 m long, 37. 7 m wide and 32. 42 m high. Some main frames had presented historical failures, without falling down, in the tie member of the roof just under its top.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} three full-scale furnace tests on post-tensioned LVL box beams loaded with vertical loads, and presents a proposed fire design method for post-tensioned timber members. The design method is adapted from the calculation methods given in Eurocode 5 and NZS: 3603 which includes the effects of changing geometry and several failure mechanisms specific to post-tensioned timber. The design procedures include an estimation of the heating of the tendons within the timber cavities, and relaxation of post-tensioning forces. Additionally, comparisons of the designs and assumptions used in the proposed fire design method and the results of the full-scale furnace tests are made. The experimental investigation and development of a design method have shown several areas which need to be addressed. It is important to calculate shear stresses in the <b>timber</b> <b>section,</b> as shear is much more likely to govern compared to solid timber. The investigation has shown that whilst tensile failures are less likely to govern the fire design of post-tensioned timber members, due to the axial compression of the post-tensioning, tensile stresses must still be calculated due to the changing centroid of the members as the fire progresses. Research has also highlighted the importance of monitoring additional deflections and moments caused by the high level of axial loads...|$|E
40|$|Variation in wood properties, {{timber harvest}} and yield, on the {{establishment}} of seed-tree and shelter-tree stands as compared with clear-felling of Pinus sylvestris, was studied at two sites. Seed trees and shelter trees were {{selected on the basis}} of seed productivity, health and vitality criteria. Pines not needed to establish seed or shelter tree stand are referred to as %different pines". The annual radial increment of seed trees was superior to that of indifferent pines but basic density from pith to bark was lower. Shelter trees were intermediate. Differences in wood properties and dimensions between seed trees, shelter trees and indifferent pines reflect the selection criteria used. Differences in value were related to the <b>timber</b> <b>section</b> of the tree, the amounts of pulpwood being more or less constant. At the two sites the change from conventional clearfelling to shelter-tree stands reduced the timber harvest by 100 m- 3 s. u. b. ha- 1. The increased percentage of pulpwood, the decreased percentage of U/S logs and a decrease in mean diameter lead to a substantial reduction in value m- 3 s. u. b. Basal area increment was reduced by 10 % in a shelter-tree stand and by less than 25 % in a seed-tree stand...|$|E
40|$|A rise {{in digital}} {{fabrication}} technologies {{has led to}} numerous recent advances {{in the design and}} manufacture of woodworking joints. Computational generative processes can be used to create a part with integral mechanical attachments for friction-fit, adhesion-less connections between parts. These processes can additionally create machine code for production of such parts on computer numerically controlled (CNC) cutters. This paper investigates such computational processes for digital design and manufacture of <b>timber</b> thin-walled structural <b>sections.</b> Assembly procedures are first presented for rectangular hollow sections and I-sections, with a series of timber prototypes produced to demonstrate their CNC production. An experimental analysis on square hollow sections under uniaxial compressive loading is then conducted. Tight fit digitally-fabricated sections are seen to possess a structural capacity approaching that of the glued sections. Prototypes with different assembly tolerances and grain directions produce a range of novel failure modes and give insight into potential failure paths of digitally-fabricated <b>timber</b> <b>sections...</b>|$|R

Different multi-layer beam designs, where the timber layers were interconnected with welded wood dowels providing interlayer shear resistance, were tested in bending with different dowel densities. The main originality {{of this study is}} the achievement of dowel welds through greater depths of sections than has previously proved possible. The practical difficulties encountered in constructing deeper multi-layer beams, and the successful solutions arrived at, are discussed.
