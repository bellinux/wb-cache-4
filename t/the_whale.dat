5|$|How <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Got His Throat — why {{the larger}} whales eat only small prey.|$|E
5|$|In December 1883, a male {{humpback}} swam up the Firth of Tay in Scotland, past {{what was}} then the whaling port of Dundee. <b>The</b> <b>whale</b> was exhibited to the public by a local entrepreneur, John Woods, both locally and then as a touring exhibition that travelled to Edinburgh and London. <b>The</b> <b>whale</b> was dissected by Professor John Struthers, who wrote seven papers on its anatomy and an 1889 monograph on the humpback.|$|E
5|$|Orectolobiformes: They are {{commonly}} referred to as the carpet sharks, including zebra sharks, nurse sharks, wobbegongs, and <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> shark.|$|E
50|$|Taxonomists further {{categorize}} <b>the</b> common minke <b>whale</b> {{into two}} or three subspecies; the North Atlantic minke <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> North Pacific minke whale and dwarf minke whale. All minke whales {{are part of the}} rorquals, a family that includes <b>the</b> humpback <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> fin <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> Bryde's <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> sei <b>whale</b> and <b>the</b> blue <b>whale.</b>|$|R
50|$|The park's {{waters are}} {{also home to}} four species of whales: <b>the</b> blue <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> fin <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> minke <b>whale</b> and <b>the</b> beluga <b>whale.</b> Due to {{pollution}} on the Saguenay river, <b>the</b> beluga <b>whale</b> population has significantly decreased in the region. This subpopulation is now considered to be endangered.|$|R
5|$|Fin {{whales are}} rorquals, {{members of the}} family Balaenopteridae, which also {{includes}} <b>the</b> humpback <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> blue <b>whale,</b> Bryde's <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> sei <b>whale,</b> and <b>the</b> minke <b>whales.</b> <b>The</b> family diverged from <b>the</b> other baleen <b>whales</b> in <b>the</b> suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Miocene, although it is not known when the members of these families further evolved into their own species.|$|R
5|$|A {{week later}} <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> was found dead, {{floating}} out at sea. It was towed to Stonehaven and dragged onto the beach. John Struthers, the Regius professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen, quickly visited the carcass, recording it as 40 feet long with flukes measuring 11 feet 4 inches. A local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> {{and had it}} transported to his yard in Dundee. On the first Sunday that it was there, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E
5|$|Air {{that passes}} through the phonic lips passes into the distal sac, then back down through the left nasal passage. This {{recycling}} of air allows <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> to continuously generate clicks {{for as long as}} it is submerged.|$|E
5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans {{knew very little about}} whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.|$|E
5000|$|Six species, {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "blackfish", are dolphins commonly called whales: <b>the</b> killer <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> melon-headed <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> pygmy killer <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> false killer <b>whale,</b> and <b>the</b> two species of pilot whales, but they are classified under the family Delphinidae.|$|R
50|$|Most {{nutrition}} from <b>the</b> <b>whale's</b> {{meat and}} organs. According to the Iñupiat people, <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> maktak, <b>the</b> thick black skin and attached oily blubber, contains body-warming energy and vitamin C. <b>The</b> <b>whale's</b> bones {{are used to}} frame sod iglus (igloo), and the elastic baleen is woven into baskets. The liver membrane is used for drums.|$|R
50|$|Lin {{was drafted}} by <b>the</b> Chinatrust <b>Whales</b> in 2007. When <b>the</b> <b>Whales</b> were disbanded {{following}} a 2008 gambling scandal, {{he went to the}} Uni-President Lions in the 2nd round of the disbursement draft. As he was completing his military service, he had not played yet for <b>the</b> <b>Whales.</b>|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> dives.|$|E
5|$|There is robust {{morphological}} {{support for}} {{the placement of the}} zebra shark, <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> shark (Rhincodon typus), and the nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum, Nebrius ferrugineus, and Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum) in a single clade. However, the interrelationships between these taxa are disputed by various authors. Dingerkus (1986) suggested that <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> shark is the closest relative of the zebra shark, and proposed a single family encompassing all five species in the clade. Compagno (1988) suggested affinity between this species and either Pseudoginglymostoma or a clade containing Rhincodon, Ginglymostoma, and Nebrius. Goto (2001) placed the zebra shark as the sister group to a clade containing Rhincodon and Ginglymostoma.|$|E
5|$|Whales defecate at the ocean's surface; their {{excrement}} {{is important}} for fisheries because it is rich in iron and nitrogen. <b>The</b> <b>whale</b> faeces are liquid and instead of sinking, they stay at the surface where phytoplankton feed off it.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (family Balaenopteridae), {{a family that}} includes <b>the</b> humpback <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> fin <b>whale,</b> Bryde's <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> sei <b>whale,</b> and <b>the</b> minke <b>whale.</b> <b>The</b> family Balaenopteridae {{is believed to have}} diverged from the other families of the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Oligocene (28 Ma ago). It is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other.|$|R
5|$|Rorquals {{consist of}} two genera (Balaenoptera and Megaptera) and nine species: <b>the</b> fin <b>whale</b> (B. physalus), <b>the</b> Sei <b>whale</b> (B. borealis), Bryde's whale (B. brydei), Eden's <b>whale</b> (B. edeni), <b>the</b> blue <b>whale</b> (B. musculus), <b>the</b> common minke <b>whale</b> (B. acutorostrata), <b>the</b> Antarctic minke <b>whale</b> (B. bonaerensis), Omura's whale (B. omurai), and <b>the</b> {{humpback}} <b>whale</b> (M. novaeangliae). In a 2012 review of cetacean taxonomy, Alexandre Hassanin (of the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle) and colleagues suggested that, based on phylogenic criteria, {{there are four}} extant genera of rorquals. They recommend that the genus Balaenoptera be limited to <b>the</b> fin <b>whale,</b> have minke <b>whales</b> fall under <b>the</b> genus Pterobalaena, and have Rorqualus contain <b>the</b> Sei <b>whale,</b> Bryde's <b>whale,</b> Eden's <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> blue <b>whale,</b> and Omura's whale.|$|R
5|$|Fossils of an extinct relative, Globicephala baereckeii, {{have been}} found in Pleistocene {{deposits}} in Florida. Another Globicephala dolphin was discovered in Pliocene strata in Tuscany, Italy, and was named G. eturia. <b>The</b> pilot <b>whales</b> were also close relatives of the extinct blunt-snouted dolphin. Close living relatives of <b>the</b> pilot <b>whales</b> are <b>the</b> melon-headed <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> pygmy killer <b>whale,</b> <b>the</b> false killer <b>whale,</b> and Risso's dolphin.|$|R
5|$|After several failed attempts, they harpooned the {{humpback}} on 31 December 1883. It was {{a strong}} male, and it towed two rowing boats and two steamboats as far as Montrose {{and then to the}} Firth of Forth. After a struggle that lasted all night, the harpoon lines broke and <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> escaped.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> from different directions will not be channeled in the same way. Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards {{the left side of}} the skull.|$|E
5|$|Eschrichtiids {{have one}} living member: the grey whale. They are bottom feeders, mainly eating {{crustaceans}} and benthic invertebrates. They feed by turning {{on their sides}} and taking in water mixed with sediment, which is then expelled through the baleen, leaving their prey trapped inside. This is an efficient method of hunting, in which <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> has no major competitors.|$|E
60|$|Ere this, {{you must}} have plainly seen {{the truth of what}} I started with-- that <b>the</b> Sperm <b>Whale</b> and <b>the</b> Right <b>Whale</b> have almost entirely {{different}} heads. To sum up, then: in <b>the</b> Right <b>Whale's</b> there is no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like <b>the</b> Sperm <b>Whale's.</b> Nor in <b>the</b> Sperm <b>Whale</b> are there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, <b>the</b> Right <b>Whale</b> has two external spout-holes, <b>the</b> Sperm <b>Whale</b> only one.|$|R

500|$|Joining <b>the</b> Chicago <b>Whales</b> in <b>the</b> Federal League, Tinker {{served as}} player-manager. In his role, he signed other major league players to the Federal League, {{though he could}} not lure American League {{pitchers}} Walter Johnson from the Washington Senators or Smoky Joe Wood from the Boston Red Sox. <b>The</b> <b>Whales</b> drew more fans than the Cubs in those two seasons. <b>The</b> <b>Whales</b> finished in second place in 1914, with Tinker batting [...]259 despite suffering a broken rib during the season. Tinker tore a muscle in May 1915, ending his season prematurely. With Tinker managing, <b>the</b> <b>Whales</b> won <b>the</b> pennant in 1915. However, the league folded after the 1915 season.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> pump. This fertilises phytoplankton and other plants {{on the surface of the}} ocean and contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon.|$|E
5|$|So-called lobtail feeding was {{observed}} in the North Atlantic. This technique involves <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> slapping {{the surface of the}} ocean with its tail between one and four times before creating the bubble net. Using network-based diffusion analysis, the study authors argued that these whales learned the behavior from other whales in the group over a period of 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey.|$|E
5|$|The Just So Stories each {{tell how}} a {{particular}} animal was modified from an original form {{to its current}} form by the acts of man, or some magical being. For example, <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> has a tiny throat because he swallowed a mariner, who tied a raft inside to block <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> from swallowing other men. The Camel has a hump {{given to him by}} a djinn as punishment for the camel's refusing to work (the hump allows the camel to work longer between times of eating). The Leopard's spots were painted by an Ethiopian (after the Ethiopian painted himself black). The Kangaroo gets its powerful hind legs, long tail, and hopping gait after being chased all day by a dingo, sent by a minor god responding to the Kangaroo's request to be made different from all other animals.|$|E
50|$|These are <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> of <b>the</b> largest size.|$|R
500|$|Recent DNA {{evidence}} indicates <b>the</b> fin <b>whale</b> {{may be more}} closely related to <b>the</b> humpback <b>whale</b> (Megaptera novaeangliae) and in at least one study <b>the</b> gray <b>whale</b> (Eschrichtius robustus), two whales in different genera, than it is to members of its own genus, such as <b>the</b> minke <b>whales.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 1984 {{animated}} film Samson & Sally: Song of <b>the</b> <b>Whales</b> involves a young white whale named Samson who searches for Moby-Dick after hearing a legend that Moby-Dick {{would one day}} return to save all <b>the</b> <b>whales.</b> <b>The</b> sinking of the Pequod is shown as <b>the</b> young <b>whale's</b> mother tells him the story of Moby Dick. The film was alternately titled The Secret of Moby Dick in some other countries.|$|R
5|$|The Regius Professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen University, John Struthers {{dissected}} <b>the</b> <b>whale,</b> much of {{the time}} in public with a military band playing in the background, organised by Woods. The decomposing whale made Woods a great deal of money, and Struthers famous.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers {{knew from}} the {{beginning}} of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled that they were prepared to change to another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult. When Humphrey <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> wandered into the San Francisco Bay, Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so. Other footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on 35mm film or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script. Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> problem, Rodis hired robotics expert Walt Conti. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well-equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>whale</b> ear has {{specific}} {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. <b>The</b> <b>whale</b> ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge {{sitting on top of}} its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> blue <b>whale</b> {{is usually}} {{classified}} {{as one of}} eight species in the genus Balaenoptera; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, Sibbaldus, {{but this is not}} accepted elsewhere. DNA sequencing analysis indicates that <b>the</b> blue <b>whale</b> is phylogenetically closer to <b>the</b> sei <b>whale</b> (Balaenoptera borealis) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei) than to other Balaenoptera species, and closer to <b>the</b> humpback <b>whale</b> (Megaptera) and <b>the</b> gray <b>whale</b> (Eschrichtius) than to <b>the</b> minke <b>whales</b> (Balaenoptera acutorostrata and Balaenoptera bonaerensis). If further research confirms these relationships, {{it will be necessary to}} reclassify the rorquals.|$|R
40|$|A diffuse {{aggregation}} of dwarf minke <b>whales</b> {{occurs in}} <b>the</b> northern Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) during the austral winter months. <b>The</b> <b>whales</b> voluntarily approach dive tourism vessels and their passengers and maintain contact for prolonged periods (mean[*]±[*]SE[*]=[*] 3. 9 [*]±[*] 0. 57  h). We report on 521 industry-wide dwarf minke whale encounters (2006 – 2007) and provide detailed analyses of 20 encounters in 2006 and 18 in 2007 from the vessel Undersea Explorer. <b>The</b> <b>whales</b> surfaced significantly more often within a 60  m {{radius of the}} vessel than expected, and aggregated especially around swimmers. The inquisitiveness of <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> creates several management issues including compliance difficulties for non-swim-with <b>whales</b> endorsed operations. <b>The</b> whales' close and prolonged association with vessels and swimmers indicates a strong attraction of these animals to the stimulus and raises concerns about the wellbeing of <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> and <b>the</b> swimming participants. Preventing these encounters would be difficult without banning dive tourism in the GBRWHA for several months. Several management strategies are highlighted and broader education is recommended to reduce the potential of adverse impacts on <b>the</b> <b>whales...</b>|$|R
