5|$|Before {{the opening}} of Melbourne Airport, Melbourne's main airport was Essendon Airport which was officially {{designated}} an international airport in 1950. In the mid-1950s, over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon Airport and the limitations of Essendon Airport were beginning to become apparent. Essendon Airport's facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel; the runways were <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> handle the then new jet airliners and the terminals failed to handle the increase in passengers, by the mid-1950s, an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary, the airport had become surrounded by residential housing, meaning that expansion of Essendon Airport was not possible.|$|E

5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in {{methyl isobutyl ketone}} (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB {{to take place in}} enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine has two stable {{isotopes}}, 35Cl and 37Cl. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes occurring in quantity, with 35Cl making up 76% of natural chlorine and 37Cl {{making up the}} remaining 24%. Both are synthesised in stars in the oxygen-burning and silicon-burning processes. Both have nuclear spin 3/2+ and thus {{may be used for}} nuclear magnetic resonance, although the spin magnitude being greater than 1/2 results in non-spherical nuclear charge distribution and thus resonance broadening {{as a result of a}} nonzero nuclear quadrupole moment and resultant quadrupolar relaxation. The other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> occur in nature primordially. Of these, the most commonly used in the laboratory are 36Cl (t1/2 = 3.0×105y) and 38Cl (t1/2 = 37.2min), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes, al-Mu'tadid's reign was {{ultimately}} <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> effect a lasting {{reversal of the}} Caliphate's fortunes, and the revival that he spearheaded was too dependent {{on the presence of}} capable personalities {{at the helm of the}} state. The brief reign of his less able son and heir, al-Muktafi, still saw some major gains, notably the annexation of the Tulunid domains, but his later successors lacked his energy, and new enemies appeared in the form of the Qarmatians. In addition, the factionalism within the bureaucracy, that had become apparent during the later years of al-Mu'tadid's reign, would debilitate the Abbasid government for decades to come, eventually leading to the subjugation of the Caliphate to a series of military strongmen and culminating in the conquest of Baghdad by the Buyids in 946.|$|E

5|$|During the {{production}} run, the Navy {{decided to move}} the Chance Vought factory from Stratford, Connecticut to a much larger facility in Dallas, Texas which had been vacant {{since the end of}} World War II; this badly disrupted {{the production}} of the Pirate. The airframes were built in Stratford and trucked to Dallas where government-furnished equipment, such as the engines and afterburners, were installed. The completed aircraft were then taxied around the new plant's airfield, but the runway was deemed <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> handle jets. The aircraft had to be disassembled and trucked to an abandoned airfield at Ardmore, Oklahoma with a runway long enough for acceptance testing.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, Sarria became {{determined}} to join the military, despite being, at just under five feet tall, <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> meet the Army's height requirement. He seduced a major who {{was attached to the}} San Francisco recruiting station on the condition that the major approve Sarria's enlistment. Jose Sarria was approved and entered the Army Reserve, continuing his studies as he waited to be called up to active duty. Shortly before he was scheduled for induction in the regular Army, his beloved second father, Charles Millen, died of a heart attack. Sarria's induction was delayed a month, then he was sworn in and ordered to Sacramento, California, for basic training with the Signal Corps.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 1905, {{following}} lobbying by Ickenham Parish Council, the Metropolitan Railway {{opened a}} small halt on their line between Harrow and Uxbridge. The railway {{company had been}} reluctant to open a station in the area due to a perceived lack of demand, and so a compromise was reached {{with the construction of}} the halt. The new stop brought with it travellers from London seeking a day out in rural surroundings. Nearby villagers sold flowers from their gardens and served teas to the visitors. The parish council later requested shelters for passengers on the platforms, which were built in December 1905, followed by a booking hut in 1910. The original platforms, <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> align with all train carriages, were extended in 1922. Ickenham Halt was rebuilt as a station in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|One of Shelby's chief {{concerns}} was securing {{federal aid}} {{to defend the}} frontier. Although Kentuckians were engaged in an undeclared war with American Indians north of the Ohio River, Shelby had been ordered by Secretary of War Henry Knox not to conduct offensive military actions against the Indians. Furthermore, he was limited by federal regulations that restricted the service of state militiamen to thirty days, which was <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> be effective. With the meager resources of his fledgling state he was only able to defend the most vulnerable areas from Indian attack. Meanwhile, Kentuckians suspected that the Indians were being stirred up and supplied by the British.|$|E
5|$|Bromine has two stable isotopes, 79Br and 81Br. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes, with 79Br making up 51% of natural bromine and 81Br {{making up the}} {{remaining}} 49%. Both have nuclear spin 3/2− and thus {{may be used for}} nuclear magnetic resonance, although 81Br is more favourable. The other bromine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> occur in nature. Of these, the most important are 80Br (t1/2 = 17.7min), 80mBr (t1/2 = 4.421h), and 82Br (t1/2 = 35.28h), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural bromine. The most stable bromine radioisotope is 77Br (t1/2 = 57.04h). The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 79Br is electron capture to isotopes of selenium; that of isotopes heavier than 81Br is beta decay to isotopes of krypton; and 80Br may decay by either mode to stable 80Se or 80Kr.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} when the Deccan Traps {{hypothesis}} was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept {{the idea that the}} mass extinctions {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. Even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, however, such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions. The duration of the K-T extinction event was less than 10 ky, and the time span is <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> be explained by Deccan volcanism. Geophysical models and high-precision radiometric dating suggest that the Chicxulub impact could have triggered some of the largest Deccan eruptions, and potentially, could have triggered eruptions at active volcanoes anywhere on Earth.|$|E

Logan {{was assigned}} to assault the 3rd Louisiana Redan and the Great Redoubt. The brigade of Brig. Gen. John E. Smith made {{it as far as}} the slope of the redan, but huddled there, dodging grenades until dark before they were recalled. Brig. Gen. John D. Stevenson's brigade advanced well in two columns against the redoubt, but their attack also failed when they found their ladders were <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> scale the fortification. Brig.

5|$|Studies by Phil Senter in 2007 {{conducted}} on P. neimongoliensis and P. mongoliensis {{concluded that the}} forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other Psittacosaurus species) were too short (only about 58% {{as long as the}} hindlimbs) to reach the ground, and their range of motion indicates they could neither be pronated nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that Psittacosaurus was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if Psittacosaurus needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or scratching the body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to the belly or sides of the animal and could have scratched only the belly, flank and knees. Even though the hands could not reach the mouth, Psittacosaurus could have still used them to carry nesting material or food to a desired location.|$|E
5|$|The Yer-2 {{was not in}} {{squadron}} service when Germany invaded on 22 June 1941, but the 420th and 421st Long-Range Bomber Regiments (—DBAP) {{were formed}} shortly afterwards.

On the evening of 10 August Yer-2s of the 420th DBAP, accompanied by Petlyakov Pe-8s of the 432nd DBAP, attempted to bomb Berlin from Pushkino Airfield near Leningrad. The airfield was <b>too</b> <b>short</b> <b>to</b> accommodate a fully loaded Yer-2, but three bombers did manage to take off regardless. Two managed to bomb Berlin, or its outskirts, but only one successfully returned; the other was shot down by 'friendly' Polikarpov I-16s when it reentered Soviet airspace and the third aircraft went missing.
