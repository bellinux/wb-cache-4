40|$|We {{show that}} <b>the</b> conjugacy <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> a wreath product A B is uniform-TC^ 0 -Turing-reducible to <b>the</b> conjugacy <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> factors A and B and <b>the</b> power <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> B. If B is torsion free, <b>the</b> power <b>problem</b> for B can be {{replaced}} by the slightly weaker cyclic submonoid membership problem for B. Moreover, if A is abelian, the cyclic subgroup membership problem suffices, which itself is uniform-AC^ 0 -many-one-reducible to <b>the</b> conjugacy <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> A B. Furthermore, under certain natural conditions, we give a uniform TC^ 0 Turing reduction from <b>the</b> power <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> A B to <b>the</b> power <b>problems</b> of A and B. Together with our first result, this yields a uniform TC^ 0 solution to <b>the</b> conjugacy <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> iterated wreath products of abelian groups - and, by the Magnus embedding, also in free solvable groups...|$|R
5|$|At the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in Kazan, Brazil {{finished}} 4th in the Men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle, in a relay {{composed by}} Bruno Fratus, Marcelo Chierighini, Matheus Santana and João de Lucca.

According to the doctor of the Brazilian Aquatic Sports Confederation (CBDA), Gustavo Magliocca, Cielo had an inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon.

Due to <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>in</b> the Men's 50 metre butterfly, Cielo struggled though the heats and the semifinals, but slumped to 6th in the final. On August 5, Cielo left the competition due to the increase of his injury.|$|E
5|$|August 7–9, 1993 - Tropical Storm Bret {{moves across}} {{northern}} Venezuela and Colombia. In Venezuela, the storm drops at least 13.35inches (339mm) in Guanare. The rainfall causes mudslides, particularly {{near the city}} of Caracas, that cover many low-income housing units. Of the 173 deaths caused by Bret in Venezuela, most occur in the low-income areas near Caracas. Lack of preparation, including weather forecasters prematurely stating the worst of the storm is over, is part of <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> <b>In</b> all, 10,000 are left homeless, and damaged totals $25million (1993USD, $37million 2008USD).

5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick.

Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma messages.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the telerecorded material, some early 1970s material survives only, or in colour only, on NTSC videotapes produced for North American transmission (e.g., TV Ontario and CKVU in Vancouver). NTSC runs at a different framerate than PAL video, and has a different number of scanlines. The conversion process used in the 1970s was primitive by modern standards, resulting in a noticeable amount of picture and motion loss. Converting the NTSC tapes back to PAL introduces more artifacts, creating a blurry picture and juddering motion. To rectify <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>in</b> 2005 a new Reverse Standards Conversion process, which attempts to unpick the original video conversion, was introduced for the DVD release of The Claws of Axos.|$|E

They saw graphic examples of hunger and malnutrition firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local and state officials. McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress {{during much of the}} next year over an expanded Food Stamp Program; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free food stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.|$|E
5|$|The {{decisive factor}} {{in favour of}} change in Chicago, however, was the {{economic}} slowdown in the early 1890s, which {{gave way to the}} financial panic of 1893. The recession, combined with the frantic building of the previous few years, meant that Chicago suddenly had a significant surplus of office space, threatening occupancy levels and rents. Regulation was introduced by the city council to control <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> 1892, with support from the real estate industry who hoped to slow the construction of additional office space and shore up their diminishing profit margins. The height of new buildings was limited to , with lower height levels on narrower streets, effectively curtailing the construction of any taller skyscrapers.|$|E

5|$|The {{starling}} family, Sturnidae, is {{an entirely}} Old World group apart from introductions elsewhere, with the greatest numbers of species in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Sturnus is polyphyletic and relationships between its members are not fully resolved. The closest relation of the common starling is the spotless starling. The non-migratory spotless starling may be descended from a population of ancestral S. vulgaris that survived in an Iberian refugium during an ice age retreat, and mitochondrial gene studies suggest {{that it could be}} considered as a subspecies of the common starling. There is more genetic variation between common starling populations than between nominate common starling and spotless starling. Although common starling remains are known from the Middle Pleistocene, part of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> resolving relationships in the Sturnidae is the paucity of the fossil record for the family as a whole.|$|E
5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773.

There is a more difficult version of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version {{of the problem was}} first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, and the answer is a very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1900s and 1910s, St. Louis began a {{building}} program that created parks and playgrounds in several deteriorating residential neighborhoods. Parks Commissioner (and former professional tennis player) Dwight F. Davis continued {{the development of}} recreational facilities during the early 1910s by expanding tennis facilities and building a public 18-hole golf course in northwest Forest Park. The St. Louis Zoo was constructed in Forest Park in the early 1910s {{under the leadership of}} Mayor Henry Kiel. Since the 1890s, St. Louis had attempted to control its air pollution problems with little success, but damage to buildings and flora made the issue more visible during the 1920s. Problems came to a head with the 1939 St. Louis smog, which blackened the sky and lasted for three weeks. A ban on burning low-quality coal solved <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> December 1939, and the addition of natural gas for heating assisted homeowners in making the transition to cleaner fuels by the late 1940s.|$|E

Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man.
