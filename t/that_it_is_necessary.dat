5|$|Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the {{corporate}} {{administrator for the}} RDA mining operation. While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize {{the attacks on the}} Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary,</b> and the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.|$|E
5|$|His later {{writings}} show {{no change}} in his fundamental positions. Other elements in Zwingli's theology would lead him to deny that baptism {{is a means of}} grace or <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> for salvation. His defence of infant baptism was not only a matter of church politics, but was clearly related to the whole of his theology and his profound sense of unity of the church.|$|E

5|$|President Bartlet {{himself is}} {{confronted with a}} forest fire in Wyoming, and decides to follow the counter-intuitive advice of his experts, and let the fire burn. Meanwhile he is still {{struggling}} {{to deal with the}} death of his perennial personal secretary, Mrs. Landingham. Charlie insists <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to appoint a new person to fill the position, but the president is reluctant to take the step. As the episode ends, Bartlet is searching for a good pen, and realizes the full depth of his dependence on Mrs. Landingham.|$|E
5|$|Should a new tunnel be built, {{it would}} not {{necessarily}} run next to the Oslo Tunnel. One proposal from the National Rail Administration calls for a separate commuter train station to be built underground, {{at the location of}} Oslo Bus Terminal, within walking distance of OsloS. This proposal involves the line connecting to the existing route before reaching Nationaltheatret. The lobby organisation Norsk Bane have called for a line to run further north, and serve Majorstuen, where there is a major metro and tramway hub. Norsk Bane also call for the tunnel to be built for higher speeds, and state <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to build high-speed rail to Bergen and Stavanger. Combined with a new line from Drammen to the tunnel, it would allow travel time from Drammen and Oslo to be reduced to 18 minutes.|$|E
5|$|While East Timor's {{decision}} {{to form a}} military has been criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons. Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat, they believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as {{an effective means of}} integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.|$|E

25|$|Thomist ethics hold <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to observe}} both {{circumstances}} and intention to determine an action's moral value, and therefore Aquinas cannot {{be said to}} be strictly either a deontologicalist or a consequentialist.

25|$|The church {{believes}} that baptism {{is done by}} immersion baptism or Believer's baptism by adults in water, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> that people be baptised in the Iglesia ni Cristo to become disciples of Jesus Christ. The church rejects infant baptism. Newborn children of members are instead dedicated to God through a congregational prayer, led by an ordained minister of the INC.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} has been controversial, {{particularly in the}} case of children. In the United States, many physicians will agree to explore and exhaust all non-blood alternatives in the treatment of children at the request of their legal guardians.

25|$|Defenders of the {{decision}} and separability have said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> for arbitration clauses to have any force, otherwise parties {{would be able to}} avoid them too easily by filing suits on any number of grounds. Those whose practice involves arbitrating disputes that are international in scope have credited it with bringing U.S. arbitration law closer to European norms, helping American companies compete and making the U.S. a viable venue for arbitration.|$|E

25|$|Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries: Surgical {{procedures}} {{depend on}} diagnosis, {{and there is}} often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female {{in order for them}} to function socially and develop normally. Psychosocial reasons are often stated. This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a cleft lip, genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Fukuyama's comments, Acemoglu and Robinson replied on their blog. First, {{they agreed that}} their work is largely inspired by North, Wallis and Weingast's work but explained that they build on and complement each other's work. Second, {{with reference to the}} criticism of oversimplification, they countered by describing the oversimplification as an approach to decompose complex political institutions; <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to conceptualize and to avoid focusing too narrowly on a single aspect of institutions. Last, on China, they attribute the rapid economic growth in China to the some (but yet limited) level of inclusiveness, as was also seen in the example of the Soviet Union in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|According to some {{lines of}} thinking, the ageing process is routed into a basic {{reduction}} of biological complexity, and thus loss of information. In order {{to reverse this}} loss, gerontologist Marios Kyriazis suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to increase input of actionable and meaningful information both individually (into individual brains), and collectively (into societal systems). This technique enhances overall biological function through up-regulation of immune, hormonal, antioxidant and other parameters, resulting in improved age-repair mechanisms. Working in parallel with natural evolutionary mechanisms that can facilitate survival through increased fitness, Kyriazis claims that the technique {{may lead to a}} reduction of the rate of death as a function of age, i.e. indefinite lifespan.|$|E
