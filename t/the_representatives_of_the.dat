5|$|After 1529, {{resistance}} to John I in Transylvania was broken {{in a series}} of small campaigns. For instance, the last Transylvanian magnate to side with Ferdinánd I, Stephen Majláth went over to John I in early 1532, and Sibiu was occupied in 1536. On February 24, 1538, a secret pact was signed in Oradea by <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two kings of Hungary. According to the treaty, both rulers were allowed to retain the territories which they then held, but the childless John I promised to recognize the Habsburgs' succession.|$|E
5|$|Another set of negotiations, {{that of the}} {{surrender}} of German armed forces, were conducted in May 1945. Smith and Strong met with <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, Generaloberst Alfred Jodl and Generaladmiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg. Once again, Strong acted as translator. Strong was present when, on 7 May, Smith signed {{the surrender}} document, along with Suslaparov and the French representative, Major General François Sevez.|$|E
5|$|Despite this glowing message by the Emperor, Chan {{writes that}} a year later in 1446, the Ming court cut off all {{relations}} with the Karmapa hierarchs. Until then, the court was unaware that Deshin Shekpa had died in 1415. The Ming court had believed that <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Karma Kagyu who continued to visit the Ming capital were sent by the Karmapa.|$|E

5|$|John Sigismund, {{who never}} married and left no heir, {{was the last}} member of the Zápolya family. In his will, he assured the Diet of its right to choose the new monarch. <b>The</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three Nations elected the Roman Catholic Stephen Báthory, who adopted the title Voivode of Transylvania. Gáspár Bekes, {{supported}} by Maximilian, contested the election, but Báthory emerged victorious in the resulting civil war and consolidated his rule.|$|E
5|$|Louis and <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish nobility started {{negotiations}} of Louis's succession in Poland in {{the autumn}} of 1373. After a year of negotiations, he issued the so-called Privilege of Koszyce on 17 September 1374, reducing the tax that Polish noblemen paid to the king by about 84% and promising a remuneration to noblemen who participated in foreign military campaigns. In exchange, the Polish lords confirmed the right of Louis's daughters to inherit Poland.|$|E
5|$|The Transylvanian Diet {{confirmed}} the Treaty of Gyalu in August. <b>The</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> noblemen of the Partium (the counties between the Tisza and Transylvania) also consented {{to a war}} against the Ottoman Empire in November. However, the Habsburgs' army was unable to recapture Pest or defeat the Ottomans. Caspar Serédy came to Gyalu to take possession of John Sigismund's realm on Ferdinand's behalf, but Isabella refused him on 17December. Three days later, the Diet declared the Treaty of Gyalu null and void, {{over the objections of}} the delegates of the Transylvanian Saxons.|$|E

5|$|The {{agreement}} of the Protocol was ratified by <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Powers at Athens on 18 June and by the Albanian government on 23 June.

On July 8, control of the cities of Tepelenë and Korçë passed to the provisional government of Northern Epirus.|$|E

In the following months several counties outside Transylvania (including Abaúj, Bihar, and Gömör) also acknowledged John Sigismund's rule.|$|E
5|$|A delegation, {{consisting}} of <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad {{to serve as}} chief arbitrator for the entire community; due to {{his status as a}} neutral outsider. There was fighting in Yathrib: primarily the dispute involved its Arab and Jewish inhabitants, and was estimated to have lasted for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu'ath in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal concept of blood-feud and {{an eye for an eye}} were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases. The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} a virtual stalemate {{with these two}} wars against the Afghans, the British imposed the Durand Line in 1893, which divided Afghanistan and British India (now the North-West Frontier Province, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (F.A.T.A.) and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan). Named after Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of the British Indian government, it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman Khan) and <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Empire but deeply resented by the Afghans. Its intended purpose was {{to serve as a}} buffer zone to inhibit the spread of Russian influence down into British India.|$|E
5|$|Although Herodotus {{presents}} the revolt {{as a consequence}} of Aristagoras and Histiaeus's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
5|$|Báthory's {{position}} {{was at first}} extremely difficult, as there was still some opposition to his election. Emperor Maximilian, insisting on his earlier election, fostered internal opposition and prepared to enforce his claim by military action. At first <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duchy of Lithuania refused to recognize Báthory as Grand Duke, and demanded concessions - that he return the estates of his wife Anne to the Lithuanian treasury, hold Sejm conventions in both Lithuania and Poland, and reserve the highest governmental official offices in Lithuania for Lithuanians. He accepted the conditions. In June Báthory was recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Duke of Ruthenia and Samogitia.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{approved}} {{the extension of}} I-70; however, the route still had {{to be approved by}} <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. military on the planning committee. Military representatives were concerned that plans for this new highway network did not have a direct connection from the central U.S. to southern California; and further felt Salt Lake City was adequately connected. Military planners {{approved the}} extension, but moved the western terminus south to Cove Fort, using I-70 as part of a link between Denver with Los Angeles instead of Salt Lake City. Utah officials objected to the modification, complaining they were being asked to build a long and expensive freeway that would serve no populated areas of the state. After being told this was the only way the military would approve the extension, Utah officials agreed to build the freeway along the approved route.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Solti {{was invited}} to become music {{director}} of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.|$|E
5|$|In Commonwealth realms {{other than}} the UK, royal assent is granted or {{withheld}} either by the realm's sovereign or, more frequently, by {{the representative of the}} sovereign, the governor-general. In federated realms, assent in each state, province, or territory is granted or withheld by <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sovereign. In Australia, this is the governors of the states, administrators of the territories, or the governor-general in the Australian Capital Territory. For Canada, this is the lieutenant governors of the provinces. A lieutenant governor may defer assent to the governor general, and the governor general may defer assent to federal bills to the sovereign.|$|E

5|$|On July 2, 2010 Minister of Environmental Protection Viktor Boiko (Bloc Lytvyn) was {{replaced}} by Mykola Zlochevskiy and Vice Prime Minister Volodymyr Seminozhenko was fired by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) the same day.

5|$|Richard's {{government}} was formed around his uncles, most prominently {{the rich and}} powerful John of Gaunt, and many of his grandfather's former senior officials. They faced the challenge of financially sustaining the war in France. Taxes in the 14th century were raised on an ad hoc basis through Parliament, then comprising the Lords, the titled aristocracy and clergy; and the Commons, <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knights, merchants and senior gentry from across England. These taxes were typically imposed on a household's movable possessions, such as their goods or stock. The raising of these taxes affected the members of the Commons much more than the Lords. To complicate matters, the official statistics used to administer the taxes pre-dated the Black Death and, since the size and wealth of local communities had changed greatly since the plague, effective collection had become increasingly difficult.|$|E
5|$|Ritual {{scarification}} in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi {{of which there are}} two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, the carved line ran {{from the center of the}} forehead down to the chin. A second line ran across the face, from the right cheek to the left. This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate the rays of the sun. In the Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to <b>the</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eze Nri; the mbùríchi.
