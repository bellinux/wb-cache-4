50|$|Crowther's wife kills herself, mistakenly {{thinking}} {{that her husband}} is the murderer; Crowther himself dies shortly afterwards from a heart attack, {{thinking that}} she is the killer. In the end it turns out it was neither of them but rather the other girl at the bus stop, Sue Widdowson, who was Crowther’s mistress. Crowther had dropped her off and had sex with Sylvia. Widdowson became insanely jealous, crept up behind Sylvia in the car, and hit her {{on the back of the}} head with a <b>tyre</b> <b>lever</b> lying in the car park.|$|E

5000|$|Von Planta's bike {{suffered}} a broken frame after a bad fall in Mongolia, {{and only a}} [...] "bodge job" [...] by Boorman using <b>tyre</b> <b>levers</b> and cable-ties enabled them {{to get to the}} next town where it could be welded. Afterwards, they discovered that the anti-lock braking system no longer worked, and the entire bike had to be shipped to Ulaanbaatar and sent home. A replacement was found locally (nicknamed 'The Red Devil'), a new Russian-made IZh Planeta 5, purchased for about US$1,000. This later developed gearbox problems. Two passing Mongolian sheep herders were able quickly to repair it, laughing that McGregor and Boorman had such high-quality tools but little idea how to fix the bike. The next part of the route was especially wet and muddy, making the heavy BMW bikes undrivable and forcing McGregor & Boorman to man-handle them for long distances, while von Planta on the much lighter Planeta had no trouble riding. The frame of McGregor's bike broke in two places in Siberia, forcing them to flag down a passing truck that took them back to Tynda for more welding.|$|R
5000|$|The 20 hp Vitesse Phaeton was {{pictured in}} the same newspaper. It came with a {{waterproof}} canvas hood, double-folding windscreen, grooved and studded tyres, detachable wheels (with spare and studded tyre), dynamo lighting system with all lamps, speedometer, lifting jack, <b>tyre</b> pump and <b>levers,</b> horn and kit of tools.

50|$|Individual {{seats were}} fitted in the front, with a bench {{at the rear}} that could fold down to {{increase}} luggage capacity. The trim material was a vinyl treated fabric. Options included a heater, radio, windscreen washers and white-wall <b>tyres.</b> The gearchange <b>lever</b> was floor-mounted with the handbrake between the seats. The door windows were not opened by conventional winders, but pulled up and down using finger grips; a window lock position was on the door handle.|$|R
