5|$|Pearl Jam {{was outraged}} when it {{discovered}} after {{a pair of}} shows in Chicago, Illinois in March 1994 that <b>ticket</b> <b>vendor</b> Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Following the tour, the band brought a lawsuit against Ticketmaster that accused them of being a monopoly whose anticompetitive practices allowed markup prices of more than 30%. The band's intention was to get ticket prices lowered for its fans. Pearl Jam's plans for a 1994 summer tour were cancelled {{as a result of}} a Ticketmaster boycott.|$|E

500|$|That {{same year}} Pearl Jam {{canceled}} its summer tour {{in protest of}} what it regarded as <b>ticket</b> <b>vendor</b> Ticketmaster's unfair business practices. Pearl Jam then began a boycott of the company; however, Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented the band from playing shows in the United States {{for the next three}} years. In 1996, Alice in Chains gave their final performances with their ailing and estranged lead singer, Layne Staley, who subsequently died from an overdose of cocaine and heroin in 2002. In 1996, Soundgarden and Screaming Trees released their final studio albums of the 1990s, Down on the Upside and Dust, respectively.

500|$|For {{its third}} album, Pearl Jam again worked with {{producer}} Brendan O'Brien. The band wrote {{many of the}} songs during soundchecks on its Vs. Tour {{and the majority of}} the album's tracks were recorded during breaks on the tour. The first session took place late in 1993 in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the band recorded [...] "Tremor Christ" [...] and [...] "Nothingman". The rest of the material was written and recorded in 1994 in sessions in Seattle, Washington and Atlanta, Georgia, with the band finishing the album at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle after the tour's completion. [...] "Immortality" [...] was written in April 1994 when the band was on tour in Atlanta. Sources state that most of the album was completed by early 1994, but that either a forced delay by Epic, or the band's battle with <b>ticket</b> <b>vendor</b> Ticketmaster, were to blame for the delay.|$|E
500|$|By 1994, Pearl Jam was [...] "fighting on all fronts", as its manager {{described}} the band at the time. Reporter Chuck Philips broke {{a series of}} stories showing that Ticketmaster was gouging Pearl Jam's customers. Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of charity benefit shows in Chicago, Illinois, it discovered that <b>ticket</b> <b>vendor</b> Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Pearl Jam was committed to keeping their concert ticket prices down but Fred Rosen of Ticketmaster, refused to waive the service charge. Since Ticketmaster controlled most major venues, the band was forced to create from scratch its own outdoor stadiums in rural areas [...] in order to perform. Pearl Jam’s efforts to organize a tour without the ticket giant collapsed which Pearl Jam said was evidence of Ticketmaster's monopoly. An analysis of journalist Chuck Philips investigative series in a well known legal monograph concluded {{that it was hard}} to imagine a legitimate reason for Ticketmaster’s exclusive contracts with venues and contracts which covered such a lengthy period of time. The authors said, “The pervasiveness of Ticketmaster's exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act.” ...|$|E
