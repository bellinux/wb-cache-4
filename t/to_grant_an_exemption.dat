2500|$|As Health Secretary, Hewitt lobbied {{hard for}} a {{complete}} ban on smoking in public places, which came into force on 1 July 2007. Her predecessor, John Reid had been in favour of limiting the Government's proposed smoking ban as much as possible, and Labour's 2005 election manifesto had included only a limited pledge, proposing to only ban smoking in places where food was served. Even {{though he had been}} moved to Secretary of State for Defence, Reid was the main opponent of her proposals, and a leading figure in the decision of the Cabinet <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> for private clubs and pubs that did not serve food. However, the exemption in the Cabinet proposals did not find favour with MPs and the Government gave them a free vote on the issue. Hewitt voted with the rebels to defeat the Cabinet's partial ban, which was replaced by the outright ban which she had always wanted. Sir Liam Donaldson described the ban as [...] "a momentous move which would prevent the deaths of both smokers and non-smokers." [...] In June 2010, it was announced {{that there had been a}} 2.4% decrease in heart attack admissions in the year following the ban.

50|$|During his episcopate, {{the city}} of León {{declined}} in importance relative to {{the city of}} Toledo. Peter had to contend with the claim of the archbishops of Toledo that the diocese of León lay within their province, a claim approved by Pope Urban II in 1099. In 1104, Peter successfully convinced Urban's successor, Paschal II, <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> León <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> from metropolitan control {{on the basis of a}} forged document, the so-called Division of Wamba. Significantly, the dioceses of León and Oviedo had common interests at this time. The only copies of the Division that support the Leonese claims emanate from the scriptorium of the cathedral of Oviedo under Bishop Pelagius, a notorious forger. The original of the papal bull of exemption still survives in the cathedral of León.|$|R
40|$|As {{a general}} proposition, when a state asserts {{substantive}} {{jurisdiction over the}} subject matter of a tax, the state should also have enforcement jurisdiction over a person who can effectively remit the tax. Administrative and compliance considerations may justify an exception when the item to be taxed falls below a certain threshold. Because the administrative and compliance costs associated with foreign persons may be higher than for domestic persons, the appropriate thresholds for foreign persons may be higher. An alternative <b>to</b> <b>granting</b> <b>a</b> tax <b>exemption</b> <b>to</b> persons who fall below a threshold is to lower their administrative and compliance costs through a simplified compliance regime. In the American sub-national system, the major impediments to the alignment of substantive and enforcement jurisdiction are the Quill physical presence test and the income tax safe-harbor of P. L. 86 - 272. These physical presence tests have had the unintended consequence of stimulating “economic development nexus ” rules that are even more protective of remote businesses, thus driving substantive and enforcement jurisdiction even further out of alignment. Finally, the tax law has responded to mobility in various ways, as illustrated by the diverse approaches to the problem of sourcing intangibles for income tax purposes...|$|R

5000|$|The {{boom in the}} Cayman Islands' {{international}} finance industry can also be at least partly attributed to the British overseas territory having no direct taxation. A popular legend attributes the tax-free status to the heroic acts of the inhabitants during a maritime tragedy in 1794, {{often referred to as}} [...] "Wreck of the Ten Sails". The wreck involved nine British merchant vessels and their naval escort, the frigate HMS Convert, that ran aground on the reefs off Grand Cayman. Due to the rescue efforts by the Caymanians using canoes, the loss of life was limited to eight. However, records from the colonial era indicate that Cayman Islands, then a dependency of Jamaica, was not tax-exempt during the period that followed.

40|$|The {{public health}} {{achievement}} of elimination and near elimination of vaccine preventable diseases is currently threatened by state policies enabling children {{the ability to}} opt out of mandated vaccines. All 50 states require children to meet certain immunization requirements as a condition of school enrollment, and 18 currently have legislation that allow exemption for personal or philosophical reasons. Three states allow only medical exemptions. In New Jersey, the school vaccine mandate law allows exemptions when vaccines pose a medical concern or violation of an individual’s religious belief. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the impact of the December 2008 state interpretation of existing policy and subsequent regulation requiring school and public health officials <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> religious <b>exemption</b> <b>to</b> any child with a parent’s note referencing religion. Evidence exists that some vaccine-hesitant parents share boilerplate language to exploit use of the unchallenged religious exemption (RE). Trend analysis using school-reported data on the New Jersey Annual Immunization Status Reports for school years 2005 - 2006 through 2013 - 2014 demonstrated an over five-fold increase in the number of religious exemptions granted by local public and private schools. Multiple regression analyses using six predictor variables were performed using the 2013 - 2014 county religious exemption rates for Kindergarten and First Grade to build a profile of high utilization areas. For Kindergarten, higher RE rates were associated with White and Asian race, high household income, and advanced education (p 3 ̆c. 05). For first grade, living in rural areas was significantly associated with higher RE rates (p 3 ̆c. 01). Recommendations to address vaccine hesitancy are delivered using levels of the ecological model, including the need for further research about parents who fit the predictor profile, tailoring education using social marketing principles and storytelling, policy change and enforcement, publication of school-level vaccine compliance rates, and improved provider support, with the aim to increase immunization coverage levels in the state.

40|$|Prince George's County, MD has {{the second}} highest {{incidence}} of HIV in both the Washington, D. C. metropolitan region {{and the state of}} Maryland. Approximately 14 % of the living cases of HIV/AIDS in Prince George's County in 2009 were attributable to injection drug use. In the 1990 's, Prince George's County was one of only two jurisdictions in the state of Maryland <b>to</b> be <b>granted</b> <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> <b>to</b> the state's drug paraphernalia law to operate a needle exchange program, a harm reduction intervention shown to be effective in lowering incidence rates of HIV in injection drug user populations. However, Prince George's County has yet to implement a needle exchange program to reduce the spread of HIV among injection drug users. This study examined the perceptions of key community stakeholders on what possible barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a needle exchange program exist in Prince George's County. Qualitative, in-depth interviews were conducted with stakeholders from the community sectors of elected officials, law enforcement, public health professionals, drug treatment counselors, neighborhood associations, and religious institutions from two legislative districts within the county. Themes and sub-themes emerged naturally using the Grounded Theory Model of qualitative data analysis. The themes that emerged in connection to barriers and facilitators to needle exchange program implementation included the image of Prince George's County, stigma, needle exchange as a political issue, benefits and harms of needle exchange programs, funding, injection drug use as a declining problem in the county, a need to raise awareness about HIV transmission in injection drug users, and differences between inner-beltway and outer-beltway areas in Prince George's County. Based on analysis of these themes, the barriers and facilitators to needle exchange program implementation in Prince George's County were identified and described, the feasibility of implementation was assessed, and recommendations were developed for local policy makers to aid in the implementation. Overall, barriers outweighed facilitators by more than 3 to 1, and the assessment concluded that implementation of a needle exchange program is unlikely at this time. However, this research sheds light on the history of needle exchange for HIV prevention in Prince George's County, and can be used to inform future research on harm reduction efforts...|$|R
40|$|Military {{training}} {{objectives and}} environmental protection have been at odds for years. One can argue, not unconvincingly, that military training by land, air, or sea is inherently antithetical to environmental protection. The essential goal of the armed forces—to protect the sovereign territories of the United States—requires each uniformed service {{to be ready to}} engage hostile enemies in any locale with destructive impact. The emergence of strong national environmental protection laws presents a fundamental conflict for military leadership. The term “operational encroachment” has been used to encapsulate the description of this often abrasive relationship. Most environmental laws contain provisions to allow for exemptions in the interest of national security, {{but it is difficult to}} state a definitive policy regarding these exemptions because the legal requirements are inconsistent. There is no clear statutory scheme <b>to</b> dictate who <b>grants</b> <b>an</b> <b>exemption,</b> under what circumstances <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> is appropriate, or what the military needs to do to obtain <b>an</b> <b>exemption.</b> To promote efficiency and predictability, and more importantly to clearly define the license of the armed forces in carrying out daily training exercises, Congress should resolve these inconsistencies. By reforming current environmental laws to establish a uniform standard and by creating a new commission to apply that standard, a balance between national security and protecting the environment can be attained. Part II of this Comment analyzes current federal environmental protection laws to illustrate the inconsistent approach to providing national security exemptions. This inconsistent approach underscores the vast potential for litigation. Part III further exposes the potential for litigation by discussing the recent Supreme Court decision in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council. Finally, Part IV proposes several possible solutions for resolving existing inconsistencies and inefficiencies to achieve a proper balance between environmental protection and appropriate levels of military training...|$|R

5000|$|Albany International BV, a Dutch company, {{claimed that}} it should not be bound by a {{collective}} agreement to remain with a collective pension fund, as it alleged it was an [...] "undertaking" [...] that restricted competition. Albany BV was obliged by Dutch law to join a supplementary pension fund for workers within its industrial sector. Albany was in the industry pension (Stichting Bedrijfspensioenfonds Textielindustrie) since 1975. In 1981 it decided the pension was not generous enough. Albany BV entered into an arrangement providing enhanced benefits for its employees with an insurer. In 1989, the basis on which benefits under the compulsory scheme were paid out was improved, making it comparable with Albany’s private arrangement. Albany therefore applied to be exempted from affiliation to the fund. The fund refused Albany’s application and refused to follow the advice of the Insurance Board, requiring it <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>an</b> <b>exemption.</b> The national court adopted the Board’s decision, but stayed proceedings pending a reference to the ECJ on whether the Fund was an undertaking within the meaning of the EC Treaty article 85 (now TFEU article 101), article 86 (now TFEU article 102) and article 90 (now TFEU article 106).
