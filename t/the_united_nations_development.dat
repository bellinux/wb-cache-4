5|$|The large {{magnitude}} of solar energy available {{makes it a}} highly appealing source of electricity. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>Development</b> Programme in its 2000 World Energy Assessment found that the annual potential of solar energy was 1,575–49,837 exajoules (EJ).

5|$|With {{states from}} Africa and Asia joining <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations,</b> <b>development</b> issues became {{increasingly}} important, {{resulting in the}} expansion of the United Nations in the development area, including the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>Development</b> Programme (UNDP) in 1965 and negotiations on an International Economic Order (NIEO) as part of the North-South conflict in the 1970s.

5|$|With {{effect from}} June 12, {{a state of}} public {{emergency}} was declared {{for the whole of}} Tuvalu, by the then Governor-General of Tuvalu, Sir Tulaga Manuella.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Castro embraced environmentalism, campaigning against {{global warming and}} the waste of natural resources, and accusing the U.S. of being the world's primary polluter. In 1994 a {{ministry}} dedicated to the environment was established, and new laws established in 1997 that promoted awareness of environmental issues throughout Cuba and stressed the sustainable use of natural resources. By 2006, Cuba was the world's only nation which met <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>Development</b> Programme's definition of sustainable development, with an ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per capita and a Human Development Index of over 0.8. Castro also became a proponent of the anti-globalization movement, criticizing U.S. global hegemony and the control exerted by multinationals. Castro maintained his devout anti-apartheid beliefs, and at the July 26 celebrations in 1991, he was joined onstage by the South African political activist Nelson Mandela, recently released from prison.
