5|$|As part of {{preparations}} for Operation Downfall, {{the invasion of}} Japan, MacArthur became commander in chief U.S. Army Forces Pacific (AFPAC) in April 1945, assuming command of all Army and Army Air Force units in the Pacific except the Twentieth Air Force. At the same time, Nimitz became commander of all naval forces. Command in the Pacific therefore remained divided. During his planning of the invasion of Japan, MacArthur stressed to the decision-makers in Washington that it was essential <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union enter the war as he argued it was crucial <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Red Army tie down the Kwantung army in Manchuria. The invasion was pre-empted by the surrender of Japan in August 1945. On 2 September MacArthur accepted the formal Japanese surrender aboard the battleship , thus ending hostilities in World War II. In recognition of {{his role as a}} maritime strategist, the U.S. Navy awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Prime Minister Holt {{vanished}} while {{swimming in}} rough seas near Melbourne; his body was never recovered. John McEwen, {{as leader of the}} junior Coalition partner, the Country Party, took over as prime minister for three weeks until the Liberals could elect a new leader. Senator John Gorton won the vote and became prime minister. The leadership campaign was conducted mostly by television, and Gorton appeared <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> visual appeal needed to keep Whitlam out of office. Gorton resigned his seat in the Senate, and in February 1968 won the by-election for Holt's seat of Higgins in Victoria. For the remainder of the year, Gorton appeared <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> better of Whitlam in the House of Representatives. In his chronicle of the Whitlam years, however, speechwriter Graham Freudenberg asserts that Gorton's erratic behaviour, Whitlam's strengthening of his party, and events outside Australia (such as the Vietnam War) ate away at Liberal dominance.|$|E

5|$|Because {{judicial}} decisions {{are subject to}} the sometimes arbitrary assessments of the CCP, citizens who attempt {{to make use of the}} legal system to pursue grievances find that, if their cause is determined <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, they may be suppressed.

5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when {{he first}} met him in the late 1870s, but grew more {{tolerant}} of him with time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized {{with the idea of}} having the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E
