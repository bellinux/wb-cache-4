The fruits contain three large, rounded seeds.|$|R
5000|$|Sorbus californica, the California {{mountain}} ash, is an [...] of Rowans {{native to}} western North America and sometimes cultivated. It has orange-red fruit and leaflets that are <b>toothed</b> almost from <b>base</b> to apex, but {{is said to}} be most often confounded with the western North American species S. occidentalis which has pinkish fruit and leaflets with few teeth.|$|R
5000|$|Leaves alternate, firm, {{heavy and}} toothed, but not <b>toothed</b> at the <b>base.</b> The leaf {{serration}} is more evident and more widely spaced {{than in the}} white hazelwood.

50|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 4 mm and 15 mm. The umbilicate, solid shell has a conical shape. It has a bright rose or carmine color. The {{elevated}} spire is acute. The 5-6, convex whorls are rounded, encircled by alternately larger and smaller closely beaded riblets, numbering 9 on the penultimate, 4 on the next earlier whorl, about 14 on the last whorl, of equal size on its latter portion. The sutures are narrowly canaliculate. The body whorl is rounded. The rounded aperture is finely sulcate inside. The columella is straight, <b>toothed</b> at <b>base,</b> with a narrow, deep square notch between the tooth and the tubercles of the basal lip.|$|R
50|$|Fumaria occidentalis is {{the largest}} {{fumitory}} {{to grow in the}} United Kingdom, with flowers 12 - 14 mm long. Their petals are initially whitish (except the dark pink tips), becoming pink later; the sepals are 4 - 5.5 mm by 2 - 3 mm, and <b>toothed</b> towards the <b>base.</b> Its fruit are also larger than those of the other British species of Fumaria, at up to 3 x 3 mm.|$|R
50|$|The {{height of}} the shell reaches 8 mm. The small, solid, white, very {{minutely}} perforated shell has a globose-conic shape. The spire is short. The four whorls are convex and encircled by strong spiral ribs. The interstices between them are deeply, coarsely pitted by the prominence of strong, regular, longitudinal lamellae, continuous over the spirals. The penultimate and next earlier whorls have 3 spirals (the subsutural one sometimes subobsolete). The outer lip is inserted upon the fourth. On the body whorl near the aperture there are 7, but sometimes more, by reason of the interpolation {{of one or two}} interstitial riblets on the upper surface. Two or three submedian ribs are generally more prominent. The sutures are canaliculate. The aperture is rounded. The columella is slightly concave, rather wide and flat, but not <b>toothed</b> at <b>base.</b> The umbilical perforation is minute.|$|R

50|$|Scorzonera libanotica {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 15 to 80 cm and is covered with fluffy detersile coating. Its erect flower stems are leafy and {{branched}} in the upper part into 3-5 floral heads measuring 2 to 4 cm. The flower heads are supported by a scaly receptacles atop long pedicels. It has glabrous cylindrical involucral bracts that are truncated at the base and slightly constricted at the top. The yellow flowers turn purple-red at the base and are larger than the involucre. It blooms in June and July. The fruit is a white, thick, long and deeply furrowed achene surmounted by a small pappus. S. libanotica leaves are whole, slightly <b>toothed</b> towards the <b>base,</b> oblong or oblong-lanceolate, more or less acute that narrow at the petiole.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} this shell varies between 25 mm and 38 mm. The shell has a {{strictly}} conical shape. It is carinated, imperforate, and thin but rather solid. It is very pale yellowish or pinkish, with irregular, rather pale vertical bands of light yellowish-brown, often broken into maculations, and radiating on the base. The surface is shining, with numerous spiral granose lirae. There are seven lirae on the penultimate whorm, on the antepenultimate, {{and on the}} upper {{surface of the body}} whorl. And sometimes these three whorls (or the last one) show interstitial threads between the granose lirae. The flat base of the shell has 12 or 13 concentric lirae, the several inner ones stronger, decidedly beaded, the 3 or 4 outer more separated, less beaded. The angular periphery is formed of a double beaded ridge, and on some specimens this projects a little at the sutures of the spire. The spire is conic, elevated, with straight lateral outlines. The shell contains nine whorls. The smooth apex is subacute. The two earlier whorls follow the apical are trilirate. The body whorl is angular at periphery, flat beneath, indented in the center around the insertion of the columella. The aperture is rhomboidal, oblique, angled on the outer part, above the angle thickened inside by a heavy callus or pearly suhmarginal deposit. The columella is oblique, arcuate and a trifle <b>toothed</b> at <b>base.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eupatorium sessilifolium is a {{perennial}} herb with stems that are sometimes more than 100 centimeters (40 inches) tall. They are produced from a woody underground caudice or short rhizome. The {{top of the}} stems, where the branching begins to the flower heads, have short hairs, while {{the lower part of}} the stems have no hairs. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs and are <b>toothed.</b> The leaf <b>bases</b> are rounded and the leaves are sessile (lacking stalks), but they do not clasp around the stem. The foliage is dotted with glands. Eupatorium sessilifolium blooms in August and September (July in the southern part of its range), and the small inflorescences are branched and composed of widely spaced, tiny white flower heads in corymbiform (flat topped) arrays. The heads typically have five or six disc florets per head, but no ray florets.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{variable}} in appearance. In general, it is a perennial herb or shrub reaching {{up to about}} 90 centimeters (3 feet) tall. The herbage is gray-green to silvery, and fleshy. It has oval to lance-shaped leaves up to 11 centimeters long. The blades are <b>toothed</b> near the <b>bases,</b> smooth-edged otherwise, and are usually hairy. The leaf base or petiole usually {{has at least one}} spine. The inflorescence is a solitary rounded flower head lined with spine-tipped phyllaries. The head has 15 to 30 short, yellow ray florets. At the center are many yellow disc florets with black anthers. The fruit is a dark-colored, flattened, somewhat triangular cypsela a few millimeters long. As the head dries and the flowers fall away, it becomes a hard, spiny, burr-like body packed with the small fruits. The life span of the plant may exceed five years.|$|R
40|$|Dipteran larval {{morphology}} exhibits overwhelming variety, {{affected by}} their diverse feeding habits and habitat use. In particular, larval mouthpart morphology {{is associated with}} feeding behavior, providing key taxonomic traits. Despite most larval Brachycera being carnivorous, a basal brachyceran family, Rhagionidae, contains bryophyte-feeding taxa with multiple feeding habits. To elucidate the life history, biology, and morphological evolution of the bryophyte-feeding rhagionids, the larval feeding behavior and morphology, and the adult oviposition behavior of four species belonging to three genera of Spaniinae (Spania Meigen, Litoleptis Chillcott and Ptiolina Zetterstedt) are described. Moreover, changes of the larval morphology associated with the evolution of bryophyte-feeding are traced by molecular phylogenetic analyses. Spania and Litoleptis (thallus-miners of thallose liverworts) share a toothed form of apical mandibular sclerite with an orifice on its dorsal surface, which contrasts {{to those of the}} other members of Rhagionidae possessing a blade-like mandibular hook with an adoral groove; whereas, Ptiolina (stem borer of mosses) exhibits a weak groove on the adoral surface of mandible and highly sclerotized maxilla with <b>toothed</b> projections. <b>Based</b> on the larval feeding behavior of the thallus-miners, it is inferred that the toothed mandibles with the dorsal orifice facilitate scraping plant tissue and then imbibing it {{with a great deal of}} the sap. A phylogeny indicated that the bryophyte-feeding genera formed a clade with Spaniopsis and was sister to Symphoromyia, which presumably are detritivores. This study indicates that the loss or reduction of adoral mandibular groove and mandibular brush is coincident with the evolution of bryophyte-feeding, and it is subsequently followed by the occurrence of dorsal mandibular orifice and the loss of creeping welts accompanying the evolution of thallus-mining...|$|R
50|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 25 mm and 34 mm. The imperforate, very thin, nearly smooth shell has a conical shape. It is soiled white with a {{delicate}} tint of sea-green on the last whorl. The surface is slightly shining. The spire is conical, its outlines a trifle concave;. It contains 8 whorls. The dextral apex is subimmersed. The first two whorls are quite convex, the following whorls slightly convex. The sutures are linear. The body whorl has a delicate carina at the otherwise blunt periphery. Above this, parallel with it, there is a narrow raised cord which does not extend above the lower whorl, and will probably be found to be quite inconstant. The whole upper surface of the whorls is traversed by numerous scarcely perceptible spirals. The base of the shell is slightly convex, and has close, unequal spiral striae, coarser near the axis and circumference. The rather large aperture is subquadrate, beautifully iridescent within. The thin outer lip is fragile. The vertical, pearly columella is cylindrical and not <b>toothed</b> at its <b>base.</b>|$|R

The 7½ whorls are slightly convex, with spiral lirae, increasing from 2 on the upper body whorl, to 6 on the penultimate and 7 on the upper surface of the ultimate one. The suture is not deep but distinct, accompanied by {{the upper part of}} a nearly covered spiral. The spirals are closely beset with compressed beads. The upper row of each whorl is slightly the largest. The body whorl is angular, keeled by the last spiral. The base of the shell is nearly flat, with 10 conspicuous, beaded spirals and a few very thin ones near the aperture. Moreover the whole shell is covered with oblique, undulating, slightly laminar, radiating striae, very distinct on the base. The aperture is subquadrate. The outer margin is thin, a little convex, with 5 spiral grooves. The basal margin is convex.

The staminate catkins range from 6 to 10 mm long, are crowded on the branchlet, with the individual flowers overtopped by the broad, shining, subtending, brown bracts. The pistillate catkins range from 7 to 10 mm long, each flower subtended by two wing-like bracts that remain fused to the fruit. The fruit of the sweet gale is a three-pointed, compressed, ovoid nutlet that at maturity is dotted with shining red to yellow resin glands. Illustration source: Britton and Brown 1913 General Description. —Sweet gale is the name used most often to refer to this shrub species. It {{is also known as}} bog myrtle, Dutch myrtle English myrtle, and meadow fern, although this species is neither a true fern nor myrtle. Sweet gale is an aromatic, deciduous, shrub up to 2. 5 m tall. The plant is single or multistemmed, with strongly ascending branches. The twigs are terete, brown with scattered yellow glands. The leaves are 2 to 6 cm long (including the short petiole), oblanceolate (i. e., widest toward apex) with cuneate <b>bases,</b> <b>toothed</b> only toward the apex, glabrous and shining above but usually pubescent on the blade’s underside. Like the twigs, the blades on both sides are often beset with yellow glands. The flowers are in unisexual, unbranched catkins (aments), with the staminate (male) and pistillate (female) catkins appearing on different plants. Individual plants have been known to change sex from year to year Range. —Sweet gale is found in the New and Old World temperate regions. It occurs in th...|$|R
50|$|Previous {{analysis}} of the saber-toothed cats used Linnaean classification based the morphology of the upper canines, which suggested that there were four tribes within the subfamily of Machairodontinae. These tribes include Machairodontini, Homotherini, Smildontini, and Matailurini seen in the cladogram of Machairodontinae. Then upon finding further fossils, Machairodontini {{was assigned to the}} Homotherini tribe. The Homotherini includes species such as Machairodus, (M. aphanistus and M. giganteus). These species are characterized by their scimitar teeth that make up the large upper canines. The Smildontini tribe includes species such as Paramachairodus, Megantereon, and Smilodon. These species have been characterized based on their longer, dagger-like teeth. The other tribe Matailurini includes species such as Matailurus and Dinofelis. These have been classified by having teeth different than the previous two clades, the long serrated teeth and the long, dagger-like teeth. Unfortunately, there are few postcranial skeletons of saber-toothed cats preserved, so available phylogenetic characters are largely cranial.New research published in 2013 took a different approach to elucidating the evolutionary relationships of saber-toothed cats. This approach used cladistic phylogeny instead of the previous Linnaean classification. The results concluded the original four tribes could not be recovered by parsimony analysis because many of the synapomorphies of the saber <b>toothed</b> cats are <b>based</b> on other bones that the prominent, upper canines.Workers now regocnize a clade for true saber toothed cats called Eumachairodontia that includes species from all of the previously proposed tribes: Megantereon, Smilodon, Amphimachairodus, Homotherium and Xenosmilus. The synapomorphy for the “true saber-toothed” clade Eumachairodontia is the hypertrophied, greatly flattened upper canines. The true machairodontines have a synapomorphy of flattened, small, lower canines and other bone variations such as the small upper first molar compared to basal, pre-saber toothed cats large, transversely situated upper first molar and large upper third premolar parastyle.|$|R
5000|$|The leaves {{typically}} measure 6 to 8 mm in length, {{but may be}} up to 12 mm long. When dry {{they are}} erect, but when moist they are sinuous with recurved tips and are generally spreading to broadly recurved, or sharply recurved from the base. The leaf sheath is oblong to elliptic in outline, forming an involute (i.e. with inward rolling margins) tube and clasping the stem. This sheath is typically golden yellow and shiny, and it is abruptly contracted to the narrowly lanceolate blade. Using a microscope, the marginal lamina {{can be seen to}} be level or erect, narrow, and typically 2 to 3 cells wide, though sometimes as many as 7 cells wide. It is <b>toothed</b> from the <b>base</b> of the blade up to the apex, with the teeth being unicellular and embedded in the margin. The costa, or central stalk of the leaf, is toothed on the underside near the apex, and is excurrent, meaning it extends beyond the end of the apex, ending in a short, rough awn. The lamellae, ridges of cells that run along the leaf surface, are crenulate (i.e. with small rounded teeth) in profile and are 5 to 9 cells high. Their margins are distinctly grooved with 2 rows of paired, projecting knobs. The marginal cells, when observed in section, may be narrow, but are more typically enlarged and wider than those beneath. They are retuse (i.e. with a rounded apex with a central shallow notch) to deeply notched, and in rare cases are divided by a vertical partition. These cells are smooth and brownish in colour and have relatively thick cell walls. The sheath cells measure 60 to 90 µm long by 10 to 13 µm wide. These cells may be elongated rectangles or strongly linear structures up to 20 times long as wide. They become narrower toward the margins. Marginal lamina cells are 10 to 15 µm wide and are subquadrate (i.e. nearly square). [...] The plants are sexually dioicous. The leaves of the perichaetium have a long sheath with a scarious (i.e. membranous) margin, while the blades themselves are greatly reduced, gradually narrowing to a finely acuminate tip. These blades have toothed margins, are denticulate to subentire in outline, roughened to almost smooth, and have a costa that is excurrent. The seta, or capsule stalk, is 5 to 9 cm long, and is stout and yellowish to reddish brown in colour. The capsule is 3 to 6 mm long, slightly rectangular to cubic in shape, and brown to dark reddish brown in colour. It is sharply 4 winged, inclined to horizontal, and glaucous when fresh. The peristome measures 250 µm, is pale in colour and has 64 teeth. The calyptra is golden yellow to brownish and completely envelops the capsule. The spores measure 5 to 8 µm, but may be up to 12 µm.|$|R
