40|$|AbstractLet G be a 2 -connected graph {{in which}} the degree of every vertex is at least d. We prove that <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> length at least d + 1 {{generate}} <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> space <b>of</b> G, unless G ≌ Kd+ 1 and d is odd. As a corollary, we deduce that <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> length at least d + 1 generate <b>the</b> subspace <b>of</b> even <b>cycles</b> in G. We also establish <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> odd <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> length at least d + 1 in the case when G is not bipartite. A second result states: if G is 2 -connected with chromatic number at least k, then <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> length at least k generate <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> space <b>of</b> G, unless G ≌ Kk and k is even. Similar corollaries follow, among them a stronger version of a theorem of Erdös and Hajnal...|$|R

5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure of matter began to form from minute {{variations in the}} mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars.

5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} also {{occurs in}} conditions involving systemic immuno-dysregulation, e.g. cyclic neutropenia and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} infection. In cyclic neutropenia, more severe oral ulceration occurs during periods of severe immuno-dysregulation, and resolution of the underlying neutropenia prevents <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> ulceration. The relative increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells, caused by a reduction in numbers of CD4+ T cells may be implicated in RAS-type ulceration in HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier {{reduces the}} {{individuality}} of the characters, enhancing {{the notion of}} humanity, keeping {{in line with the}} theme of history as a repetition of patterns regardless of who is in power. The simultaneous presence of fact and fiction and <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> reversal of fortunes presents characters as functional variants of each other. Through frequent use of metonymy, whereby a part replaces a whole, for example, referring to soldiers as uniformes (uniforms), Carpentier shifts the focus from individuals to the collective.|$|E
5|$|Even though peasant {{households}} {{were significantly}} smaller than aristocratic ones, the wealthiest of these would also employ servants.

This way they would learn the skills needed later in life, {{and at the same time}} earn a wage. This was particularly useful for girls, who could put the earnings towards their dowry.|$|E

Ledyard Stebbins was in the latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas, usually {{at the hands of}} narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. His ability to read quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were the hallmarks of his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master of the review essay or synthetic thought piece.|$|E

5|$|Substance Dualism is {{a common}} feature of several {{orthodox}} Hindu schools including the Sāṅkhya, Nyāya, Yoga and Dvaita Vedanta. In these schools a clear difference is drawn between matter and a non-material soul, which is eternal and undergoes samsara, a cycle of death and rebirth. The Nyāya school argued that qualities such as cognition and desire are inherent qualities which are not possessed by anything solely material, and therefore by process of elimination must belong to a non-material self, the atman. Many of these schools see their spiritual goal as moksha, liberation from <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> reincarnation.|$|E

5|$|The {{scholars}} Pratapaditya Pal, {{an expert}} on South Asian art and H. Bhattacharya, author of Hinduder Debdebi {{on the subject of}} Hindu deities, equate Chhinnamasta with the concepts of sacrifice and the renewal of creation. Chhinnamasta sacrifices herself, and her blood– drunk by her attendants– nourishes the universe. One invocation to her calls her the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and the recipient of the sacrifice, with the severed head treated as an offering. This paradox signifies the entire sacrificial process, and thus <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> creation, dissolution, and re-creation.|$|E

One theory states that there was not an organised Sri Lankan Tamil people presence in Sri Lanka until the invasions from what is now South India in the 12th century AD; another theory contends that Tamil people were one of the original inhabitants of the island.
