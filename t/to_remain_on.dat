5|$|At a four-way {{stop with}} {{channelized}} right turn lanes, drivers must turn <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> the highway. To {{the south is}} Renfrew County Road 40, which continues to Highway17 {{at the southern end}} of the Pembroke Bypass. Highway 148 continues east, crossing the Ottawa Valley Railway and the entrance to Hazley Bay before entering the community of Cotnam Island. The highway curves northeast and crosses the Ottawa River, entering Quebec midspan.|$|E
5|$|Between Atherley and Tiverton, Highway21 travels straight-as-an-arrow along {{what was}} {{originally}} a rural concession road through the hamlets of Reid's Corners, Pine River, Huron Ridge and Slade.

Within Tiverton, which {{acts as the}} primary town serving Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, traffic must turn <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> Highway21. As it exits southeast from the town, the highway makes a broad curve to the northeast and continues through the hamlets of Underwood and North Bruce.|$|E

5|$|For the 1967 NFL season, the NFL {{expanded}} to 16 teams, and split its two conferences into two divisions each, with four teams in each division. The four division champions would {{advance to the}} NFL playoffs, and <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> schedule, a tie-breaker system was introduced. The first round of playoffs determined the conference's champion and its representative in the NFL Championship Game, played the following week. Thus, 1967 was the first season there was a scheduled playoff tournament to determine the teams {{to play for the}} NFL Championship.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E

Between Buckhorn and Burleigh Falls, the highway serves the cottages that line the northern shore of Lower Buckhorn Lake.|$|E
5|$|The offside {{rule was}} {{introduced}} to Sheffield Rules in 1863. Their version only required {{one member of the}} opposition between a player and the opposing goal <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> side. Despite this the rule was only used sporadically in actual play. The FA version, which required a player to remain behind the ball at all times, was introduced during the 1865–66 season but was disliked {{due to the lack of}} goal scoring opportunities it caused. The one man offside was finally used a regular basis from 1867 until the adoption of FA rules in 1877.|$|E

Most ex-slaves viewed Dessalines' rule as more of the same oppression they had known during de jure slavery. Dessalines was killed by a mob of his own officers in 1806.|$|R

5|$|While {{residents}} {{along the}} NY63 corridor {{are against the}} increased truck traffic along the corridor (spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement), most of those same residents, along with other groups, also fought the proposed expressway.

5|$|While some {{ships and}} units such as No 49 Squadron {{returned}} to the UK, most personnel had <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> Christmas Island. The Minister of Supply gave assurances that no personnel would have <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> the island {{for more than a}} year unless absolutely necessary, in which case home leave would be given. To maintain morale, units were given periodic briefings on the importance of their work. Junior officers took a keen interest in the welfare of the men and their families at home, since they were not permitted to bring them to the island. An efficient mail system was maintained to allow them to keep in contact. The quality of Army rations was better than at any other British base. The men were given one day a week off work, and sports such as soccer, cricket, tennis, volleyball sailing, fishing and water skiing were organised. Leave was provided that could be taken in Fiji, Hawaii or the Gilbert Islands. To relieve the monotony, some Army personnel ashore exchanged places with some Navy personnel afloat. A Christmas Island Broadcasting Service was established with nightly radio programs.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> the ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If {{the location of the}} bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E

5|$|Alexios {{deployed}} his smaller army {{in waiting}} near Bryennios's camp, and divided {{it in two}} commands. The left, which confronted Bryennios's strongest division, was commanded by himself and contained the Frankish knights {{to the right and}} the Immortals to the Franks' left. The right command was under Constantine Katakalon, and comprised the Chomatenoi and the Turks. The latter, according to the Alexiad, were given the role of flank guard (plagiophylakes) and tasked with observing and countering the Pechenegs. Conversely, on the extreme left Alexios formed his own flanking detachment (apparently drawn from among the Immortals), concealed from enemy view inside a hollow. Given his inferiority, Alexios was forced <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> the defensive. His only chance at success was that his out-flankers, concealed by the broken terrain, would surprise and create enough confusion among Bryennios's men for him and his strong left wing to break through their lines.|$|E
5|$|As at Orsogna, the 18th Armoured Regiment {{was to play}} a {{supporting}} role in the forthcoming attack on Cassino, with the infantry of the 5th and 6th Brigades bearing {{the brunt of the}} battle. When the attack began on 15 March, the regiment was initially held as a reserve, ready to exploit any breakthrough by the infantry but this did not eventuate. The infantry struggled to make progress in the face of determined resistance. The regiment's tanks were first used at Cassino as artillery support for two weeks, each squadron being rotated in three-day stints to a position overlooking the town. Then in mid-April, one squadron was detached <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> the Cassino front while the other two squadrons were withdrawn for training. The regiment remained fragmented into May, for once training was completed, another squadron was detached and sent into Cassino itself to man tanks which had been effectively set up as pillboxes.|$|E
5|$|At 2045 hrs, {{another person}} on {{duty in the}} control tower {{received}} a call to track the mysterious craft on radar. For the next 40 minutes, it was observed circling around the weapons storage area, when it suddenly vanished, {{as though it had}} landed or dropped below the radar. Witnesses later observed it flying away towards Grand Falls, New Brunswick, twelve miles to the east. Messages were sent to the National Military Command Center, the Air Force Chief of Staff, and Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base. The base continued <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> a high state of alert until the following morning, as efforts to identify the unidentified aircraft through the Maine State Police, local police departments, and the Houlton Federal Aviation Administration office remained elusive.|$|E
