500|$|The English aristocratic Spencer {{family has}} resided at their ancestral home at Althorp, Northamptonshire, {{since the early}} 16th century. The Estate now covers [...] in Northamptonshire, Warwickshire and Norfolk. From pre-Tudor times the Spencers had been farmers, coming to {{prominence}} in Warwickshire in the 15th century when John Spencer became feoffee of Wormleighton in 1469, and a tenant at Althorp in 1486. His nephew, another John, used the gains from <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> and commodities to buy both properties. He was knighted in 1504 and died in 1522. John's descendants expanded the family holdings through business dealings and marriage into the peerage. The family is related through marriage to the Churchills of Blenheim Palace, a line that included the Dukes of Marlborough and Winston Churchill. From the Althorp line came the Earls of Sunderland, the later Dukes of Marlborough, and the Earls Spencer. The family captured international attention when Lady Diana Frances Spencer married Prince Charles on 29 July 1981, and her death {{in a car crash}} in Paris on 31 August 1997.|$|E

30|$|Third, {{complementarity}} to pastoral {{livestock production}} appears to significantly influence household choice regarding whether {{to participate in}} non-livestock income activities. The result of this study reveals that the diversification of incomes complementary to pastoral <b>livestock</b> production <b>in</b> pastoral settlements is occurring on two fronts: (1) diversification {{in the form of}} <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> (influenced by the development of markets for humanitarian de-stocking programmes) and (2) diversification in the form of <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> products to respond to opportunities arising from expanding urban environments and market centres. Under this system, diversification into “easy income” non-livestock activities is not only supported through livestock assets but also pursued to enhance complementarities with livestock production. This finding may imply that income diversification - as opposed to exiting out of the pastoral livelihood - is attractive and that those engaged in it are mainly incentivized by opportunities within the livestock economy itself, which is enhanced by the growing populations in pastoral settlements. In this case, one may argue that income diversification in pastoral settlements is practiced more as a risk management strategy than a wealth accumulation strategy.|$|R

5000|$|The medieval marketplace, perhaps {{laid out}} in 1276, {{occupied}} the triangle of land now defined by the High Street, Surrey Street, and Crown Hill. To {{take advantage of the}} slope of the ground, it seems that the higher and well-drained east side came to be used for corn-trading, and the lower-lying west side (Butcher Row, now Surrey Street) for <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>livestock,</b> meat, and hides. By the later Middle Ages, however, the open marketplace was becoming infilled with buildings. A building on the east side was bought for use as a market house (mainly for corn-trading) in 1566, and was succeeded by another cornmarket nearby in 1609. The older market house was probably taken over as a general provisions market, and was rebuilt for that purpose (as the so-called Butter Market) in 1708. It continued to be used until 1874.|$|R
50|$|The fair {{traditionally}} {{provided a}} forum for <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> and other business activities and has since become a regular social festival for the community and large numbers of visitors drawn from the wider locality.

The fair today attracts market traders {{from all over the}} UK whose stalls line Abbey Bridge and stretch along the length of Plymouth Road, interspersed with smaller fairground rides. Visitors to the fair will be keen to spot the year's most prominent 'must have' fad gadget or toy craze adorning the stalls; folding scooters, laser pens, yo-yos and tamagotchis have all had their respective years of dominance. As well as the usual abundance of doughnut, hot dog, onion and candyfloss smells, representative food from the fair might include a roast pork roll washed down with a glass of warmed spiced cider.|$|R

50|$|John Spencer {{first made}} a living by <b>trading</b> <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> and other {{commodities}} and eventually saved enough money to purchase both the Wormleighton and Althorp lands. Wormleighton was bought in 1506, the manor house was completed in 1512. In 1508, John Spencer also purchased the estate of Althorp with its moated house and several hundred acres of farmland. He had grazed sheep here from the 1480s. Impressed {{by the quality of}} the land, he eventually bought it and rebuilt the house in 1508. At that time, his estate and mansion in Warwickshire were considerably larger, the house in Wormleighton was four times the size of Althorp. In 1511 he made further purchases to acquire much of the surrounding countryside, including the villages of Little Brington and Great Brington as well their parish church of St Mary the Virgin, from Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset. By putting down roots at Althorp, Sir John provided what was to become a home for the next 19 generations.|$|R
50|$|Wormleighton manor is a {{fine example}} of the Tudor {{architecture}} that appeared during the reign of Henry VIII. The wealthy Spencer family, who built their fortune on the production of wool in Warwickshire in the 15th century, first became linked to Wormleighton in 1469, when John Spencer became feoffee (feudal lord) and a tenant at Althorp in 1486. John Spencer's nephew, John, <b>traded</b> <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> and other commodities and saved enough money to purchase both the Wormleighton and Althorp lands outright. Wormleighton was bought in 1506, the manor house was completed in 1512. As the family wealth grew dramatically, John Spencer purchased the land at Althorp between 1509 and 1511 and constructed another residence there. In 1613, the gatehouse at the entrance of Wormleighton Manor was added by Sir Robert, first Lord Spencer, and he or his son are believed to have made alterations or enlargements also to the main building. The Spencer library accumulated at the manor to form a substantial collection which is now housed in London.|$|R
40|$|Cointegration of Canadian and US {{livestock}} prices {{points to}} the existence of market integration in the period January 1996 to December 2004. Trade flows of livestock and beef products were nonexistent between Canada and the United States for many months in 2003 and 2004 suggesting market segmentation. This lack of <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> beef and <b>livestock</b> was due to livestock/beef import bans by both countries due to bovine spongiform encephalopathy. It was also determined that Canada's <b>trade</b> dependence <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> and beef is cointegrated with Canadian and US livestock prices. However, as the trade dependence variable is shocked, the effects on Canadian and US prices are opposite although one would expect that in an integrated market the price responses to an exogenous shock would be similar or statistically identical. This result reinforces the case against the use of price cointegration analysis in determining presence (or absence) of market integration. Empirical results in this article raise some very difficult questions. Gains from trade are well documented. Yet, once a country becomes very trade dependent, the prices in it become much more vulnerable to exogenous shocks that reduce the trade flows. ...|$|R
50|$|Even if {{the goods}} are not {{perceived}} to be undesirable, states will still seek to document and regulate the cross-border trade in order to collect tariffs and benefit from foreign currency exchange revenues. Thus, there is the concept unofficial trade in goods otherwise legal; for example, the cross-border <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> by pastoralists in the Horn of Africa.

50|$|Manorhamilton {{railway station}} opened on 1 December 1880 and formed {{part of the}} Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway (SLNCR). All {{maintenance}} on the line's engines and rolling stock was carried out at the station works and the railway became a major employer locally. The administrative headquarters of the SLNCR was located in the nearby village of Lurganboy. The railway served as a major business and tourism artery to the area and developed a large <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> exports. The development of the modern roads system in Ireland led to the decline of railway usage and the consolidation of railways nationwide. The SLNCR, and with it Manorhamilton Station, finally closed on 1 October 1957.|$|E

This silk was exported {{as far as the}} Ottoman capital Istanbul. In addition to weaving industries, there were olive oil presses and water mills for wheat and sesame, while grapes and rice, grown in the surrounding marshlands from the 16th century, were found in abundance in the city's markets. Moreover, the markets of Homs were the center of a <b>trade</b> <b>in</b> <b>livestock,</b> where flocks of sheep and goats coming from Aleppo met camels and cattle moving north from Damascus.|$|E
