5|$|Beveridge {{cautioned that}} because the anime was {{designed}} around the non-linear format of the manga, its transitions might at first be <b>troublesome</b> for the viewer, but by the final volume finds the anime in all its aspects far superior.|$|E
5|$|Brown's tour of Vietnam {{ended in}} September 1970, {{and he became}} Commander, Air Force Systems Command, with {{headquarters}} at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. This job involved handling a number of <b>troublesome</b> projects, including the F-111.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the fly-off, the gun turrets proved <b>troublesome,</b> their drive motors proving to be underpowered, and issues with wind blast through the gun slots were also encountered. As a result of these problems, the XB-21's nose turret was faired over, while the dorsal turret was removed.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to find P. fimbriata in the wild, as its shape and movements are well disguised. The Queensland variety is quite easy to raise, while the Northern Territory variety is quite <b>troublesome</b> to maintain.|$|E
5|$|With the {{assistance}} of his apprentices Bewick brought out the second volume, Water Birds, in 1804, as the sole author. He found the task of managing the printers continually <b>troublesome,</b> but the book met with as much success as the first volume.|$|E
5|$|American {{black bears}} were a common {{attraction}} by the 1930s, but in 1929 alone 81people required treatment for bear-related injuries. <b>Troublesome</b> bears were marked with white paint before being relocated {{to other parts}} of the park, and repeat offenders were killed. Bear feeding shows were stopped in 1940, but the Park Service continued to kill bears that habitually raided camps; 200 were put down between 1960 and 1972. Park visitors are now educated about proper food storage.|$|E
5|$|As the two grew older, {{the letters}} became fewer and farther between. There {{was also a}} great deal that they kept to themselves. Jefferson said nothing about his {{construction}} of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams did not mention the <b>troublesome</b> behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park {{operates}} year-round. Camping is {{most practical}} in winter months, when mosquitoes are less <b>troublesome</b> on the keys. Private concessioners provide full day tours {{in the park}} that include snorkeling, hiking, paddling and sailing from the park headquarters. Boat excursions to Boca Chita and Adams Key are also available.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Devil May Cry 4 was positive, with praise aimed towards its challenging {{difficulty and}} the characters' special moves. However, {{it was also}} criticized for its backtracking and a <b>troublesome</b> camera. The game sold over 3 million units worldwide, becoming the series' best-selling title. It has also been adapted into a two-volume light novel by its original writer, Bingo Morihashi.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Victoria College {{expelled}} Edward, who {{had proved}} a <b>troublesome</b> boy, despite being {{a student of}} great intelligence and much academic achievement; he then attended Northfield Mount Hermon School, Massachusetts, a socially élite, college-prep boarding-school where he lived a difficult year of social alienation. Nonetheless, the student Edward excelled, and achieved the rank of either first (valedictorian) or second (salutatorian) {{in a class of}} one hundred sixty students.|$|E
5|$|Inari's kitsune are white, a {{color of}} good omen. They possess {{the power to}} ward off evil, and they {{sometimes}} serve as guardian spirits. In addition to protecting Inari shrines, they are petitioned to intervene {{on behalf of the}} locals and particularly to aid against <b>troublesome</b> nogitsune, those spirit foxes who do not serve Inari. Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens.|$|E
5|$|The BT46 {{appeared}} for {{the last}} time in the Formula One World Championship at {{the first round of the}} 1979 season in the hands of Nelson Piquet. Niki Lauda also used the car to qualify for that race, as the new BT48 was proving <b>troublesome,</b> although he did race the new car. Piquet retired on the first lap after a multi-car collision that wrecked the BT46.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's death, Emma Smith {{quickly became}} alienated from Brigham Young {{and the church}} leadership. Young, whom Emma feared and despised, was {{suspicious}} of her desire to preserve the family's assets from inclusion {{with those of the}} church, and thought she would be even more <b>troublesome</b> because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III. Emma never denied Smith's prophetic gift or repudiated her belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Wheldon had been working with IndyCar {{officials}} to develop the ICONIC chassis with the intention of improving safety in the sport. Planned changes to the chassis include larger cockpits for driver protection and bodywork over the rear wheels to prevent cars from launching off one another {{in the event of a}} collision, long a problem in open-wheel racing, regardless of oval or road course, but <b>troublesome</b> on high-speed ovals and tight street circuits with a long straight and a tight turn, similar to the style of many modern road courses.|$|E
5|$|David {{made several}} visits to California, which she much enjoyed, but her health began to fail. Because her legs had been <b>troublesome</b> for some time, she {{suffered}} {{a succession of}} falls which resulted in several spells in hospital. She became increasingly reclusive but, despite spending periods in bed at home, she continued to work on Ice and Ices. She realised {{that she would not}} be able to finish the work, and asked Norman to complete it for her. It was published in 1994, under the title Harvest of the Cold Months.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} through late 2002, with targeted release dates of December in Japan and early 2003 in North America. During the final stages, two planned dungeons that fell behind schedule were cut {{and replaced with}} a quest to recover Triforce pieces around the Great Sea. Elements of these dungeons were recycled for later Zelda games. On October 15, 2002, Nintendo revealed the game's official Japanese subtitle, Kaze no Takuto (Wind Baton), to emphasize the role of wind in the game. The company announced the official English version, The Wind Waker, on December 2, 2002. In {{the gap between the}} Japanese and North American releases, the designers reworked some <b>troublesome</b> segments, notably shortening the lengthy Triforce quest.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the flyoff competition, the XSO2U-1 {{was used}} as a general utility {{aircraft}} and hack by the Navy, before being supplied to the Ranger Engine Corporation in July 1942 for use in tests of the V-770 engine. These tests were intended to assist in debugging the engine for the Bell XP-77 lightweight fighter and Edo XOSE floatplane, but the V-770 remained <b>troublesome,</b> and after two years of testing the XSO2U was returned to the Navy. Having no further use for the aircraft, the XSO2U-1 was removed from the Navy's rolls on 6 July 1944, being subsequently scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality, which has been {{compared with that of}} the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting <b>troublesome</b> political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.|$|E
5|$|However, {{attempting}} to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations, the photoelectric effect, and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe, proved <b>troublesome.</b> Through {{the work of}} leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons. In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{reassessment}} of James {{in the past}} two decades, as an able ruler who extended royal power in Scotland and preserved his kingdoms from war throughout his reign, has been accompanied by a re-evaluation of Anne as an influential political figure and assertive mother, at least {{for as long as the}} royal marriage remained a reality. John Leeds Barroll argues in his cultural biography of Anne that her political interventions in Scotland were more significant, and certainly more <b>troublesome,</b> than previously noticed; and Clare McManus, among other cultural historians, has highlighted Anne's influential role in the Jacobean cultural flowering, not only as a patron of writers and artists but as a performer herself.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the B began {{a project}} to raise the tracks of the New Hampshire Main and the {{southern}} end of the Woburn Branch for a mile through Winchester, eliminating a <b>troublesome</b> grade crossing downtown. Boxy two-story brick stations opened at Wedgemere and Winchester Center in 1957. The ticket office in the new station was closed in 1960 after just three years in service; thereafter, passengers bought tickets on the train. The station building hosted a coffee shop from 2008 to 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 the March {{team was}} sold, and {{became known as}} Leyton House. Gugelmin was once again partnered by Capelli, but the team's CG901 chassis proved <b>troublesome</b> and between them they failed to qualify six times, {{including}} at the Mexican Grand Prix. However, at the next race, the French Grand Prix, modifications {{had been made to}} the car which improved the performance. Running the whole race without changing their tyres, Capelli and Gugelmin ran first and second during the race. Gugelmin retired mid-race with engine problems and Capelli was passed by Alain Prost for the lead late in the race. Gugelmin also scored a point for finishing sixth in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, first-generation {{symmetric}} multiprocessing (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, {{referred to as}} SMP1. These clients used Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as {{at that time the}} GROMACS cores were not designed to be used with multiple threads. This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI. Although the clients performed well in Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were <b>troublesome</b> under Windows. On January24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable thread-based implementation.|$|E
5|$|In {{external}} relations, Báthory sought peace through strong alliances. Though Báthory remained {{distrustful of}} the Habsburgs, he maintained {{the tradition of}} good relations that the Commonwealth had with its Western neighbor and confirmed past treaties between the Commonwealth and Holy Roman Empire with diplomatic missions received by Maximilian's successor, Rudolf II. The <b>troublesome</b> south-eastern border with the Ottoman Empire was temporarily quelled by truces signed in July 1577 and April 1579. The Sejm of January 1578 gathered in Warsaw was persuaded to grant Báthory subsidies for the inevitable war against Muscovy.|$|E
5|$|Kaiser and Deutschland {{were placed}} in reserve after the 1878 {{maneuvers}} were cancelled and remained there for a decade, {{with the exception of}} the 1883 maneuvers. During the maneuvers, both ships' steam engines proved <b>troublesome,</b> and indeed forced a temporary halt to the training exercises when they simultaneously broke down. The two ships were reactivated in 1889 to participate in cruises following the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II. These included a state visit to Great Britain in August 1889 and a tour of the Mediterranean in the winter of 1889–1890.|$|E
5|$|Opinions were {{generally}} favorable towards FreeSpace 2s multiplayer implementation. SquadWar received favorable {{responses from the}} reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a <b>troublesome</b> process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all. Other reviewers' experiences with lag were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said lag became more apparent on a dial-up connection during a multiplayer mission with four or more players. FiringSquad's reviewer's experience was similar {{but he said the}} lag was not enough to hinder his enjoyment of the multiplayer action.|$|E
5|$|Said {{disliked the}} Oslo Accords for not {{producing}} an independent State of Palestine, {{and because they}} were politically inferior to a plan that Yasir Arafat had rejected—a plan Said had presented to Arafat {{on behalf of the}} U.S. government in the late 1970s. Especially <b>troublesome</b> to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.|$|E
5|$|She {{starts a}} {{relationship}} with <b>troublesome</b> Trey. He films them having sex, which is later leaked at the town's movie festival. She has a brief relationship with Liam. After the death of good friend Belle, Nicole goes on a downward spiral. She starts partying and binge drinking along with Indigo. Geoff notices her behaviour and attempts to help her. After pushing him away she sleeps with drug addict Liam. She then pursues older man Sid. She kisses him and Indigo sees them, which ruins their friendship. She later moves in with Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart) who agrees to look after her.|$|E
5|$|The Konjaku Monogatarishū, a {{collection}} of stories published in the late Heian period, contains {{some of the earliest}} tales of tengu, already characterized as they would be for centuries to come. These tengu are the <b>troublesome</b> opponents of Buddhism, who mislead the pious with false images of the Buddha, carry off monks and drop them in remote places, possess women in an attempt to seduce holy men, rob temples, and endow those who worship them with unholy power. They often disguise themselves as priests or nuns, but their true form seems to be that of a kite.|$|E
5|$|The Martin AM Mauler (originally XBTM) was a single-seat {{shipboard}} attack aircraft {{built for}} the United States Navy. Designed during World War II, the Mauler encountered development delays and did not enter service until 1948 in small numbers. The aircraft proved <b>troublesome</b> and remained in frontline service only until 1950, when the Navy switched to the smaller and simpler Douglas AD Skyraider. Maulers remained in reserve squadrons until 1953. A few were built as AM-1Q electronic-warfare aircraft with an additional crewman in the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The Platt-LePage XR-1, {{also known}} by the company {{designation}} PL-3, was an early American twin-rotor helicopter, built by the Platt-LePage Aircraft Company of Eddystone, Pennsylvania. The winner of a United States Army Air Corps design competition held in early 1940, the XR-1 was the first helicopter tested by the USAAF, flying in 1941. The flight testing of the XR-1 proved <b>troublesome,</b> and although continued testing showed that the design had promise, other, improved helicopters were becoming available before the XR-1 was ready for service. As a result, {{the development of the}} aircraft was terminated in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a {{supersonic}} interceptor aircraft. During the time, {{there was much}} skepticism about operating supersonic aircraft from carrier decks. So {{in order to address}} this issue, U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, since many supersonic designs of the time required long takeoff rolls, had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to control—all factors that were <b>troublesome</b> on a carrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} based on “a couple of incidents” that the writers had heard about in which <b>troublesome</b> children, through {{alternative}} sentencing, were tethered to their parents. The scene in which Homer and Marge get spanked by Springfield's citizens {{as part of their}} punishment was also based on an alternative sentencing, in which the sentenced had to wear certain shirts or signs that indicated whether they, for example, had not paid taxes. The scene in which Bart accidentally drives away with Chief Wiggum's police car {{was based on}} one of Scully's friends in high school, who stole a still running police car parked at a Dunkin' Donuts while the police were in the store.|$|E
5|$|The inverse {{square root}} of a {{floating}} point number {{is used in}} calculating a normalized vector. Programs can use normalized vectors to determine angles of incidence and reflection. 3D graphics programs must perform millions of these calculations every second to simulate lighting. When the code {{was developed in the}} early 1990s, most floating-point processing power lagged behind the speed of integer processing. This was <b>troublesome</b> for 3D graphics programs before the advent of specialized hardware to handle transform and lighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} sometime between the Dissolution and the Union of the Crowns but the exact date is not known. It was probably constructed {{as a strong}} room to store munitions or provide a secure location if the city walls were breached. This turned the ground floor room into a lock up where <b>troublesome</b> citizens would be thrown until they came before the law to be punished. Much about the tower has changed. The wall {{to the right of}} the door is 13th-century, while the dividing wall including the door is 18th-century.|$|E
