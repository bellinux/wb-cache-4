In July the Youth of <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> Party dissolved itself in protest of the events; however, a new, loyal organization immediately surfaced.

5|$|In the 2001 {{parliamentary}} election the party lost the gains {{it had made}} according to opinion polling but maintained its position from the 1997 election, it got 14.6% and 26 members in the parliament. The election result allowed them to unseat the Labour Party government of Jens Stoltenberg {{and replace it with}} a three-party coalition led by Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik. However, the coalition continued to decline to govern together with <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> Party as they considered the political differences too large. <b>The</b> <b>Progress</b> Party eventually decided to tolerate the coalition, as it promised to invest more in defence, open more private hospitals and open for more competition in the public sector. In 2002 <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> Party again advanced in the opinion polls and for a while became the largest party.|$|E
40|$|Although Queen Elizabeth I of England made summer {{journeys}} or progresses {{almost every}} year from 1559 to 1602 very {{little attention has been}} focused on them and on the reasons for or the results of these trips. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold: (1) to describe <b>the</b> summer <b>progresses</b> and (2) to arrive at some conclusions as to the significance of <b>the</b> <b>progresses.</b> <b>The</b> principal source of this paper is the three volume Nichols? collection of original documents concerning <b>the</b> <b>progresses.</b> These documents were collected from widely varying sources and published in 1823 by a printer named John Nichols. This material, either in the Nichols? collection or in the original, is the only source of information on <b>the</b> <b>progresses.</b> Every secondary work examined by the author of this paper used one of these sources for his information about <b>the</b> <b>progresses.</b> <b>The</b> main significance of <b>the</b> <b>progresses</b> was to allow the crown to keep in personal touch with the provincial officials and with the general public. Both the people and the officials were appreciative of this royal attention and it contributed to the favorable public opinion which Elizabeth enjoyed during her entire reign. The public exposure which <b>the</b> <b>progresses</b> gave to Elizabeth created a bond between the Queen and her subjects which enabled her to govern with a freer hand than she would have been able to do otherwise. Of secondary importance these journeys allowed the Queen a chance to relax somewhat from the formality of the court and to enjoy some of the sporting entertainments such as hunting which were impossible to do in London...|$|R

5|$|Since early 2010, {{opinion polls}} {{regularly}} showed a majority support for <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> Party and Conservative Party together. <b>The</b> <b>Progress</b> Party however saw a strong setback for the 2011 local elections.

According to political scientists, {{most of the}} setback {{could be explained by}} a low turnout of Progress Party supporters.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Progress</b> Party has {{historically}} sometimes been portrayed externally as a populist or right-wing populist party (or other similar terms), both by opposing politicians, {{as well as}} some scholars. Depending on definitions of populism, other scholars have however found that populism is at best a minor element of the party, or that its policies historically have been more consistent than for instance those of the Labour Party, which has moved more towards <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> Party and neoliberalism since the 1980s. Political scientist Anders Todal Jensen has argued that <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> Party is the only populist party in Norway, with all the other parties in contrast having strong elitist foundations. He has suggested that populism could actually be a sign of health as the structures of the traditional parties make them poorly able to “listen to the people” in the same manner that <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> Party may.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{a seminal}} paper, Lin and Reiter {{introduced}} a model-theoretic definition for {{the progression of}} a basic action theory in the situation calculus, and proved that it implies the intended properties. They also showed that this definition comes with a strong negative result, namely that for certain cases first-order logic is not expressive enough to correctly characterize <b>the</b> <b>progressed</b> theory and second-order axioms are necessary. However, they also considered an alternative simpler definition according to which <b>the</b> <b>progressed</b> theory is always first-order definable. They conjectured that this alternative definition is incorrect {{in the sense that}} <b>the</b> <b>progressed</b> theory is too weak and may sometimes lose information. This conjecture and the status of the definability of progression in first-order logic has remained open since. In this paper we present two significant results about this alternative definition of progression. First, we prove the Lin and Reiter conjecture by presenting a case where <b>the</b> <b>progressed</b> theory indeed does lose information, thus closing a question that has remained open for more than ten years. Second, we prove that the alternative definition is nonetheless correct for reasoning about a large class of sentences, including some that quantify over situations...|$|R

5|$|In the 1995 local {{elections}} <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> Party regained {{the level of}} support seen at the 1987 elections.

The latter particularly gained the party many sympathy votes, as a result of the harsh media storm targeted against Hagen. In the 1997 parliamentary election, the party obtained 15.3% of the vote, and for the first time became the second largest political party in Norway.
