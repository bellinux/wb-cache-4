5000|$|Cameron <b>Toll</b> Shopping <b>Centre,</b> Cameron <b>Toll,</b> Edinburgh, Scotland, opened 1984 and re-branded as Sainsbury's in 2005 ...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{building}} {{dates from the}} 20th century, but the fortifications date back to a 14th-century castle. The château was originally a court of justice and a <b>toll</b> collection <b>centre,</b> hence its name [...] "La Barre".|$|R
50|$|The {{area is the}} {{location}} of Cameron <b>Toll</b> Shopping <b>Centre,</b> Edinburgh’s first ‘out of town’ shopping centre, which opened in 1984 {{at a cost of}} £33 million. Built in the former grounds of Inch House between the A7 and A701 roads, the centre occupies a 26-acre site.|$|R
25|$|Edinburgh {{also has}} {{substantial}} retail parks {{outside the city}} centre. These include The Gyle Shopping Centre and Hermiston Gait in {{the west of the}} city, Cameron <b>Toll</b> Shopping <b>Centre,</b> Straiton Retail Park and Fort Kinnaird in the south and east, and Ocean Terminal in the north on the Leith waterfront.|$|R
50|$|In 1984, SavaCentre started {{trading in}} Scotland {{following}} {{the opening of}} a store in Cameron <b>Toll</b> Shopping <b>Centre</b> in Cameron <b>Toll,</b> Edinburgh, between the A7 and A701 roads. At the time of building the Cameron Toll SavaCentre was Scotland’s largest single level store. This store also had to compete with a smaller Safeway supermarket in the same shopping centre, until the Safeway branch closed down in 1997.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a small}} {{junction}} {{which is}} for the A772, {{that used to be}} the A7 until the mid-1990s. This road leads to Cameron <b>Toll</b> shopping <b>centre</b> as well as the A701 and the city centre. There is evidence that western slip-roads were considered at the roundabout to join the A772. This junction offers only connections to and from the west on the A720.|$|R
40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need for European and {{national}} transport policy to establish instruments for a better and faster adaptation of existing infrastructure capacity to policy goals. For this purpose the setup and operation of access- and usage control of the existing road infrastructure capacity need to be established. GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) based dynamic tolling which reacts situation based {{to a set of}} parameters according to predefined coded thresholds is widely seen as an appropriate instrument by traffic planners, industry and policy. Therefore a new dynamic tolling scheme needs to take additional parameters like current congestion on the road, vehicle occupancy (trucks-load or passengers per vehicles), pollution, particles, CO 2 emissions, noise etc. into consideration. One essential element to such a new dynamic tolling scheme is contributed by GALILEO: detecting which vehicles are driving on which road, and possibly even on which particular lane of that road. Galileo will provide this robust, reliable and precise positioning of the vehicle. An vehicle based On-Board-Unit will process these exact positioning data together with price relevant data provided by the <b>tolling</b> <b>centre</b> and integrate them with the relevant in-vehicle generated data (e. g. from CAN-BUS) for the calculation of the currently valid road price that will be displayed via a human machine interface (HMI). The data transmission between On-Board-Unit and <b>tolling</b> operation <b>centre</b> will be done by terrestrial wireless infrastructure-to-vehicle communication technologies (e. g. GSM/GPRS, Infrared, Microwave). This paper discusses the use of Galileo for vehicle positioning within dynamic tolling systems and the corresponding possible impacts of such schemes (harmonisation of traffic along the road network, reduction of CO 2 emissions, noise etc.) on traffic and on transport policy. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{introduction}} of congestion <b>toll</b> in <b>centre</b> of Prague. I {{look at the}} toll as an internalization of externalities instrument. Car transport causes high externalities in centres of cities, so there exists a tendency {{to solve this problem}} by different arrangements. Altough particular congestion toll project in Prague brings internalization of automobile externalities, this project is not profitable for the society because of high costs...|$|R
50|$|Scotland's main {{motorway}}, the M74 skirts {{the eastern}} {{edges of the}} town. Larkhall has 2 motorway intersections: Junction 7 with the A72, which is for southbound traffic only, and Junction 8 with the A71, which is for both northbound and southbound traffic. Junction 8 is known locally as Canderside Toll or The <b>Toll.</b> The <b>centre</b> of Glasgow can be reached in 20 minutes; Edinburgh is around 50 minutes away.|$|R
5000|$|The {{explosion}} {{followed a}} build-up of gas in an underground space beneath the Clarkston <b>Toll</b> shopping <b>centre,</b> {{caused by a}} gas main leak later ruled to have been accidental. Customers and shop staff had on 20 October complained of a strong smell of gas in the centre and Scottish Gas engineers had attended to investigate, but had identified no source for the smell. The engineers were still in attendance at around 2:50pm on the 21st when the gas ignited and exploded, killing at least 21 people and injuring around 100. The victims included many female shop staff and housewives on shopping trips, and the passengers of a bus that had been passing the scene. [...] The explosion destroyed several shops and a terraced car park.|$|R
50|$|The highway was {{upgraded}} from single carriageway to {{dual carriageway}} in the 1980s. In 1995, the highway {{was taken over}} by the Metramac Corporation Sdn Bhd which also managed the Cheras Highway (Federal Route J1), East-West Link Expressway and Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Expressway (both E37). The Jalan Pahang <b>toll</b> plaza (city <b>centre</b> bound) was in operation from 1 August 1995 and the motorist would pay the RM 0.50 tolls until the toll plaza was abolished 13 August 2004. This highway is now maintained by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall or Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur (DBKL).|$|R
50|$|With {{the exit}} in Mailundveien, Oslo the road runs north via Trondheimsveien, {{continues}} via Sinsenkrysset and through Groruddalen to Gjelleråsen where it meets riksvei 22. From there, it continues north through Nittedal and Hakadal, next to Harestua {{along the west}} side of Harestuvatnet and further through Grua, Roa, Gran and Jaren. From Jaren, the road runs northeast to Lygna where it meets riksvei 180. From there, the road runs north to Einavoll, along the east side of Einavatnet to Eina. There is a new motorway with <b>tolls</b> from Reinsvoll <b>centre</b> and next to Raufoss until the junction with Rv33 in Hunndalen and further down to Mjøsstranda in Gjøvik. From Gjøvik, the road runs along {{the west side of}} Mjøsa to Mjøsa Bridge at Moelv where it joins the E6.|$|R
50|$|After {{the tornado}} left Woodstock, it is {{suspected}} that the tornado grew to its maximum size. As it passed over the town of Oxford Centre (a hamlet of 250 at the time) the damage path width had reached 1 kilometre. Within two minutes, thirty homes were destroyed, along with the local church and community centre in Oxford <b>Centre</b> (<b>Toll,</b> 1980). The towns of New Durham and Vanessa met a similar fate shortly thereafter, at 7:19 and 7:37pm respectively. A partially filled, forty-foot silo constructed of concrete six inches thick, toppled over on a farm somewhere between Oxford Centre and New Durham. The two deaths were in the New Durham area. A 51-year-old man was killed instantly after being thrown some 200 feet from his two-ton vehicle, and a woman died after being hit with flying glass (Toll, 1980). At this point, the funnel {{had been on the}} ground for over twenty minutes and was easily over a mile wide. During this stretch of the tornado's path, two vehicles on two separate farms were tossed nearly a kilometre. In addition to the powerful tornado at hand, hail the size of tennis balls fell north of its track, destroying entire tobacco fields on dozens of farms (Newark, 1979). Eyewitnesses also reported that the tornado was preceded by intense and nearly constant lightning unlike any they had seen before (Toll, 1980).|$|R
