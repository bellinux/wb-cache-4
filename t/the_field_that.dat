5|$|McClintock's {{cytogenetic}} research {{focused on}} developing ways to visualize and characterize maize chromosomes. This particular {{part of her}} work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using carmine staining to visualize maize chromosomes, and showed {{for the first time}} the morphology of the 10 maize chromosomes. This discovery was made because she observed cells from the microspore as opposed to the root tip. By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to link specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together. Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 Genetics paper on the characterization of triploid maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>that</b> were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.|$|E
5|$|Much of Havelock's {{work was}} devoted to {{addressing}} a single thesis: that all of Western thought is informed by a profound shift {{in the kinds of}} ideas available to the human mind at the point that Greek philosophy converted from an oral to a literate form. The idea has been very controversial in classical studies, and has been rejected outright both by many of Havelock's contemporaries and modern classicists. Havelock and his ideas have nonetheless had far-reaching influence, both in classical studies and other academic areas. He and Walter J. Ong (who was himself strongly influenced by Havelock) essentially founded <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>that</b> studies transitions from orality to literacy, and Havelock {{has been one of the}} most frequently cited theorists in that field; as an account of communication, his work profoundly affected the media theories of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan. Havelock's influence has spread beyond the study of the classical world to that of analogous transitions in other times and places.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 1963, Altgens was {{scheduled}} {{to work in the}} AP offices in Dallas as the wirephoto editor. He asked instead to go to the railroad overpass (the bridge under which Elm, Main and Commerce Streets converge at the west end of Dealey Plaza) to photograph the motorcade that was to take President Kennedy from Love Field to his scheduled appearance at the Dallas Trade Mart. Altgens was not assigned to work in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>that</b> day, so he took his personal single-lens reflex camera rather than the motor-driven equipment normally used for news events.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} {{to begin the}} game, and Air Force began the first drive of the game at its 20-yard line after a touchback. The Falcons began the game with three {{consecutive}} short rushes that failed to gain a first down and punted the ball away to Virginia Tech. The Hokies began their first drive of the game after a short return to their 35-yard line. As had Air Force before them, Tech was unable to gain a first down and punted. Air Force began its second drive at its 34-yard line and had more success on its second drive. Aided by an offside penalty against Virginia Tech, the Falcons picked up a first down with a big run by Bart Weiss that penetrated the Tech side of <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> <b>That</b> run was followed by several others from the Falcons, who drove inside the Tech red zone before being stopped by the Tech defense. Facing fourth down, Air Force attempted a 35-yard field goal, which was successful. With 6:35 remaining in the first quarter, Air Force took a 30 lead.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{recovered}} {{in the end}} zone for a touchback, and the Volunteers started at their 20-yard line. Tennessee resumed running out the clock via short runs up the middle of <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>that</b> kept the game clock ticking down. After not gaining a first down, Tennessee punted to the Hokies with less than two minutes remaining in the game. Tech wide receiver Antonio Freeman returned the kick to the Tech 42-yard line, and on the first play of the Hokie drive, Druckenmiller completed a 17-yard pass to the Tennessee 41-yard line. That completion was followed by a nine-yard pass to Jermaine Holmes. After an incomplete pass that almost was intercepted, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass before Oxendine failed to gain enough yards for a first down and Tech turned the ball over on downs. With less than a minute remaining, Tennessee's offense ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and secured a 4523 victory.|$|E

25|$|Transpersonal {{psychology}} {{has been}} noted for undervaluing quantitative methods {{as a tool for}} improving our knowledge of spiritual and transpersonal categories.

25|$|Fighting {{a mobile}} guerrilla war {{much of the}} time, the VC/NVA could not deploy large {{quantities}} of heavy artillery or tanks. Exceptions were the set piece siege battles such as the battle of Khe Sanh or heavy artillery duels against US batteries across the Demilitarised Zone. It was only after the shift to conventional warfare in the 1972 Easter Offensive, and the final conventional campaign in 1975 (when US airpower had vacated <b>the</b> <b>field)</b> <b>that</b> tanks and heavy batteries were openly used in significant numbers. When using heavy artillery, the VC/NVA relied on high quality Soviet-supplied heavy 122mm and 130mm guns that outranged American and ARVN opposition.|$|E
25|$|Early {{clinical}} studies with protein-based therapeutics largely {{focused on the}} intravenous or intracoronary administration of a particular growth factor to stimulate angiogenesis in the affected tissue or organ. Most of these trials did not achieve statistically significant improvements in their clinical endpoints. This ultimately led to an abandonment of this approach and a widespread belief in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>that</b> protein therapy, especially with a single agent, was not a viable option to treat ischemic cardiovascular disease. However, the failure of gene- or cell-based therapy to deliver a suitable treatment choice for diseases resulting from poor blood flow {{has led to a}} resurgence of interest in returning to protein-based therapy to stimulate angiogenesis.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{experience}} with barcode scanning in those stores revealed additional benefits. The detailed sales information {{acquired by the}} new systems allowed greater responsiveness to customer habits, needs and preferences. This {{was reflected in the}} fact that about 5 weeks after installing barcode scanners, sales in grocery stores typically started climbing and eventually leveled off at a 10–12% increase in sales that never dropped off. There was also a 1–2% decrease in operating cost for those stores, and this enabled them to lower prices and thereby to increase market share. It was shown in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>that</b> the return on investment for a barcode scanner was 41.5%. By 1980, 8,000 stores per year were converting.|$|E
25|$|Navajo scouts {{accompanied}} the United States Army when it investigated many civilian-Navajo confrontations. For example, between June 14 and September 28, 1883 {{there were five}} different Navajo reservation related activities. Lieutenant Parker, with ten enlisted men and two scouts, {{went up to the}} San Juan River to separate Navajos and citizens who encroached on Navajo land. Lieutenant Guy, with seventeen enlisted men and two scouts, and Captain Smith, with 56 enlisted men and five scouts helped the local Indian agent deal with unhappy Navajo chiefs. This involved Manuelito, Torlino, Grando Muncho and fifty armed Navajos who were upset by raids of citizens and other tribes on their people and livestock. In another action: Lieutenant Lockett, with forty-two enlisted men, were joined by Lieutenant Holomon at Navajo Springs. Evidently a citizen named Houck and or Owens had murdered a Navajo chief's son and 100 armed Navajos were looking for them. It is evident from these four months of military reports from <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>that</b> the officers tended to trust the Navajo version of events.|$|E
25|$|Corbett {{was born}} Bertie Oswald Corbett in Thame, Oxfordshire {{one of three}} sons of Rev. Elijah Bagot Corbett (Vicar of Thame 1872–1893). He was educated at Thame Grammar School and played soccer for Oxfordshire {{at the age of}} 15. He went on to Oxford University where he won his soccer blue. He later played soccer for the Corinthians and the Casuals, in the days when the famous amateur side could beat {{professional}} teams. He played in the game against Bury which the Corinthians won 10–3 to take the Sheriff of London Charity Shield. The team which Bury put into <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>that</b> day contained nine of the eleven players which had beaten Derby County F.C. in the 1903 FA Cup final by 6–0. Corbett made one appearance for the English football team, against Wales on 18 March 1901, playing at outside left. England won the match 6–0 thanks to four goals from Steve Bloomer. Throughout his career he played at outside-left and was noted for his pace and body swerve. He is highly regarded for his first history of the club The Annals of the Corinthian F. C. written in 1906.|$|E
