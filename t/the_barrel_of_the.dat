5|$|In 1942, {{trying to}} solve the problem of lack of a {{suitable}} mobile 152mm howitzer, the design bureau headed by F. F. Petrov started to work privately on a new howitzer, based on the carriage of the M-30 and <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M-10 (which was fitted with a muzzle brake in order to reduce the recoil and thus prevent damage to the lighter carriage). The approach allowed production to begin on the new howitzer almost immediately from the stockpile of parts for both earlier guns. Given the war situation and shortages of artillery, this solution was both elegant and expedient.|$|E
5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} a combination of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter {{than that of the}} M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
5|$|These {{guns are}} {{air-cooled}} {{and use a}} gas blow-back recoil system. Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II, <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20mm Oerlikon gun does not recoil; the breechblock is never locked against the breech and is actually moving forward when the gun fires. This weapon lacks a counter-recoil brake, as {{the force of the}} counter-recoil is checked by recoil from the firing of the next round of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese cannon are {{on display}} at Firepower - The Royal Artillery Museum at Woolwich. <b>The</b> {{remaining}} portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> only remaining cascabel, weighing 358 oz (10kg), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps at MoD Donnington. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source.|$|R
25|$|Japanese tactics {{were mainly}} {{defensive}} in nature but included counter-attacks when positions were taken. A notable exception was {{the attack on}} 25-pounder gun emplacements of 2/1st Field Regiment near Soputa in <b>the</b> first minutes <b>of</b> 29 December. A charge was exploded in <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guns.|$|R
500|$|Fired from <b>the</b> longer [...] <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PS90, <b>the</b> muzzle {{velocity}} <b>of</b> SS195LF {{is roughly}} [...] faster, and <b>the</b> muzzle velocity <b>of</b> SS197SR is roughly [...] faster. Fired from <b>the</b> shorter [...] <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Five-seven pistol, <b>the</b> muzzle velocity <b>of</b> SS195LF is roughly [...] slower, and <b>the</b> muzzle velocity <b>of</b> SS197SR is roughly [...] slower.|$|R

25|$|The 105mm Howitzer M3 was a U.S. light {{howitzer}} {{designed for}} use by airborne troops. The gun utilized <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 105 mm Howitzer M2, shortened and fitted to a slightly modified split trail carriage of the 75 mm pack howitzer.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M-30 was of {{built-up}} {{construction and}} consisted of a liner, jacket and breech. The breechblock was of interrupted screw type, with forced cartridge case extraction. The gun was equipped with a hydraulic recoil buffer and hydropneumatic recuperator. A panoramic sight was used for both indirect and direct fire.|$|E
25|$|Both Kazi Amar Singh Thapa and Ranajor Singh Thapa {{were thus}} hemmed in and looking down <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British guns when Bam Shah’s letter arrived, announcing <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> Almora. Although <b>the</b> old {{commander}} was still reluctant to surrender, Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at last saw <b>the</b> hopelessness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation and, compelled by circumstances and the British guns, surrendered with honour for both himself and Ranajor Singh. The Nepalese {{positions in the}} Far West were {{turned over to the}} British on 15 May 1815.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cannon in {{question}} are stationed outside the Officers' Mess at the Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich. <b>The</b> remaining portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> only remaining cascabel, weighing 10kilograms (385oz), {{is stored in}} a vault maintained by 15 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps at MoD Donnington. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source.

5|$|She {{was next}} seen by Navy divers, the same year, lying upside {{down with her}} bow on <b>the</b> rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{underwater}} bomb crater and stern angled toward the center. There was no sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superstructure or the big guns. The first diver to reach Arkansas sank up to his armpits in radioactive mud. When National Park Service divers returned in 1989 and 1990, the bottom was again firm-packed sand, and the mud was gone. They {{were able to see}} <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forward guns, which had not been visible in 1946.|$|R
25|$|Late in 1940, the Ordnance Corps started {{another project}} - an {{anti-tank}} gun {{based on the}} 3 inch anti-aircraft gun T9. <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> T9 was combined with breech, recoil system and carriage, all adapted from the 105 mm howitzer M2. The pilot of the weapon, named 3inch Gun T10, was ready by September 1941. Although the subsequent testing revealed minor problems, {{it was clear that}} the gun, eventually standardized as M5 on carriage M1, presented major performance improvement over existing designs.|$|E
25|$|The Hamada pistol is a {{blowback}} {{pistol and}} functionally {{a copy of}} the Browning Model 1910. The most significant design difference between the Hamada pistol and Browning Model 1910 is the replacement of the interrupter lugs used to hold <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Browning Model 1910 with a dovetail joint. The frame plate lock design and striker assembly were also modified and awarded patents in 1943. The Hamada pistol maintained high quality throughout its production, with the bluing done to a high standard. The safety, rear frame plate, and extractor were heat tempered to a reddish brown and the barrel, striker, and firing mechanism were brightly polished.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} {{the action of the}} weapon {{combined}} functions of several different machine guns of the same era. The action consisted of a sliding breech block connected to a rotary crank, which in turn was operated by an off-set connecting rod, driven by the piston rod of the weapon. The feeding system was also unconventional, utilizing a box magazine mounted {{on the left side of}} the gun, holding 10 stripper clips with five rounds each. The stripper clips were fed one at a time through the gun from left to right where the empty clips were ejected (japanese type 11 light machine gun utilised similar feature). It used the rear sight and <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Krag–Jørgensen rifle.|$|E
50|$|A {{letter code}} was stamped on <b>the</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> just forward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receiver. Usually the two middle letters {{indicate}} the {{month and year}} in which the rifle was manufactured. The first and/or fourth characters are inspectors' stamps. <b>The</b> serial number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rifle was stamped on <b>the</b> underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> just forward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock.|$|R

500|$|The single-seat fighter {{versions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hunter {{were armed}} with four [...] ADEN cannon, with 150 {{rounds of ammunition}} per gun. The cannon and ammunition boxes were contained in a single pack that could {{be removed from the}} aircraft for rapid re-arming and maintenance. Unusually, <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cannon remained in the aircraft while the pack was removed and changed. In the two-seat version, either a single 30mm ADEN cannon was carried or, in some export versions, two, with a removable ammunition tank. Later versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hunter were fitted with SNEB Pods; these were [...] rocket projectiles in 18-round Matra pods, providing an effective strike capability against ground targets.|$|R
25|$|To emplace the grafts of {{autologous}} fat-tissue, doctors J. Newman and J. Levin {{designed a}} lipo-injector gun with a gear-driven plunger, which allowed the even injection of autologous fat-tissue {{to the desired}} recipient sites. The control afforded by the lipo-injector gun assisted the plastic surgeon in controlling excessive pressure to the fat in <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syringe, thus avoiding over-filling the recipient site. The later-design lipo-injector gun featured a ratchet-gear operation that afforded the surgeon greater control in accurately emplacing grafts of autologous fat to the recipient site; a trigger action injected 0.1cm3 of filler. Since 1989, most non-surgical, fat-graft augmentation of the breast features the emplacement of adipocyte fat outside the breast parenchymaup to 300ml of fatin three equal measures (aliquots), is emplaced to the subpectoral space and to the intrapectoral space of the pectoralis major muscle, and the submammary space, to achieve a breast outcome of natural appearance and contour.|$|E
25|$|The French Army {{preferred}} bag {{charges for}} its ammunition because the brass cartridge cases {{used by the}} Mle 1915 were expensive to produce, both in money and {{in the amount of}} brass required. This became a real problem during the war given the vast number of shells expended and Schneider was asked to redesign the gun to use a deBange obdurator and allow it to use bagged powder. Schneider agreed and adapted the breech of the Canon de 155mm GPF to fit <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mle 1915, but this took quite a bit of time due to the press of existing work and the new Mle 1917 howitzer didn't enter service until late 1916. The main difference between the Mle 1915 and 1917 was in the breech. Many guns had their loading trays removed because it slowed down the rate of fire; a portable shell tray was used instead by the loaders.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 1970, Jonathan Jackson, {{a heavily}} armed, 17-year-old African-American high-school student, gained {{control over a}} {{courtroom}} in Marin County, California. Once in the courtroom, Jackson armed the black defendants and took Judge Harold Haley, the prosecutor, and three female jurors as hostages. As Jackson transported the hostages and two black convicts away from the courtroom, the police began shooting at the vehicle. The judge and the three black men {{were killed in the}} melee; one of the jurors and the prosecutor were injured. Although the judge {{was shot in the head}} with a blast from the shotgun, he also suffered a chest wound from a bullet that may have been fired from outside the van. Evidence during the trial showed, however, that either could have been fatal. The firearms which Jackson used in the attack, including the shotgun used to kill Judge Haley, had been purchased by Davis two days prior, and <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shotgun had been sawn off. Davis was found to have been corresponding with one of the inmates involved.|$|E

It is estimated that 80 to 85 more Victoria Crosses could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, Hancocks of London, established in 1849, {{has been responsible for}} <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> every medal since its inception. Both the Australian and New Zealand Victoria Crosses are made from the same gunmetal as the originals.|$|R

25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find out {{as much information as}} they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton was so impressed with the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to look down <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to see how much of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E
25|$|Nicholson {{approached}} {{the problem by}} constructing a development of the intrados of the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively unrolling and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces, adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the development diagram by projecting the detail of the intrados back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative solutions to the problem. This method resulted in the courses of stone voussoirs making up <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skew arch following parallel helical paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive rifled appearance. Although these courses meet the arch faces at right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from perpendicularity. Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, {{but it is a}} workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to each other, all the voussoir stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or quoins, where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face.|$|E
25|$|The PT-76 is amphibious, {{it has a}} flat, boat-shaped hull {{which is}} hermetical and ensures minimal {{resistance}} when the tank is afloat. It can swim after switching on the two electric bilge pumps, erecting the trim vane which improves the vehicle's stability and displacement {{in the water and}} prevents water from flooding into the bow of the tank. Switching the driver's periscope for a swimming periscope enables the driver to see over the trim vane. When not in use the trim vane is stowed {{in the front of the}} bow over <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main gun and serves as additional armor. Bilge pumps keep the tank afloat even if it leaks or is damaged. There is a manual bilge pump for emergency use. The tank is propelled through the water by two hydrojets, one on each side of the hull, with the inlets underneath the hull and the outlets at the rear. There are also additional assistant water-jet inlets on both sides of the hull over the last road wheels. The rear outlets have lids that can be fully or partially closed, redirecting the water stream to the forward-directed outlets at the sides of the hull, thus enabling the vehicle to turn or go in reverse. To turn to the left for example, the left water-jet is covered, to turn to the right, the right water-jet is covered. To make a 180° turn, one water-jet sucks in water while the other pushes it out. This system was designed by N. Konowalow. It is the same system as the one used in the BTR-50 APC, which was based on the PT-76. The tank can swim at up to 10.2km/h and has a range of 100km. It can cross most water obstacles and can also swim in the sea. However, its amphibious design makes it disproportionally large for a vehicle of its weight and allows less armor protection than other light tanks.|$|E
50|$|Filming for Yamato {{took place}} from March to June 2005 at a closed-down {{shipyard}} of Hitachi Zosen Corporation in Onomichi, Hiroshima Prefecture. Approximately JPY 600 million {{was spent in}} building a 1:1 scale set <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forward section and the portside anti-aircraft guns. The starboard side, aft section and <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> A turret were not built since the film only required scenes on the port side. However, compliance issues with Japan's Building Standards Act prevented <b>the</b> reproduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yamato's pagoda tower. Instead, photographs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yamato Museum's own 1:10 Yamato model was used for post-production. The interior scenes were made on a sound stage, but a hall near the set shows the various rooms and props reproduced for the film.|$|R

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cannon were forged or cast, {{and each}} gun {{generally}} differed in calibre and length. [...] Early powder resembled a paste, {{and tended to}} burn slowly. [...] Its composition varied in different geographical areas, <b>the</b> powder <b>of</b> Europe being quite different to that used in the Islamic world. [...] The projectiles used were generally stone balls for bombards and mortars. [...] Forged iron balls were used in smaller-calibre cannon, and coated with lead to make them smooth. [...] From the 15th century, cast iron balls were used, which caused great destruction. [...] As they were denser than stone, even small balls could be destructive. [...] Thus, cannon became smaller in calibre, and longer <b>barrels</b> increased <b>the</b> range.|$|R
500|$|The [...] D-1 {{howitzer}} M1943 (...) is a Soviet World War II-era 152.4mm howitzer. The gun {{was developed}} by the design bureau headed by F. F.

Later, a variant with a semi-automatic breech (with empty cartridge ejection) was developed. This variant—initially designated M5E1, adopted as M6 on 14 November 1940—received a full length barrel. The tubes were interchangeable, but replacing M5 with M6 and vice versa would result in an unbalanced mount and was therefore prohibited. These guns were mounted on several models of tanks and other armored vehicles: ...|$|E
