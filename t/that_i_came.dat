500|$|Despite {{the rivalry}} between regular and reserve officers, the 6th Division staff was an {{effective}} organisation. Brigadier John Harding, {{the chief of}} staff of XIII Corps, as the Western Desert Force was renamed on 1 January 1941, had been a student at Staff College, Camberley along with Mackay's chief of staff, Colonel Frank Berryman, at a time when O'Connor had been an instructor there. Harding later considered the 6th Division staff [...] "as good as any <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> across in that war, and highly efficient." [...] Australian doctrine emphasised the importance of initiative in its junior leaders and small units were trained in aggressive patrolling, particularly at night.|$|E
500|$|Fiennes {{was cast}} as Amon Göth after Spielberg viewed his {{performances}} in [...] and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that [...] "I saw sexual evil. It {{is all about}} subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold." [...] Fiennes put on [...] to play the role. He watched historic newsreels and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew Göth. In portraying him, Fiennes said [...] "I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to feel peculiarly attached to." [...] Doctors Samuel J. Leistedt and Paul Linkowski of the Université libre de Bruxelles describe Göth's character in the film as a classic psychopath. Fiennes looked so much like Göth in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg (a survivor of the events) met him, she trembled with fear.|$|E

500|$|In November 1863, {{when the}} {{military}} cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania was dedicated, Everett, by then widely renowned as the finest orator in the country, was invited to be the featured speaker. In his two-hour formal oration he compared the Battle of Gettysburg to battles of antiquity such as Marathon, and spoke about how opposing sides in previous civil wars (such as the War of the Roses and the Thirty Years' War) were able to reconcile their differences afterward. [...] Everett's oration {{was followed by the}} now far more famous Gettysburg Address of President Lincoln. For his part, Everett was deeply impressed by the concise speech and wrote to Lincoln noting [...] "I should be glad if I could flatter myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes." [...] In the 1864 election, Everett supported Lincoln, serving as a presidential elector from Massachusetts for the Republicans.|$|E
500|$|To protect Wollstonecraft, Imlay {{registered}} her as {{his wife}} in 1793, {{even though they were}} not married. After declaring war on Britain, France was blockaded by the Royal Navy, which caused shortages that worsened the problem of inflation. Imlay engaged in blockade-running, chartering ships to be bring in food and soap from America into France, which explained why both he and Wollstonecraft were not arrested during the Reign of Terror. As the Terror began in France with arrests and executions occurring daily, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion as someone from a nation that was at war with France and who was known to be a friend of leading Girondins, which led Imlay to make a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her into an American citizen, in order to protect her from arrest. Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined (Wollstonecraft's sisters believed she had been imprisoned). Wollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins [...] "nightmarish" [...] with gigantic parades in the day where everyone had to cheer, lest they fall under suspicion of not being committed to the republic, and police raids at night to arrest [...] "enemies of the republic". In a letter to her sister Everina, written in March 1794, Wollstonecraft wrote: [...] "It is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind...death and misery, in every shape of terror, haunted this devoted country – I certainly am glad <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to France, because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded." ...|$|E
2500|$|Foreign observers, however, {{believed}} that Ananda Mahidol {{did not really}} want to be king and felt his reign would not last long. Louis Mountbatten, Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the British commander in Southeast Asia, visited Bangkok in January 1946 and described the king as [...] "a frightened, short-sighted boy, his sloping shoulders and thin chest behung with gorgeous diamond-studded decorations, altogether a pathetic and lonely figure". At a public function, Mountbatten wrote: [...] "is nervousness increased to such an alarming extent, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> very close to support him in case he passed out".|$|E

Ricketts received her Bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1994, and her Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1998. Laura talks of her own struggle to come out; [...] "I came out to my family I would say early to mid 90s. I think {{for a long time}} I wasn't really out to myself, growing up in Omaha, Neb., to a Catholic conservative family. It {{took me a while to}} come out to myself and not long after <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> out to them. I think that it really couldn't have been a better experience.

2500|$|On 19 March 2008, {{during a}} {{surprise}} visit to pray at {{the tomb of}} Saint Francis in Assisi, Italy, Gorbachev made an announcement which has been interpreted {{to the effect that}} he was a Christian. Gorbachev stated: [...] "St Francis is, for me, the alter Christus, another Christ. His story fascinates me and has played a fundamental role in my life". He added: [...] "It was through St Francis that I arrived at the Church, so it was important <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to visit his tomb". However, a few days later, he reportedly told the Russian news agency Interfax: [...] "Over the last few days some media have been disseminating fantasies—I can't use any other word—about my secret Catholicism, [...] To sum up and avoid any misunderstandings, let me say that I have been and remain an atheist", to which the contemporary Orthodox patriarch replied, [...] "He is still on his way to Christianity".|$|E

We were new and inexperienced and events kept occurring one after the other which we had to deal with. In doing that, we made mistakes as I told you. I admit it now and I admitted it in the notes I have written. Whoever wishes to blame or attack me is entitled to do so. I regret I didn't have enough experience to totally control the movement. On the other hand, with our constant struggle, this had to be done together with others in the communist world to stop Kampuchea becoming Vietnamese. For the love of the nation and the people it was the right thing to do but in the course of our actions we made mistakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 September 2013, an {{interview}} was published quoting Ewen confirming {{that the group}} had split.

[...] "I think it's unfair to fans and we should be honest. The band being over is definitely not my choice. I kind of was unlucky in <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> in [...] {{towards the end of the}} cycle when things naturally came to the end.
