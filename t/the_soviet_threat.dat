5|$|The first Home Army {{structure}} designed {{primarily to}} deal with <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> had been NIE, formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how {{to deal with}} the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 NIE ("NO") was disbanded and transformed into an Armed Forces Delegation for Poland (Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February, Hausser's SS Panzer Corps {{was ordered}} to strike southwards, to provide a screen for the 4th Panzer Army's attack. Simultaneously, Army Detachment Hollidt {{was ordered to}} contain the {{continuing}} Soviet efforts to break through German lines. The 1st Panzer Army was ordered to drive north {{in an attempt to}} cut off and destroy Popov's Mobile Group, using accurate intelligence on Soviet strength which allowed the Wehrmacht to pick and choose their engagements and bring about tactical numerical superiority. The 1st and 4th Panzer Armies were also ordered to attack the overextended Soviet 6th Army and 1st Guards Army. Between 20–23 February, the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) cut through the 6th Army's flank, eliminating <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> to the Dnieper River and successfully surrounding and destroying a number of Red Army units south of the Samara River. The 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich advanced in a northeastern direction, while the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf was put into action on 22 February, advancing parallel to the Das Reich. These two divisions successfully cut the supply lines to the Soviet spearheads. First Panzer Army was able to surround and pocket Popov's Mobile Group by 24 February, although a sizable contingent of Soviet troops managed to escape north. On 22 February, alarmed by the success of the German counterattack, the Soviet Stavka ordered the Voronezh Front to shift the 3rd Tank Army and 69th Army south, in an effort to alleviate pressure on the Southwestern Front and destroy German forces in the Krasnograd area.|$|E

25|$|General Ma Buqing was {{in virtual}} {{control of the}} Gansu {{corridor}} at that time. Ma Buqing had earlier fought against the Japanese, but because <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> was great, Chiang changed Ma's position, in July, 1942, by instructing Ma to move 30,000 of his troops to the Tsaidam marsh in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai. Chiang named Ma as Reclamation Commissioner, to threaten Sheng Shicai's southern flank in Xinjiang, which bordered Tsaidam.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> {{certainly}} {{formed an}} important component of ASIO’s activities, but threats from other sources of foreign interference and politically motivated violence have been important to ASIO for some time, and will remain so. However, the implications for ASIO of the changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are more far-reaching than for the other agencies. The Government has therefore decided that while ASIO’s capacity to meet its responsibilities must be maintained, there is scope for resource reductions.|$|E

25|$|The Czech coup, the PCF's failed {{policy of}} {{sabotage}} and the Marshall Plan's likely passage were all beginning to sway French public opinion. 70% of French people now believed the U.S. {{would do more}} than any other country to help France, compared to 7% who thought the USSR would do more. Despite French concern about Germany, it was becoming increasingly clear that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> was greater than the German. France would still seek an advantageous power position vis-à-vis Germany, but it was becoming reconciled to the prospect of a rehabilitated Germany as part of postwar Europe.|$|E
25|$|For the Germans, {{the effects}} were bigger. Although <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> was {{eliminated}} {{and the position}} of the 18th Army re-established, the 11th Army had suffered serious losses in men, equipment and ammunition. The 18th Army also suffered losses, especially the 223rd Infantry Division, which was opposing the 8th Army {{on the first day of}} its offensive. Heavy casualties led to the OKH Operations Order No. 1, which ordered Army Group North to defense during the winter. In November, the German reinforcements and other units were stripped from Army Group North to deal with a major Soviet offensive at Stalingrad and Operation Northern Light was aborted.|$|E
25|$|By {{that moment}} in time, he was {{publicly}} voicing his concern that Transylvania was a target of expansion for Regency-period Hungary, while cautioning the public against Nazi Germany and its revanchism. Similarly, {{he was concerned about}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> and the fate of Romanians in the Soviet Union, working closely with the Transnistrian anti-communist refugee Nichita Smochină. Such worries were notably expressed by Iorga in a series of Bucharest Radio broadcasts, Sfaturi pe întuneric ("Advice at Dark", soon after published in brochure format). He completed several new volumes, among which were Dovezi despre conștiința originii românilor ("Evidence on the Conscious Origin of the Romanians"), the polemical essay Lupta mea contra prostiei ("My Fight against Stupidity"), and the first two volumes of the long planned Istoria românilor.|$|E

500|$|The third game {{featured}} the world champion Czechoslovaks against <b>the</b> Olympic champion <b>Soviets.</b> Czechoslovakia justified pre-tournament expectations by winning 5–3 while <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> complained about <b>the</b> scheduling, claiming organizers deliberately matched them {{up against the}} Czechoslovaks in their opening game to set them at an early disadvantage in <b>the</b> tournament. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> complaints grew louder following a 3–3 tie against Sweden. [...] While the Swedish press was hailing Salming as the greatest player in their nation's history after his second consecutive dominant effort, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> threatened to quit the tournament as they were upset about the officiating of Canadian referee Andre Legace.

25|$|In {{the latter}} {{stages of the}} Cold War, the Royal Navy was reconfigured with three anti-submarine warfare (ASW) {{aircraft}} carriers and a force of frigates and destroyers. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic. There were also mine countermeasures and submarine forces as well as support ships. As the Cold War ended, the Royal Navy fought in the Gulf War against Iraq, with Sea Skua anti-ship missiles sinking {{a large proportion of}} the Iraqi Navy. The WRNS was amalgamated with the RN in 1991. The RN also carried out many mine countermeasures operations. However, the end of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> brought about a very large reduction in the strength of the Navy. All its diesel-electric submarines were decommissioned in 1992 and more surface combatants left the fleet.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, Gale applied these {{principles}} {{to the development}} of airborne forces. An advocate of shock manoeuvre with elite forces, Gale stressed extensive training, the use of the latest battlefield technologies and strong personal leadership. For Gale, the quality of one's military forces were as important as their number, and he drew additional lessons on the disproportionate effect that surprise manoeuvre had on a 'demoralised or unprepared enemy', as opposed to a 'well-trained opposition', from the operations of his own 6th Airborne Division in Normandy. Later in life, Gale examined the issues of war in the nuclear age. Still an advocate of manoeuvre and high-quality forces, Gale was to stress the importance of achieving mobility and flexibility in the face of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat,</b> foreshadowing in many ways the evolution of the AirLand battle doctrine of the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Whipple also {{discloses}} that Japan {{has retained}} its militarism, {{with reference to}} its bushido code of conduct, while the United States vacillates against the Greater Soviet Union's ascendancy. Due to the Greater Soviet Union threat, the United States and Japan have moved towards a closer military and strategic alliance. Japanese militarist values are much admired in the United States. Japan and the United States {{are the only two}} major powers standing between the Greater Soviet Union and total control of the globe—yet most Americans seem unable to be roused to deal with <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat.</b> Whipple wonders what the emergence of an American leader like Feric Jaggar, the hero of Lord of the Swastika, could accomplish. Finally, there is a casual mention that, while in this history Nazi Germany never came into being, it is the Soviets who have undertaken the systematic genocide of all Jews in Europe—and since this is perpetrated by the Soviets, there is no power left whose armies might stop it and save at least a remnant of the Jews from this version of the Holocaust.|$|E
5000|$|As {{equipment}} capability increased, and <b>the</b> perceived <b>Soviet</b> bomber <b>threat</b> diminished, <b>the</b> {{requirement for}} numbers decreased, and the nine CF-100 squadrons {{were replaced by}} five CF-101 squadrons, which later fell to three. The auxiliary squadrons also lost their air defence role. At the same time, the Pinetree Line, the Mid-Canada Line and the DEW Line radar stations, largely operated by the RCAF, were built across Canada because of <b>the</b> growing <b>Soviet</b> nuclear <b>threat.</b>|$|R
50|$|President Reagan reignited the Cold War. Détente was {{rejected}} in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter {{in the face}} of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> invasion of Afghanistan.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> {{invasion}} <b>threat</b> was {{no longer}} acute after <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had evacuated their Hanko base and the Germans had advanced in the Baltic states.

25|$|Early in 1919, Guderian was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} four thousand officers to continue on in military service for the reduced size German army, the Reichswehr. He was assigned to serve {{on the staff of the}} central command of the Eastern Frontier Guard Service. This Guard Service was intended to control and coordinate the independent Freikorps units in the defense of Germany's eastern frontiers against Polish and Soviet forces engaged in the Russian Civil War. In June 1919, Guderian joined the Iron Brigade (later known as the Iron Division) as its second General Staff officer. The commanders of the regular German army had intended that this move would allow the army to reassert its control over the Iron Division; however, their hopes were disappointed. Rather than restrain the Freikorps, Guderian's anti-communism caused him to empathize with the Iron Division's efforts to defend Prussia against <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat.</b> The Iron Division waged a ruthless campaign in Lithuania and pushed into Latvia; however, traditional German anti-Slavic attitudes prevented the division's full cooperation with the White Russian and Baltic forces opposing the Bolsheviks.|$|E
25|$|In East Prussia the Luftwaffe sent an 800-strong force under 4. Fliegerdivision. JG 54, {{operating}} the Fw 190 fighter versions along with SG 4 supported the German Fourth Army and {{enabled them to}} halt the Soviet attempt to crush the Courland pocket. On one day, 27 October, the Fw 190 fighter unit JG 54 claimed 57 aircraft shot down. SG 4 lost 17 Fw 190F ground attack machines. On 28 October, Erich Rudorffer claimed 11 victories, reaching a total of 209. Fw 190s of JG 54 claimed 600 victories between 14 September and 24 November, while the Soviet units reported a total loss of 779 aircraft. The crisis on the Eastern Front now required all available units {{to return to the}} theatre. The Battle of the Bulge in the Western theatre was still ongoing, but with the Siege of Budapest and the Soviet winter offensive about to strike across the Polish plain, Luftflotte 6 was rushed from the Ardennes sector to Poland to meet <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat.</b> It brought with it some 100 Fw 190s.|$|E
25|$|In early 1943, the Home Army {{built up}} its forces in {{preparation}} for a national uprising. The situation was soon complicated by the continuing strength of Germany and the threat presented by the advance of the Soviets, who promoted a territorial and political vision of a future Poland at odds with what the Polish leaders were striving for. The Council of National Unity, a quasi-parliament, was instituted in occupied Poland on 9 January 1944; it was chaired by Kazimierz Pużak, a socialist. The plan for the establishment of Polish state authority ahead of the arrival of the Soviets was code-named Operation Tempest and began in late 1943. Its major elements were the campaign of the 27th Home Army Infantry Division in Volhynia (from February 1944), Operation Ostra Brama in Vilnius and the Warsaw Uprising. In the earlier cases, the Soviets and their allies ruthlessly imposed their rule; {{in the case of the}} Warsaw Uprising, the Soviets waited for the Germans to defeat the insurgents. The forces of the Polish right-wing called for stopping the war against Germany and concentrating on fighting the communists and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the Cold War, a {{principal}} focus of Canadian defence policy was {{contributing to the}} security of Europe in the face of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> military <b>threat.</b> Toward that end, Canadian ground and air forces were based in Europe from the early 1950s until the early 1990s.|$|R

25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War forced Turkish {{leaders to}} {{reassess}} their country's international position. The disappearance of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> {{and the perception of}} being excluded from Europe have created a sense of vulnerability with respect to Turkey's position in the fast-changing global political environment. Özal believed Turkey's future security depended on the continuation of a strong relationship with the United States. For that reason, he supported the United States' position during the Persian Gulf War, although Turkey's economic ties to Iraq were extensive and their disruption hurt the country. After the war, he continued to support major United States initiatives in the region, including the creation of a no-fly zone over northern Iraq, the Arab–Israeli peace process, and expanded ties with the Central Asian members of the CIS. Özal's pro-United States policy was not accepted by all Turks. The United States' use of Turkish military installations during the bombing of Iraq in 1991 led to antiwar demonstrations in several cities, and sporadic attacks on United States facilities continued in 1992 and 1993. Nevertheless, among Turkey's political elite, a consensus had emerged by January 1995 that Turkey's security depended on remaining a strategic ally of the United States. For that reason, both the Demirel and Çiller governments undertook efforts to cultivate relations with the administrations of presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{continued}} {{to expand on}} his vision of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat,</b> saying that the Soviets' maritime goal [...] "encompasses not only the military uses of the sea, but also those relating to world politics, economics, commerce and technology," [...] and likened its propaganda value to the Space Race.|$|E
500|$|The Treaty of Brussels was {{a mutual}} defence treaty against <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> {{at the start}} of the Cold War. It was signed on 17March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom. It was the {{precursor}} to NATO. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> became immediate with the Berlin Blockade in 1948, leading to the creation of the Western European Union's Defence Organization in September 1948. However, the parties were too weak militarily to counter the military power of the USSR. In addition, the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état by the Communists had overthrown a democratic government and British Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin reiterated that the best way to prevent another Czechoslovakia was to evolve a joint Western military strategy. He got a receptive hearing in the United States, especially considering American anxiety over Italy (and the Italian Communist Party).|$|E
50|$|The Reagan Administration’s naval buildup is {{important}} for the overall objective of deterring <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in Europe and the American’s interest due to military escalation of nuclear weapons. The Maritime Strategy is the blueprint for the U.S. Navy to mass-produce 600 ships against fighting in a global war against <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. <b>The</b> U.S. Navy believes that the buildup is the key {{for the protection of the}} American people and their close relation to Europe. The main idea is to prevent <b>the</b> <b>Soviet’s</b> <b>threat</b> to NATO and is extremely important to the American’s military. The Maritime Strategy is to gain control in the sea and have the range to launch missiles or air strikes into enemy territory. Horizontal escalation was one of the main tenets of the overall defense policy of the early Reagan Administration. The horizontal escalation discussed in its position is to build large number of carriers and have the capability to eliminate threats on both land and water.|$|R
50|$|Demilitarisation {{can also}} {{refer to the}} {{policies}} employed by Allied forces during the occupation of Japan and Germany after World War II. The Japanese and German militaries were re-badged to disassociate them from their recent war history, but were kept active and reinforced to help the allies face <b>the</b> new <b>Soviet</b> <b>threat</b> that had become evident as World War 2 ended, and the Cold War began.|$|R
