5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn {{develops}} a crush on Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco) and tries to get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her,</b> which proves difficult due to her destructive and uncontrollable power.|$|E
5|$|After falling {{pregnant}} by Brett Macklin (Gerry Sont), Ruth Stewart (Justine Clarke) {{gave birth}} to Martha. However, she decided to give Martha up for adoption to a family called the MacKenzies. Martha grew up on her new family's farm. Her adoptive parents died, leaving Martha with the farm and her adoptive brothers. Martha then {{went in search of}} her biological parents. Brett did not want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her,</b> but she managed to form a relationship with Ruth and went to live with her in New York. Her grandfather, Alf, and her great aunt, Morag (Cornelia Frances), came to visit and Martha chose to return to Australia to live with her relatives.|$|E
5|$|Her death caused {{reactions}} {{not just}} within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, Feynman began {{thinking}} of writing an autobiography, {{and he began}} granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought {{a new wave of}} protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged sexism in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He had gotten <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her,</b> and both liked and admired her.|$|E
5|$|She {{gradually}} becomes {{friends with}} Charlene and Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan). Jane later starts to date Mike. Nell bans her from seeing Mike after her love rival Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) begins to send Nell poison pen letters about Mike. She later allows them be together when Daphne finds out Sue {{is behind the}} letters. After becoming lost in the bush with Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien), they strike up a friendship and share a bond, this makes Mike jealous. Her relationship with Mike gradually {{comes to an end}} after he cheats on her. Amanda comes back to Erinsborough, under the ruse of getting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> daughter when in reality she is hiding from being fined for insurance fraud. Jane and Nell eventually tell her to leave.|$|E
25|$|After an {{incident}} when Janet {{was found in}} a bathtub, presumably drunk, Janet becomes embarrassed and both Moon and Kate notice the change in her mood. As her friend, Kate hopes that this situation does not harm Janet's credibility at the university, although she finds that many of the professors no longer care for Janet. Although Kate defends Janet, it is no use. Many people ridicule Janet and seem to have no desire to get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> better.|$|E

25|$|The drug run was {{organised}} by Perth criminal John Asciak. Chambers was enlisted {{for the job}} due to {{his experience}} in the task. Asciak spent much time at the residence of his girlfriend Debbie Colyer-Long and got <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> boarder, Kevin Barlow. Asciak soon learned Barlow had little money and few prospects for regular work. At the time Barlow was on compensation after injuring himself at work. He was depressed, consuming a lot of alcohol and marijuana after losing his girlfriend. He had also been threatened with the repossession of his car.|$|E
25|$|Another reason family {{folklore}} {{might be}} suppressed or lost {{is when the}} references are too painful {{at the present time}} or to the present generation. When Catherine Noren found photo albums and other old family portraits in her grandmother’s attic, she unwittingly unearthed an entire family history of a prosperous German-Jewish family before the Holocaust. It became her task, one generation removed, to explore and record the family history in a book containing photos, diaries and memories of her family history. It is only because these albums and portraits had not been discarded along with the narrative that Noren came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> family story.|$|E
25|$|Lamarr {{went on to}} play {{a number}} of stage roles, {{including}} a starring one in Sissy, a play produced in Vienna, which won accolades from critics. Admirers sent roses to her dressing room {{and tried to get}} backstage to meet her. She sent most of them away, including a man who was more insistent, Friedrich Mandl. He became obsessed with getting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her.</b> She fell for his charming and fascinating personality, partly due to his immense financial status. Her parents, both of Jewish descent, did not approve, due to Mandl's ties to Mussolini and, later, Hitler, but could not stop the headstrong Hedy.|$|E

25|$|Livia {{played a}} vital role in the {{formation}} of her children Tiberius and Drusus. Attention focuses on her part in the divorce of her first husband, father of Tiberius, in 39/38 BC. It would be interesting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> role in this, as well as in Tiberius' divorce of Vipsania Agrippina in 12 BC at Augustus' insistence: whether it was merely neutral or passive, or whether she actively colluded in Caesar's wishes. The first divorce left Tiberius a fosterchild at the house of Octavian; the second left Tiberius with a lasting emotional scar, since he had been forced to abandon the woman he loved for dynastic considerations.|$|E
25|$|She {{was born}} in Athens, Greece and after 36 BC was brought to Rome by {{her mother and her}} siblings. Antonia never had the chance <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> father, Mark Antony, who {{divorced}} her mother in 32 BC and committed suicide in 30 BC. She was raised by her mother, her uncle and her aunt, Livia Drusilla. Due to inheritances, she owned properties in Italy, Greece and Egypt. She was a wealthy and influential woman who often received people who were visiting Rome. Antonia had many male friends and they included wealthy Jew Alexander the Alabarch and Lucius Vitellius, a consul and father of future Emperor Aulus Vitellius.|$|E
25|$|Chopin {{appeared}} {{to express her}} belief in the strength of women. Marquand draws from theories about creative nonfiction {{in terms of her}} work. In order for a story to be autobiographical, or even biographical, Marquand writes, {{there has to be a}} nonfictional element, but more often than not the author exaggerates the truth to spark and hold interest for the readers. Kate Chopin might have been surprised <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> work has been characterized as feminist in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, just as she had been in her own time to have it described as immoral. Critics tend to regard writers as individuals with larger points of view addressed to factions in society.|$|E

25|$|Martha leaves Holby {{to attend}} university, {{returning}} {{two years later}} having married in Las Vegas without telling her father. Elliot is upset, so Martha plans a picnic at which Elliot can get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> new husband Ben (Oliver Boot) better. At the picnic, Elliot's dog Samson is run over by an ambulance, resulting in a pneumothorax. Elliot operates on Samson in a basement theatre, and he makes a full recovery. When Ben confides in Elliot that he is experiencing on-going health problems, he initially agrees not to tell Martha, not wanting her to worry. Martha later learns Ben is {{in the early stages}} of Sarcoidosis and will be blind within months. Relating his own experience of Gina's failing health, Elliot advises Martha to leave Ben, and ultimately they break up.|$|E
25|$|On 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol {{was driving}} a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he {{collided}} with the rear of a braking truck 10km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half {{of his face and}} incurred cuts on his face that cost him the sight of his right eye. Both the royal cremation and coronation had to be postponed once more. While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, Riante Rive. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. Their wedding was described by The New York Times as “the shortest, simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of gilded elephants and white umbrellas”. The ceremony was performed by Bhumibol's ageing grandmother, Savang Vadhana.|$|E
25|$|Peggy and Joe Appiah {{took their}} honeymoon in France and {{returned}} to England where Joe was to finish his legal training at the Middle Temple. In May 1954 their first son, Kwame Anthony Appiah, was born (amid another flutter of newspaper publicity) and in November the young family arrived in the Gold Coast to begin their new life. During this period, while Joe was developing a legal career and beginning {{his life as a}} politician, Peggy focused most of her energy on her young family —- Ama was born in 1955, Adwoa in 1960 and Abena in 1962 —- and on working as a secretary and legal assistant in his law office and for his constituents, supporting her husband as she had supported her father. She learned to wear cloth, started attending funerals, and got <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> husband's family and his father's family as well. They built themselves a home in Mbrom, where their neighbours were Victor Owusu, another senior NLM politician, John Brew, and, across the street, Joe Appiah's father, J. W. K. Appiah and his wife, Aunty Jane.|$|E
5000|$|Hering {{was pulled}} from {{training}} and, unable {{to receive a}} reply to his satisfaction, requested reassignment to different duties. Instead, the Air Force issued an administrative discharge for [...] "failure to demonstrate acceptable qualities of leadership".

25|$|The {{third season}} {{focuses on the}} characters' first half of their senior year, and also has the return of basketball. It {{features}} the arrival of Rachel Gatina, who brings conflict to the romance between Brooke and Lucas when she sets out to date Lucas. Peyton deals {{with the return of}} her mom, and tries to get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> when she finds out she is dying from cancer. Jake and Peyton's relationship draws to a close and Peyton's romantic feelings for Lucas resurface later in the season. Chris Keller returns and helps Nathan and Haley reunite, also causing damage between Brooke and Lucas. The later of the season sees Nathan and Haley plan their wedding. A major subplot consists of Dan's efforts to solve the murder attempt that was made against him during the previous season's cliffhanger. A major episode ("With Tired Eyes, Tired Minds, Tired Souls, We Slept") involves most of the main cast in a hostage situation at Tree Hill High and culminates in Peyton getting shot in the leg, Jimmy Edwards committing suicide and Dan murdering Keith. At {{the end of the season}} finale after Nathan and Haley renew their vows he, Rachel, and Cooper are fighting for their lives after a car accident.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{cases of}} media {{censorship}} {{occurred during the}} 2013 anti-government protests, when the mainstream media did not broadcast any news regarding the demonstrations for three days after they began. The lack of media coverage was symbolised by CNN International covering the protests while CNN Türk broadcast a documentary about penguins at the same time. The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) controversially issued a fine to pro-opposition news channels including Halk TV and Ulusal Kanal for their coverage of the protests, accusing them of broadcasting footage that could be morally, physically and mentally destabilising to children. Erdoğan was criticised for not responding to the accusations of media intimidation, and caused international outrage after telling a female journalist (Amberin Zaman of The Economist) <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> place and calling her a 'shameless militant' during his 2014 presidential election campaign. While the 2014 presidential election was not subject to substantial electoral fraud, Erdoğan was again criticised for receiving disproportionate media attention in comparison to his rivals. The British newspaper The Times commented that between 2 and 4 July, the state-owned media channel TRT gave 204 minutes of coverage to Erdoğan's campaign and less than a total of 3 minutes to both his rivals.|$|E
