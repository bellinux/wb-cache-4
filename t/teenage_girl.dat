5|$|Inspired {{by their}} own daughters, Schooley and McCorkle {{conceived}} Kim as a <b>teenage</b> <b>girl</b> capable of doing anything, basing the character on their own childhood hero James Bond. Upon noticing the lack of strong female leads in children's animated television, they decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's action hero accompanied by a male comedic sidekick {{in the form of}} best friend-turned-boyfriend Ron Stoppable. Devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity unlike traditional superheroes, the character's crime-fighting abilities are instead drawn from her cheerleading experience, thus making her more relatable to young viewers. Originally designed as a bombshell based on video game character Lara Croft, Kim's appearance was ultimately altered to resemble a <b>teenage</b> <b>girl</b> instead.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} on cosmetic surgery and <b>teenage</b> <b>girls</b> is limited and fails {{to provide information}} regarding how <b>teenage</b> <b>girls</b> construct these procedures. A social constructionist approach informed by a discursive psychology methodology was used to study how <b>teenage</b> <b>girls</b> and message board respondents construct cosmetic surgery through the language they use and the social actions performed through their talk. I analyzed questions posted by <b>teenage</b> <b>girls</b> {{between the ages of}} 13 to 19 on online message boards, as well as responses to these questions posted by other message board users. Social actions identified in the teenage girls’ talk included: advice and information seeking, approval seeking, and justification of cosmetic surgery. Social actions identified in the respondents’ talk included: provision of advice and information, warning, approval, disapproval, criticism and judgement, reassurance, empathy, encouragement, and support. In general, <b>teenage</b> <b>girls</b> constructed cosmetic surgery as a way for them to feel better about themselves, as a way for them to feel better about the body part they were seeking surgery for, and as a way for them to fit in and be accepted by others. The results of this study are discussed in relation to the existing {{research on}} <b>teenage</b> <b>girls</b> and cosmetic surgery, Davis’s (1995) feminist perspective on cosmetic surgery, Fredrickson and Roberts’s (1997) objectification theory, and embodiment. Implications for <b>teenage</b> <b>girls,</b> parents of <b>teenage</b> <b>girls,</b> physicians, and psychologists are also discussed, and recommendations for future research are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the discharge diagnoses of children receiving surgical consultation for acute abdominal pain according to age and sex. Methods: Retrospective chart review. Results: Nine hundred forty-one children were included. Appendicitis was confirmed in 31 % of young boys (= 12 years), 38 % of young girls, and only 18 % of <b>teenage</b> <b>girls.</b> A large number of <b>teenage</b> <b>girls</b> were diagnosed as having constipation and nonspecific abdominal pain. Gynecological diagnoses were relatively rare (9 % of <b>teenage</b> <b>girls).</b> <b>Teenage</b> <b>girls</b> often required multiple visits to the emergency department. In addition, they frequently received consultation from other medical specialists: 30 % versus 20 % of young girls and 12 % of boys. <b>Teenage</b> <b>girls</b> had the highest rate of (retrospectively) unnecessary surgery: 36 % versus 10 % of young girls (P < 0. 01) and 11 % of boys (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: Most children receiving surgical consultation for acute abdominal pain do not have diseases requiring surgery. In <b>teenage</b> <b>girls,</b> especially, the proportion with appendicitis is low. Constipation and nonspecific abdominal pain are the main discharge diagnoses in this group. Physicians should have a high index of suspicion of constipation when examining <b>teenage</b> <b>girls</b> with acute abdominal pain...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Elizabeth Arden began to {{introduce}} different lipstick colors. She inspired other companies {{to create a}} variety of lipstick shades.

The main difficulty in the context of Mashhad and Iran is the lack of private places and large number of children in residential care. A quantitative approach has been conducted to study the effect of privacy on <b>teenage</b> <b>girls</b> aged 12 - 18 (n= 67) living in 5 selected residential care in Mashhad. This research suggests new application and directions and appropriate size in terms of spatial privacy for <b>teenage</b> <b>girls</b> in the future...|$|R
