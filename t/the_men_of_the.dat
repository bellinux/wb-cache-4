5|$|After seeing minor {{action in}} the Battle of Hanover Court House on May 27, the 22nd {{remained}} in camp at Gaines' Mill for nearly a month as McClellan positioned his army for an assault on Richmond. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 22nd could see the steeples of Richmond from their camp.

Thirteen men were killed and several other injured. The company, composed mainly of immigrants, then retreated to Bab al-Wad. The 52nd Battalion was preparing to take the hill in front of Yalu, but received an order to retreat.|$|E

5|$|Initially, de Peyster {{had been}} {{selected}} to lead {{an assault on the}} breastworks outside the city, however the night before the assault he noticed the city aflame from a signal tower and informed General Weitzel. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corps then entered the city unmolested. Admiral David Farragut later claimed that de Peyster was due as much credit as he would have received had he actually taken the city by storming it, because doing it without bloodshed still carried the same intent.|$|E

5|$|The Eighth Army Ranger Company was {{deactivated}} on 31 March 1951.

In the meantime, most of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Eighth Army Ranger Company were transferred to other units of the 25th Infantry Division, while those who were paratrooper qualified through the United States Army Airborne School were allowed to transfer to the 187th Regimental Combat Team or one of the other Ranger companies then beginning to arrive in Korea. During its brief existence, the Eighth Army Ranger Company saw 164 days of combat and was awarded a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E

5|$|The division, now {{reattached}} to II ANZAC Corps, moved {{north in}} mid-October and replaced the 5th Australian Division at Sailly. It remained here, patrolling the sector and mounting raids, into February 1917. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division had become fatigued through their {{service on the}} Western Front. While the 2nd and Rifle Brigades soon recovered, the 1st Brigade, having many Gallipoli veterans, continued to struggle as did Johnston, its commander. Consequently, Russell sent him on leave and reorganised the brigades.|$|E
5|$|The less-prominent women {{mentioned}} in the play are subordinated as well, as they are only described through <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play. Most of what is said about Sycorax, for example, is said by Prospero. Further, Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero has never met Sycorax – all he learned about her he learned from Ariel. According to Orgel, Prospero's suspicion of women makes him an unreliable source of information. Orgel suggests that he is sceptical of female virtue in general, citing his ambiguous remark about his wife's fidelity.|$|E

Camden Street remained under constant guard by 16 sentinels. They served in two-hour shifts, with four-hours' rest in between.|$|E
