5|$|His knighthood {{involved}} some controversy, {{following his}} wife's public comment {{that he was}} the only Australian state governor without such an honour. As knighthoods were then conferred by the Queen on the recommendation of her Federal and State governments, and the Governor was the Queen's representative in the state, this was seen as highly inappropriate, especially given the Western Australian ALP State government of the day, led by John Tonkin had a policy of not recommending Imperial Honours. However, the Tonkin Government was defeated in April 1974 and the incoming Liberal Premier, Sir Charles Court, was happy <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Deep ecology is a {{movement}} founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles {{for the well-being of}} all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will {{improve the quality of life}} rather than the standard of living. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> change happen. The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species (for example through artificial photosynthesis) allowing Rights of Nature.|$|E

25|$|In Europe and elsewhere, railway {{networks}} are {{considered part of}} the national transport infrastructure, just like roads, highways and waterways, so are often financed by the state. Operators of the rolling stock pay fees according to rail use.

Because railroad infrastructure is privately owned in the U.S., railroads are unwilling <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> investments for electrification.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the shift}} of policy, the policy of {{evacuating}} Greek settlements and relocating the inhabitants was continued, albeit in a limited scale. The policy was targeted to specific regions that were considered militarily vulnerable, not {{the whole of the}} Greek population. As a 1919 Patriarchate account records, the evacuation of many villages was accompanied with looting and murders, while many {{died as a result of}} not having been given the time <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> provisions or of being relocated to uninhabitable places.|$|E

60|$|The three fellows {{came down}} to the Spaniards one morning, and in very humble terms desired to be {{admitted}} to speak with them.

25|$|In 1967, Rolf Hochhuth, a German playwright, {{included}} one {{theory of the}} 1943 crash in his play Soldiers: An Obituary for Geneva.

Unaware that Prchal was still alive, the pilot was accused of participating in this plot. A libel case resulted and a court in London found in favour of Prchal and awarded him substantial damages and costs (50 thousand British pounds). Hochhuth moved to Switzerland and avoided the payments. The London theatre staging the play agreed to out-of-court compensation.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, the National {{opposition}} {{prompted the}} adoption of the statute in 1947 when its leader, and future prime minister, Sidney Holland introduced a private member's bill to abolish the Legislative Council. Because New Zealand required the consent of the British Parliament <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> amendments to the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, Peter Fraser, now Prime Minister, had a reason to finally adopt the statute. It was formally adopted on 25 November 1947 with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947, along with consenting legislation from the British Parliament—New Zealand was the last Dominion listed in the statute to adopt it.|$|E

Although the balloons {{turned out to be}} usable, the hydrogen-producing gear was absolutely worthless.

25|$|Initially, a {{group of}} benevolent {{creditors}} placed the company into receivership, believing it just needed some time to trade {{its way out of}} difficulty. Unfortunately, the group appointed Sommers N.

Seddinger and Smith were removed from their positions, and a more competent receiver appointed, but the latter was unable to persuade the creditors <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> investments to revive the company's fortunes, and in May 1908 the Neafie & Levy plant was sold for the sum of only $50,000.|$|E
