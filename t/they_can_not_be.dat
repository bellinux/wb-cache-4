5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from {{the internal combustion engine}} and regenerative braking, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained {{a photograph of}} a feral cat carrying a rabbit corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> increased.|$|E

25|$|Colic may {{be managed}} {{medically}} or surgically. Severe clinical signs often suggest {{the need for}} surgery, especially if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> controlled with analgesics. Immediate surgical intervention may be required, but surgery can be counter-indicated in some cases of colic, so diagnostic tests are used to help discover the cause of the colic and guide the practitioner in determining the need for surgery (See Diagnosis). The majority of colics (approximately 90%) can be successfully managed medically.|$|E
25|$|Preservation is {{a problem}} for fairyflies (and other small chalcid wasps). Their tiny sizes require special methods. Specimens have to be dried, if {{collected}} wet, e.g. if ethyl alcohol is used as the killing agent. Drying can make specimens extremely brittle, so additional care should also be taken not to disintegrate them. Mounting specimens (preferably in permanent slides) is also time-consuming and requires a fair amount of practice. They are gummed or glued onto cards, as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> mounted on pins like larger insects.|$|E

25|$|Tubs were hauled on rails {{within the}} pits, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> considered railways; notable among these was the inclined {{plane in the}} Wemyss no. 7 pit which ran out under the Firth of Forth from West Wemyss, from 1824. It was a single track operated by steam engine and haulage cable; as workings at various levels were served, branches were made at those levels. Because of the gradient of the incline, 29 degrees, ordinary turnout connections were not possible as the trams would tip sideways on the turnout; a form of drawbridge was {{used to make the}} connections.|$|E
25|$|When {{considering}} psycho-physical parallelism, superpositions appear {{rich enough}} to represent primitive conscious awareness. It seems that quantum superpositions have never been considered, for example, in neuronal models, since only classical states of deﬁnite neuronal excitation are usually taken into account. These quasi-classical states are also measured by external neurobiologists. Quantum theory would admit their superpositions, too, thus giving rise to a far greater variety of physical states which may be experienced by the subjective observer. When used for information processing, such superpositions would now be called “quantumbits” or qubits. As demonstrated by M. Tegmark, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> relevant for neuronal and similar processes in the brain.|$|E
25|$|Eurypterus {{belongs to}} the {{suborder}} Eurypterina, eurypterids in which the sixth appendage had developed a broad swimming paddle remarkably {{similar to that of}} the modern-day swimming crab. These appendages could only be moved in near-horizontal planes (i.e. <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> bent much upwards or downwards). They are generally thought to utilize a rowing type of locomotion. The paddles are almost vertically oriented on the backward and down stroke, pushing the animal forward and lifting it up. They are then oriented horizontally on the recovery stroke to slash through the water without pushing the animal back. This type of swimming is exhibited by crabs and water beetles.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is in fact}} arguable {{that the}} title arose even earlier, as his {{ancestor}} John Sutton (died 1359) had a writ of summons to the Council on 25 February 1342, but {{neither he nor his}} son (died [...] ), grandson (died 10 March 1396) or great grandson (all called John Sutton of Dudley) were summoned, so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> probably <b>not</b> <b>be</b> regarded as peers.|$|R
5000|$|Pisolites are {{spheroidal}} particles, {{larger in}} size and commonly more distorted than ooids. The name derives from the Greek pisos (pea). Mineral concentrations (bauxites, limonites, siderites) and the pedogenic caliches (subaerial environment) can have pisolitic structure. They usually reach 5-8 mm in diameter {{and for this reason}} <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> strictly <b>be</b> considered microspherulites. Dunham (1969) [...] considered them associated to caliches, while Pray and Esteban (1977) [...] suggested they were formed by inorganic precipitation from brines.|$|R

25|$|NTSC DVDs {{may carry}} closed {{captions}} in data packets of the MPEG-2 video streams {{inside of the}} Video-TS folder. Once played out of the analog outputs of a set top DVD player, the caption data is converted to the Line 21 format. They are output by the player to the composite video (or an available RF connector) for a connected TV's built-in decoder or a set-top decoder as usual. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> output on S-Video or component video outputs {{due to the lack}} of a colorburst signal on line 21. (Actually, regardless of this, if the DVD player is in interlaced rather than progressive mode, closed captioning will be displayed on the TV over component video input if the TV captioning is turned on and set to CC1.) When viewed on a personal computer, caption data can be viewed by software that can read and decode the caption data packets in the MPEG-2 streams of the DVD-Video disc. Windows Media Player (before Windows 7) in Vista supported only closed caption channels 1 and 2 (not 3 or 4). Apple's DVD Player does not have the ability to read and decode Line 21 caption data which are recorded on a DVD made from an over-the-air broadcast. It can display some movie DVD captions.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Miyazaki {{stated that}} Howl's Moving Castle was his {{favorite}} creation, and explained his choice by saying [...] "I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed." [...] In the film, Sophie is shown to overcome extreme challenges by learning to put the well-being of those she cares about above her own self-interest, a quality which Miyazaki refers to as devotion. Several of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films, such as Ashitaka and San in Princess Mononoke and Sheeta and Pazu in Castle in the Sky learn to survive by learning the same lesson. Cavallaro states that Miyazaki spreads this moral through the entire film, to convey human beings' ability to be compassionate, such as when the scarecrow holds an umbrella over Sophie's head when it rains. Over {{the course of the}} film, Howl, its most vain and selfish character, also learns to put others before himself. When Madame Suliman returns the Witch of the Waste to her true form as a decrepit old woman, Sophie takes her in and cares for her, despite the witch being responsible for Sophie's curse, thus strongly demonstrating the idea of compassion. The witch then nearly destroys Howl through her selfish behavior, but also helps save the castle at the end. Parsons writes that [...] "In Miyazaki's balancing act, old women can be powerful and weak, positive and negative, nurturing and selfish, maligned and loved; in short, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> simply categorized or stereotyped, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> dismissed as fantasy malefactors embodied by evil witches." [...] They are also given a lot of space in the film as active characters, something not commonly found in western movies.|$|E
