Raising <b>broilers</b> in the <b>cages</b> is another type of broiler housing system, but yet it is not commonly used. Raising <b>broilers</b> in <b>cage</b> system has many advantages when compared to raising broilers on the floor. The first obvious advantage is the better utilization of space available and that is important especially when the lands are expensive. In addition, using <b>cage</b> to raise <b>broilers</b> provide better hygienic condition {{that could lead to}} improving the health and quality of broilers. However, it is not known whether or not different broiler breeds will behave similarly when are raised in cage versus floor. Therefore, the current study was conducted to compare the production performance as well as %carcass of broilers raised in the <b>cage</b> system with <b>broilers</b> raised on the floor. In addition the %fat and %protein of meat from broilers raised under the two housing systems were measured. Three broiler breeds were used in three separate experiments. These breeds were Indian River, Cobb 500 and Ross. Data on body weight, feed consumption were measured at 1, 3 and 5 weeks of age. Feed efficiency, %mortality, %carcass were calculated. In addition the %protein and %fat of breasts and legs of different breeds under the two housing systems were measured. Our results indicate that raising <b>broilers</b> in <b>cages</b> could provide better production efficiency than raising broilers on the floor.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of performance and}} P reduction in litter and manure from broilers fed rations with and without phytase enzyme was made with chickens reared on litter or in cages. Low-activity phytase supplemented as a dry powder to mash diets did not affect performance, but litter P accumulation was decreased 14 to 21 % in the finisher phase. Manure P content of <b>broilers</b> in <b>cages</b> was reduced 14 to 19 % during the starter and grower phases. Liquid phytase applied postpelleting to diets with 0. 5 % total P (0. 3 % available P) reduced litter P accumulation (14 to 19 %) and reduced manure P content in starter, grower, and finisher phases of the study. Phosphorus content in raw manure was decreased by 55 % during the finisher phase. Feed conversions of <b>broilers</b> in <b>cages</b> and on conventional litter-covered floors were improved significantly with postpellet application of liquid phytase.

40|$|Bis (tri-tert-butoxigermanates), -stannates and -plumbates of Mg (1 a), Ca (1 b, 2 b, 3 b), Sr (1 c, 2 c, 3 c), Ba (1 d, 2 d, 3 d), Cd (1 e, 2 e, 3 e), Eu (1 f, 2 f, 3 f) and Pb (1 g, 2 g, 3 g) {{have been}} {{synthesized}} by various procedures from starting {{materials such as}} sodium tri-tert-butoxigermanate (5) and -plumbate (6) and other analogous compounds. While 1 g and 2 g the lead atom is situated {{in the middle of}} the molecule, it can also occupy two different coordination sites as in Pb(Ot) Bu) 3 Pb (3 g) and in Ge(OtBu) 3 Pb(OtBu) 3 Pb (7). X-ray structure investigations on 1 a, 1 b, 1 e, 1 f, 1 g, 2 b, 2 e, 2 g, 3 c, 3 d and 3 g reveal that all these molecules have a common ElO 3 MO 3 El <b>cage</b> <b>unit.</b> This <b>cage</b> <b>unit</b> can be visualized as two ElO 3 M trigonal bipyramids sharing the central metal M. Consequently in all structures the central element M is sixfold coordinated by oxygen while the outer metals (El) have three oxygen neighbours. The oxygen atoms are further bonded to tert-butyl-groups, which surround the whole ElO 3 Mo 3 El frame. Four different structure types have been fount to exist: a monoclinic type alpha (1 a), an orthorhombic type beta (1 b, 1 e, 2 b, 2 e), a rhombohedral type gamma (1 f, 1 g, 3 c, 3 d, 3 g) and a monoclinic type delta (2 g). In the beta-structure type the molecules are found to exist as three different isomers, depending on the arrangement of the alkoxy groups in a right- or left-handed manner within the El(OtBu) 3 groups (RR, SS and RS). Solution equilibria between theses isomers are observed by NMR. In the case of 1 e a more detailed picture of this intramolecular motion, attributed to the inversion of the trigonal-pyramidally coordinated oxygen atoms, can be given. CP-MAS-NMR-spectra as well as solution spectra have been obtained for 1 e (13 C, 113 Cd), 2 e (13 C, 113 Cd, 119 Sn), 2 g (119 Sn, 207 Pb), 3 g (13 C). While delta 113 Cd values of 2 e in solution and in the solid are comparable (92. 8 vs 73. 7 ppm), the 2 J(119 Sn/ 113 Cd) values rise from 39 Hz to 295 Hz. Detailed comparision of bond lengths and angles in the different derivatives shows that the "softness" of the El(OtBu) 3 groups (or the ability of the groups to accommodate a metal atom with respect to ist size) follows the order Sn(OtBu) 3 < Ge(OtBu) 3 < Pb(OtBu) 3. From these findings it can be explained, why the lead derivative 2 g shows stereochemical activity of the lone pair, while 1 g and 3 g do not show this effect at room temperature. All compounds except the lead derivatives 1 g, 2 g, 3 g and 7 are colourless...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{interactions}} and metal−metal communication {{in a wide}} range of cobaltacarborane−hydrocarbon complexes containing one to six metal centers, and exhibiting a variety of modes of inter-cage connectivity and molecular architectures, have been investigated via cyclic voltammetry, controlled potential coulometry, and UV−visible spectroelectrochemistry. The properties of mixed-valent CoIII/CoIV and CoII/CoIII species that are generated on oxidation or reduction of dinuclear and polynuclear CoIII complexes were examined and classified as Robin-Day Class I (localized), Class II (partially delocalized), or Class III (fully delocalized) systems. The extent of metal−metal communication between metallacarborane <b>cage</b> <b>units</b> is strongly influenced by the type of intercage connection (e. g., cage B−B or Cp−Cp); the vertexes involved (equatorial vs apical); the nature of the linking unit, if any; and the presence of substituents on the carborane cages. In multi-tripledecker complexes where three CpCo(C 2 B 3 H 4) CoCp units are linked through a central triethynyl benzene connector, the data suggest that Co−Co electronic communication is extensive (Class III) within individual sandwich units while intersandwich delocalization is weak or absent. An extended Hückel study of CpCoC 2 B 4 H 6 double-decker and CpCo(C 2 B 3 H 5) CoCp triple-decker sandwich model complexes shows significant differences in the orbital contributions involved in the HOMO and LUMO of the former vs the latter type. The calculations afford additional insight into the electronic structures and properties of these systems as elucidated by the experimental studies...|$|R
