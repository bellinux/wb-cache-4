In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin {{may be used}} to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. <b>Topical</b> <b>application</b> of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.|$|E
40|$|SKH- 1 hairless mice were {{irradiated}} with ultraviolet B (UVB) twice weekly for 20 weeks. These tumor-free mice, {{which had}} {{a high risk of}} developing skin tumors during the next several months, were then treated topically with caffeine (6. 2 μmol) or (−) -epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG; 6. 5 μmol) once a day 5 days a week for 18 weeks in the absence of further treatment with UVB. <b>Topical</b> <b>applications</b> of caffeine to these mice decreased the number of nonmalignant and malignant skin tumors per mouse by 44 % and 72 %, respectively. <b>Topical</b> <b>applications</b> of EGCG decreased the number of nonmalignant and malignant tumors per mouse by 55 % and 66 %, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that <b>topical</b> <b>applications</b> of caffeine or EGCG increased apoptosis as measured by the number of caspase 3 -positive cells in nonmalignant skin tumors by 87 % or 72 %, respectively, and in squamous cell carcinomas by 92 % or 56 %, respectively, but there was no effect on apoptosis in nontumor areas of the epidermis. <b>Topical</b> <b>applications</b> of caffeine or EGCG had a small inhibitory effect on proliferation in nonmalignant tumors as measured by BrdUrd labeling (16 – 22 %), and there was also a similar, but nonsignificant, inhibitory effect on proliferation in malignant tumors. The results suggest a need for further studies to determine whether <b>topical</b> <b>applications</b> of caffeine or EGCG can inhibit sunlight-induced skin cancer in humans...|$|R

5|$|Salicylic acid is a topically applied beta-hydroxy acid {{that stops}} {{bacteria}} from reproducing and has keratolytic properties. It opens obstructed skin pores and promotes shedding of epithelial skin cells. Salicylic acid {{is known to}} be less effective than retinoid therapy.

5|$|Oil {{from the}} flowers was used against catarrhs, colics and, in Germany, earaches, frostbite, eczema and other {{external}} conditions. <b>Topical</b> <b>application</b> of various V.thapsus-based preparations was recommended {{for the treatment}} of warts, boils, carbuncles, hemorrhoids, and chilblains, amongst others. Recent studies have found that great mullein contains glycyrrhizin compounds with bactericide and potential anti-tumoral action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the National Formulary in the United States and United Kingdom. The plant's leaves, in addition to the seeds, have been reported to contain rotenone, although quantities are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests <b>topical</b> <b>application</b> of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E

5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper <b>topical</b> <b>application</b> of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E

50|$|Severe acne usually {{indicates}} {{the necessity of}} prescription medication to treat the pimples. Prescription medications used to treat acne and pimples include isotretinoin, which is a retinoid. Historically, antibiotics such as tetracyclines and erythromycin were prescribed. While they were more effective than <b>topical</b> <b>applications</b> of benzoyl peroxide, the bacteria eventually grew resistant to the antibiotics and the treatments became less and less effective. Also, antibiotics had more side effects than <b>topical</b> <b>applications,</b> such as stomach cramps and severe discoloration of teeth. Common antibiotics prescribed by dermatologists include doxycycline and minocycline. For more severe cases of acne dermatologists might recommend accutane, a retinoid {{that is the most}} potent of acne treatments. However, accutane can cause various side effects including vomiting, diarrhea, and birth defects if taken during pregnancy.|$|R

40|$|Recently, we {{demonstrated}} the safety use of calendula oil/chitosan microcapsules as a carrier for both oral and topical deliveries.

25|$|Until 1913, {{oral and}} maxillofacial surgery was {{performed}} by mask inhalation anesthesia, <b>topical</b> <b>application</b> of local anesthetics to the mucosa, rectal anesthesia, or intravenous anesthesia. While otherwise effective, these techniques did not protect the airway from obstruction and also exposed patients {{to the risk of}} pulmonary aspiration of blood and mucus into the tracheobronchial tree. In 1913, Chevalier Jackson (1865–1958) was the first to report a high rate of success for the use of direct laryngoscopy as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that had a light source at the distal tip, rather than the proximal light source used by Kirstein. This new blade incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope.|$|E
25|$|<b>Topical</b> <b>application</b> of {{progesterone}} {{with the}} intention of systemic therapy should not be equated with local treatment. Despite {{the fact that it is}} not approved for use in menopausal HRT, topical progesterone is registered in some countries under the brand name Progestogel as a 1% gel for direct local application to the breasts to treat premenstrual mastodynia (breast pain). It has been found in clinical studies to inhibit estrogen-induced proliferation of breast epithelial cells and to abolish breast pain and tenderness in women with the condition. The effectiveness of topical progesterone for this indication may be related in part to the fact that the site of application of topical progesterone has been found to significantly influence its absorption. A study observed a significant increase in serum levels of progesterone when it was applied as a topical ointment to the breasts but not when it was applied to other areas like the thigh or abdomen.|$|E
