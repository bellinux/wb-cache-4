Byrd, Sr. organized the Massive Resistance movement {{that included the}} closing of schools rather than desegregating <b>them.</b> <b>See,</b> for example, The Southern Manifesto.

5|$|Alice and Meg have {{received}} Falstaff's letters. They compare <b>them,</b> <b>see</b> {{that they are}} identical and, together with Mistress Quickly and Nannetta Ford, resolve to punish Falstaff. Meanwhile, Ford has been warned of the letters by Bardolfo and Pistola. All three are thirsty for revenge and are supported by Dr Caius and Fenton, a young gentleman. To Ford's disapproval, Fenton {{is in love with}} Nannetta. Finding a moment to be alone, the young lovers exchange banter. They are interrupted by the return of Alice, Meg and Mistress Quickly. The act ends with an ensemble in which the women and the men separately plan revenge on Falstaff.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed tapetum lucidum, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. This helps <b>them</b> <b>see</b> in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E

5|$|The {{provitamin}} A beta-carotene from carrots {{does not}} actually help {{people to see}} in the dark unless they suffer from a deficiency of vitamin A. This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels. Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help <b>them</b> <b>see</b> better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.|$|E

25|$|Symon Petliura, who {{was head}} of the Directorate of the Ukrainian National Republic in 1919, had moved to Paris in 1924 and {{was the head of the}} government-in-exile of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Sholom Schwartzbard, who had lost his family in the 1919 pogroms, held Symon Petliura {{responsible}} for <b>them</b> (<b>see</b> the discussion on Petliura's role in the pogroms). According to his autobiography, after hearing the news that Petliura had relocated to Paris, Schwartzbard became distraught and started plotting Petliura's assassination. A picture of Petliura with Józef Piłsudski published in the Encyclopedia Larousse allowed Schwartzbard to recognize him.|$|E
25|$|Pamela Barnes Ewing was {{severely}} {{injured in a}} car accident in the tenth season finale in 1987, and left Bobby and Christopher due to her apparent inability to let <b>them</b> <b>see</b> her in such a physically disfigured fashion. Nevertheless, while Victoria Principal never returned again to the series, Margaret Michaels, a Principal look-alike, played the character in a season 12 episode. Having undergone plastic surgery which explained the difference in her appearance, it was revealed that Pam was dying of a disease, though only she and her doctor knew. After this, Pam is never seen in Dallas again. Unable to reach a salary agreement, it was Principal's own decision to not renew her Dallas contract.|$|E
25|$|Coins {{are usually}} metal or alloy, or {{sometimes}} made of synthetic materials. They are usually disc shaped. Coins made of valuable metal {{are stored in}} large quantities as bullion coins. Other coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes. Usually the highest value coin in circulation (i.e. excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. In the last hundred years, the face value of circulation coins has occasionally been lower than {{the value of the}} metal they contain, for example due to inflation. If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, or the public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard <b>them</b> (<b>see</b> Gresham's law).|$|E
