40|$|In {{the fast}} {{collision}} approximation, the scattering amplitude operator of the quasi-elastic scattering is expressed as the summation of multipole moment operators M(k) (li,si) of the valence shell {{involved in the}} resonance 1 with distinct polarization factors. Each multipole moment operator is expressed as the sum of an orbital moment operator and two spin-orbital moment operators with unique coefficients. The explicit form of these coefficients is obtained and the numerical values are calculated. For the transitions to continuous bands, the explicit forms of M(k) (li,si) are extended from electric dipole transitions to any electric multipole transitions. Within the manifolds of good total L and good total S, the k th rank multipole moment operator M(k) (li,si) can be {{expressed in terms of}} the k th rank spin-orbital moments M(k) (L,S) of the total L- and total S-operators of the valence shell involved in the resonance. Furthermore, within the manifolds of good <b>total</b> <b>J,</b> M(k) (li,si) can be further simplified in terms of the spherical tensor operators of the <b>total</b> <b>J</b> of the resonance valence shell. For Hund's rule ground states, the corresponding proportionality coefficients for both cases were obtained. For rare earths, we obtained the thermal expectation value of M(k) (li,si) at T = 0 for coherent elastic scattering. These results are inconsistent with Hamrick's single electron method 2 for {{the second half of the}} rare earth series. For the first half of the rare earth series, we showed that the single electron method is an approximation of our theory. In spiral antiferromagnets, such as holmium, the magnetic sensitivity results in a series of magnetic satellites distributed at each side of Bragg peak. This behavior can be understood on the basis of the XRES electric multipole transition theory we developed. As temperature increases, the higher order harmonics decrease more rapidly than the lower order harmonics, which can be qualitatively explained by mean-field theory. Just above the Neel temperature, there is weak magnetic scattering which can be understood as the short range moment-moment correlations of different spin-orbital multipole moment operators. ftn 1 J.

40|$|The quantum state-counting phase space theory {{commonly}} used to describe barrierless dissociation is recast in a helicity basis to calculate photofragment v{center_dot}j correlations. Counting pairs of fragment states with specific angular momentum projection numbers on the relative velocity provides a simple connection between angular momentum conservation and the v{center_dot}j correlation, which is not so evident in the conventional basis for phase space state counts. The upper bound on the orbital angular momentum, l, imposed by the centrifugal barrier cannot be included simply in the helicity basis, where l {{is not a good}} quantum number. Two approaches for a quantum calculation of the v{center_dot}j correlation are described to address this point. An application to the photodissociation of NCCN is consistent with recent classical phase space calculations of Cline and Klippenstein. The observed vector correlation exceeds the phase space theory prediction. The authors take this as evidence of incomplete mixing of the K states of the linear parent molecule at the transition state, corresponding to an evolution of the body-fixed projection number K into the total helicity of the fragment pair state.

We have now repeated this study using a larger, quenched lattice to check that there the finite size effects are under control. Also the effect of quenching is studied by using dynamical fermion configurations. In the latter case the lattice spacing a is smaller, which allows one to make an estimate of a → 0 corrections. The new measurements confirm the earlier calculated energy spectrum. From some theoretical considerations it is expected that, for high angular momentum states, the multiplets should be inverted compared with the Coulomb spectrum, i. e. L − should lie higher than L+ [2]. This happens when a pure scalar confining potential is present. Here the notation L+(−) means that the light quark spin couples to angular momentum L giving the <b>total</b> <b>j</b> =L± 1 / 2.
