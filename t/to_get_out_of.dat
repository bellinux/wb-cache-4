5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E

5|$|After an aborted {{attempt by}} Kennedy to bring yet another studio that {{had turned to}} him for help, First National Pictures, into the Photophone fold, RCA was ready to step back in: the company {{acquired}} Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced {{the creation of the}} Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Pathé separate from RKO and under his personal control. RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent; in the early 1930s, RCA's share of stock in the company rose as high as 60 percent. The company's production and distribution arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer, was incorporated early in 1929 as Radio Pictures. Looking <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the film business the following year, Kennedy arranged in late 1930 for RKO to purchase Pathé from him.|$|E
