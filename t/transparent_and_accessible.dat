40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give a simple, {{geometric}} proof of Wigner's theorem on the realization of symmetries in quantum mechanics that clarifies its relation to projective geometry. Although several proofs exist already, it seems that the relevance of Wigner's theorem is not fully appreciated in general. It is Wigner's theorem which allows the use of linear realizations of symmetries and therefore guarantees that, in the end, quantum theory stays a linear theory. In the present paper, we take a strictly geometrical point of view in order to prove this theorem. It becomes apparent that Wigner's theorem is nothing else but a corollary of the fundamental theorem of projective geometry. In this sense, the proof presented here is simple, <b>transparent</b> <b>and</b> therefore <b>accessible</b> even to elementary treatments in quantum mechanics. Comment: 8 page...|$|R

The ad campaign includes, in the words of one Centre Daily Times journalist Bob Myers, [...] "real Pennsylvanians talking earnestly about the wonderful experiences they’ve had with Range Resources". According to Elwin Green of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Range Resources stands out because most gas companies generally prefer to keep a low profile, preferring to [...] "tout their successes to Wall Street, but not to Main Street". In contrast, Range Resources' campaign uses testimonials such as, [...] "Natural gas has been ... a godsend to this area," [...] from farmers or [...] "In the last two years, probably 60 percent of our business is natural gas," [...] from local business owners. Vice president Ray Walker was quoted as saying, [...] "A lot of people don't know much about our industry or about Range Resources...we're committed to being the very best that we can be. We want to be accountable, <b>transparent</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessible</b> to people." [...] Videos produced by public relations firms Big Picture Communications and Downtown's Animal Inc. used [...] "unscripted video and purposely avoided using company spokespeople". Blake Lewis, CEO of Lewis Public Relations in Dallas and a board member of the Public Relations Society of America gave Range Resources' website [...] "high marks". However, journalists' reactions have been skeptical or mixed. According to Myers, [...] "a quick review of the state Department of Environmental Protection records suggests that the truth is more complicated than the ads suggest...the folks at Range define good stewardship in a slightly different manner than is customary."

50|$|The Society of Floristry Limited {{was formed}} in 1951 to meet the growing need for {{professional}} recognition for florists. Its first major task, after forming a Council of directors composed of leading florists in the industry, was to write, run and mark examinations in floristry skills and theory, which it did successfully for almost 49 years. It developed into an educational and standard-setting body which pioneered the concept of floristry as a profession, running regular workshops and educational seminars for florists undertaking study and continuing professional development. The Society also ran a highly successful trade show for many years, enabling the best exponents of the craft to showcase their skills and talents, and for the support industries in the trade to launch and promote their product. These shows were attended by thousands of florists and students over the years, raising standards and pushing back the boundaries of commercial floral design. The cornerstone {{of the success of}} the Society was the ability of training providers to draw down Government funding for courses which supported what became the gold standard qualifications in the UK for florists, the Intermediate Certificate of the Society of Floristry (ICSF) and the National Diploma of the Society of Floristry (NDSF). When the ability to draw this funding was removed a few years ago in an initiative to reduce the number of organisations awarding recognised qualifications, the number of florists able to afford to attend colleges and the ability of those colleges to offer courses toward the examinations was severely restricted. As a consequence, the number coming forward to be examined dropped off significantly, and the pass rate amongst those who did fell also. The Society did not want to see a situation develop where its standards were eroded, and entered into negotiations with NPTC City and Guilds to write recognised qualifications at Higher Education level to replace the well-recognised and valued ICSF and NDSF. The courses came into existence during 2006 - see http://www.nptc.org.uk/qualifications/default.asp?area=130. This had a number of advantages for candidates: Colleges were funded so courses were available and more affordable; college support for learning needs could be accessed; the standards and skills required became more <b>transparent</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessible.</b> However, the result for the Society was that its reason for existing was seriously eroded. On 28.2.10 the Society ceased trading and was acquired and absorbed into the British Florist Association.|$|E
