5000|$|Phthalates ( [...] , [...] ), or {{phthalate}} esters, are esters of {{phthalic acid}} and are mainly used as plasticizers (substances added to plastics {{to increase their}} flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity). Phthalates are manufactured by reacting phthalic anhydride with alcohol(s) that range from methanol and ethanol (C1/C2) up to <b>tridecyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (C13), either as a straight chain or with some branching. They are divided into two distinct groups, with very different applications, toxicological properties, and classification, {{based on the number}} of carbon atoms in their alcohol chain. They are used primarily to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Lower-molecular-weight phthalates (3-6 carbon atoms in their backbone) are being gradually replaced in many products in the United States, Canada, and European Union over health concerns. They are replaced by high-molecular-weight phthalates (those with more than 6 carbons in their backbone, which gives them increased permanency and durability). In 2010, the market was still dominated by high-phthalate plasticizers; however, due to legal provisions and growing environmental awareness and perceptions, producers are increasingly forced to use non-phthalate plasticizers.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} how dilution of vermicompost Leachate {{combined with}} different concentrations of NPK triple 17 fertilizer and polyoxyethylene <b>tridecyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> as dispersant and polyethylene nonylphenol as adherent {{to increase efficiency}} of fertilizer uptake, affected maize plant development. The vermicomposting leachate with pH 7. 8 and electrolytic conductivity 2. 6 dS m - 1, contained 834 mg K + L - 1, 247 mg NO 3 - 1 L - 1 and 168 mg PO 4 3 â€“ L - 1, was free of pathogens and resulted in a 65 % germination index. Vermicompost Leachate diluted to 50 % and mixed with 170 g L - 1 NPK resulted in the best maize plant development while the dispersant and adherent had no significant effect. It was found that vermicompost leachate stimulated plant development when diluted, but fertilization with NPK was required for maximum growth...|$|E
