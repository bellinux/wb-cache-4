25|$|There were {{plans for}} a major {{redevelopment}} of the station area in the late 1980s, which involved construction of high-rise condominiums with 300 apartments, underground parking and a shopping- and sports center, partially over and partially under the tracks.

25|$|Locals demanded {{during the}} 1990s that the station be upgraded. They main {{concern was that}} the {{northern}} platform was wooden and in poor shape, and a safety hazard {{as it would be}} slippery when wet. Grants for the upgrade were initially issued in 2001, but in the last minute reallocated to Skøyen Station. In 2005 money was again put aside, but with only one tender the Norwegian National Rail Administration had to postpone the work. Construction commenced on 22 September 2006. The upgrade also included a new underpass under the tracks at the station, which acts as part of a continuous recreational path from Lillomarka to the Oslofjord. The project cost 32 million Norwegian krone and was opened on 21 August 2007. Real time <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> systems for the public were installed in 2010.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{advances}} in traffic monitoring systems have made real-time traffic velocity data ubiquitously accessible for drivers. This paper develops a traffic data-enabled predictive energy management framework for a power-split plug-in {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (PHEV). Compared with conventional model predictive control (MPC), an additional supervisory state of charge (SOC) planning level is constructed based on real-time traffic data. A power balance-based PHEV model is developed for this upper level to rapidly generate battery SOC trajectories that utilized as final state constraints in the MPC level. This PHEV energy management framework is evaluated under three different scenarios: (i) without <b>traffic</b> flow <b>information,</b> (ii) with static <b>traffic</b> flow <b>information,</b> and (iii) with dynamic <b>traffic</b> flow <b>information.</b> Numerical results using real-world traffic data illustrate that the proposed strategy successfully incorporates dynamic traffic flow data into the PHEV energy management algorithm to achieve enhanced fuel economy...|$|R
