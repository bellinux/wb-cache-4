DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of <b>thing.</b> <b>We</b> <b>want</b> the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E
500|$|On {{the return}} of Overwatchs closed beta in February 2016, victory poses, among other {{elements}} {{were added to the}} characters. In March 2016, a controversy arose over Tracer's [...] "Over the Shoulder" [...] victory pose, after a user opined in the game's forums that it was out of character and that its supposed oversexualization [...] "reduces Tracer to just another bland female sex symbol". The post generated a discussion in the forums, which gaming outlets noted was civil; several users added their dissenting opinions of the pose, while others disagreed with the original poster's thoughts. Kaplan posted an apologetic response in which he announced Blizzard's plans to replace the pose, writing [...] "the last <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to do is make someone feel uncomfortable, under-appreciated or misrepresented". The decision was met with mixed reactions from the gaming community, with some gamers arguing that Blizzard yielded its creative control over the game, censoring its content to appease an offended user, while others praised Blizzard's willingness to listen to the community and adhere to standards for portraying a character according to their personality. Kaplan later expressed that the game's development team was not [...] "entirely happy with the original pose", and had internal creative struggles about its inclusion. The following week, a replacement pose was released, although it was described by one commentator to be [...] "different, butt not by much" [...] referring to the posterior cleavage of the original pose.

Kaplan later stated that the team was already unsure of the pose and was thinking of changing it. The following week, a replacement pose was released, although it was noted to be similar to the original pose.

2500|$|The {{band members}} grew their hair long and allied {{themselves}} to the glam rock movement of the early 1970s. Hill's stage costumes also became notable during this period. Many of Holder's costumes during this period, including the trademark mirror top hat, were made by Dorothy [...] "Dolly" [...] Annakin—a sister of Holder's friend Ron Annakin. Chandler now demanded the band write a follow-up single themselves which led to Lea and Holder writing [...] "Coz I Luv You". The song was written {{in half an hour}} and started a writing partnership which would continue throughout Slade's career. Upon hearing the track played to him acoustically, a pleased Chandler predicted the song would make number one. While recording, the band felt the song's sound to be too soft, and so clapping was added. The song's misspelled title also became a trademark for Slade while causing a furor among British school teachers. The attendant appearance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops brought Slade to a wider audience as well as pushing [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] to number one in the UK charts. In November 1971, NME reported that Slade had turned down a multimillion-dollar campaign, including a television series and a heavily promoted tour of the US. [...] "But", commented Holder, [...] "acceptance would have meant the cancellation of many commitments here – and the last <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to do is to mess around the people who have put us where we are".|$|E
