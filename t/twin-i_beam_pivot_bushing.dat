5000|$|Weissach axle - {{a variant}} of Double {{wishbone}} suspension with a short link at the front <b>pivot</b> <b>bushing</b> of the lower A-arm ...|$|R
50|$|Usually the {{connecting}} rod to the crankshaft is placed between the piston and the <b>beam's</b> <b>pivot.</b> That is, {{they use a}} second-class lever, rather than the usual first-class lever.|$|R
5000|$|For the Weissach axle, {{the front}} <b>pivot</b> <b>bushing</b> of the {{trailing}} arm {{is replaced by}} a short link. In this arrangement, when the vehicle decelerates and the wheel is [...] "pulled" [...] back, the result is toe in. This adds to stability and thus, reduces oversteer.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the heavy}} masonry engine house {{used to support}} the <b>beam</b> and <b>pivot</b> of a {{conventional}} beam engine, the grasshopper <b>beam</b> was <b>pivoted</b> on a swinging link. The crankpin was carried directly by the beam and moved {{in a straight line}} vertically, the <b>beam</b> <b>pivot</b> moving slightly sideways on its link to allow this. This simplified the need for a parallel motion linkage on the piston rod. Grasshopper engines were thus lighter than conventional beam engines and could be built completely in factories, rather than requiring considerable erection work to be carried out on-site. This encouraged the use of grasshopper engines for smaller sized engines. Some makers, notably Easton & Amos of Southwark, specialised in such engines. Many were used for pumping, but not for powering large mills.|$|R
50|$|TS250: Developed {{from the}} ES/ETS {{machines}} {{but with a}} new frame. The engine hung from the top <b>beam</b> <b>pivoting</b> at the rear with no front down tube. Early models were four-speed machines with the vertical finned cylinder head but the later machines had the flat top engine and five-speed gear box, {{the basis of the}} later models. These models were all 6-volt and pre-mix fuel.|$|R
50|$|These engines were a {{development}} after the house-built engine. Their cast-iron frames {{could be built}} and test-assembled at a factory before delivery, allowing rapid assembly or 'erection' once on site. Their main advantage was that they avoided the need for complex masonry foundations in their engine house, merely a simple level platform to which the iron frame could be bolted. The difficult alignment between their cylinder, the <b>beam</b> <b>pivot</b> and the crankshaft was all {{taken care of by}} the factory-made frame. Although {{the upper part of the}} frame only supports the <b>beam's</b> central <b>pivot</b> and any Watt's parallel motion gear, it also has an important function in stiffening the frame overall against vertical bending forces between the cylinder and crankshaft. Cast iron is weak against bending, and a shallow frame alone would need either rigid masonry support, or would soon fracture.|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{grasshopper}} engines {{placed the}} crankshaft between the piston and the <b>beam's</b> <b>pivot.</b> This allows a long stroke for the piston, with a shorter stroke for the crank, although with greater force. This was advantageous for early low-pressure steam engines that had limited cylinder force but could increase their power {{by using a}} longer cylinder. A few exceptions, those of the Americans Oliver Evans' boats and Phineas Davis' Grasshopper locomotives, reversed this and placed the cylinder in between the pivot and crank: a third-class lever.|$|R
50|$|Six-column beam {{engines are}} {{a means of}} {{constructing}} a beam engine, where the <b>beam's</b> central <b>pivot</b> is supported on a cast-iron frame or 'bedstead', supported on six iron columns.|$|R
5|$|Grasshopper beam engines were <b>beam</b> engines <b>pivoted</b> at one end, {{the long}} {{horizontal}} arm resembling the hind {{leg of a}} grasshopper. The type was patented by William Freemantle in 1803.|$|R
50|$|Larger engines {{rarely used}} the six-column form, as the upper {{framework}} would become unwieldy. The {{weight of their}} large beams {{was more than the}} slim columns supporting the <b>beam</b> <b>pivot</b> could cope with. A rare form was the eight-column engine, where the pivot was supported by four close-set pillars rather than two. An example of such an engine survives at Markfield Road. With the extra power of the largest engines, the bending forces on the frame would become too much altogether and these engines used either masonry beds, or a deep iron bed casting, set {{at the base of the}} engine.|$|R
5000|$|The pump was {{operated}} by a breastshot water wheel which was direct coupled to a three-throw crankshaft (cast in 1912) which swung three 12 ft long <b>beams</b> <b>pivoted</b> at one end through connecting rods. The pump plunger rods connected to the outer free ends of the beams travel in a substantially straight-line motion; these were fitted with back to back 6 in diameter leather cups and non-return valves made from leather flaps. The pump has three cylinders with a 6.5 in bore and a stroke of 13 in. The pump could produce an operating pressure of in excess of [...]|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Available {{output in}} the Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (SLO) may be {{expressed}} as radiant {{power at the}} <b>beam</b> <b>pivot</b> (SLO exit pupil), in units of microwatts (mW). This power corresponds to dimensions of brightness (like luminance and retinal illuminance) and {{to a range of}} related measures (like cd/m 2, lm/m 2, and the troland value) in both free and Maxwellian views. We demonstrate that the conversion factor power/troland= 1. 26 * 1023 mW and 3. 15 * 1024 mW for SLO nomi-nal visual angles 40 ˚ and 20 ˚, respectively. The factor permits mea-sured SLO power to be expressed in units of brightness and (inversely) brightnesses of everyday objects to be expressed in units of SLO power. Examples of both conversions are given. Reference to the literature demonstrates the importance of express-ing SLO power in brightness terms common to everyday activitie...|$|R
40|$|NASA s Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Project {{will send}} a six-wheeled rover to Mars in 2009. The rover will carry a {{scientific}} payload designed to search for organic molecules on the Martian surface during its primary mission. This paper describes the development and testing of a bonded film lubricated bushing system {{to be used in}} the mobility system of the rover. The MSL Rover Mobility System contains several pivots that are tightly constrained with respect to mass and volume. These pivots are also exposed to relatively low temperatures (- 135 C) during operation. The combination of these constraints led the mobility team to consider the use of solid film lubricated metallic bushings and dry running polymeric bushings in several flight pivot applications. A test program was developed to mitigate the risk associated with using these materials in critical pivots on the MSL vehicle. The program was designed to characterize bushing friction and wear performance over the expected operational temperature range (- 135 C to + 70 C). Seven different bushing material / lubricant combinations were evaluated to aid in the selection of the final flight <b>pivot</b> <b>bushing</b> material / lubricant combination...|$|R

The <b>beam</b> replacement switches are {{used on the}} mainline and multi-position pivot switches are used in storage yard areas. In both cases, they are structural steel assemblies incorporating steel guideway <b>beams</b> that <b>pivot</b> to provide guidance and support, routing the train from one lane to another. Power rails are continuous throughout the switches to maintain vehicle propulsion.|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the common}} faults {{associated}} with suspension components are damaged or leaking shock absorbers, spring weakness, wearing down of the <b>pivot</b> and <b>bushing</b> and damage to the main support member assembly. To investigate these problems, a seven degree-of-freedom (7 - DOF) model has been developed, for a full vehicle, using MATLAB.

50|$|A handcar (also {{known as}} a pump trolley, pump car, jigger, Kalamazoo, velocipede, or draisine) is a {{railroad}} car powered by its passengers, or by people pushing the car from behind. It is mostly used as a maintenance of way or mining car, {{but it was also}} used for passenger service in some cases. A typical design consists of an arm, called the walking <b>beam,</b> that <b>pivots,</b> seesaw-like, on a base, which the passengers alternately push down and pull up to move the car.|$|R
40|$|Work-Life balance {{stems from}} the fact that workers as human beings have other needs beside the {{economic}} ones. Individuals have to divide their time among various domains such as work, family, community, religion and recreation. To many people, especially those who are in gainful employment, work tends to be the central activity around which all other activities revolve. In other words the work schedule determines in one way or another how individuals fulfil their commitments in the non-work domains which consist mainly of family and social life. Life becomes a balancing act. In a balance an equilibrium is reached when the weights, placed on one pan, are equivalent to the weight of the substance on the other pan, so that the <b>beam</b> <b>pivoted</b> at the centre is in horizontal position. What this metaphor therefore implies is that there should be an equilibrium between the work and non-work domains. In other words the presupposition of this perspective is that there should be an appropriate distribution of time allocated between work and non work. Work-Life balance has become a more topical issue since many institutions are demanding from their employees a kind of time commitment which in the past was only expected fro...|$|R
50|$|On {{the hollow}} shafts {{there are two}} {{ventilated}} disc brakes, {{for which there is}} enough room due to the missing cross <b>beam</b> and <b>pivot</b> pin, as mentioned above. The disc brakes are separate and are ventilated from the inside. They can be serviced or replaced from below, without needing to take out the entire axle. During regular braking, primarily the regenerative brake is used, and the traction motor serves as the generator. The cooperation between disc brakes and regenerative brakes is controlled by a dedicated brake control computer.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} wear on {{a roller chain}} is to {{increase}} the pitch (spacing of the links), causing the chain to grow longer. Note that this is due to wear at the <b>pivoting</b> pins and <b>bushes,</b> not from actual stretching of the metal (as does happen to some flexible steel components such as the hand-brake cable of a motor vehicle).|$|R

50|$|The piston was {{attached}} by a chain {{to a large}} <b>pivoted</b> <b>beam.</b> When the piston pulled the beam, {{the other side of}} the beam was pulled upward. This end {{was attached}} to a rod that pulled on a series of conventional pump handles in the mine. At the end of this power stroke, the steam valve was reopened, and the weight of the pump rods pulled the beam down, lifting the piston and drawing steam into the cylinder again.|$|R

A charged rod is held near a wooden beam that is mounted on a pivot, as shown in Figure 1. The electric field of the charged rod polarizes the charge in the water molecules in the beam. Because the electric field is non-uniform, a net attractive force is exerted between the rod and the polarized molecules. This attractive force rotates the wooden <b>beam</b> on its <b>pivot...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Dana 50 {{was made}} as a solid axle and as a Twin Traction <b>Beam</b> (TTB) which <b>pivots</b> in the center {{allowing}} the wheels to move independently of each other. A unique quality of the Dana 50 axle {{is the lack of}} variation in both TTB and Solid axle versions, which simplifies repairs and upgrades. There were no carrier breaks and only one spline count (30 spline). Gross axle weight ratings were lowered by Ford for safety and tire reasons.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, Jeep used {{a unique}} Dana 44 IFS setup, that was short lived. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ford used {{a form of}} IFS known as [...] "Twin Traction Beam" [...] (TTB). This Dana 44 had no axle tubes but {{attached}} to the driver side traction beam, which also acted as a cover plate, and had [...] "open air" [...] axles which traveled through the beams to the spindles. The axles had u-joints {{to allow for the}} independent action of the <b>beams.</b> Individual <b>pivot</b> points for the beams at greater than center made each beam longer than half the overall width crossing in the middle. This allowed for an independent front suspension design. Ford TTB Dana 44 axles all utilized locking hubs. The TTB set-up is based on Ford's highly successful Twin I-beam design on two-wheel-drive pick-up truck models.|$|R
25|$|In 1813, William Hedley and Timothy Hackworth {{designed}} a locomotive (Puffing Billy) {{for use on}} the tramway between Stockton and Darlington. Puffing Billy featured piston rods extending upwards to <b>pivoting</b> <b>beams,</b> connected in turn by rods to a crankshaft beneath the frames which, in turn, drove the gears attached to the wheels. This meant that the wheels were coupled, allowing better traction. A year later, George Stephenson improved on that design with his first locomotive Blücher, {{which was the first}} locomotive to use single-flanged wheels.|$|R
50|$|The DVM-4 is of a hood-type design, with a cab at one end, {{external}} walkways {{around the}} engine compartment, and a welded steel frame. It has two-axle bogies with box <b>beams</b> and transverse <b>pivot</b> bars; the journal boxes have SKF roller bearings. Tractive and braking forces are transmitted via pins. The gearbox was set with {{a gear ratio}} of 73:21=3.476. The locomotive is equipped with Knorr air brakes and handbrakes; air for the brake system is supplied by an MK-135 three-cylinder, two-stage compressor. Brake pads are located at either side of each wheel.|$|R
50|$|The hind end of {{the frame}} was {{redesigned}} and the bridle casting was removed and replaced by a frame plate, riveted to the main bar frame and carried through to the hind buffer beam. A new steel casting, extending across and over the main frame, added rigidity {{and served as a}} support for the boiler at the throat plate. A new design of drag box was installed. While the trailing Bissel truck remained unaltered, its side control was re-designed and a new compensating <b>beam</b> and support <b>pivot</b> was fitted.|$|R
2500|$|Before the {{development}} of the double acting piston, the linkage to the beam and the piston rod had been by means of a chain, which meant that power could only be applied in one direction, by pulling. This was effective in engines that were used for pumping water, but the double action of the piston meant that it could push as well as pull. This was not possible as long as the beam and the rod were connected by a chain. Furthermore, {{it was not possible to}} connect the piston rod of the sealed cylinder directly to the beam, because while the rod moved vertically in a straight line, the <b>beam</b> was <b>pivoted</b> at its centre, with each side inscribing an arc. To bridge the conflicting actions of the beam and the piston, Watt developed his parallel motion. This masterpiece of engineering uses a four bar linkage coupled with a pantograph to produce the required straight line motion much more cheaply than if he had used a slider type of linkage. [...] He was very proud of his solution.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a real pivot formed by a double-clamped beam for the rotational tuning structures in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) tunable lasers. Micromechanical properties such as <b>beam</b> deformation, <b>pivot</b> position and pivot shift are investigated and compared with the virtual pivot formed by a cantilever beam. It is shown that the real pivot has negligible shift when subjected to load and fabrication error owing to its feature of structural symmetry, while the virtual pivot suffers from significant pivot shift, which would severely limit the wavelength tuning range. The two pivot designs are implemented into MEMS tuning structures that are fabricated by deep etching and released using a dry release approach. The real pivot measures a depth variation of 16 % over the double-clamped beam but maintains the symmetry to the midpoint, and is still able to produce a rotation angle of 4. 7 °. In contrast, the virtual pivot has a depth reduction of 4 % over the cantilever beam, but achieves only a 2. 4 ° rotation due to the pull-in problem originated from the severe pivot shift. The real pivot design is more suitable for the MEMS tunable lasers as it is simple, symmetric, robust, and suitable for single-chip integration.

40|$|Abstract. In this project, {{the output}} of a Beam Engine is used to drive a {{circular}} saw to cut timber. Here, instead of the rotating fly wheel, {{it is intended to}} have a rotating circular saw. This rotating circular saw is used to cut timber. Circular saws driven with electric power are a common feature. But in places where electricity is scarce, or absent, it is difficult to operate these equipments. But since the Beam Engine powered saw runs on fuel, it can be operated even in places where electricity is totally absent. A beam engine is a design of stationary steam engine [1]. A stationary engine is an engine whose framework does not move [2]. Usually, a stationary engine is used not to propel a vehicle but to drive a piece of immobile equipment such as a pump or power tools [4]. In a beam engine, the piston is mounted vertically, and the piston rod does not connect directly to the connecting rod, but instead to a rocker or beam above both the piston and flywheel. The <b>beam</b> is <b>pivoted</b> in the middle, with the cylinder {{on one side and the}} flywheel, which incorporates the crank, on the other.
