Thus, several carcinomas and melanomas have subnormal concentrations of Syk. Although Syk is mainly localized at the plasma membrane, it is also present in centrosomes, where it is involved in the control of cell division. The mechanisms responsible for its centrosomal localization and action are unknown. We used wild-type and mutant fluorescent Syk fusion proteins in live-cell imaging (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, total internal reflection fluorescence, and photoactivation) combined with mathematical modeling to demonstrate that Syk is actively transported to the centrosomes via the microtubules and that this transport depends on the dynein/dynactin molecular motor. Syk can only target the centrosomes if its kinase activity is intact and it is catalytically active at the centrosomes. We showed that the autophosphorylated Y 130 Syk residue helps to uncouple Syk from the plasma membrane and to promote its translocation to the centrosome, suggesting that the subcellular location of Syk depends on its autophosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues. We have thus established the details of how Syk is <b>trafficked</b> <b>intracellularly</b> and found evidence that its targeting to the centrosomes is controlled by autophosphorylation...|$|E
40|$|Neurotoxic {{peptides}} {{derived from}} the protease-resistant core of the prion protein are used to model the pathogenesis of prion diseases. The current study characterised the ingestion, internalization and intracellular trafficking of a neurotoxic peptide containing amino acids 105 - 132 of the murine prion protein (MoPrP 105 - 132) in neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons. Fluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation techniques showed that MoPrP 105 - 132 co-localised with lipid raft markers (cholera toxin and caveolin- 1) and <b>trafficked</b> <b>intracellularly</b> within lipid rafts. This trafficking followed a non-classical endosomal pathway delivering peptide to the Golgi and ER, avoiding classical endosomal trafficking via early endosomes to lysosomes. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis demonstrated close interactions of MoPrP 105 - 132 with cytoplasmic phospholipase A 2 (cPLA 2) and cyclo-oxygenase- 1 (COX- 1), enzymes implicated in the neurotoxicity of prions. Treatment with squalestatin reduced neuronal cholesterol levels and caused the redistribution of MoPrP 105 - 132 out of lipid rafts. In squalestatin-treated cells, MoPrP 105 - 132 was rerouted away from the Golgi/ER into degradative lysosomes. Squalestatin treatment also reduced the association between MoPrP 105 - 132 and cPLA 2 /COX- 1. As the observed shift in peptide trafficking was accompanied by increased cell survival these {{studies suggest that the}} neurotoxicity of this PrP peptide is dependent on trafficking to specific organelles where it activates specific signal transduction pathways...|$|E

40|$|Mutations in the SLC 4 A 1 gene {{encoding}} the {{anion exchanger}} 1 (AE 1) can cause distal {{renal tubular acidosis}} (dRTA), a disease often due to mis-trafficking of the mutant protein. In this study, we investigated whether trafficking of a Golgi-retained dRTA mutant, G 701 D kAE 1, or two dRTA mutants retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, C 479 W and R 589 H kAE 1, could be functionally rescued to the plasma membrane of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. Treatments with DMSO, glycerol, the corrector VX- 809, or low temperature incubations restored the basolateral trafficking of G 701 D kAE 1 mutant. These treatments had no significant rescuing effect on trafficking of the mis-folded C 479 W or R 589 H kAE 1 mutants. DMSO was the only treatment that partially restored G 701 D kAE 1 function in the plasma membrane of MDCK cells. Our experiments show that <b>trafficking</b> of <b>intracellularly</b> retained dRTA kAE 1 mutants can be partially restored, and that one chemical treatment rescued both trafficking and function of a dRTA mutant. These studies {{provide an opportunity to}} develop alternative therapeutic solutions for dRTA patients...|$|R
40|$|The amyloid {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} {{the production of}} β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregates leads to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD. Aβ is produced by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretase. While nascent APP is well known to transit to the endosomal/ lysosomal system via the cell surface, we have recently shown that APP can also <b>traffic</b> to lysosomes <b>intracellularly</b> via its interaction with AP- 3. Because AP- 3 interacts with cargo protein via interaction with tyrosine motifs, we mutated the three tyrosines motif in the cytoplasmic tail of APP. Here, we show that the YTSI motif interacts with AP- 3, and phosphorylation of the serine in this motif disrupts the interaction and decreases APP trafficking to lysosomes. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation at this motif can decrease the production of neurotoxic Aβ 42. This demonstrates that reducing APP trafficking to lysosomes may be a strategy to reduce Aβ 42 in Alzheimer's disease...|$|R
