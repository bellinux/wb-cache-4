5|$|By 1980, only 20 active College Republican {{chapters}} remained. By the US Presidential {{election in}} 1980, that number had increased to 1,000 active clubs, helping Reagan win 98 of 105 mock elections and recruiting thousands of voters. This success led to $290,000 in financial assistance from <b>the</b> <b>RNC,</b> mainly to implement Jack Abramoff's field representative program. Abramoff's fund-raising efforts brought in an additional $1,160,000 {{during the next}} two years. By 1983, only 10% of the CRNC's budget came from <b>the</b> <b>RNC.</b>|$|E
5|$|The College Republicans were financed, {{at least}} in part, by the Republican National Committee {{throughout}} much of its history. James Francis Burke received significant funding from <b>the</b> <b>RNC</b> to support the American Republican College League's founding and to maintain the organization's early offices in New York City and Chicago. By 1924, the organization was operating directly {{under the auspices of}} <b>the</b> <b>RNC</b> as the Associated University Republican Clubs.|$|E
5|$|BLM activists {{also called}} on the Republican National Committee to have a presidential debate focused on issues of racial justice. <b>The</b> <b>RNC,</b> however, {{declined}} to alter their debate schedule, and instead also supported a townhall or forum.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, the Young Republican National Federation was {{permanently}} {{spun off}} from the College Republicans in 1970 to prevent counter-productive infighting among the two groups.

5|$|By this time, {{the first}} wave of what would {{eventually}} be more than four million letters, telegrams, postcards, and phone calls had flooded into RNC headquarters and other political offices. While a later study found that only about 7 percent of these communications addressed any substantive issue, they still ran 75 to one in favor of Nixon. Nixon skeptics joined in; both Stassen and Dewey sent congratulatory telegrams. Many letters included contributions {{to help pay for the}} cost of the broadcast; <b>the</b> <b>RNC</b> eventually recouped four-fifths of the $75,000 cost. Newspaper switchboards were jammed with calls from people seeking the RNC's address, while Western Union was caught off guard by Nixon's request that listeners wire <b>the</b> <b>RNC,</b> and had no extra help on hand. Checkers herself received enough dog food to last a year, and hundreds of collars, leashes, and toys.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner {{was given}} an office at <b>the</b> <b>RNC,</b> {{nominally}} as the official in charge of tickets for the inauguration. RNC chairman Ray Bliss and his aides were disturbed by his presence, and were told he would be gone after January 20. Meanwhile, Nixon and his aides considered a new RNC chairman finally settling on Maryland Congressman Rogers Morton, who agreed to take the position once Bliss left, though Morton was not told of the promise to Chotiner. When the President-elect met with Bliss on January 10, 1969, he could {{not bring himself to}} fire the chairman. With the situation unresolved, and Morton's appointment unannounced, Chotiner sat in his RNC office for a month after the inauguration with nothing to do, as <b>the</b> <b>RNC</b> staff wondered at his presence.|$|E

5|$|McKinley {{remained}} well ahead {{when the state}} conventions concluded, leaving his opponents' only hope the Republican National Committee (RNC), which would make initial rulings on which delegates would be seated; there were contested seats or rival delegations in several states, and rulings against McKinley could still deprive him of a first-ballot majority. When <b>the</b> <b>RNC</b> met in mid-June, {{just prior to the}} convention, McKinley was easily victorious in almost all cases.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>RNC</b> spent $100,000 on Tedisco's behalf. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $150,000 and the Service Employees International Union spent $315,000 for Murphy.

5000|$|As Chairman of the California Republican Party from 2003-2007, Sundheim {{played a}} key role in the only {{successful}} recall of a sitting governor in the history of California in 2003.

Upon completion of that program, the registration differential between Republicans and Democrats was 8% (the smallest difference in California in over 80 years).|$|R
5|$|The 1896 Republican National Convention convened at the Wigwam, a {{temporary}} structure in St. Louis, on June 16. With most credentials battles settled in McKinley's favor, {{the roll of}} delegates drawn up by <b>the</b> <b>RNC</b> heavily favored the Ohioan, though Reed, Allison, Morton and Quay remained in the race. The credentials report served as a test vote, which the McKinley forces won easily. Hanna, who was a delegate from Ohio, was in full control of the convention.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>RNC</b> hired Albert Lasker, an {{advertising}} executive from Chicago, to publicize Harding, and Lasker unleashed a broad-based advertising campaign that used many now-standard advertising techniques {{for the first}} time in a presidential campaign. Lasker's approach included newsreels and sound recordings. Visitors to Marion had their photographs taken with Senator and Mrs. Harding, and copies were sent to their hometown newspapers. Billboard posters, newspapers and magazines were employed in addition to motion pictures. Telemarketers were used to make phone calls with scripted dialogues to promote Harding.|$|E
5|$|Both Eisenhower's {{speech to}} the excited crowd and {{telegram}} to his running mate were noncommittal. The general applauded his running mate for his speech, but stated that the two had to meet face to face before a final decision could be made. While Eisenhower affirmed that <b>the</b> <b>RNC</b> {{had the power to}} elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the committee would, most likely, be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon to meet with him in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the general's campaign was next scheduled to go. Eisenhower's telegram was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon's suite, and the latter learned of his running mate's position from a wire service report.|$|E
5000|$|The Republican Party has {{attempted}} several times, unsuccessfully, {{to terminate the}} consent decree, arguing that it is [...] "antiquated" [...] and unnecessary. The Democratic National Committee had countered by arguing that that [...] "recent campaigns show the 'consent degree remains necessary today.'" [...] In 2009, a New Jersey federal judge rejected <b>the</b> <b>RNC's</b> request to vacate the consent decree, and this ruling was unanimously affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in 2012.

After her office contacted the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary (RNC) to report the incidents <b>the</b> <b>RNC</b> felt {{it was necessary to}} take precaution and assign security to the premier. Dunderdale spoke on the issue the following day, she said that due to privacy reasons she was partially reluctant to take on a bodyguard but respects the RNC’s decision. Dunderdale also said that the police had asked her not to comment on the issue and therefore she would stay mum about what led to the need for security.|$|E
5|$|Prompted by the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, the CRNC officially {{left the}} control of <b>the</b> <b>RNC</b> by reconstituting as a 527 group, {{allowing}} it to operate independently and raise unlimited amount of money for issue-advocacy work. As a 527 group, the organization is prohibited from coordinating directly with a particular campaign and its recent focus has turned towards developing volunteers and other support activities rather than outright campaigning. The shift has allowed the CRNC to vastly expand its fundraising efforts. During its first two years, the CRNC raised $17.3 million, most going to pay fundraising costs and other administrative costs, while leaving more than $2 million to expand the field representative program and to improve pay for the full-time positions.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the night}} to the morning of September 22, Eisenhower and Nixon aides {{arranged}} the speech. <b>The</b> <b>RNC</b> worked to raise the $75,000 needed to buy the half hour of television time, while the Eisenhower staff secured sixty NBC stations to telecast the speech, with radio coverage from CBS and Mutual. The Nixon staff initially advocated a half hour that evening, Monday, September 22, to follow the immensely popular I Love Lucy show, but when the candidate indicated {{he could not be}} ready that soon, settled for 6:30pm Tuesday night, 9:30pm in the East, following the almost equally popular Texaco Star Theater, starring Milton Berle. The campaign arranged to use the El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, where several NBC variety shows were then broadcast, since its lighting was superior to that of NBC Studios. Nixon told the press that he would be addressing the nation on television, but refused to take any questions about what he might say.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, Dianis sued to {{stop the}} Republican National Committee from {{engaging}} in potential voter suppression tactics in Ohio.

Bush. Steele's critics increasingly called {{on him to}} step down as RNC Chair when his term ended in 2011. A debate for Chairman hosted by Americans for Tax Reform took place on January 3 at the National Press Club.

In FSR, a packet buffering mechanism is implemented to avoid packet loss at <b>the</b> target <b>RNC.</b> We propose an analytic model to investigate the performance of FSR.
