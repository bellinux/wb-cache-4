5|$|The {{number of}} bronze medals awarded was greater <b>than</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> gold or silver. This {{was due to}} a number of dead heats for third position, {{including}} the women's 100 meter hurdles and men's pole vault. Also, a second bronze medal was awarded for each of the boxing and judo events as there were no third/fourth position tiebreakers held.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{world was}} a much less urban society <b>than</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire or the modern world. The fall of the Roman Empire had caused a catastrophic de-population of the towns and cities that had existed within the Empire. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, however, {{a revival of the}} European city occurred, with an {{increase}} in the urbanisation of society.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any time of year. Alligators are considered to be less aggressive <b>than</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E
5|$|In the {{build-up}} to the 1997 general election, the Referendum Party {{spent more}} on press advertising <b>than</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> incumbent Conservatives or their main rival, the Labour Party. It stood candidates in 547 constituencies, {{more than any}} minor party had ever fielded in a UK election. Ultimately, it gained 811,827 votes, representing 2.6% of the national total. Support was strongest in southern and eastern England, and weakest in inner London, northern England, and Scotland. The party failed to win any seats in the House of Commons. Following the election, psephologists argued {{that the impact of}} the Referendum Party deprived Conservative candidates of victory in somewhere between four and sixteen parliamentary seats. In the months following the election, the party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith died in July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members reformed as a Eurosceptic pressure group called the Democracy Movement, and many others joined Eurosceptic political parties like the UK Independence Party and the Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|The main {{use for the}} agung in Maguindanao and Maranao {{society is}} as a supportive/accompanying {{instrument}} of an orthodox kulintang ensemble. Using basic patterns and interlocking rhythms, a player would use the agung to complement the melody played by the kulintang. The patterns players use are normally considered freer <b>than</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> babendil or the dabakan; players could manipulate the patterns freely {{as long as they}} conform, reaffirm, reinforce and even generate the rhythmic mode of the piece. The length of the patterns themselves may vary depending on how they fit into the melodic improvisation. Rapid style is useful especially during exhibition of playing skills.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifth}} chapter, Stursberg recounts CBC's {{experience}} losing sports licenses. While the CBC had superior market placement (with respect to geographic coverage and experience with amateur sports), {{they lost the}} 2010 and 2012 Olympics to a joint CTV/TSN/Rogers $153 million bid. The Canadian Football League moved its broadcasting rights to TSN with Stursberg citing Commissioner Tom Wright's displeasure with the CBC's poor coverage of CFL games during the CBC 2005 lock-out. The CBC also lost broadcasting rights for The Brier and the Tournament of Hearts to CTV/TSN. Stursberg negotiated for Hockey Night in Canadas NHL rights with Gary Bettman and managed to extend their contract, but at a significantly higher price. The sixth chapter deals with CBC News which, as Stursberg explains, were scheduled to have the local newscasts eliminated. Instead, he initiated style and content reforms, taking effect in October 2009, including {{the creation of an}} internal newswire to provide stories suitable for TV, radio, and web services. He also commissioned an independent study to analyze a perceived anti-conservative bias in news coverage but the study found the coverage to be more conservative friendly <b>than</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> Global or CTV coverage. The chapter on Radio noted CBC Radio One's dominance in the Canadian radio market but CBC Radio Two's low ratings. Stursberg advocated for more local radio coverage, especially in the Hamilton area, and facilitated the programming change of CBC Radio Two by inserting more musical variety, specializing in Canadian music.|$|E
5|$|The low {{glycaemic}} index treatment (LGIT) {{is an attempt}} to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose {{may be one of the}} mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate <b>than</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a {{glycaemic index}} lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.|$|E
25|$|It {{might be}} noted that Pro Football Reference rates the 2009 Rams as worse by 2.8 points <b>than</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> 2009 or 2008 Lions, owing to a weak {{schedule}} and larger margins of defeat.|$|E
50|$|This Twelve shared {{much with}} Morris's 1292cc Ten Four and 1378cc Ten Six using the Ten Four gearbox and ratios but with wider wheels and larger section tyres <b>than</b> <b>either</b> of <b>the</b> smaller-engined cars and it used, with modifications, the {{wheelbase}} of the Ten Six which was six inches {{more than the}} Ten Four. The wheelbase was almost an inch longer than the Ten Six. It also had a fuel tank which held a gallon more <b>than</b> <b>either</b> of <b>the</b> other cars.|$|R

25|$|Different jurisdictions regard {{fiduciary}} duties in different lights.

25|$|Between 1996 and 1999, 34 licence-built Hornets {{left the}} {{assembly}} lines at Emmen.

25|$|Recent {{examination}} of damage {{reports from the}} 1868 event suggest that the rupture over only portions of the Northern and Southern Hayward fault could generate a magnitude 7.0 event, far more powerful <b>than</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> 6.5 event shown here or the 6.7 previously recognized as a likely maximum.|$|E
25|$|For {{traffic from}} further away, such as traffic between New England (and points north/east) and Pennsylvania (and points south/west), Interstate 84, which crosses the Hudson on the Newburgh–Beacon Bridge, {{is often used}} as an {{alternative}} rather <b>than</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> GWB or the Tappan Zee Bridge, as it avoids the inner New York metropolitan area and is a less congested route.|$|E

25|$|Those {{proteins}} {{destined for}} {{areas of the}} cell other <b>than</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus are moved through the Golgi cisternae towards the trans face, to a complex network of membranes and associated vesicles known as the trans-Golgi network (TGN).

25|$|If a Turing {{reduction}} of A to B exists then every algorithm for B {{can be used}} to produce an algorithm for A, by inserting the algorithm for B at each place where the oracle machine computing A queries the oracle for B. However, because the oracle machine may query the oracle a large number of times, the resulting algorithm may require more time asymptotically <b>than</b> <b>either</b> <b>the</b> algorithm for B or the oracle machine computing A, and may require as much space as both together.|$|E
