5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 16:56:54 BRT at FL370, {{and it was}} confirmed that neither <b>Traffic</b> <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> (TCAS) system had activated or alerted its respective crew, nor did any crew see the oncoming traffic visually or initiate any evasive action prior to the collision. While both planes were equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's transponder had ceased operating almost an hour earlier, at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.|$|E

The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a <b>Traffic</b> <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> (TCAS) outage, unknown to its flight crew prior to the collision, according to the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR):Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the collision avoidance system in the Legacy airplane was not functioning {{at the time of the}} accident, thereby disabling the system's ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR data indicate that the flight crew was unaware that the collision avoidance system was not functioning until after the accident.|$|E

40|$|New infrastructure-less <b>traffic</b> <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems</b> are {{currently}} developed for road and railway transportation. Similar to maritime and air transport {{a significant increase}} in safety is expected by exploiting direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication to detect possible collision threats and to immediately warn the driver. Augmented cognition is a key feature to expand the driver’s “view” or to support the self awareness of intelligent onboard units in such critical situations. To design new control and <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems</b> and to assess their performance, it is essential to emulate the interaction of centralized traffic management components with partly autonomous vehicles or their drivers. For this purpose test facilities can be operated, e. g. in case of railway transportation using train models to reduce costs and to avoid substantial damage. Concomitant with this approach, a millimetre level localisation of vehicle models is required for small-scale indoor test environments. In this paper we present an infrared based positioning concept that allows simulation of the vehicle’s and driver’s access to additional traffic relevant information like position or velocity of vehicles in the vicinity...|$|R
25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the TBM seats {{a pair of}} flying crew. According to Flying Magazine, even in the {{standard}} configuration, the cockpit is provided with a generous suite of avionics and equipment. It features an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), <b>traffic</b> <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system</b> (TCAS), terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), weather radar, lightning detection, dual Garmin GNS 530 navigation/communication systems, Bose headsets, dual transponders, dual compasses, and full cockpit instrumentation for both positions. Pilots can enter the cockpit either from the main cabin or via a small pilot's door on the left hand side, forward of the wing; in a cargo configuration, the pilot's door eliminates the need to clamber over the cargo payload. The pilot's door is an optional extra, and is not installed upon all aircraft. From the TBM 700B onwards, an enlarged cabin entry door was introduced, which later became standard upon subsequent models.|$|E

30|$|The fully {{autonomous}} intersection {{management system}} is not widely implemented due to several factors. The first obvious factor is that the autonomous vehicle itself is not ready for operation on real roads.
