5|$|Charles XI has {{sometimes}} been described in Sweden as <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by {{his father and his}} son. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the view of him changed and he was regarded as dependent, uncertain, and easily influenced by others. In the most recent book, Rystads biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.|$|E

5|$|In the 8th century BC, {{after the}} end of the {{so-called}} Greek Dark Ages, Greece emerged with a network of myths and legends, <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> being that of the Trojan Epic Cycle. In general, the Greeks of classical antiquity idealized the Mycenaean period as a glorious period of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth. The legends of Homer's Epics were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity. At this time, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann undertook the first modern archaeological excavations in Greece at the site of Mycenae in 1876. Thus, Schliemann set out to prove the historical accuracy of the Iliad by identifying the places described by Homer.|$|E

In the eleventh and last book of the novel, Lucius, after falling asleep on the beach at Cenchreae in Greece, wakes to see the full moon. He prays to the moon, using the names of several moon goddesses known in the Greco-Roman world, asking her to restore him to human form. Isis appears in a vision before Lucius and declares herself <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> goddesses. She tells him that a festival in her honor, the Navigium Isidis, is taking place nearby, and that the festival procession carries with it garlands of roses that will restore his human form if he eats them. After Lucius becomes human again, the high priest at the festival declares that he has been saved from his misfortunes by the goddess, and that he will now be free of the inquisitiveness and self-indulgence that drew him into many of his earlier misadventures. Lucius joins the local temple of Isis, becomes her devoted follower, and eventually undergoes initiation.|$|E
