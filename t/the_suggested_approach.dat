The test as formulated in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin requires that the reasonable man be sitting in court and in the know of all the relevant facts. However, this is usually not the case. Most of the public only receives information in bits and pieces, and thus even if a case passes the reasonable suspicion test, the public may not be satisfied {{that there was no}} possibility of bias. Thus the concept that the reasonable suspicion test reflects the public's perspective is overstated.

Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>approach</b> is that the court, in personifying the reasonable man, should take into account all relevant circumstances and determine if there is the suspicion or possibility of the appearance of bias whilst being mindful to exclude considerations stemming from the individual judge's personal preferences, special knowledge and legal sophistication.|$|E

Such an approach would do M. Reynaud far less good than if he made a firm stand. Further, the approach would ruin the integrity of our fighting position in this country. Even if we did not include geographical precision and mentioned no names, everybody would know what we had in mind... let us not be dragged down with France. If the French were not prepared to go on with the struggle, let them give up.... If this country was beaten, France become a vassal State; but if we won, we might save them. The best help we could give to M. Reynaud was to let him feel that, whatever happened to France, we were going to fight it out to the end.... At the moment our prestige in Europe was very low. The only way we could get it back was by showing the world that Germany had not beaten us. If, after two or three months, we could show that we still unbeaten, our prestige would return. Even if we were beaten, we should be no worse off than we should be if we were now to abandon the struggle. Let us therefore avoid being dragged down the slippery slope with France. The whole of this maneuver was intended to get us so deeply involved in negotiations that we should be unable to turn back. We had gone a long way already in our approach to Italy, but let us not allow M. Reynaud to get us involved in a confused situation. The approach proposed was not only futile, but involved us in a deadly danger.|$|E
40|$|The major {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are: (1) to develop a practical approach for evaluating, periodically and in quantitative terms, the effectiveness of management information systems; (2) to develop an evaluative device to check the results produced by <b>the</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>approach.</b> A modified semantic differential is developed and used for this purpose; and (3) to test the practicability and validity of <b>the</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>approach</b> by applying it on a sample of organisations {{for the purpose of}} evaluating the effectiveness of their management information systems. The foundation for <b>the</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>approach</b> is synthesised from the relevant literature. Specifically, a survey is undertaken of the literature in management information systems, accounting and psychology. <b>The</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>approach</b> assumes that users' satisfaction with the information provided by an information system indicates that the information is useful and consequently the system is effective. The approach takes also into consideration the views of both the providers of information and the persons affected by the decisions taken which are based, among other things, on the information provided by the system. A set of information criteria is developed to measure information utility and consequently the effectiveness of a management information system can be determined. To express the effectiveness in quantitative terms, a point scoring model is used so that the results can be compared from one period to the next. Also an operational framework of <b>the</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>approach</b> is developed. To evaluate the results produced by <b>the</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>approach,</b> the semantic differential is modified, based on the views of a sample of users of information and individuals involved in the preparation of management information, and is used as an evaluative device. As no similar research conducted on the effectiveness of management information systems in nationalised industries was found, it may be useful to test <b>the</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>approach</b> in this field. This application achieves two purposes: (1) primarily, to test the practicability and validity of the approach; and (2) to fill a gap in knowledge concerning the effectiveness of management information systems in nationalised industries.

40|$|Thesis (D. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Language, Literacy and Arts Education, 2009 This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with primary education reform at schools attached to Rajabhat Universities. A set of twelve language teaching <b>approaches</b> (methods) is <b>suggested</b> in <b>the</b> Thai Teacher Handbook for Foreign Language Teachers, {{as part of the}} reform in language teaching and learning at primary level. The approaches aim to develop the ability of language use for communication. Rajabhat schools are in the ideal position for the change implementation, due to schools' location on university campuses and administrative structures under the universities. The aim {{of the study was to}} probe the teachers' understanding and practice of the new approaches. Two research questions guided the study: 1 To what degree the teachers comprehend <b>the</b> <b>suggested</b> language teaching methods? 2 What are the teachers' perceptions of how they implement <b>the</b> <b>suggested</b> language teaching methods in classrooms? A mixed research method was employed to answer these questions. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used for data collection. The two data sets are brought together by comparing and contrasting the findings, providing triangulation to enrich result interpretation. Data analysis reveals that the teachers have incorporated <b>the</b> <b>suggested</b> language teaching <b>approaches</b> and methods into classroom activities. They are willing to learn how <b>the</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>approaches</b> could be transformed into activities. However, activities students engaged in appeared to emphasize coverage of linguistic elements of target language and analysis of grammatical relationships of the elements. The emphasis on linguistics, rather than development of the ability to relate language form for functional use, derives from unclear understanding of the proposed approaches. Study findings provide evidence that knowledge and skill development for the usage of the methodological concepts of <b>the</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>approaches</b> could lead to the sustained change in language teaching and learning.

40|$|The {{importance}} of prioritising requirements is widely recognised.

This paper aims to investigate the difference in information and aim {{to find ways to}} measure and compare the different levels of information. This is important since techniques using a richer scale tend to be more time-consuming and complex to use. Thus, there is a trade-off between simple techniques yielding less information and complex techniques yielding more information. <b>The</b> paper <b>suggests</b> three <b>approaches</b> to compare the level of information inherent in the two scales, and one way to design the cost-value diagram when the priorities are based on ranks.
