500|$|At {{some point}} in the 1896 season, Hogan {{apparently}} secured his release from the Browns. Once again, however, his physical speed offered no guarantee of consistency on the playing field. [...] On July 21, 1896, the St. Paul (Minneapolis) Globe reported that Hogan had performed poorly in a contest between the Hoosiers and the local ball club. [...] "Marty Hogan...made a bad fumble, and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at the sky to see if it had moved while he was locating the ball", the paper reported. [...] "It was a good bluff, but the crowd discovered Marty's weakness {{before the end of the}} game". [...] In January 1897, the Vindicator reported that the Hoosiers had sold Hogan to a club in Grand Rapids, Michigan. [...] The article called Hogan [...] "one of the fastest outfielders and baserunners in the Western League" [...] and predicted he would [...] "greatly strengthen the Grand Rapids outfield". [...] The following month, however, the paper described the previous report as a [...] "mistake", indicating instead that Hogan had signed a contract with baseball executive John T. Brush to play with the Hoosiers for another year. [...] The paper also reported that the contract granted Hogan [...] "the largest salary he has ever drawn". [...] Despite this lucrative contract, Hogan established and maintained his own advertising distribution agency in Indianapolis. [...] "He goes about the streets dressed much like an English costermonger", Sporting Life reported in January 1897. [...] "Marty can be seen with a little red wagon full of signs and advertising matter chasing up and down streets nailing the signs to buildings and convenient places and distributing advertising literature in the reel-dance portion of Indianapolis". [...] Less than four months later, in May 1897, he was released by the Indianapolis ball club. In June 1897, the Kansas City Journal indicated Hogan had moved on to the Dayton (Ohio) Old Soldiers, a team affiliated with the Class B Interstate League, where he was [...] "playing a sensational center field". In October of the same year, Sporting Life speculated Hogan would remain with Dayton during the upcoming 1898 season. [...] "Marty Hogan's contract with Dayton is such that he cannot be reserved, as are the rest of the players", the article stated. [...] "Unless Marty has a better offer to play with some other team it is safe to say that he will be with Dayton next year". [...] Further research is required to determine how long Hogan continued to play as an outfielder in the minor leagues. [...] (His obituary indicated that he also worked as a major league trainer.) [...] During his playing career, he apparently received at least one serious injury. [...] In February 1903, Sporting Life reported that the former baseball player's friends were [...] "anxious to get him appointed on the staff of American League umpires". [...] The article added, [...] "Hogan has suffered from operations to remove portions of his breast bone, which was injured in a collision during a baseball game".|$|E

During an {{interview}} with Norman Ross in Chicago, Callas said, [...] "I admire Tebaldi's tone; it's beautiful—also some beautiful phrasing. Sometimes, I actually wish I had her voice." [...] Francis Robinson of the Met wrote of an incident in which Tebaldi asked him to recommend a recording of La Gioconda {{in order to help}} her learn the role. Being fully aware of the alleged rivalry, he recommended Zinka Milanov's version. A few days later, he went to visit Tebaldi, only to find her sitting by the speakers, listening intently to Callas's recording. She <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at him and asked, [...] "Why didn't you tell me Maria's was the best?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, when Bosworth's family {{thought it}} was his time to go, Branham visited his bedside, prayed with him, and was greatly {{encouraged}} by his testimony. [...] Bosworth recovered his strength {{and it was not}} until several months later, in 1958, when he eventually died, again with an outstanding testimony. [...] According to his son's description in the 9th edition of [...] "Christ the Healer", the family was gathered around Bosworth's bedside talking, laughing, and singing about three weeks after Bosworth was in bed full-time, [...] Bosworth <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> never saw the family members present, and began [...] "to greet and hug people - he was enraptured ... He did this for several hours", then with {{a smile on his face}} he laid back and went to sleep. [...] When Bosworth died, Branham was asked by the family to come to preach his funeral but was unable to attend because he was in the middle of a campaign.|$|E

2500|$|About 1:00 pm the Wham party {{reached the}} site of the attack. [...] Campbell, who was in the lead, was {{attempting}} to guide her horse around a boulder that was blocking the road {{as the rest of the}} party crested a hill. [...] After the convoy halted, Sergeant Benjamin Brown led his men forward to try to move the obstacle out of the road while Corporal Isaiah Mays took a position at the rear of the convoy. [...] As they approached the rock, the group saw evidence that the rock had been deliberately placed in the road. [...] As they <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to see where the rock had come from, the soldiers saw two men stand up from a breastwork situated above them. [...] Neither of the two men wore masks and the soldiers later identified their attackers as Wilfred T. Webb and Mark E. Cunningham. [...] Local folklore suggests some bandits may have donned disguises, with one attacker dressed to resemble a local figure name William Ellison [...] "Cyclone Bill" [...] Beck. [...] Cunningham was armed with a rifle. [...] Webb brandished a pair of revolvers and yelled, [...] "Get out, you black sons of bitches!" [...] The bandits then began to fire toward the convoy.|$|E
