40|$|This review {{provides}} an overview of 50 years of basic and clinical research on an oncolytic avian virus, Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), which has particular anti-neoplastic and immune stimulatory properties. Of special interest is the fact that this biological agent induces immunogenic cell death and systemic anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, localized oncolytic virotherapy with NDV was shown to overcome systemic tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Clinical experience attests <b>to</b> <b>low</b> <b>side</b> effects and a high safety profile. This is due among others to the strong virus-induced type I interferon response. Other viral characteristics are lack of interaction with host cell DNA, lack of genetic recombination and independence of virus replication from cell proliferation. In this millennium, new recombinant strains of viruses are being produced with improved therapeutic properties. Clinical applications include single case observations, case series studies and Phase I to III studies...|$|E

Grape seed extract {{has the ability to}} release endothelial growth factor and its topical application results in contraction and closure of the skin wound.

40|$|Level shifter is an {{important}} building block in the power management system. In the DC-DC buck converter, requires a control signal with very low rise and fall time. Level shifters are used to convert low voltage signal to high voltage signal for the high side PMOS transistor of the power stage and allows increasing {{the efficiency of the}} DCDC buck converter with low rise and fall time. This thesis presents High voltage tolerant level shifter using differentially switched cascode transistor topology in cascade structure. This high voltage tolerant level shifter is providing high voltage control signal to the power stage of the step down dc-dc converter. Output signal of the level shifter has an offset of 5 VDD of the nominal supply voltage at high frequency with a very low power loss of 1. 84 mW where each VDD is 1 V. P-Driver and N-Driver provides dead time controlled signal for the power stage PMOS and NMOS transistor. The dead time for the high <b>to</b> <b>low</b> <b>side</b> is 157 ps and low to high side is 115 ps. The layout of single stage level shifter is presented which consumes a silicon area of 83. 54 × 121. 86 [μm×μm] and layout of the all three stages consumes 262. 82 × 124. 66 [μm×μm] of silicon area. The converter is designed in standard 1 V, Cadence 45 nm Generic Process Design Kit (GPDK). The switching frequency is 52 MHz. The converter operates with 6 V input voltage and provides 1. 25 V constant output voltage. When the input power is 200 mW, the extracted simulation gives a peak conversion efficiency of 79. 65 % with 200 mA output current.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{new family}} of zero-current {{switching}} (ZCS) BBR with high power factor using only two active switches is proposed. The proposed BBR {{is based on a}} totem-pole BBR (TPBBR) configuration which allows the current to flow from high side <b>to</b> <b>low</b> <b>side</b> and vice versa during resonance. Hence, no auxiliary active switch is needed to provide soft-switching for all semiconductor devices. The soft-switching also reduces the body diode reverse recovery problem hence allows the TPBLB to operate in continuous conduction mode (CCM). Design considerations and parameter values calculations are given. An experimental prototype is developed and tested to verify the converter performance. The proposed FTBBR is based on an H-bridge rectifier configuration. Only two out of the four switches are needed to be working in order to ensure the continuity of the converter operation. A detailed analysis of the FTBBR operation under all open-circuit faults of the switches is presented. In addition, adding resonant networks to the FTBBR is also analysed. The FTBBR is controlled using similar PWM controller as proposed in the new ZCS BBR. An experimental prototype is developed and tested to verify the converter performance. The TPBBR requires a special switching techniques and sequences, where isolated gate driver is the best solution which allows both high and low side switches to be turned on simultaneously during resonance. As a solution to the gate driver, a magnetically isolated gate driver with high immunity to leakage inductance is proposed. The proposed gate driver (PGD) is developed based on a bipolar totem-pole gate driver (non-inverting) located on the secondary side of the coupling transformer. It is able to drive a MOSFET/IGBT from standard CMOS to TTL output and down to LSTTL level. It also achieves large duty cycle ratio and small input to output delay and provides reliable isolation. The PGD is analysed and verified experimentally. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney. UniKey credentials are required.

40|$|Models of optimum radio-systems on {{the vector}} {{combinatorial}} configurations. Method {{for construction of}} optimum radio systems, based on a new conceptual model of the systems - Ideal Ring Vector structures (clusters of the IRV) is proposed. IRV clusters are cyclic ordered sequences of t- integer sub-sequences of the sequence which form perfect relationships of t-dimensional partitions over a virtual t-dimensional lattice covered surface of a finite space interval. The sums of connected sub-sequences of an IRV enumerate the set of tcoordinates specified with respect to cyclic frame reference exactly R-times. This property makes IRVs useful in applications which need to partition multidimensional objects with the smallest possible number of intersections. This sort of models {{can be used for}} finding optimal solution for wide classes of technological problems based on the idea of "perfect" vector combinatorial constructions, and expanding the applicability of two-, three- and multidimensional IRV as multidimensional cyclic relationships for fundamental and applied research in systems engineering, for improving such quality indices as vector data coding and signal reconstruction, resolving ability and low side lobe antenna design. There are regarded basic properties these models and made comparative analysis of the models with difference sets.

Short review of the methods relating to constructing of the optimum models of non-uniform antenna arrays with respect <b>to</b> <b>low</b> <b>side</b> lobe is given.
