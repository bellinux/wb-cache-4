500|$|The Boston Globe {{music critic}} Joan Anderman criticized the album saying [...] "Jackson's {{decision}} to recycle the nympho routine {{one more time}} is just boring [...] A quarter-century into her career, it was Jackson's moment <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath,</b> dig a little deeper, and make a bold - {{or at least a}} different - statement. Instead, she has trussed herself up in vinyl to coo another batch of digitized porn." [...] On a better note, she called the tracks [...] "Rollercoaster" [...] and [...] "Luv" [...] "engaging tracks", describing them as a [...] "sassy-sweet side" [...] and [...] "a plump, crackling confection", respectively.|$|E
500|$|According to Donald Spoto in The Dark Side of Genius, Hitchcock's wife, Alma Reville, {{spotted a}} blooper {{in one of}} the last {{screenings}} of Psycho before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink. According to Patricia Hitchcock, talking in Laurent Bouzereau's [...] "making of" [...] documentary, Alma spotted that Leigh's character appeared <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath.</b> In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences. Although Marion's eyes should be dilated after her death, the contact lenses necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of acclimation to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.|$|E
500|$|Sophocles {{died at the}} age of ninety or ninety-one in {{the winter}} of 406/5 BC, having seen within his {{lifetime}} both the Greek triumph in the Persian Wars and the bloodletting of the Peloponnesian War. As with many famous men in classical antiquity, his death inspired a number of apocryphal stories. The most famous is the suggestion that he died from the strain of trying to recite a long sentence from his Antigone without pausing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath.</b> Another account suggests he choked while eating grapes at the Anthesteria festival in Athens. A third holds that he died of happiness after winning his final victory at the City Dionysia. A few months later, a comic poet, in a play titled The Muses, wrote this eulogy: [...] "Blessed is Sophocles, who had a long life, was a man both happy and talented, and the writer of many good tragedies; and he ended his life well without suffering any misfortune." [...] According to some accounts, however, his own sons tried to have him declared incompetent near the end of his life; he is said to have refuted their charge in court by reading from his as yet unproduced Oedipus at Colonus. One of his sons, Iophon, and a grandson, also called Sophocles, also became playwrights.|$|E

60|$|I {{have found}} it {{necessary}} to touch the thing up a little here and there, for writers in those days were weak in construction.

2500|$|Cantor's giant {{softshell}} turtle (Pelochelys cantorii) {{can grow}} up to approx 2 m in length. [...] It is an ambush predator and primarily carnivorous, feeding on crustaceans, molluscs and fish (although some aquatic plants may also be eaten). The turtle spends 95% of its life buried and motionless, with only its eyes and mouth protruding from the sand. It surfaces only twice a day <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] Similarly, the New Guinea giant softshell turtle (Pelochelys bibroni) {{is considered to be}} an ambush predator.|$|E
2500|$|Known as the Balloon Pokémon, Jigglypuff {{is shaped}} like a round ball, with pink skin, large blue or green eyes, catlike ears, and a tuft of fur on its forehead. Its skin is rubbery and stretchy. It can inflate its body like a balloon (usually when it becomes angry; this is {{accompanied}} by a distinctive [...] "honk" [...] sound), or flatten its body, much like fellow Nintendo character Kirby. An exact limit to the size it can grow to in this manner is unknown. Jigglypuff are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath,</b> so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air. Game Freak's staff have noted Jigglypuff as both one of their and the public's favorite Pokémon, in terms of both anime and video game appearances.|$|E

6000|$|Every toiling Manchester, its {{smoke and}} soot all burnt, ought it not, among so many world-wide conquests, {{to have a}} hundred acres or so of free greenfield, with trees on it, conquered, for its little {{children}} to disport in; for its all-conquering workers <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of twilight air in? You would say so! A willing Legislature could say so with effect. A willing Legislature could say very many things!

6000|$|... "Hold your tongue, Peterkin!" [...] cried Jack.--"Well, {{after the}} {{schooner}} had disappeared, I dived {{back into the}} cave, much to Peterkin's relief, and told him what I had seen. We sat down and had a long talk over this matter, and then we agreed to make a regular, systematic search through the woods, {{so as to make}} sure at least that you had not been killed. But now we thought of the difficulty of getting out of the cave without your help. Peterkin became dreadfully nervous when he thought of this; and I must confess I felt some alarm, for, of course, I could not hope alone to take him out so quickly as we two together had brought him in. And he himself vowed that if we had been a moment longer with him that time, he would have had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of salt water. However, there was no help for it, and I endeavoured to calm his fears as well as I could; `for,' said I, `you can't live here, Peterkin,' to which he replied, `Of course not, Jack; I can only die here, and as that's not at all desirable, you had better propose something.' So I suggested that he should take a good, long breath, and trust himself to me.|$|E

6000|$|Through the {{clinging}} magnolia {{bushes and}} rhododendron shrubs {{he pushed his}} way downward, the red end of his cigar shining out like a signal light in the semi-purple darkness. Every {{now and then he}} stopped <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> of air perfumed by a clump of hyacinth, or some star-shaped flower which had yielded up its sweetness to the softly-falling night. Now and then, too, he took a lover's look at the stars, and downward to the softly-heaving bosom of the Mediterranean. All these things seemed to mean so much more to him now! Adrienne had changed the world, and he was looking out upon it with different eyes. Sentiment, which before he had scoffed at a little, as became a sturdy young Briton but lately escaped from public school and college, had suddenly become for him something akin to a holy thing. He was almost a poet that night--he who had scarcely read a line of what the world calls poetry since his school days. There was a man whom he had hated all his life. Just then he began to think of him without a particle of anger or resentment. If he could have met him there, among those drooping, white-flowering shrubs, he felt that he could have shaken his hand, have asked him heartily after his health, and doubtless have fixed a day to dine with him. The world was a capital place, and Palermo was on the threshold of heaven. His big, boyish heart was full to over-flowing. Oh! it is a fine thing to be in love! ...|$|E

Black refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> test and was arrested. He was taken back to a police station when he again refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>breath</b> test. Black's defence lawyer argued that Black had been {{drinking}} heavily and his judgement had been affected, and was frustrated because {{he had lost his}} job as a delivery driver because his licence was suspended.
