5|$|The {{decision}} {{in favour of}} West Ham's bid was unanimous, although controversial as local rivals Tottenham Hotspur had also been bidding for the venue. Hopes of moving to the stadium, however, were since placed under doubt following a legal challenge by Tottenham and Leyton Orient, with Leyton Orient fearful that having West Ham playing less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> from their Brisbane Road ground could steal support from the club and {{put them out of}} business. Both clubs' appeal for a judicial review, however, were rejected on 23 June 2011.

25|$|The {{grandeur}} of the mansion and its handsomely landscaped grounds served to match the impressive scale of the estate, which at 1,700 acres was unusually large by Valley standards.

25|$|Brig. Gen. Joseph Hooker's 2nd Division of the III Corps was {{the lead}} {{infantry}} in the Union Army advance.

Hooker had expected Baldy Smith's division of the IV Corps, marching north on the Yorktown Road, to hear the sound of battle and come in on Hooker's right in support.

25|$|The {{founder of}} the {{aviation}} program at UND, John D. Odegard, logged over 10,000 hours of flight {{time in his life}} and was licensed for commercial flight and instrument operations. He was type-rated in Cessna Citations, Learjet, and Beechjet, as well as being a certificated flight instructor (CFI) and certified examiner for commercial, instrument, tailwheel, multiengine, and Citation type-ratings. Having broken the sound barrier in the Concorde (as a passenger) and having flown as a crop-duster to help pay for college, Odegard was no stranger to the varied envelopes of flight. He was quite familiar with the many aspects of aviation and his vision for a well-rounded school which trains pilots in all aspects of flight helped the aviation program at UND become what it is today. Odegard died of cancer in 1998 at the age of 57. He is buried in Grand Forks, less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> from the UND campus.|$|E
25|$|Rescue {{operations}} were immediately undertaken after {{it became clear}} that the plane had crashed, although efforts were hampered by the fact that the crash site was around two hours away from the closest location of police forces. Heavy rains in the area also led to the risk of flooding and landslides. Personnel from the Nepalese Army reached the site of the crash on foot, and were responsible for gathering bodies, but due to weather conditions, helicopters were forced to land more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away.</b> Authorities announced a reward of Rs. 50,000 for anyone who would find equipment that would help authorities discover the cause of the crash. By 2 September, both the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder of the crashed aircraft had been located; both were undamaged and were analysed by investigators in India. The government of Nepal formed a five-member panel to help determine the cause of the crash; the committee was instructed to submit a report on the crash within 65 days.|$|E

In Monitor Worden was already at his station in the pilot house while Greene took command of the turret. Samuel Howard, Acting Master of Minnesota, who was familiar with Hampton Roads with its varying depths and shallow areas, had volunteered to be the pilot the night before and thus was accepted, while Quarter Master Peter Williams steered the vessel throughout the battle (Williams was later awarded the Medal of Honor for this act). The speaking tube used to communicate between the pilothouse and the turret had broken early in the action so Keeler and captain's clerk Daniel Toffey had to relay commands from Worden to Greene. As Virginia was approaching she began firing at Minnesota from more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away,</b> a few of her shells hitting the vessel. When the firing was heard in the distance, Greene sent paymaster Keeler to the pilot house for permission to open fire as soon as possible where Worden ordered, [...] "Tell Mr. Green not to fire till I give the word, to be cool and deliberate, to take sure aim and not waste a shot." ...|$|E

Less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>away</b> from the factory Martin & Co were doing maintenance work on a road when they accidentally unearthed and damaged the power cable providing the factory with electricity. Due to the power being off the factory lost a large amount of money; £368 on damaged goods, £400 on the profits they would have made from those goods and £1,767 for the steel they could not make due to the power outage. The question was what Spartan Steel could claim money for. Martin & Co agreed they were negligent, and offered to pay for the damaged goods and the profit that Spartan Steel would have made on those goods, but refused to pay damages for the steel Spartan Steel could not make due to the power outage. In his judgment Denning agreed that they would only have to pay for losses associated with the damaged goods, not the money lost on the steel that could not be made due to the power outage because it counted as pure economic loss. For public policy reasons Denning would not allow the recovery of pure economic loss, stating in his judgment that: ...|$|E
