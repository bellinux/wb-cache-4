"Go Big or Go Home" [...] was {{the first}} {{original}} episode since [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] in May 2010, and executive producer Michael Schur said while he believed it was a strong episode, there were fears the hiatus would hurt {{the momentum of the}} series: [...] "Of course, any time you're not on the air, {{you run the risk of}} people forgetting about you; that's <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> about the mid-season show." [...] The week of the third season premiere, Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice." [...] Poehler also said the long hiatus made an ironic sort of sense for the script, since at the beginning the characters have [...] "taken too much time off and we've all gone a little crazy". While Parks and Recreation previously aired on 8:30 p.m. EST on Thursdays, [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] marked the first episode in a new 9:30 p.m. Thursday time-slot between the two popular shows The Office and 30 Rock. Poehler said of the time-slot, [...] "'The Office' is such an amazing show and to be behind it is an honor." [...] In anticipation of new viewers due to the Office lead-in, [...] "Go Big and Go Home" [...] included an introductory sequence describing the previous events of the series.|$|E
500|$|Allegations of sexism {{occurred}} {{following a}} statement by Lino DiSalvo, the film's head of animation, who said to Fan Voice's Jenna Busch: [...] "Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, {{because they have to}} go through these range of emotions, but you have to keep them pretty." [...] However, a Disney spokesperson later told Time that DiSalvo's quote was widely misinterpreted, stating that he was [...] "describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters." [...] Director Lee also said that DiSalvo's words were recklessly taken out of context, and that he was talking in very technical terms about CG animation. [...] "It is hard no matter what the gender is. I felt horrible for him," [...] she said. In an August 2014 interview, DiSalvo re-emphasized what he had been trying to explain all along when his statements were taken out of context– the difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2D emotion model sheet into a properly rigged 3D character model: [...] "Translating that emotional range onto a CG character {{is one of the most}} difficult parts of the process. Male. Female. Snowman. Animal." [...] He added, [...] "The really sad thing is people took that... catchy headline and they just repopulated it everywhere. People didn't get back to me for comments and <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> is that's the way the internet works. They don't want the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scholars {{and authors}} have also commented on these changes. Southern Methodist University's Director of Medieval Studies Bonnie Wheeler is [...] "convinced {{that the new}} Robert Zemeckis movie {{treatment}} sacrifices {{the power of the}} original for a plot line that propels Beowulf into seduction by Angelina Jolie—the mother of the monster he has just slain. What man doesn’t get involved with Angelina Jolie?' Wheeler asks. 'It’s a great cop-out on a great poem.' ... 'For me, <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> is the movie returns to…a view of the horror of woman, the monstrous female who will kill off the male,' Wheeler says. 'It seems to me you could do so much better now. And the story of Beowulf is so much more powerful.'" [...] Other commentators pointed to the theories elucidated in John Grigsby's work Beowulf and Grendel, where Grendel's mother was linked with the ancient Germanic fertility goddess Nerthus.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear, dear, dear, dear!" [...] groaned the old lady. And {{while she}} groaned Clarissa furtively cast a smile upon her cousin.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the elder}} assented, [...] "we {{butterflies}} and victorias {{belong to the}} youth {{of the year and}} the world. And <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> is that we won't have our palingenesis." ...|$|E
6000|$|I said: [...] "Do you {{remember}} <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> {{that happened in}} the South of France some two years ago? A soldier picked some cherries as he passed a house, and the French peasant to whom the cherries belonged came out, and without a word of warning shot him dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{my teacher}} would explain--he was a {{painstaking}} gentleman; [...] "you say {{it as if}} it were spelt K-i-r-c-h-k-e. There is no k. It is--." [...] And he would illustrate to me again, for the twentieth time that morning, how it should be pronounced; <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> being that I could never for the life of me detect any difference between the way he said it and the way I said it. So he would try a new method.|$|E
5000|$|... "I see comedy everywhere, that's how I live day to day. I try {{to laugh}} and see the ironies and hopefulness in life. Even in <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>things.</b> They're one and the same, in their extremes. If you've ever seen someone truly happy, ecstatically happy, it is indistinguishable from grief." ...|$|R
60|$|The melancholy fact is, I built our {{warehouse}} on {{an unfavorable}} site, {{about a mile}} out from the shore (on the ice, you understand), and when the thaw came--O my God, Wannie, it was <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>thing</b> you ever saw in all your life! You will be so glad to know I was not in it at the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes indeed," [...] said Mrs. Orme, wiping a tear {{away from}} her eye as she {{thought of all the}} {{troubles}} present and to come. [...] "It is <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>thing.</b> Poor lady! It would almost break your heart if you were to see her. Since first she heard of this, which was before Christmas, she has not had one quiet moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|In the {{meantime}} the King, {{who had not}} the least idea of <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> that was happening outside the gate of his palace, proposed to Miranda {{that she should be}} driven in her chariot all round the town, which was to be illuminated with thousands and thousands of torches, placed in windows and balconies, and in all the grand squares. But what a sight met her eyes at the very entrance of the palace! There lay her dear, kind sheep, silent and motionless, upon the pavement! ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, given {{a mother who}} is too {{generally}} hard or indifferent, then it rests with the father to provide the delicate sympathy and the refined discipline. Then the father must show the tender sensitiveness of the upper mode. <b>The</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> to-day is that so few mothers have any deep bowels of love--or even the breast of love. What they have is the benevolent spiritual will, {{the will of the}} upper self. But the will is not love. And benevolence in a parent is a poison. It is bullying. In these circumstances the father must give delicate adjustment, and, above all, some warm, native love from the richer sensual self.|$|E
60|$|Chuang Tzu, {{whose name}} must {{carefully}} be pronounced {{as it is}} not written, {{was born in the}} fourth century before Christ, by the banks of the Yellow River, in the Flowery Land; and portraits of the wonderful sage seated on the flying dragon of contemplation may still be found on the simple tea- trays and pleasing screens of many of our most respectable suburban households. The honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt often mocked at the dome-like forehead of the philosopher, and laughed over the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him. If they really knew who he was, they would tremble. For Chuang Tzu spent his life in preaching the great creed of Inaction, and in pointing out the uselessness of all useful things. 'Do nothing, and everything will be done,' was the doctrine which he inherited from his great master Lao Tzu. To resolve action into thought, and thought into abstraction, was his wicked transcendental aim. Like the obscure philosopher of early Greek speculation, he believed in the identity of contraries; like Plato, he was an idealist, and had all the idealist's contempt for utilitarian systems; he was a mystic like Dionysius, and Scotus Erigena, and Jacob Bohme, and held, with them and with Philo, that the object of life was to get rid of self-consciousness, and to become the unconscious vehicle of a higher illumination. In fact, Chuang Tzu may be said to have summed up in himself almost every mood of European metaphysical or mystical thought, from Heraclitus down to Hegel. There was something in him of the Quietist also; and in his worship of Nothing he may be said to have in some measure anticipated those strange dreamers of mediaeval days who, like Tauler and Master Eckhart, adored the purum nihil and the Abyss. The great middle classes of this country, to whom, as we all know, our prosperity, if not our civilisation, is entirely due, may shrug their shoulders over all this and ask, {{with a certain amount of}} reason, what is the identity of contraries to them, and why they should get rid of that self-consciousness which is their chief characteristic. But Chuang Tzu was something more than a metaphysician and an illuminist. He sought to destroy society, as we know it, as the middle classes know it; and <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> is that he combines with the passionate eloquence of a Rousseau the scientific reasoning of a Herbert Spencer. There is nothing of the sentimentalist in him. He pities the rich more than the poor, if he ever pities at all, and prosperity seems to him as tragic a thing as suffering. He has nothing of the modern sympathy with failures, nor does he propose that the prizes should always be given on moral grounds to those who come in last in the race. It is the race itself that he objects to; and as for active sympathy, which has become the profession of so many worthy people in our own day, he thinks that trying to make others good is as silly an occupation as 'beating a drum in a forest in order to find a fugitive.' It is a mere waste of energy. That is all. While, as for a thoroughly sympathetic man, he is, in the eyes of Chuang Tzu, simply a man who is always trying to be somebody else, and so misses the only possible excuse for his own existence.|$|E

Any {{disagreement}} between you {{about such a}} serious matter as this would be <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>thing</b> that could happen.

60|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>things</b> for <b>the</b> poor slaves {{was that}} they could never long be a happy family all together--father, mother, and little {{brothers}} and sisters--because at any time the master might sell the father or the mother {{or one of the}} children to some one else. When this happened those who were left behind were very sad indeed--more sad than if their dear one had died.|$|R
60|$|I {{hope that}} if he saw it, Mr Powell forgave me the smile of which I was guilty at that moment. The light in the cabin of his little cutter was dim. And the smile was dim too. Dim and fleeting. The girl's life had {{presented}} itself {{to me as a}} tragi-comical adventure, <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>thing</b> on earth, slipping between frank laughter and unabashed tears. Yes, <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> facts and <b>the</b> most common, and, being common perhaps the most worthy of our unreserved pity.|$|R
5000|$|He {{said the}} book was a little [...] "cheeky" [...] because [...] "it does reflect some of the prejudices which are taking root Europe.

50|$|One of {{the things}} that makes Hamilton Bradshaw quite unique is that unlike a lot of private equity firms...my company only invests my own money.

5000|$|Matt Jones, {{photographer}} {{and son of}} i-D editor Terry Jones, said of his friend Davide: “I guess he did slightly see the glamorous side. He also saw the real side of it.

[...] Boyle answered: [...] "This is one of <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>things</b> for me.... Basically title is a hybrid of the word [...] "underdog"—and everything that means in terms of rooting for the underdog and validating his triumph—and the fact that he obviously comes from the slums. That's what we intended." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But <b>the</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>thing</b> {{of all to}} me, and {{the most}} {{difficult}} to understand," [...] resumed Brisbane, [...] "is the state of mind and feeling of those professing Christians, who, with ample means, give exceedingly little towards the alleviation of such distress, take little or no interest in the condition of the poor, and allow as much waste in their establishments as would, if turned to account, become streamlets of absolute wealth to many of the destitute." ...|$|R
50|$|Raeburn's {{last years}} were quite difficult. Because of his arteriosclerosis, {{he was unable}} to care for himself. This became clear when his friend Margaret Doughty, née McKechnie visited the painter in his flat on Fettes Row. She found the place getting more and more uncared for indeed, and rather messy. <b>The</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> was that Raeburn was well aware of his failing mental health.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{funny thing}} about Hollywood {{is that they are}} {{interested}} in having you do one thing and do it well and do it ever after," [...] said O'Brien. [...] "That's <b>the</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> about being a leading man - while the rewards may be great in fame and finances, it becomes monotonous for an actor. I think that's why {{some of the people who}} are continually playing themselves are not happy." ...|$|E
50|$|The first International Book Fair {{was held}} in Karachi and Lahore {{last year at the}} expo centre and it was well {{received}} by the public at large despite the fact that all the books were originals and were highly priced. People thronged the premises even if they didn’t really buy much. <b>The</b> <b>sad</b> <b>thing</b> to note was that the Indian publishers had a very impressive collection of reference books on various subjects, while one finds it very difficult to find books on those topics by Pakistani publishers.|$|E
5000|$|... "Special to Me" [...] {{is one of}} my {{all time}} {{favorite}} songs of Tony's.

5000|$|Foo Fighters {{responded to}} the {{incident}} saying: [...] "It's frustrating and infuriating that someone who claims {{to speak for the}} American people would repeatedly show such little respect for creativity and intellectual property[...] [...] <b>The</b> <b>saddest</b> <b>thing</b> about this is that 'My Hero' was written as a celebration of the common man and his extraordinary potential.
