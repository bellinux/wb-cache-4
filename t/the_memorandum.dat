The Russian government sought {{to demonstrate that}} granting autonomy to both Poland and Lithuania would be complicated, and would probably exacerbate national conflicts. On November 26 (November 13 O.S.) <b>the</b> <b>memorandum</b> was also reprinted in Vilniaus žinios.

In June 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank after defeating Arab forces in the Six Day War. In 1972 the first municipal polls were held and Fa'eq Ali Rimawi was elected. In 1978 Bani Zeid was one of several Palestinian localities to append its municipal seal to <b>the</b> <b>Memorandum</b> from the masses and the institutions of the West Bank to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization in a display of unity with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). <b>The</b> <b>memorandum</b> was a rejection of any solution, regardless of its origin, not containing a clear recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establishing an independent Palestinian national state. In 2000 Bani Zeid was incorporated into Area A giving the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the Palestinian governing body established after the Oslo Agreements with Israel in 1993, full control over security and civilian affairs in the town.|$|E

5|$|Vice Admiral Scheer became Commander {{in chief}} of the High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916 when Pohl became too ill to {{continue}} in that post. Upon promotion to the position, Scheer wrote Guiding Principles for Sea Warfare in the North Sea, which outlined his strategic plans. His central idea was that the Grand Fleet should be pressured by higher U-boat activity and zeppelin raids as well as increased fleet sorties. The Grand Fleet would be forced to abandon the distant blockade and would have to attack the German fleet; the Kaiser approved <b>the</b> <b>memorandum</b> on 23 February 1916. Now that he had approval from the Kaiser, Scheer could use the fleet more aggressively.|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} legal {{writing as}} it is represented in legal memoranda prepared by first-semester law students in twelve different law schools. It {{is based on the}} cumulative judgments of the instructors and professors of law in those institutions, humanities specialists at Educational Testing Service, and two legal consultants. A taxonomy of the elements of <b>the</b> legal <b>memorandum</b> was developed from annotations and written and tape-recorded commentaries on 237 legal <b>memoranda</b> written by <b>the</b> law students. Ratings of the overall quality and of the importance of specific elements of <b>the</b> legal <b>memoranda</b> were conducted on multiple occasions by different judges. Statistical analyses of the rating data revealed some disagreement among legal writing instructors with respect to the overall quality of <b>the</b> legal <b>memoranda</b> and with respect to the elements of them that were either strong or weak. Despite these disagreements, it was possible to determine in the aggregate what elements of <b>the</b> legal <b>memoranda</b> were most important and what relative weight each has in the judgments of the instructors and professors. It was also possible to identify combinations of elements that formed factors important in determining the quality of legal memoranda. Computer analyses of <b>the</b> <b>memoranda</b> indicated differences between <b>the</b> student <b>memoranda</b> and other kinds of writing, particularly with respect to the greater use of passive voice and nominalizations in <b>the</b> student <b>memoranda,</b> but <b>the</b> computer variables did not correlate significantly with global quality ratings of <b>the</b> <b>memoranda.</b> Although no significant sex differences were found in the global quality ratings, differences favoring females were observed for several taxonomy elements...|$|R

5|$|Despite its {{disappointment}} with the award of Paris Tribunal of Arbitration, Venezuela abided by it. However, {{half a century}} later the publication of an alleged political deal between Russia and Britain led Venezuela to re-assert its claims. In 1949, the US jurist Otto Schoenrich gave the Venezuelan government <b>the</b> <b>Memorandum</b> of Severo Mallet-Prevost (Official Secretary of the U.S./Venezuela delegation in the Tribunal of Arbitration), written in 1944 to be published only after Mallet-Prevost's death. This re-opened the issues, with Mallet-Prevost surmising a political deal between Russia and Britain from the subsequent private behaviour of the judges. Mallet-Prevost said that Martens had visited England with the two British arbitrators in the summer of 1899, and subsequently had offered the two American judges a choice between accepting a unanimous award along the lines ultimately agreed, or a 3:2 majority opinion even more favourable to the British. The alternative would have followed the Schomburgk Line entirely, and given the mouth of the Orinoco to the British. Mallet-Prevost said that the American judges and Venezuelan counsel were disgusted at the situation and considered the 3:2 option with a strongly worded minority opinion, but ultimately went along with Martens in order to avoid depriving Venezuela of valuable territory to which it was entitled.|$|E
