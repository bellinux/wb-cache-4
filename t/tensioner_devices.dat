30|$|Removing the locking screws in {{the nail}} will even allow {{compression}} with the AO <b>tensioner</b> <b>device</b> prior to augmentative plating. Finally, {{the use of}} additional bone grafting in augmentative plate fixation is variable [16, 28, 29, 30, 31].|$|R
30|$|The {{posterior}} round endobuttons were advanced using {{a sliding}} knot {{until they were}} flush with the posterior face of the glenoid. A suture <b>tensioner</b> <b>device</b> was used to secure the posterior round endobuttons. Once the implant was tensioned, we secured it with half hitches and cut suture tails (Taverna et al., 2014). After bone block procedure, graft stability was tested and humeral head stability and position were evaluated.|$|R
30|$|Forearm nonunions are {{uncommon}} but challenging. Operative {{treatment with}} adequate debridement, eradication of infection and stable fixation using compression (using lag screws, eccentric drilling and/or AO <b>tensioner</b> <b>device)</b> {{will lead to}} high predictable rates of healing. For the diaphyseal nonunion, longer plates with a high plate-span/screw ratio are preferred to achieve a more stable fixation. Segmental defects up to 6  cm can be successfully reconstructed with autogenous corticocancellous bone grafts while larger defects may require free tissue transfer. For the distal radius nonunions, placement of an opening wedge will not only correct deformity but also provide intrinsic stability. Locking plate technology has facilitated fixation of the small distal radius nonunion fragments.|$|R
40|$|The device {{consists}} of two grab elements, each with a grab jaw section {{and a lever arm}} section. The lever arm sections are charged by a movable power-transmitting element, which is tensioned against the lever arm sections by a <b>tensioner</b> <b>device.</b> An actuator is formed by a piezo adjusting element, which is charged by an electrical control voltage. This lengthens the element {{in the direction of the}} lever arm sections, so that it presses against the power-transmitting element, which in turn is driven in the direction of the lever arm sections. This causes the grab jaws to move about joints, and towards each other. ADVANTAGE - Simple to manufacture, modular construction...|$|R
50|$|Bolt <b>tensioners</b> are <b>devices</b> {{designed}} {{to apply a}} specific tension to a bolt. The device may be either removed once the actual nut is threaded into place, or left in place, {{in the case of}} a hydraulic nut.|$|R
50|$|A {{marine riser}} <b>tensioner</b> is a <b>device</b> used on an {{offshore}} drilling vessel {{which provides a}} near constant upward force on the drilling riser independent of {{the movement of the}} floating drill vessel.|$|R
50|$|A belt <b>tensioner</b> is a <b>device</b> {{designed}} to maintain {{tension in the}} engine’s timing belt. There is a spring device in the belt tensioner where the bearing is located. The spring device oscillates back and forth at 2° for about 60 cycles per minute.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, he {{received}} a promotion to project engineer on an experimental version of a pilotless B-47 Stratojet. (This program was designated Project Brass Ring.) Around 1955 he joined the Bomarc Missile Program, a pilotless interceptor. He worked on this program as assistant project engineer, focused on the guidance and data systems. He later became lead engineer for production, and then head of the Bomarc operation. Helberg was awarded a patent for an automatic control cable <b>tensioner.</b> This <b>device</b> was used in Boeing-built bombers.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tensioner</b> is a <b>device</b> {{that applies}} {{a force to}} create or {{maintain}} tension. The force may be applied parallel to, {{as in the case}} of a hydraulic bolt tensioner, or perpendicular to, {{as in the case of}} a spring-loaded bicycle chain tensioner, the tension it creates. The force may be generated by a fixed displacement, as in the case of an eccentric bicycle bottom bracket, which must be adjusted as parts wear, or by stretching or compressing a spring, as in the case of a spring-loaded bicycle chain tensioner; by changing the volume of a gas, as in the case of a marine riser tensioner; by hydraulic pressure, as in the case of a hydraulic bolt tensioner; or by gravity acting on a suspended mass, as in the case of a chair lift cable tensioner.|$|R
40|$|Serpentine {{belt drives}} {{are often used}} in front end {{accessory}} drive of automotive engine. The accessories resistant torques are getting higher within new technological innovations as stater-alternator, and belt transmissions are always asked for higher capacity. Two kind of tensioners are used to maintain minimum tension that insure power transmission and minimize slip : dry friction or hydraulic <b>tensioners.</b> An experimental <b>device</b> and a specific transmission error measurement method {{have been used to}} evaluate the performances of a generic transmission by determining the pulley–belt slip for these two kinds of tensioner. Transmission error between pulleys, pulley/belt slip are deduced from pulley rotation angle measurements. Results obtained show that : the use of tensioner limits belt slip on pulleys, pulley–belt slip is reachable from transmission error measurement, belt non uniform characteristics are responsible of low frequency modulations of transmission error...|$|R
