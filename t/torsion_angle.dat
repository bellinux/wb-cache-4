25|$|The {{structural}} formula and the bond angles {{are not usually}} sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further degree of freedom for each carbon–carbon bond: the <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms {{at each end of}} the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation.|$|E
25|$|Simulating {{the docking}} process {{is much more}} complicated. In this approach, the protein and the ligand are {{separated}} by some physical distance, and the ligand finds its position into the protein’s active site after {{a certain number of}} “moves” in its conformational space. The moves incorporate rigid body transformations such as translations and rotations, as well as internal changes to the ligand’s structure including <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> rotations. Each of these moves in the conformation space of the ligand induces a total energetic cost of the system. Hence, the system's total energy is calculated after every move.|$|E
25|$|Ethane {{forms the}} {{simplest}} case {{for studying the}} conformation of alkanes, as {{there is only one}} C–C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C–C bond, one will see the so-called Newman projection. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon–carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation.|$|E

25|$|The {{angle of}} {{inclination}} formed between the neck and shaft of the femur, (collodiaphysial angle), varies with age—about 150° in the newborn, it gradually decreases to 126-128° in adults, to reach 120° in old age. Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg: A small angle produces coxa vara and a large angle in coxa valga; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and coxa vara leads genu valgum. Additionally, a line drawn through the femoral neck superimposed on a line drawn through the femoral condyles forms an angle, the <b>torsion</b> <b>angle,</b> which {{makes it possible for}} flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the femoral head. Abnormally increased torsion angles results in a limb turned inward and a decreased angle in a limb turned outward; both cases resulting in a reduced range of a persons mobility.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} isoleucines in protein {{structures}} solved using X-ray crystallography revealed {{a series of}} systematic trends for the two side-chain <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> 1 and 2 dependent on the resolution, secondary structure and refinement software used. The average <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> for the nine rotamers were similar in high-resolution structures solved using either the REFMAC, CNS or PHENIX software. However, at low resolution these programs often refine towards somewhat different 1 and 2 values. Small systematic differences can be observed between refinement software that uses molecular dynamics-type energy terms (for example CNS) and software that does not use these terms (for example REFMAC). Detailing the standard <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> used in refinement software can improve the refinement of protein structures.

40|$|We have {{conducted}} two dimensional NOESY {{studies on the}} molecule d(G 2 T 5 G 2) to characterize {{the structure of the}} tetramolecular complex previously identified by calorimetric and spectroscopic studies (1). Analysis of the NOE and exchange cross peaks observed in the NOESY spectra establishes the formation of structured conformations at low temperature (5 degrees C). Significantly, within each strand of these structured conformations, the G 1 and G 8 residues adopt syn glycosidic <b>torsion</b> <b>angles,</b> while the G 2 and G 9 residues adopt anti glycosidic <b>torsion</b> <b>angles.</b> Consequently, any structure proposed for the tetramolecular complex of d(G 2 T 5 G 2) must have alternating G(syn) and G(anti) glycosidic <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> within each strand.

25|$|In {{addition}} to distance restraints, restraints on the <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> {{of the chemical}} bonds, typically the psi and phi angles, can be generated. One approach {{is to use the}} Karplus equation, to generate angle restraints from coupling constants. Another approach uses the chemical shifts to generate angle restraints. Both methods use the fact that the geometry around the alpha carbon affects the coupling constants and chemical shifts, so given the coupling constants or the chemical shifts, a qualified guess can be made about the <b>torsion</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|R
