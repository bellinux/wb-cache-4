5|$|A type of refined cooking {{developed}} in the late Middle Ages that set the standard among the nobility all over Europe. Common seasonings in the highly spiced sweet-sour repertory typical of upper-class medieval food included verjuice, wine and vinegar in combination with spices such as black pepper, saffron and ginger. These, along with {{the widespread use of}} sugar or honey, gave many dishes a sweet-sour flavour. Almonds were very popular as a <b>thickener</b> in soups, stews, and sauces, particularly as almond milk.|$|E
5|$|Lithium, sodium, and {{potassium}} have many applications, while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts {{but do not}} have many applications yet. Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica. Lithium stearate is a <b>thickener</b> {{and can be used}} to make lubricating greases; it is produced from lithium hydroxide, which is also used to absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines. Lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts. Metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys.|$|E
5|$|When being cooked, {{fried chicken}} is often divided into smaller pieces. The chicken is then {{generally}} {{covered in a}} batter, often consisting of ingredients such as eggs or milk, and a <b>thickener</b> such as flour. This is {{used to create a}} crust on the exterior of the meat. In addition, seasoning is often added at this stage. Once the chicken is ready to be cooked, it is placed in a deep fryer, frying pan or pressure cooker (depending on the method used) and fried in lard or a type of oil.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackground & aimsFluid <b>thickeners</b> are an {{important}} and commonly-used strategy to manage swallowing difficulties however there are no reports of the perceptions and experiences of parents of children using <b>thickeners.</b> MethodsSemi-structured interviews of 14 parents having a child using fluid <b>thickeners</b> due to swallowing difficulties. ResultsParents reported improvements in {{quality of life and}} health through the use of <b>thickeners.</b> They also reported persistent difficulties in the use of <b>thickeners.</b> ConclusionsResults showed unanimous goodwill and positive attitudes towards <b>thickeners</b> and their observed benefits, tempered by common difficulties with <b>thickeners</b> (variability and unpredictability). There remains scope for improvements of commercial <b>thickeners</b> and in information conveyed to users...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of different <b>thickeners,</b> as used in foodstuffs, on thermal inactivation of some relevant bacterial spores was investigated. The way <b>thickeners</b> affect the death-kinetics of spores depends on the bacterial species. A general statement about {{the influence of}} different <b>thickeners</b> on distinct spore-forming bacteria can not be given. It is evident, however, that some <b>thickeners</b> exert protection on spores during thermal treatment. This must be compensated by a higher thermal charge or other adequate precautions to avoid any hygienic risks in foodstuffs...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} common {{constituents}} of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar. Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries. By the Late Middle Ages biscuits (cookies in the U.S.) and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties. Grain, either as bread crumbs or flour, was also the most common <b>thickener</b> of soups and stews, alone or in combination with almond milk.|$|E

40|$|People {{who suffer}} from {{swallowing}} disorders, {{commonly referred to as}} dysphagia, are often restricted to a texture-modified diet. In such a diet, the texture of the fluid is modified mainly by the addition of gum or starch-based <b>thickeners.</b> For optimal modification of the texture, tunable rheological parameters are shear viscosity, yield stress, and elasticity. In this work, the flow properties of commercial <b>thickeners</b> obtained from major commercial suppliers were measured both in shear and extensional flow using a laboratory viscometer and a newly developed tube viscometry technique, termed Pulsed Ultrasound Velocimetry plus Pressure Drop (PUV[*]+[*]PD). The two methods gave similar results, demonstrating that the PUV[*]+[*]PD technique can be applied to study flow during the swallowing process in geometry {{similar to that of the}} swallowing tract. The <b>thickeners</b> were characterized in relation to extensional viscosity using the Hyperbolic Contraction Flow method, with microscopy used as a complementary method for visualization of the fluid structure. The gum-based <b>thickeners</b> had significantly higher extensional viscosities than the starch-based <b>thickeners.</b> The rheological behavior was manifested in the microstructure as a hydrocolloid network with dimensions in the nanometer range for the gum-based <b>thickeners.</b> The starch-based <b>thickeners</b> displayed a granular structure in the micrometer range. In addition, the commercial <b>thickeners</b> were compared to model fluids (Boger, Newtonian, and Shear-thinning) set to equal shear viscosity at 50 /s and it was demonstrated that their rheological behavior could be tuned between highly elastic, extension-thickening to Newtonian. Practical applications <b>Thickeners</b> available for dysphagia management were characterized for extensional viscosity to improve the understanding of these <b>thickeners</b> in large scale deformation. Extensional deformation behavior was further explained by using microcopy as corresponding technique for better understanding of structure/rheology relationship. Moreover, the major challenge in capturing human swallowing process is the short transit times of the bolus flow (< 1 s). Therefore, the ultrasound-based rheometry method; PUV+PD which measures the real-time flow curve in ∼ 50 ms was used in addition to classical shear rheometry. The two methods complimented each other indicating that the PUV+PD method can be applied to study the transient swallowing process which is part of our future research, where we are studying the flow properties of fluids in an in vitro swallowing tract...|$|R
50|$|Powdered solids {{may also}} be used as <b>thickeners,</b> {{especially}} as clays, which are used in some inexpensive, low performance greases. Fatty oil-based greases have also been prepared with other <b>thickeners,</b> such as tar, graphite, or mica, which also increase the durability of the grease.|$|R
50|$|Many {{other food}} {{ingredients}} {{are used as}} <b>thickeners,</b> usually {{in the final stages}} of preparation of specific foods. These <b>thickeners</b> have a flavor and are not markedly stable, thus are not suitable for general use. However, they are very convenient and effective, and hence are widely used.|$|R

25|$|Coriander is {{commonly}} found both as whole dried seeds and in ground form. Roasting or heating the seeds {{in a dry}} pan heightens the flavour, aroma, and pungency. Ground coriander seed loses flavour quickly in storage and is best ground fresh. Coriander seed is a spice in garam masala and Indian curries which often employ the ground fruits in generous amounts together with cumin, acting as a <b>thickener</b> in a mixture called dhana jeera.|$|E
50|$|Dropping {{point is}} used in {{combination}} with other testable properties to determine the suitability of greases for specific applications.

Instead, they separate oil, and the dropping point as a phase transition does not apply.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} under-exploited sources of non-starch polysaccharides from West African food {{was carried out}} on four {{commonly}} used traditional plant food <b>thickeners</b> namely, Grewia spp., Triumfetta spp., Beilschmiedia spp. and Irvingia gabonensis, bought from the markets of Maroua, Garoua and Ngaoundere in Cameroon. The extraction and isolation of water-soluble non-starch polysaccharides (s-NSP) were performed using standard analysis test to determine the intrinsic viscosity, {{the purity of the}} extracted s-NSP and original flours, as well as the concentration of polysaccharides and other nutrients using the standard. Chemical analysis of the five food <b>thickeners</b> showed variation in ash, protein, fat, moisture and carbohydrate content. Ash content was comparatively high for Nkui and Grewia, with mean contents of 9. 01 ± 1. 5 mg and 7. 92 ± 1. 1 mg respectively. Except for Nkui and Grewia which showed low protein content below 5 % whereas, the other three food <b>thickeners</b> had no significant variation in their protein contents. There were variations in monosaccharide’s composition of water soluble and non soluble polysaccharide across the five starch <b>thickeners.</b> Apart from galactose which was comparatively high with a mean value of 18. 1 ± 3. 1 mg in Nduk 1, xylose and fructose were not recorded for any of the water insoluble flour food <b>thickeners...</b>|$|R

In Vietnam, the starch called bột sắn dây is flavoured with pomelo oil and then used as a drink in the summer. In Japan, the plant is known as kuzu and the starch named kuzuko. Kuzuko is used in dishes including kuzumochi, mizu manjū, and kuzuyu. It also serves as a <b>thickener</b> for sauces, and can substitute for cornstarch.|$|E
25|$|Two {{different}} methods for the direct application of indigo {{were developed in}} England in the 18th century and remained in use well into the 19th century. The first method, known as 'pencil blue' because it was most often applied by pencil or brush, {{could be used to}} achieve dark hues. Arsenic trisulfide and a <b>thickener</b> were added to the indigo vat. The arsenic compound delayed the oxidation of the indigo long enough to paint the dye onto fabrics.|$|E
25|$|In {{order of}} {{increasing}} cost and decreasing product moisture {{the most common}} dewatering options are a <b>thickener,</b> deep bed thickening, belt presses and membrane filter presses. In general centrifuges and other competing technologies do not show a significant cost advantage compared to the belt press filter, for the same cake dryness. The cost of flocculant is often a major operating cost of dewatering equipment. Belt press filters in general have the lowest flocculant consumption {{for any of the}} listed processes excluding membrane filter presses and centrifuges.|$|E
5000|$|Food <b>thickeners</b> {{frequently}} {{are based on}} either polysaccharides (starches, vegetable gums, and pectin), or proteins. A flavorless powdered starch {{used for this purpose}} is a fecula (from the Latin faecula, diminutive of faex, [...] "dregs"). This category includes starches as arrowroot, cornstarch, katakuri starch, potato starch, sago, tapioca and their starch derivatives. Vegetable gums used as food <b>thickeners</b> include alginin, guar gum, locust bean gum, and xanthan gum. Proteins used as food <b>thickeners</b> include collagen, egg whites, and gelatin. Sugars include agar and carrageenan. Other thickening agents act on the proteins already present in a food. One example is sodium pyrophosphate, which acts on casein in milk during the preparation of instant pudding.|$|R
30|$|Drilling mud plays a {{critical}} role in the success of oil and gas drilling operations. It cools and lubricates drill bit, controls well pressure, transports and suspends cuttings. Mud must have a relatively high viscosity to effectively suspend cuttings. Therefore, mud <b>thickeners</b> are often added into mud to boost mud viscosity. The most widely used mud <b>thickeners</b> are carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) and hydroxy ethyl cellulose (HEC) (Rabia 1985).|$|R
