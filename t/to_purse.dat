25|$|Often an {{incomplete}} cleft lip requires the same surgery as complete cleft. This {{is done for}} two reasons. Firstly the group of muscles required <b>to</b> <b>purse</b> the lips run through the upper lip. In order to restore the complete group a full incision must be made. Secondly, to create a less obvious scar the surgeon tries to line up the scar with the natural lines in the upper lip (such as {{the edges of the}} philtrum) and tuck away stitches as far up the nose as possible. Incomplete cleft gives the surgeon more tissue to work with, creating a more supple and natural-looking upper lip.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Mars {{displaying}} sadness as he reminisces about the moments spent {{between him and}} his [...] "brunette vixen" [...] girlfriend in an [...] "sparsely" [...] decorated apartment. Throughout the video, the singer expresses his emptiness and devastation recurring to solo shots in which he stands [...] "around looking sullen" [...] and by using [...] "faded lighting" [...] in order to convey such sentiments. Flashes {{of the two of them}} giggling, kissing, snuggling, pouring out romance and being [...] "playful" [...] are shown, as the singer apparently misses their relationship. After the opening sequence, Mars holds a private screening of [...] "Breaking Dawn" [...] to please her, the couple kiss in front of a cinema projector lights, while romantic scenes from the , including the honeymoon and the one where Edward, played by Robert Pattinson, sweeps Bella, portrayed by Kristen Stewart, [...] "off her feet and into their new home", are projected on the wall. As the video continues, the couple begins to fight, leading to more [...] "heated arguments and lonely nights". At this point, Mars, possibly, writes a song <b>to</b> <b>purse</b> her to stay with him. A critic believed the song written only helped Mars to lead with the break up by telling the story. Nevertheless, MTV's, Jocelyn Vena stated [...] "we see that the song Bruno wrote while his lady was asleep turned out to be romantic enough to win her back." [...] The video ends with Mats revisiting scenes of the relationship and being set back to the present. In the final shot the singer is alone as rain pours down and hits the window behind him.|$|E

2500|$|After Badou Jack (21-1-2, 12 KOs) {{moved up}} to light heavyweight, on 19 June 2017, he {{revealed}} that his team were working towards a deal for him to fight Cleverly. He expected when the fight gets announced, it {{would be on the}} undercard of Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor in Las Vegas on 26 August 2017. On 19 July, according to sources, a deal was being close to being agreed from sides. On 27 July, [...] the World Boxing Association ordered Cleverly for fight undefeated WBA interim champion Dmitry Bivol (11-0, 9 KOs), which would eventually establish a mandatory challenger for 'super' champion Andre Ward. Both camps were given 30 days or it would go <b>to</b> <b>purse</b> bids. On August 9, Eddie Hearn confirmed that terms had been agreed for a fight between Jack and Cleverly. It was also reported that whether the WBA 'regular' title would be at state at this point was uncertain, as mandatory challenger Bivol was yet to agree a step aside fee. On 12 August, the WBA's Championships Committee granted special permission for the fight to be contested for their light heavyweight title. They also {{made it clear that the}} winner would need to negotiate a deal to fight Bivol by 11 September 2017. Cleverly lost the bout via 5th round stoppage, losing his WBA title in the process. Cleverly had some success in round 2, throwing and landing continuously without hurting Jack. In round 4, Jack piled the pressure on Cleverly, who left himself open and ended up with a bloodied nose. The end came with Cleverly against the ropes and Jack pounding him with combinations. Referee stepped in and called an end to the fight at 2 minutes and 47 seconds of round 5. At the time of stoppage, Jack had landed 172 punches of 442 thrown (39%), while Cleverly, who threw 409, only landed 82 punches (20%). In the post-fight, Jack said, [...] "I wanted to box him and feel him out while establishing my jab. Then the plan was to break him down from there. The plan was to finish him." [...] Cleverly stated that he suffered a broken nose in the third round. Jack also told Jim Gray of Showtime, “You can’t leave it in the hands of the judges. You have to go for the kill,” referring to his previous fight decisions.|$|E

60|$|There {{was no need}} of any order. The men flung {{themselves}} panting {{against the}} sides of the square, for they had good reason to know that whoso was left outside when the fighting began would very probably die in an extremely unpleasant fashion. The little hundred-and-fifty-pound camel-guns posted at one corner of the square opened the ball as the square moved forward by its right to get possession of a knoll of rising ground. All had fought in this manner many times before, and there was no novelty in the entertainment; always the same hot and stifling formation, the smell of dust and leather, the same boltlike rush of the enemy, the same pressure on the weakest side, the few minutes of hand-to-hand scuffle, and then the silence of the desert, broken only by the yells of those whom their handful of cavalry attempted <b>to</b> <b>purse.</b> They had become careless. The camel-guns spoke at intervals, and the square slouched forward amid the protesting of the camels. Then came the attack of three thousand men who had not learned from books that it is impossible for troops in close order to attack against breech-loading fire.|$|E
60|$|In February, Frank again {{went back}} to college; having settled with Harry Baker certain affairs which weighed on his mind. He {{went back to}} Cambridge, {{promising}} to be home on the 20th of the month, {{so as to be}} present at his sister's wedding. A cold and chilling time had been named for these hymeneal joys, but one not altogether unsuited to the feelings of the happy pair. February is certainly not a warm month; but with the rich it is generally a cosy, comfortable time. Good fires, winter cheer, groaning tables, and warm blankets, make a fictitious summer, which, to some tastes, is more delightful than the long days and the hot sun. And some marriages are especially winter matches. They depend for their charm on the same substantial attractions: instead of heart beating to heart in sympathetic unison, purse chinks <b>to</b> <b>purse.</b> The rich new furniture of the new abode is looked to instead of the rapture of a pure embrace. The new carriage is depended on rather than the new heart's companion; and the first bright gloss, prepared by the upholsterer's hands, stands in lieu of the rosy tints which young love lends to his true votaries.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{beginning}} of the 2007 school year, a confrontation between a school security guard and a student led to an unusual student protest that made international news. In February 2007, parents were notified of a new regional policy that prohibited students from carrying their books, school work, and belongings in backpacks between classes, as well as banning jacket wearing. The policy was intended for both student health concerns, safety concerns, and to limit the possibility to conceal weapons and other contraband. The new regulations still allowed girls <b>to</b> carry <b>purses</b> <b>to</b> hold their personal items. Some female students used larger purses that would accommodate their school materials as well, functioning as a book bag. [...] After the boys of the school complained on the basis of gender discrimination, the school announced the policy would be amended <b>to</b> ban <b>purses</b> as well. Some of the students misunderstood the announcement, belieing that the size of the purses was all that mattered. Rumors quickly began spreading that girls would only be allowed <b>to</b> carry <b>purses</b> during their menstrual periods.|$|R
