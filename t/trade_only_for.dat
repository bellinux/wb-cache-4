5000|$|A {{trade fair}} (trade show, trade {{exhibition}}, or expo) is an exhibition organized so that companies {{in a specific}} industry can showcase and demonstrate their latest products and services, meet with industry partners and customers, study activities of rivals, and examine recent market trends and opportunities. In contrast to consumer fairs, only some trade fairs {{are open to the}} public, while others can only be attended by company representatives (members of the trade, e.g. professionals) and members of the press, therefore trade shows are classified as either [...] "public" [...] or [...] "trade only". A few fairs are hybrids of the two; one example is the Frankfurt Book Fair, which is <b>trade</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> its first three days and open to the general public on its final two days.

50|$|The North American fur trade {{began in}} the seventeenth century when European and Aboriginal people began meeting at the St. Lawrence to trade goods. The Europeans were mainly {{interested}} in buying furs for the luxury fur and felt market in Europe. Beaver pelts for use in millinery were particularly sought after. Aboriginal people knew the best places and methods for trapping, and therefore became valuable procurers for the Europeans. Because European traders had no knowledge of the Canadian landscape and climate, they also needed Aboriginal assistance in surviving. In contrast, Aboriginal people were interested in European goods that they previously had no access to, such as metal pots and utensils. As trade continued, the Ojibwa people would act as middlemen for the traders, bringing goods into the western interior to trade with the Cree and Assiniboine, and bringing furs back to the Europeans. As the trade progressed into the eighteenth century, the Cree and Assiniboine people would start becoming middlemen themselves, increasing their participation in the trade. As more Aboriginal people became involved in the trade it became apparent that personal relationships were becoming important aspects of the trade. Fostering relationships was a valuable way to secure trade access and loyalty between particular native groups and European traders. Some historians even believe that this is what caused the great success of the fur trade. For example, Brenda Macdougall writes that Aboriginal people refused to <b>trade</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> economic reasons, illuminating how personal relationships were pivotal for the success of the fur trade.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine whether}} two {{important}} theories of trade, the Heckscher-Ohlin {{theory and the}} increasing returns theory, can account for the empirical success of the so-called gravity equation. Since versions of both theories can predict this equation, we tackle the model identification problem by conditioning bilateral trade relations on factor endowment differences and on the share of intraindustry <b>trade.</b> <b>Only</b> <b>for</b> large differences in factor endowments does the Heckscher-Ohlin model predict perfect production specialization in different countries {{as well as the}} gravity equation, and trade is purely in goods produced with different factor intensities. Our empirical analysis yields three findings. First, the predictions of the perfect specialization versions of both theories are rejected by the data and so are unlikely explanations for the empirical success of the gravity equation. Second, a model of imperfect specialization that includes both increasing returns and factor endowments as sources of trade has a mixed performance: it correctly predicts production of more differentiated goods when the level of intraindustry trade is greater; however, the predicted link to factor proportions is tenuous. Third, the predictions of a model with imperfect specialization that relies solely on differences in factor endowments find support in the data. These results suggest that factor endowments and increasing returns explain different components of the international variation of production patterns and trade volumes. ...|$|E

With different trading mechanisms in the stock and options markets, this finding implies that investors, when facing different impediments to information-related trading, select different vehicles to exploit their information.

40|$|Different {{weather events}} play an {{important}} role for industries with profits depending on temperature or other weather conditions. A mar-ket for trading on temperature events has recently emerged. The traded financial contracts allowing to transfer weather risks are called weather derivatives. The value of those contracts depend on a certain weather event, which is in the most cases average temperature. The organized market for weather derivatives in Germany is still small. There are only two cities on which weather the derivatives are traded: Berlin and Essen. For many important locations of weather depen-dent industries no weather derivatives are traded. The problem of calculating arbitrage free prices for those regions arises. In this diploma thesis temperature based weather derivatives on CAT index are considered, currently <b>traded</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> Berlin and Essen. They are used to construct CAT future prices for Munich where there is no organized trading on temperature events.

40|$|The {{world trade}} {{collapsed}} {{in the most recent}} recession. Some analysts have suggested the increasing offshoring of the supply chain, or vertical specialization (VS) trade, can explain the apparent increase in volatility of trade over the business cycle. This paper develops a model of VS trade to examine its impact on the volatility of trade. The model features increased trade volatility as VS trade increases when goods production is more volatile than services production. While the simulated model generates the observed increase in relative volatility of trade to GDP from 1967 to 2002, most of the increase is due to GDP’s shift to less volatile services production. VS <b>trade</b> <b>only</b> accounts <b>for</b> a third of the increase. Counterintuitively, VS trade can moderate trade volatility. ...|$|R
