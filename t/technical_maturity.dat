40|$|Over {{the last}} quarter, we {{continued}} to optimize procedures for producing free-standing, defect free films using rigid silicon and glass substrates. A strong correlation was observed between sputter power and formation of defects (pinholes) in the film; i. e., lower power, and correspondingly lower deposition rate, results in a lower defect density. Films less than 1 {micro}m-thick have been successfully released from both silicon and glass substrates although the minimum thickness for pinhole-free films over a 4 -inch diameter disc {{is still on the}} order of 3 - 4 {micro}m. Results from hydrogen permeation testing over the last quarter have shown a marked increase in membrane performance primarily due to proper alloy composition and pre-treatment procedures. As an example, the hydrogen flux at 400 C and 20 psi trans-membrane pressure, for a 5 {micro}m-thick membrane, was 120 cm{sup 3 } (STP) /cm{sup 2 } min. The productivity of this membrane exceeds the 2015 DOE Fossil Energy targets.

For example, the design principles developed for LCoS could be applied to other phase-controllable arrays in a straightforward fashion if a suitable phase stroke (greater than 2π at 1550 nm) can be achieved. However the requirements for low electrical crosstalk and high fill factor over very small pixels required to allow switching in a compact form factor remain serious practical impediments to achieving these goals.|$|E

40|$|Key words: soccer, {{winners and}} losers, effectiveness, {{analysis}} of difference The need {{to optimize the}} training process induces trainers and theoreti-cians of team games to search for factors decisive for the all-round devel-opment of a player. A strict identification of victory and defeat factors in soccer is quite difficult, because this game is always a bit of lottery. Therefore this study has been conducted to find factors of an effective soccer game. In order to do this, technical and tactical actions were compared in 7 games of winners and losers – the finalists of the Soccer Champions League in 1997 - 2003. Game data were marked on observation spread-sheets; Szwarc's method of game description and registration was applied. It was proved that just shots on goal {{in the course of}} the games and an effective goalkeeper game are the factors which make a difference between the teams which win and those who fail to succeed. Estimation of quality and effectiveness of technical and tactical actions of players from winning teams and those which were defeated reveals such game elements that are decisive for victory.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Anil Karanjai {{made a huge}} impact in Indian art circles with his <b>technical</b> <b>maturity</b> and his dreamlike, often nightmarish, angry imagery. In many of his early paintings, contorted human forms emerge from weird landscapes to {{threaten}} and accuse; natural forms - rocks, clouds, animals and trees - become a vehicle for mass consciousness, waiting to release its energy against centuries of oppression. After his move to Delhi, his grotesque human forms were often integrated with ruins, {{a metaphor for the}} tyranny of history. An element of satirical humour is not, however, absent from most of these canvases. Moreover, Anil's imagery sometimes communicates a poetic romanticism, almost soft in expression. This would become much more pronounced in many of his later works in which landscape would become the predominant motif and in which the human presence is subtly suggested, often by a pathway or steps leading to a mysterious destination. Ghostly whispers also echo in his landscapes through old walls, gateways or sculpted pillars.|$|E

40|$|This {{composition}} portfolio submission for {{the degree}} of Master of Music at the Elder Conservatorium of Music, University of Adelaide, comprises a collection of original compositions supported by an explanatory exegesis. The folio consists of: a choral-orchestral Cantata in seven movements for baritone soloist, choir and string orchestra based on poems by Yr Ham, The Lost Coin; a Woodwind Quartet in four movements; a String Quartet in three movements; and a Woodwind Trio in three movements. The overall performing duration of the works is approximately 70 minutes. The original compositions which {{are the product of}} this research study have rhythmic ambiguity and irregularity as their main focus, and are intended to be at a standard that is playable by advanced secondary or amateur musicians who enjoy community music making. There has been an exploration of a variety of rhythmic ideas within individual works and across the whole folio, with deliberate, though not exclusive, use of prime number time signatures, irregular groupings, and changing times at the ends of phrases forming rhythmic cadential figures. <b>Technical</b> and emotional <b>maturity</b> demands made by these musical works have been considered and kept well within the reach of the intended performers.

This paper presents the genealogy of the local population, quality characteristics and productivity potential resistance to pathogens and vegetation period. This local population has attracted particular attention by its uniqueness, cultivar with long, large fruits, similar to those of long pepper but, at <b>technical</b> and physiological <b>maturity</b> are colored in yellow-orange and are hot.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} the evaluation of the variability present in a segregating wine grape population derived from a cross between Graciano × Tempranillo, two Spanish varieties, in order to select improved genotypes with potential for producing high-quality wines in a climate change scenario. For that purpose, the phenotypic segregation of 16 agronomic traits related to production and phenology and 11 enological traits related to <b>technical</b> and phenolic <b>maturity</b> was studied in the progeny for three consecutive years. All traits presented transgressive segregation and continuous variation. Year effect was significant for all traits except total, extractable and skin anthocyanins content. However, a high level of genotype consistency for enological traits was revealed by repeatabilities and correlations between years. Significant correlations among traits were observed but most associations were weak. Furthermore, the CAPS (Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence) marker for the VvmybA genotype was tested to determine whether it would be useful in indirect selection for berry anthocyanins content. The results showed that the number of homozygous and heterozygous genotypes for the functional colour allele adjusted to a 1 : 1 segregation ratio, and that homozygous genotypes had significantly higher anthocyanins content. Principal component analysis found eight variables that contributed up to 80 % of the phenotypic variability present in the population. Seven groups of hybrids were distinguished based on ripening time, cluster weight, berry weight and anthocyanins content by cluster analysis; and fourteen genotypes were pre-selected for further research. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
