40|$|This {{project was}} {{inspired}} by <b>my</b> <b>grandmother’s</b> love of quilting. She passed away in 2001 and I have fond memories of sewing with her from a very young age. Quilting was her passion. Although I did make a few quilts with <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> when I was young, I {{did not get the}} opportunity to make quilts with her as an adult. With this project, I set out <b>to</b> marry <b>my</b> <b>grandmother’s</b> passion for quilting with my own passion for painting. This project gave me the opportunity <b>to</b> honor <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> by looking <b>to</b> her quilts for inspiration for my work. Creating these painted quilts has allowed me to look into the past for inspiration and discover a new appreciation for a traditional craft. I have gained knowledge in the history of quilting in America and how it developed into art. The work I created shows a commitment to learning traditional quilt block piecing techniques. Just as quilts were made in the past to preserve a person’s memory, I too have preserved the memory and legacy of <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> through creating these painted quilts.

60|$|In {{order to}} be at hand when I might need him, Walkirk took up his {{residence}} at the village tavern, or, as {{some of us were}} pleased to call it, the inn. To make him available when occasion should require, I took him with me to the scene of my building operations and <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandmother's</b> farm, and he there showed the same intelligent interest that he gave <b>to</b> <b>my</b> evening recitals. I had no difficulty in finding occupation for my under-study, and, so far as I could judge, he attended to the business I placed in his hands as well as I could have done it myself; indeed, in some instances, he did it better, for he gave it more time and careful consideration.|$|R

40|$|In this Master’s thesis I {{represent}} <b>my</b> <b>grandmother’s</b> {{story of}} survival during the Holocaust as {{a narrative of}} loss, love, and dancing. This qualitative and creative research project is informed by in-depth interviews with <b>my</b> <b>grandmother,</b> life writing, sustained reflection on my own life experiences, and a recent research trip to Poland where I visited key sites linked <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandmother’s</b> story. During the research process, I also considered the ways my Bubby’s story has shaped my identity as a third-generation survivor, as I have been deeply influenced by her perspective on life. Through my use of oral history, life writing and an art installation, I have gained {{greater understanding of the}} significance of multi-sensory learning, storytelling and creative art initiatives and recognize these methods as meaningful tools for Holocaust education. For me, the thesis has initiated ongoing research into the effects of memory, multi-sensory learning and creative art practices. For a larger audience, I suggest that this use of story can enhance multi-disciplinary learning, illustrate the complexities of the Holocaust through artful renderings, and inspire educators to adopt creative and powerful pedagogic tools in teaching the history of genocide...|$|R

60|$|<b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> {{took the}} flute, started, put her {{spectacles}} {{closer to her}} eyes, examined the instrument, and turned pale--for her cheeks still retained {{a little of the}} color of their youth--and then cast a glance hurriedly and anxiously at me. I could see that she was pondering on something profoundly in her most secret mind, for a minute or two. Luckily the others were too much occupied with the box of the pedler to heed her movements. She walked slowly out of the door, almost brushing me as she passed, and went into the hall. Here she turned, and, catching my eye, she signed for me to join her. Obeying this signal, I followed, until I was led into a little room, in one of the wings, that I well remembered as a sort of private parlor attached <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>grandmother's</b> own bedroom. <b>To</b> call it a boudoir would be to caricature things, its furniture being just that of the sort of room I have mentioned, or of a plain, neat, comfortable, country parlor.
