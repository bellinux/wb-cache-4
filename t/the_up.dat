40|$|Background: Nursing students, {{like other}} {{healthcare}} students, {{are at high}} risk of occupational exposure to blood and bodily fluids. Studies have shown that use of <b>the</b> Universal Precautions (<b>UPs)</b> lowers this risk, but do students know and practise these precautions?Objectives: This study investigated the knowledge and practice of undergraduate nursing students regarding <b>the</b> <b>UPs,</b> and whether there was a correlation between knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>UPs</b> and their practice. Method: This was a descriptive quantitative study amongst undergraduate nursing students in years 2 – 4 (n = 253), who were selected by means of stratified random sampling. A questionnaire was administered to the participants by the researcher. The data collected were analysed through use of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 16. 0) and content analysis. Results: It was established that there was indeed a lack of knowledge regarding <b>the</b> <b>UPs,</b> and that <b>the</b> students’ self-reported practice of <b>the</b> <b>UPs</b> was poor. There was no statistically significant correlation between knowledge and practice of <b>the</b> <b>UPs.</b> Conclusion: More structured educational programmes are needed to improve both knowledge and practice of <b>the</b> <b>UPs.</b> These programmes should be offered across all nursing student study years as continuous professional development...|$|R

5|$|In {{the age of}} {{the auto}} trail, the roads that later formed US2 through <b>the</b> <b>UP</b> were given a few {{different}} highway names. When the original roadways between Ironwood and Iron River were completed in late 1915, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau (UPDB) named the area Cloverland and the highway the Cloverland Trail. Later the name was extended over the highway to Escanaba, and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927. The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. Through <b>the</b> <b>UP,</b> the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US2, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|M-45 was {{originally}} designated in <b>the</b> <b>UP</b> {{on what is}} now M-95 by July 1, 1919. The highway ran between M-12 in Sagola and M-15 in Humboldt Township. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, US2 replaced most of M-12 through <b>the</b> <b>UP.</b> M-45 was extended south of Sagola to {{the north side of}} Iron Mountain. Along with this change, M-69 replaced another previous section of M-12 and all of M-90. M-69 ran concurrently with M-45 between Sagola and Randville to connect these two highway segments. By 1933, M-45 was extended concurrently along US2/US141 into Iron Mountain and then as an independent routing through Kingsford to the Wisconsin state line. Before the next year, the M-95 replaced M-45 in <b>the</b> <b>UP.</b>|$|E

5|$|One Canadian auto {{trail was}} routed through <b>the</b> <b>UP</b> as well. In 1920, the King's International Highway linked Vancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, {{but there was}} no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to {{continue}} along the auto trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used US2 through <b>the</b> <b>UP</b> from Ironwood to Sault Ste. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960; by that time, the auto trail had taken on the Trans-Canada Highway name.|$|E

5|$|The {{station at}} Chalfont Road was built with almost all {{facilities}} on <b>the</b> <b>up</b> side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, {{was on the}} other side of the tracks, most passengers travelling to and from the station were obliged to take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road giving access to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London–Aylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside <b>the</b> <b>up</b> platform for trains to Chesham. A run-around loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform always to be at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line were obliged to push their trains out of the station before performing the manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|There were {{initially}} two platforms, up and down. <b>The</b> <b>up</b> platform was accessed {{from the upper}} floor of the station building via a stairway outside the building.

5|$|US Highway 2 (US2) is a {{component}} of the United States Numbered Highway System that connects Everett, Washington, to the Upper Peninsula (UP) of the US state of Michigan, with a separate segment that runs from Rouses Point, New York, to Houlton, Maine. In Michigan, the highway runs through <b>the</b> <b>UP</b> in two segments {{as a part of the}} state trunkline highway system, entering the state at Ironwood and ending at St. Ignace; in between, US2 briefly traverses the state of Wisconsin. As one of the major transportation arteries in <b>the</b> <b>UP,</b> US2 is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern Midwest states. Two sections of the roadway are included as part of the Great Lakes Circle Tours, and other segments are listed as state-designated Pure Michigan Byways. There are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along US2 that date to the 1910s and 1920s. The highway runs through rural sections of <b>the</b> <b>UP,</b> passing through two national and two state forests in the process.|$|E
