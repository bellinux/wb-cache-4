5000|$|Area Code or Exchange Routing. Toll-free traffic {{may also}} be routed {{depending}} upon {{the location of the}} caller. For instance, if a company has call centers in the north and in the south, they may express a preference to have their southern callers speak with people in the southern call centers. Companies may also wish {{to take advantage of the}} difference in interstate rates versus intrastate rates. For example, the cost of a telephone call across multiple states may be less expensive than a call within a state, and as a result, the ability <b>to</b> <b>route</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> originating in Michigan to a call center outside Michigan can save a company substantial amounts of money.|$|E
50|$|A {{voice call}} {{originating}} in the VoIP environment also faces challenges to reach its destination if the number is routed to a mobile phone number on a traditional mobile carrier. VoIP has been identified {{in the past as}} a Least Cost Routing (LCR) system, which is based on checking the destination of each telephone call as it is made, and then sending the call via the network that will cost the customer the least. This rating is subject to some debate given the complexity of call routing created by number portability. With GSM number portability now in place, LCR providers can no longer rely on using the network root prefix to determine how <b>to</b> <b>route</b> <b>a</b> <b>call.</b> Instead, they must now determine the actual network of every number before routing the call.|$|E
5000|$|The phreakers {{informed}} Draper that a toy whistle that was, at the time, {{packaged in}} boxes of Cap'n Crunch cereal could emit a tone at precisely 2600 hertz—the same frequency {{that was used}} by AT&T long lines to indicate that a trunk line was ready and available <b>to</b> <b>route</b> <b>a</b> new <b>call.</b> [...] This would effectively disconnect {{one end of the}} trunk, allowing the still connected side to enter an operator mode.

With number portability now in place in many countries, LCR providers can no longer rely on using only a portion of the dialed telephone number <b>to</b> <b>route</b> <b>a</b> <b>call.</b> Instead, they now need to discover the actual current network of every number before routing the call. Thus, LCR solutions also need to handle MNP when routing a voice call. In countries without a central database like UK it might be necessary to query the GSM network about the home network a mobile phone number belongs to.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates fast {{routing table}} lookup techniques, where {{the table is}} {{composed}} of hierarchical addresses such as those found in a national telephone network.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{off-peak}} {{hours of a}} day, when incoming and outgoing traffic arrival rate used to be low, a Mobile Terminal (MT) can stay in idle mode for long time. For tracking the idle MTs, a wireless access network invokes them to conduct location update whenever they enter into a new location. This allows the network <b>to</b> <b>route</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> successfully. To provide any IP packet based service, Mobile IP (MIP) is very important protocol undeniably. However, Proxy Mobile IP was developed by IETF without considering idle mode condition of MTs. Consequently, an idle MT needs to conduct MIP binding (Layer 3 location update) whenever it moves to a new area of a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) although {{it does not have}} any incoming or outgoing packets during idle periods. This phenomenon unnecessarily increases location update signaling cost. In our previous work, we proposed a mechanism using which only Layer 2 location update is needed when an MT is in idle mode and the Layer 3 location update is conducted after a call arrives for an idle MT in Optical and Wireless Converged Access Networks (OWCAN). This allows saving energy in the mobility management nodes (e. g. MAG, Base Stations) significantly. Based on our previous work, in this paper we propose a novel algorithm for the Optical Network Units (ONUs) of an OWCAN. This algorithm decides when to interrupt modules of a sleeping ONU to wake up and which frames should be forwarded for uplink transmission. We have found that adopting this algorithm an ONU of an OWCAN can save energy significantly. Therefore, our solutions mainly contribute in two-fold to make a green OWCAN. First, it minimizes energy consumption in the mobility management nodes. Second, our solution also reduces energy consumption and improves bandwidth utilization in the optical backhaul...|$|E

50|$|The {{importance}} of the freight road waned as the Oregon Short Line Railroad and the Utah Northern Railroad pushed into Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. By July 1884 the stage route was defunct, but Kelton still had the transcontinental railroad.

Kelton's former section was relegated to a mere backup line, used in case of high water, and to service local farmers and ranchers.

40|$|The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is {{a popular}} routing {{technique}} for IP networks, where the core problem is <b>to</b> find <b>a</b> <b>route</b> (<b>called</b> LSP) that satisfy all the capacity constraints imposed by a specific traffic.

The present paper discusses the influence of different crossover and selection methods in achieving a fast and accurate convergence of the genetic algorithm, when solving the MPLS allocation problem. The experimental results, using different network topologies such as Carrier, Dora, and Mesh, have shown that uniform crossover and Stochastic Remainder Sampling selection are the most suitable combination to solve the problem. 2.
