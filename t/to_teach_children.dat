Its late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century football teams were nationally prominent, and Warner was paid $1,200 (approximately $33,000 in 2016), an exceptionally high salary for a coach at the time.|$|E
5|$|Kids Can Say No! was {{the first}} British children's film about sexual abuse. The film is {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, {{how to get out}} of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep it from being frightening to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Margaret Roffey {{was born}} in London, England, the {{daughter}} of Anne (n√©e Murphy) and Peter Roffey. She moved to the United States at age three in 1959, when her father, an anesthesiologist, took up a fellowship at the University of Washington. Her mother was a nurse practitioner whose specialty was women's health. The Roffey family, including Sally and her three siblings, enjoyed the outdoors, and Sally went sailing and hiking from a young age. A two-week camping trip <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> ecology inspired her love of the outdoors when she was nine years old. She graduated in 1973 from Renton High School.|$|E

5|$|Monotype later {{created a}} bold and bold italic (called a {{semi-bold}} in some digitisations) {{to match the}} roman and italic of the original release. (True bold type {{did not exist in}} Kis's time.) Released in 1967, Fleet Titling was a capitals-only alphabet intended to serve as a companion for titling use. It was created by Monotype's occasional collaborator John Peters, a Cambridge University Press designer who also worked as a private printer. Monotype used it for their logo and letterhead. More oddly, Monotype in the 1960s used Ehrhardt as a base for printing in the Initial Teaching Alphabet. This alphabet system, intended to be used <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> to read, used alternative characters for different sounds spelled with the same letter, like t's and c's dropped below the baseline of the text.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{said that}} {{he came up with}} the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. Kids Can Say No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids Can Say No! or any other film <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can Say No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of Kids Can Say No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E

25|$|Which style use in {{teaching}} reading has divided educators for years. It {{is now known}} that using the two approaches together is more powerful than either program alone. The technical skills learned through phonics are important for many children when learning to read, spell, and general language comprehension and engagement {{of children in the}} whole-language approach is also important to keep the children motivated and excited to learn. Many teachers and schools acknowledge this and say that they use multiple methods <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> to read.|$|E

25|$|Stories are {{effective}} educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember. Storytelling {{can be seen}} as a foundation for learning and teaching. While the storylistener is engaged, they are able to imagine new perspectives, inviting a transformative and empathetic experience. This involves allowing the individual to actively engage in the story as well as observe, listen and participate with minimal guidance. Listening to a storyteller can create lasting personal connections, promote innovative problem solving and foster a shared understanding regarding future ambitions. The listener can then activate knowledge and imagine new possibilities. Together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions. Because stories often have multiple layers of meanings, listeners have to listen closely to identify the underlying knowledge in the story. Storytelling is used as a tool <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> the importance of respect through the practice of listening. As well as connecting children with their environment, through the theme of the stories, and give them more autonomy by using repetitive statements, which improve their learning to learn competence. It is also used <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> to have respect for all life, value inter-connectedness and always work to overcome adversity. To teach this a Kinesthetic learningstyle would be used, involving the listeners through music, dream interpretation, or dance.|$|E
25|$|By 1917 the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society had {{the largest}} number of depositors of any savings bank in the United States and was second to the Emigrant Savings Bank in the amount of money deposited. In 1923 PSFS began the first in-school banking program at William Penn School for Girls. The program was {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> to save by allowing them to deposit money at the bank. In junior high schools PSFS had students work as tellers to collect and record deposits. PSFS also provided a separate counter just for student accounts at their headquarters. The School Accounts Counter included step stools for the youngest depositors. The program helped several generations of Philadelphians open up accounts as children, leading many to become lifelong customers.|$|E
25|$|An Episcopalian, Cozzens {{attended}} the Episcopal Kent School in Connecticut from 1916‚Äì22, and after graduation went to Harvard University for two years, where he published his first novel, Confusion, in 1924.

Neither book sold well or was widely read, and to sustain himself, Cozzens went to Cuba <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>children</b> of American residents, and there began to write short stories and gather material, which eventually became Cock Pit (1928) and The Son of Perdition (1929). After a year he accompanied his mother to Europe, where he tutored a young polio victim in order to earn money.|$|E
