5|$|The match {{received}} extensive {{media coverage}} in Northern Ireland, {{especially from the}} predominantly nationalist Irish News. The Belfast Telegraph dedicated several pages to the match the following day, including <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> covers, whereas The News Letter, a largely unionist publication, had sparse coverage, highlighting traditional attitudes to Gaelic games in Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The maxillary toothrows are {{parallel}} to each other. The molars are bunodont (with the cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests) and brachyodont (low-crowned) and have the inter-cusp valleys on the labial (outer) sides closed by a cingulum (shelf). The valleys on the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molars meet at the midlines. Each of the upper molars has three roots—unlike {{in most of the}} closest relatives of Pennatomys, there is no additional labial root on M1. The m1 has four roots—two large roots at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> and two smaller ones in the middle. There are three roots under m2, two at the front and one at the back, and two under m3, at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back.</b> Upper toothrow length ranges from 5.6 to 6.7mm and lower toothrow length is 5.9 to 7.4mm.|$|E
5|$|After the war started, the FBB {{provided}} wider security {{protection for}} Hitler when {{in residence at}} the Berghof, as he travelled by vehicle to front-line command posts and at military headquarters. They would be in heavily armed vehicles at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> of Hitler's convoy. In addition, army motorcycle outriders were positioned at {{the front and rear}} of the convoy of vehicles. The FBK would ride with Hitler and the RSD men would ride in a separate car during the trips.|$|E
5|$|As in all oryzomyines, {{the upper}} molars all have one root {{on the inner}} (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar in Pseudoryzomys and some other species has another labial root. The first lower molar has large roots at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two roots at the front, one labial and one lingual, and another at the back.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Four {{putative}} first lower molariforms (mf1s) of Ferugliotherium are known, and {{the only}} known tooth of Trapalcotherium is also thought to be an mf1. Ferugliotherium mf1s are roughly rectangular, with rounded corners, and bear two longitudinal rows of cusps. There are four cusps in the lingual row (on {{the side of the}} tongue) and three in the labial row (the side of the lips). The cusps are connected to cusps in the other row by transverse ridges and separated from cusps in their own rows by three transverse furrows. Two heavily worn Ferugliotherium mf1s were originally identified as upper molars of Vucetichia gracilis by Bonaparte in 1990. One of the two preserves the roots; at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back,</b> there were two roots, fused at their bases. The mf1 of Trapalcotherium differs only in some details; among others, the cusps are less distinct from the crests. The sole mf2 of Ferugliotherium is the holotype. It bears two rows of two cusps. The cusps in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> pairs are connected by a broad ridge and the two pairs are separated by a deep furrow. Transverse ridges between the cusps similar to those seen in ferugliotheriids are not known in any multituberculate. On the other hand, overall patterns of cusps and ridges are essentially similar among Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica, indicating that the three are closely related.|$|E
5|$|In {{a two-day}} match against Yorkshire, Miller struck 111 {{including}} three sixes when {{none of the}} teammates passed 30. His innings featured strokes from both <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> foot. The next day, he scored 75 in 83 minutes against Durham and took 2/1 in another win for the RAAF. That {{was the first of}} four back-to-back one-dayers for the RAAF; Miller scored two, 23 and nine against Scottish Services, Greenock and Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Julia Martha Thomas was {{a former}} schoolteacher who had been twice widowed. Since {{the death of her}} second husband in 1873, she had lived on her own at 2 Mayfield Cottages (also known as 2 Vine Cottages) in Park Road in Richmond. The house was a two-storey semi-detached villa built in grey stone with a garden at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back.</b> The area was not heavily {{populated}} at the time, although her house was close to a public house called The Hole in the Wall.|$|E
5|$|O'Donnell hired Chalkie Davies, a {{photographer}} for New Musical Express {{for two weeks}} to photograph the band on a US tour in early 1978 in order to capture enough pictures suitable for the album artwork. The front cover, featuring Lynott in the foreground, was originally {{supposed to be the}} back cover as the group wanted equal coverage of all members. O'Donnell disagreed and reversed <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> photographs at the last minute. The album had a working title of Thin Lizzy Live but Lynott decided that Live and Dangerous was better.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after making}} {{the choice to}} include {{electronic}} drums and triggers, Peart added what has become another trademark of his kit: a rotating drum riser. During live Rush shows the riser allows Peart to swap the prominent portions of the kit (traditional acoustic in front, electronic in back). A staple of Peart's live drum solos has been the in-performance rotation-and-swap of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> kits {{as part of the}} solo itself. This special effect provides both a symbolic transition of drum styles within the solo and a visual treat for the audience.|$|E

He {{was not required}} to wear the yellow badge of the Star of David on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> of his clothes; instead he wore a white and blue armband with the Star of David. He was allowed to enter and leave the ghetto at any time, and his daughter was not required {{to live in the}} ghetto, even though other half-Jews were confined within the ghetto. Gens and the Jewish policemen were allowed to carry pistols.|$|E
5|$|The fourth lower premolar (p4) {{is known}} from a poorly {{preserved}} specimen from Oberdorf and a less worn specimen from Tägernaustrasse. There are four ridges, of which <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> pair are connected at the lingual side {{and in the}} Oberdorf specimen also at the labial side. This tooth {{is similar to that}} of Muscardinus hispanicus, but the front pair is better developed. There is one root.|$|E
5|$|The {{specimen}} MACN Pv-RN 975, {{first described}} by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, {{may be a}} jaw fragment of Ferugliotherium, although {{it has also been}} identified as an unrelated multituberculate. The fossil preserves a bladelike premolar, identified as the fourth premolar, and the piece of the jawbone below it. A diastema (gap) is present between the premolar and the incisor that would have been located in front of it. The alveolus (socket) of the lower incisor extends {{all the way through the}} fossil. The p4 bears eight ridges on both sides of the longitudinal crest and is supported by two roots at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back.</b> The p4 assigned to Argentodites also has eight ridges on both sides, which descend from cusps on the upper margin, and roots at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back.</b> According to Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues, it differs from that of MACN Pv-RN 975 in its rounded, as opposed to angular shape. However, Gurovich and Beck attribute this difference to the fact that the latter has undergone much more wear.|$|E
