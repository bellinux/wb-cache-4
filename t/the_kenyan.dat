5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kenyan</b> government's {{attempt to}} defer the cases at the ICC by {{appealing}} {{to members of the}} UN Security Council failed without being voted on, however the government, represented by British lawyers Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon, have subsequently applied directly to the Court. <b>The</b> <b>Kenyan</b> government's application to Pre-Trial Chamber II that the two cases were inadmissible was rejected unanimously by the judges. Many victims of the post-election violence voiced opposition to the government's stance, and a poll of Kenyans conducted by Synovate shortly after Moreno Ocampo's announcement that he intended to seek summonses showed that sixty percent of Kenyans supported the trial of the accused taking place in The Hague.|$|E

5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is a 50 over cricket {{match between}} two {{representative}} teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by}} the International Cricket Council (ICC). An ODI differs from Test matches in that the number of overs per team is limited, and that each team has only one innings. , 50 players have represented <b>the</b> <b>Kenyan</b> national team in ODIs, since its debut in 1996.|$|E
50|$|Over the {{previous}} couple of months, the two Moroccan runners Ali Ezzine and Brahim Boulami had proven they could run with <b>the</b> <b>Kenyans</b> in sub-8:04 races. That still {{was not in}} the range of the capability of World Record holder Bernard Barmasai or previous record holder Wilson Boit Kipketer. But <b>the</b> <b>Kenyans</b> did not assert the same dominance they had displayed in {{the previous}} three Olympics.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kenyans</b> {{were led}} by the reigning World and Olympic {{champion}} Brimin Kipruto, followed by 2004 Olympic champion and world-leader Ezekiel Kemboi, and finally Olympic medallists Paul Kipsiele Koech and Richard Mateelong. Two French athletes offered the strongest possibility of beating <b>the</b> <b>Kenyans,</b> with Olympic silver medallist Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad and European record holder Bouabdellah Tahri. Other possible medallists were the in-form Moroccan Jamel Chatbi and the European Champion Jukka Keskisalo.|$|R

5|$|On 4 January, {{reports said}} ICU troops were split across Afmadow and Badade districts, and {{possibly}} concentrated {{at the former}} Al-Ittihad Al-Islamiya (AIAI) stronghold of Ras Kamboni. TFG and Ethiopian forces reported taking district capital Afmadow (2 January), and Dhobley along <b>the</b> <b>Kenyan</b> border (3 January), and were presently en route to Badade, the district capital just north of Ras Kamboni.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, {{operations}} moved towards {{securing the}} borders with Kenya {{in the provinces}} of Afmadow and Badhadhe in the Lower Juba region. Ethiopian aircraft and attack helicopters struck the town of Doble (Dhoobley) in Afmadow province, not far from <b>the</b> <b>Kenyan</b> border. The strikes were presumably to hit ICU elements attempting to cross the border. Fighting tailed off after midnight.|$|E

5|$|A polygamist, Idi Amin {{married at}} least six women, three of whom he divorced. He married his first and second wives, Malyamu and Kay, in 1966. In 1967, he married Nora, and then married Nalongo Madina in 1972. On 26 March 1974, he {{announced}} on Radio Uganda that he had divorced Malyamu, Nora, and Kay. Malyamu was arrested in Tororo on <b>the</b> <b>Kenyan</b> border in April 1974 and accused of attempting to smuggle a bolt of fabric into Kenya. She later moved to London where she operates a restaurant in East London. In 1974, Kay Amin died under mysterious circumstances, with her body found dismembered. Nora fled to Zaire in 1979; her current whereabouts are unknown.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{artillery}} strikes continued, eventually {{forcing the}} ICU frontlines to falter. A mutiny within the ICU caused their forces to disintegrate, and abandon both Jilib and Kismayo. At 10p.m., {{the sounds of}} battle died down. By midnight, the ICU front in Jilib had collapsed, and the ICU began to flee. By 2:00a.m., they had fled from Kismayo. Local militiamen patrolled the streets, and looting began of former ICU property. They were reported to be fleeing towards Ras Kamboni island in southern Somalia, or <b>the</b> <b>Kenyan</b> border.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{evacuation}} of its citizens on 13 January, the US government stated that it recognised that Zanzibar lay within Britain's sphere of influence, and would not intervene. The US did, however, urge that Britain cooperate with other Southeast African countries to restore order. The first British military vessel on the scene was the survey ship HMS Owen, which was diverted from <b>the</b> <b>Kenyan</b> coast and arrived {{on the evening of}} 12January. Owen was joined on 15January by the frigate Rhyl and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Hebe. While the lightly armed Owen had been able to provide the revolutionaries with an unobtrusive reminder of Britain's military power, the Hebe and Rhyl were different matters. Due to inaccurate reports that the situation in Zanzibar was deteriorating, the Rhyl was carrying a company of troops of the first battalion of the Staffordshire Regiment from Kenya, the embarkation of which was widely reported in <b>the</b> <b>Kenyan</b> media, and would hinder British negotiations with Zanzibar. The Hebe had just finished removing stores from the naval depot at Mombasa and was loaded with weapons and explosives. Although the Revolutionary Council was unaware of the nature of Hebes cargo, the Royal Navy's refusal to allow a search of the ship created suspicion ashore and rumours circulated that she was an amphibious assault ship.|$|E

5|$|Kenya Airways was {{established}} by <b>the</b> <b>Kenyan</b> government on , following the break-up of the East African Community and the consequent demise of East African Airways (EAA). On , two Boeing 707–321s leased from British Midland Airways inaugurated operations, serving the Nairobi–Frankfurt–London route. On internal and regional flights, the carrier deployed aircraft formerly operated by the EAA consortium, such as one Douglas DC-9-52 and three Fokker F-27-200s. In late 1977, three Boeing 707s were acquired from Northwest Orient. The following year, the company formed a charter subsidiary named Kenya Flamingo Airlines, which leased aircraft from the parent airline in order to operate international passenger and cargo services. Aer Lingus provided the company with technical and management support in the early years.|$|E
5|$|Kenya gained ODI {{status in}} its own right {{following}} a strong performance in the 1996 World Cup, a competition they qualified for by gaining a second-placed finish in the 1994 ICC Trophy. The team's first ODI came against India in the 1996 World Cup, a competition for which Kenya was given temporary ODI status, with the team then playing four further matches in the competition. Kenya's first ODI win came in their fourth World Cup match against the West Indies. The Kenyans won the game by 73 runs but ultimately finished last in group A. Kenya have since qualified for four more Cricket World Cups. They reached the group stage in the 1999 competition, the 2007 competition and the 2011 competition. At the 2003 Cricket World Cup, partly hosted in Kenya, <b>the</b> <b>Kenyan</b> team finished second in their group and in doing so qualified for the Super Sixes stage. Kenya finished third in the Super Sixes stage and qualified for the semi-finals where they lost to India by 91 runs. <b>The</b> <b>Kenyan</b> team have played 154 ODI games with the most recent coming in 2014. Thomas Odoyo and Steve Tikolo have played the most ODIs for Kenya with 131 each. Tikolo has scored the most runs with 3369 for the team while Odoyo has taken the most wickets with 141.|$|E

50|$|Ibrahim Hussein was <b>the</b> first <b>Kenyan</b> (and also <b>the</b> first African) to win Boston, {{setting a}} world record and having books written on his legacy.

50|$|World record holder Hicham El Guerrouj was {{the clear}} {{favorite}} {{coming into the}} race, {{but he had a}} reputation for setting records in races set up by a pacemaker. His countryman Youssef Baba provided the service, sacrificing his own ambition in the final, he took the pace out in 54.14, the two Moroccan teammates leading <b>the</b> two <b>Kenyan</b> challengers Noah Ngeny and Bernard Lagat, separating {{from the rest of the}} field. On the second lap the pace lagged to 60.63, letting the other runners back in. Baba disappeared quickly leaving El Guerrouj to burn off <b>the</b> <b>Kenyans</b> taking <b>the</b> third lap in 56.90. But <b>the</b> <b>Kenyans</b> remained close with Mehdi Baala a step behind. Through the final turn Ngeny executed a textbook kick, moving onto El Guerrouj's shoulder, sliding into the second lane and sprinting past him for the gold. Lagat moved into lane 3 with hopes of passing as well but ran out of real estate to take the bronze.|$|R
5|$|On 25 November 2012, it was {{announced}} that Kenya was chosen to host the tournament after bids were placed by the host nation as well as Rwanda. However, their hosting of the tournament was not confirmed until a congress meeting for the Confederation of African Football held in Marrakesh, Morocco on 11 March 2013, after it {{was announced}} that the Football Kenya Federation had met all the requirements for hosting the tournaments with support from <b>the</b> <b>Kenyan</b> government. The capital city Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Machakos and Nakuru were identified as host cities for the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{examples}} include Kenyan runner Bernard Lagat, {{who became a}} United States citizen in May 2004. <b>The</b> <b>Kenyan</b> constitution requires that one renounce their Kenyan citizenship when they become a citizen of another nation. Lagat competed for Kenya in the 2004 Athens Olympics {{even though he had}} already become a United States citizen. According to Kenya, he was no longer a Kenyan citizen, jeopardising his silver medal. Lagat said he started the citizenship process in late 2003 and did not expect to become an American citizen until after the Athens games.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kenyan</b> athletes {{emerged with}} both the {{individual}} and team titles in the men's and women's races. Despite limited experience in top level half marathon races, Wilson Kiprop and Florence Kiplagat won their respective races. Kiprop broke Zersenay Tadese's winning streak which dated back to 2006, out-sprinting the defending champion in the final stages. Sammy Kitwara won the men's bronze medal and helped Kenya to the men's team title. Led by Zersenay, the Eritrean men beat Ethiopia to the team silver medal spot.|$|E

He took 3 wickets for just 36 runs. He eventually took 5 wickets on tour at an economy rate of 5.78.|$|R
50|$|Kenya {{achieved}} {{independence and}} adopted a parliamentary system, {{largely due to}} the leadership of politicians who had been part of KAU. Despite guerrilla warfare and protests, the peaceful negotiations led by former KAU leaders prevailed, inspiring other movements across Africa and the world. The Royal Commission helped settle the land arguments between the British and <b>the</b> <b>Kenyans.</b> <b>The</b> Royal Commission also helped make government decisions and proved that the KAU was an organization that desired peace and tranquility.|$|R
5|$|The {{favourite}} for the men's {{race was}} Eritrean runner Zersenay Tadese (the defending champion with four straight wins), who {{had broken the}} world record earlier that year with a run of 58:23 minutes at the Lisbon Half Marathon. Newly minted African Champion Wilson Kiprop was {{the most prominent of}} <b>the</b> <b>Kenyan</b> contingent, which was the clear favourite for the team title through its hoard of sub-60 minute runners including Sammy Kitwara, Silas Kipruto and Moses Mosop. Other contenders were Ethiopian Lelisa Desisa and Eritrean Samuel Tsegay. Kenya was the defending champion in the team race.|$|E
5|$|In December 1964, Kenya {{was officially}} proclaimed a republic. Kenyatta became its {{executive}} President, a role combining {{the head of}} state and head of government. Over the course of 1965 and 1966, various constitutional amendments were made that enhanced the President's power. For instance, a May 1966 amendment gave the president the ability to order the detention of individuals without trial if the security of the state was regarded as threatened. Kenyatta sought to attain the support of Kenya's second largest tribal group, the Luo, thus appointing the Luo activist Odinga as his Vice President. However, the Kikuyu—who made up around 20 percent of <b>the</b> <b>Kenyan</b> population—still held most of the important government and administrative positions in the country. This contributed to a perception among many in the country that independence had simply seen the dominance of a European elite replaced by the dominance of a Kikuyu elite.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} in 2011 that Kenyatta has recruited British lawyers Steven Kay and Gillian Higgins, who previously defended Slobodan Milosevic at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, to lead his legal team. Francis Muthaura initially appointed another British lawyer, Karim Ahmad Khan, who previously led the defence of Charles Taylor at the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and subsequently also recruited Essa Faal and Shyamala Alagendra who both formerly worked in the ICC Prosecutor's office. Ali's defence was led by Canadian John Philpot, Kosgey's by Julius Kemboi, and William Ruto appointed Dr. Kindiki Kithure and Katwa Kigeni. Kigeni is also representing Joshua Sang. <b>The</b> <b>Kenyan</b> government has agreed to pay the legal costs of Francis Muthaura and Mohamed Ali due to their actions being taken {{in the course of}} their public employment. This decision has attracted criticism from many Kenyans.|$|E
