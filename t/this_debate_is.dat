5|$|<b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> still ongoing; at this time, Scelidosaurus is {{considered}} to be either more closely related to ankylosaurids than to stegosaurids and, by extension, a true ankylosaur, or basal to the ankylosaur-stegosaur split. The stegosaur classification has fallen out of favor, but is seen in older dinosaur books. Cladistic analyses have invariably recovered a basal position for Scelidosaurus, outside of the Eurypoda.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> also of {{importance}} when classifying the trust as either constructive or express, {{a matter of}} considerable debate. On one view, if the traditional theory is correct, secret trusts are created by the courts, and are thus constructive; if the more modern view is correct, the trusts exist without the court's permission, and are express trusts. However, a secret trust {{does not have to}} obey the separate formalities of the Law of Property Act 1925, even when it concerns land and one solution to this problem is to consider them constructive. Some commentators believe that half-secret trusts may fall into a different category to fully secret trusts in this regard.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> {{relevant}} {{because it}} is easy to imagine specific situations in which the arrival of an electron at a screen at a certain point and time would trigger one event, whereas its arrival at another point would trigger an entirely different event (e.g. see Schrödinger's cat - a thought experiment used as part of a deeper debate).|$|E

25|$|The {{causes and}} degree of Olmec {{influences}} on Mesoamerican cultures has been a subject of debate over many decades. Although the Olmecs {{are considered to be}} perhaps the earliest Mesoamerican civilization, there are questions concerning how and how much the Olmecs influenced cultures outside the Olmec heartland. <b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> succinctly, if simplistically, framed by the title of a 2005 New York Times article: “Mother Culture, or Only a Sister?”.|$|E
25|$|There {{is still}} {{controversy}} {{about the reasons}} for the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Some argue it {{is a direct result of}} alcohol's toxic effect on the nerves, but others say factors such as a nutritional deficiency or chronic liver disease may play a role in the development as well. <b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> ongoing and research is continuing in an effort to discover the real cause of alcoholic polyneuropathy.|$|E
25|$|What {{is perhaps}} the most {{debatable}} characteristic of this collage/montage form is the question of what is added to the message or content of the poem by using a more fragmented view. <b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> clearly visible within Langston Hughes' Montage in the question of who the primary voice belongs to and what is added by having Harlem shown through multiple people, as opposed to Hughes simply speaking from his own understanding of what makes Harlem.|$|E
30|$|One {{consequence}} of <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> {{the development of}} historical earthquake research as an interdisciplinary research field at the University of Vienna by Rolf Gutdeutsch.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{scheduled for}} January 6, 2008, {{but because the}} Iowa Caucus was moved up to January 3, 2008, the Des Moines Register moved the debate up to December 13.|$|R
50|$|The {{format of}} <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> {{identical}} {{to that of the}} first <b>debate.</b> There <b>were</b> six 15-minute segments, with the moderator introducing a topic and giving each candidate two minutes to respond, before allowing the candidates to discuss the topics.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} passage preserved, Encolpius is in a Greek town in Campania, perhaps Puteoli, {{where he is}} {{standing}} outside a school, railing against the Asiatic style and false taste in literature, which he blames on the prevailing system of declamatory education (1–2). His adversary in <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> Agamemnon, a sophist, who shifts the blame from the teachers to the parents (3–5). Encolpius discovers that his companion Ascyltos has left and breaks away from Agamemnon {{when a group of}} students arrive (6).|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} {{indigenous}} children, by which mixed-race children of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent {{were removed from}} their families by Australian Federal and State government agencies and church missions, was a policy actively conducted in the period between approximately 1905 and 1969. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission argued that these removals constituted attempted genocide and had {{a major impact on}} the Indigenous population. Such interpretations of Aboriginal history are disputed by a few historians such as Keith Windschuttle as being exaggerated or fabricated for political or ideological reasons. <b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> part of what is known within Australia as the History Wars.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{theories}} of {{the location of the}} order Euphausiacea. Since the first description of Thysanopode tricuspide by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1830, the similarity of their biramous thoracopods had led zoologists to group euphausiids and Mysidacea in the order Schizopoda, which was split by Johan Erik Vesti Boas in 1883 into two separate orders. Later, William Thomas Calman (1904) ranked the Mysidacea in the superorder Peracarida and euphausiids in the superorder Eucarida, although even up to the 1930s the order Schizopoda was advocated. It was later also proposed that order Euphausiacea should be grouped with the Penaeidae (family of prawns) in the Decapoda based on developmental similarities, as noted by Robert Gurney and Isabella Gordon. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> that krill share some morphological features of decapods and others of mysids.|$|E
50|$|On October 13, Kerry and Bush debated at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. The {{focus of}} <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> {{domestic}} policy issues. Again, polls were split, but more indicated a win for Kerry than Bush.|$|R
50|$|The {{focus of}} <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> Mustafa Kemal's {{abolition}} of the caliphate in 1924, and the response of some Arab Muslim scholars that it was incumbent upon Arabs, in particular, to reinstate the caliphate in Arab lands.|$|R
5000|$|<b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> {{shown on}} BBC One Scotland, BBC News and BBC Parliament. It {{featured}} {{representatives from the}} Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and the SNP, and was hosted by Glenn Campbell at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh.|$|R
25|$|Research on {{the repercussions}} of gender in toys {{suggests}} that play {{should be encouraged to}} be more gender neutral in order to work towards a desegregation of the genders. Too, researcher Carol Auster and Claire Mansbach promote that allowing children to play with toys which more closely fit their talents would help them to better develop their skills. In terms of parental influence, a study found that parents who demonstrated some androgynous behavior have higher scores in support, warmth, and self-worth in regards to the treatment of their children. Even as <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> evolving and children are becoming more inclined to cross barriers in terms of gender with their toys, girls are typically more encouraged to do so than boys because of the societal value of masculinity.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Pilbara Craton is {{the eastern}} {{portion of the}} Pilbara Craton located in Western Australia. This region {{contains}} variably metamorphosed mafic and ultramafic greenstone belt rocks, intrusive granitic dome structures, and volcanic sedimentary rocks. These greenstone belts worldwide {{are thought to be}} the remnants of ancient volcanic belts, and are subject to much debate in today's scientific community. Areas such as Isua and Barberton which have similar lithologies and ages as Pilbara have been argued to be subduction accretion arcs, while others suggest that they are the result of vertical tectonics. <b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> crucial to investigating when/how plate tectonics began on Earth. The Pilbara Craton along with the Kaapvaal Craton are the only remaining areas of the Earth with pristine 3.6–2.5 Ga crust. The extremely old and rare nature of this crustal region makes it a valuable resource in the understanding of the evolution of the Archean Earth.|$|E
25|$|Within the Roman Catholic Church, {{there has}} existed a {{sometimes}} tense relationship between Jesuits and the Holy See due to questioning of official church teaching and papal directives, {{such as those}} on abortion, birth control, women deacons, homosexuality, and liberation theology. Usually, this theological free thinking is academically oriented, being prevalent at the university level. From this standpoint, the function of <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> less to challenge the magisterium than to publicize the results of historical research or to illustrate the church's ability to compromise in a pluralist society based on shared values that do not always align with religious teachings. This has not prevented Popes from appointing Jesuits to powerful positions in the church. John Paul II and Benedict XVI together appointed ten Jesuit Cardinals to notable jobs. Under Benedict, Archbishop Luis Ladaria Ferrer was Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and Federico Lombardi was Vatican Press Secretary.|$|E
25|$|Attended by {{all eight}} candidates, <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> held during the NAACP convention. An on-stage {{conversation}} between Edwards and Clinton was overheard—due to activated microphones—in which {{they talked about}} eventually ceasing the participation of non-frontrunner candidates in future debates.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the summer}} of 2009, the YDA participated in an {{exhibition}} debate {{in the middle of}} Harold Square in New York City against the Harvard team debating various pop culture topics. Part of <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> later shown on VH1 news.|$|R
25|$|However, Romney soon {{changed his}} stance, {{and he did}} {{participate}} in the debate, held in Durham, New Hampshire on September 5, 2007. <b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> cosponsored by Fox News rather than CNN and was somewhat more conventional than the earlier debate on CNN.|$|R
25|$|The {{existence}} of CSCs is under debate, because many studies found no cells with their specific characteristics. Cancer cells must {{be capable of}} continuous proliferation and self-renewal to retain the many mutations required for carcinogenesis and to sustain {{the growth of a}} tumor, since differentiated cells (constrained by the Hayflick Limit) cannot divide indefinitely. For therapeutic consideration, if most tumor cells are endowed with stem cell properties, targeting tumor size directly is a valid strategy. If they are a small minority, targeting them may be more effective. Another debate is over the origin of CSCs - whether from disregulation of normal stem cells or from a more specialized population that acquired the ability to self-renew (which is related to the issue of stem cell plasticity). Confounding <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> the discovery that many cancer cells demonstrate a Phenotypic plasticity under therapeutic challenge, altering their transcriptomes to a more stem-like state to escape destruction.|$|E
25|$|The New Zealand or Land Wars were {{a series}} of wars fought between Māori {{on one side and}} a mixture of settler troops, {{imperial}} troops and other Māori on the other. What the wars were 'about' has been debated by historians, with Keith Sinclair arguing that they were about land, while James Belich has argued that although land was a major factor, the wars were essentially a contest over sovereignty. <b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> reflected in the naming of the wars: there is no real consensus over whether they should be called the 'New Zealand Wars' or the 'Land Wars', although Belich's television series about the conflict has popularised the former term. The name 'Māori Wars' has fallen into disuse. A Māori name for the conflict is 'Te Riri Pākehā' (white man's anger). While the fighting began in 1843 and the last shots were arguably fired in the early 20th century, the bulk of fighting took place in the 1860s.|$|E
500|$|The exact point made by Zhuangzi in <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> {{not entirely}} clear. [...] The story {{seems to make}} the point that [...] "knowing" [...] a thing is simply a state of mind, and that it is not {{possible}} to determine if that knowing has any objective validity. [...] This story has been cited as an example of Zhuangzi's linguistic mastery, as he subtly uses reason to make an anti-rationalist point.|$|E
40|$|Congress <b>is</b> <b>debating</b> {{whether or}} not to legalize more than 11 million {{unauthorized}} immigrants, as well as stricter border and workplace enforcement. Mostly left out of <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>are</b> the more than 5 million children living in unauthorized families, who, like their parents, would be greatly affected by the outcome of <b>this</b> <b>debate.</b> <b>This</b> fact sheet describes the population of U. S. children of immigrants [...] especially those with unauthorized parents...|$|R
25|$|A fifth debate {{took place}} on November 9 at Canal 13's studios in Santiago, which was {{broadcast}} live at 10 PM.

5000|$|<b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> {{due to the}} {{confusion}} of quadratic forms (represented by polynomials) and symmetric bilinear forms (represented by matrices), and [...] "twos out" [...] is now the accepted convention; [...] "twos in" [...] is instead the theory of integral symmetric bilinear forms (integral symmetric matrices).|$|R
500|$|In {{the book}} , Aeon J. Skoble cited the episode {{as an example}} in his piece titled: [...] "Do We Admire or Laugh at Lisa?". He wrote: [...] "The fact that the less {{intellectual}} doll is vastly preferred over Lisa's doll, even though Lisa's objections are reasonable, demonstrates {{the ways in which}} reasonable ideas can be made to {{take a back seat to}} having fun and going with the flow. <b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> often played out in the real world, of course: Barbie is the subject of perennial criticism along the lines of Lisa's ...|$|E
500|$|Relevant to <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> {{the absence}} of any {{compositions}} by Rocky IV composer Vince DiCola, except for the song [...] "Hearts on Fire", co-written by DiCola, Ed Fruge and Joe Esposito. DiCola is the only person, other than Bill Conti, to act as composer on a Rocky film and his work was used extensively on the 1991 compilation CD The Rocky Story: Songs from the Rocky Movies. The missing DiCola tracks are the only tracks on the 1991 CD that are not present on the new CD which indicates an effort to use only Rocky Balboa composer Conti's tracks.|$|E
500|$|Structure and agency, {{sometimes}} referred to as determinism versus voluntarism, form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: [...] "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" [...] In this context 'agency' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas 'structure' relates to factors that limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological epistemology ("What is the social world made of?", [...] "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?"). A perennial question within <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> that of [...] "social reproduction": how are structures (specifically, structures producing inequality) reproduced through the choices of individuals? ...|$|E
40|$|After denial, {{there is}} acceptance. Some in Labour {{have not yet}} reached this stage, but {{increasingly}} Labour MPs are discussing Britain’s future outside of the European Union. Richard Johnson writes that at the centre of <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>are</b> two issues: Britain’s trading relationship with the European Union and immigration...|$|R
50|$|The third <b>debate</b> has <b>been</b> notable, as {{it brought}} about {{a change in the}} <b>debate</b> process. <b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> a monumental step for television. For the first time ever, split screen {{technology}} was used to bring two people from opposite sides of the country together so they were able to converse in real time. Nixon was in Los Angeles while Kennedy was in New York. The men appear {{to be in the same}} room, thanks to identical sets. Both candidates had monitors in their respective studios containing the feed from the opposite studio so they could respond to questions. Bill Shadel moderated the debate from a third television studio in Chicago. The main topic of <b>this</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> whether military force should be used to prevent Quemoy and Matsu, two island archipelagos off the Chinese coast, from falling under Communist control.|$|R
5000|$|... 200 {{members of}} the general public were allowed to {{participate}} in this event to raise questions. <b>This</b> <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> divided into 3 sessions: social livelihood, politics and economics as themes for each session. During the debate, the two candidates respectively answered 9 questions from the audience and 6 from the media.|$|R
