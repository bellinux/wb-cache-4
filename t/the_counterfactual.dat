25|$|The task of distributing {{a secret}} key could be {{achieved}} even when the particle (on which the secret information, e.g. polarization, has been encoded) does not traverse through the quantum channel using a protocol developed by Tae-Gon Noh. Here Alice generates a photon which randomly takes either path (a) or path (b). Path (a) stays inside Alice's secure device and path (b) goes to Bob. By rejecting the photons that Bob receives and only accepting the ones he doesn't receive, Bob & Alice can set up a secure channel, i.e. Eve's attempts to read <b>the</b> <b>counterfactual</b> photons would still be detected. This protocol uses the quantum phenomenon whereby {{the possibility that a}} photon can be sent has an effect even when it isn't sent. So-called interaction-free measurement also uses this quantum effect, as for example in the bomb testing problem, whereby you can determine which bombs are not duds without setting them off, except in a counterfactual sense.|$|E
25|$|Finally, upon {{termination}} of the algorithm, the result needs to be read off. In {{the case of a}} classical computer, we sample from the probability distribution on the three-bit register to obtain one definite three-bit string, say 000. Quantum mechanically, one measures the three-qubit state, which is equivalent to collapsing the quantum state down to a classical distribution (with the coefficients in the classical state being the squared magnitudes of the coefficients for the quantum state, as described above), followed by sampling from that distribution. This destroys the original quantum state. Many algorithms will only give the correct answer with a certain probability. However, by repeatedly initializing, running and measuring the quantum computer's results, the probability of getting the correct answer can be increased. In contrast, counterfactual quantum computation allows the correct answer to be inferred when the quantum computer is not actually running in a technical sense, though earlier initialization and frequent measurements are part of <b>the</b> <b>counterfactual</b> computation protocol.|$|E

40|$|Counterfactuals are a {{hot topic}} in {{economics}} today, at least among economists concerned with methodology. I shall argue that on the whole this is a mistake.

2500|$|Confounding has {{traditionally}} been defined as bias arising from the co-occurrence or mixing of effects of extraneous factors, referred to as confounders, with the main effect(s) of interest. A more recent definition of confounding invokes the notion of counterfactual effects. According to this view, when one observes an outcome of interest, say Y=1 (as opposed to Y=0), in a given population A which is entirely exposed (i.e. exposure X=1 for every unit of the population) the risk of this event will be RA1. <b>The</b> <b>counterfactual</b> or unobserved risk RA0 corresponds to the risk {{which would have been}} observed if these same individuals had been unexposed (i.e. X=0 for every unit of the population). The true effect of exposure therefore is: RA1−RA0 (if one is interested in risk differences) or RA1/RA0 (if one is interested in relative risk). Since <b>the</b> <b>counterfactual</b> risk RA0 is unobservable we approximate it using a second population B and we actually measure the following relations: RA1−RB0 or RA1/RB0. In this situation, confounding occurs when RA0≠RB0. (NB: Example assumes binary outcome and exposure variables.) ...|$|E
40|$|Using linked employer-employee data, {{this paper}} {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} collective bargaining coverage on wages over an interval of continuing decline in unionism.

2500|$|The book sparked {{controversy}} {{in the press and}} academic circles. Some historians have characterized its reception {{as an extension of the}} Historikerstreit, the German historiographical debate of the 1980s that sought to explain Nazi history. The book was a [...] "publishing phenomenon", achieving fame in both the United States and Germany despite being criticized by some historians, who called it ahistorical and, according to Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg, [...] "totally wrong about everything" [...] and [...] "worthless." [...] Due to its alleged [...] "generalizing hypothesis" [...] about Germans, it has been characterized as anti-German. The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer claims that [...] "Goldhagen stumbles badly," [...] and Does not seem to be acquainted with some basic developments in German society in the nineteenth century. Certainly, there was what he calls eliminationist antisemitism and its impact increased as the century matured...But antisemitism came in different forms, and Goldhagen puts all antisemitism in the same basket, including the liberal type that wanted to see the Jews disappear by assimilation and conversion...The vast majority of German antisemitics did not wish to abolish formal Jewish emancipation. Goldhagen makes much of the radical antisemitism of the Conservative Party in Germany; but in 1893 it obtained less than 10 percent of the votes, whereas the National Liberals, among whom there were a number of former Jews, were much more numerous. Goldhagen ignores this and makes <b>the</b> <b>counterfactual</b> statement that [...] "conservatives and völkisch nationalists in Germany...formed the vast majority of the population. By 1912, the Social Democrats, with an explicitly anti-antisemitic program, were the largest party in the German Reichstag, and the Progressives ran very strongly as well...Formally, at least, the Jews had been fully emancipated with the establishment of the German Empire, although they were kept out of certain influential occupations, enjoyed extraordinary prosperity...Germans intermarried with Jews: in the 1930s some 50,000 Jews were living in mixed German-Jewish marriages, so at least 50,000 Germans, and presumably parts of their families, had familial contact with the Jews. Goldhagen himself mentions that a large proportion of the Jewish upper classes in Germany converted to Christianity in the nineteenth century. In a society where eliminationist norms were universal and in which Jews were rejected even after they had converted, or so he argues, the rise of this extreme form of assimilation of Jews would hardly have been possible." [...] Bauer argues that [...] "Goldhagen's thesis does not work." [...] and charges [...] "...that the anti-German bias of his book, almost a racist bias (however much he may deny it) leads nowhere." [...] The American historian Fritz Stern denounced the book as unscholarly and full of racist Germanophobia. Hilberg summarised the debates, [...] "by the end of 1996, it was clear that in sharp distinction from lay readers, much of the academic world had wiped Goldhagen off the map." ...|$|E
