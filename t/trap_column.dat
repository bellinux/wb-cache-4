The system was optimised for the determination of the antidepressant trazodone in plasma. The clean-up of untreated plasma was carried out with disposable C 18 cartridges, using several washing steps. The analyte was desorbed with methanol, the extract was diluted on-line with buffer and preconcentrated on a PLRP-S <b>trapping</b> <b>column.</b> The <b>trapping</b> <b>column</b> was dried by purging with nitrogen gas. Desorption (phase switching) of the <b>trapping</b> <b>column</b> was carried out with ethyl acetate which was introduced into a retention gap using partially concurrent solvent evaporation conditions. Trazodone was determined by GC with flame ionisation detection (FID). With a 1 ml sample, this resulted in a detection limit for trazodone in plasma of 3 ng/ml. The system showed good linearity and repeatability in the range 0. 01 - 1 μg/ml, thus covering the range of pharmacokinetic/dynamic-to-therapeutic concentrations of trazodone in plasma. Preliminary results for benzodiazepines are promising. They indicate that the use of a selective detector such as the nitrogen/phosphorus detector, is to be recommended. © 1995 Friedr.

40|$|A novel recycle preparative HPLC {{system was}} {{developed}} to repeatedly enrich and purify low-abundance compounds from complex samples. The recycle separation involves injecting a large volume of the sample through a <b>trap</b> <b>column,</b> releasing the absorbed sample for preparative HPLC separation, and then capturing the target component in the same <b>trap</b> <b>column</b> for the next separation. After several cycles, the final purified target compound absorbed in the <b>trap</b> <b>column</b> is eluted with a small volume of solvent. The capture and recycle procedure was realized by adjusting {{the strength of the}} mobile phase using an auxiliary pump and switching the two valves connecting the trap and preparative columns. Compared with standard HPLC or existing recycle chromatography, this system not only reduces the solvent side-effects and sample volume overloading during injection but also avoids peak-broadening and sensitivity loss during the recycle runs. Moreover, the final purified products can be easily concentrated. With the aid of this system, a 10 % polyphenol in extracts from Saussurea involucrata cultured cells reached > 95 % purity with more than 95 % recovery after three recycle purifications, and a 1 % unstable epimer impurity in the raw material of the drug silybin reached > 95 % purity with 75 % recovery after a six-cycle separation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports the}} development of novel, fully automatable, online multidimensional liquid chromatography (MDLC) technologies and methodologies to accelerate proteomics and glycomics mapping from complex biological samples. Chapter 2 reports {{the development of}} an online two-dimensional (2 D) liquid chromatography (LC) system—with separations based on hydrophilic interactions in the first dimension and low-pH reversed-phase (RP) separation (peptide hydrophobicity) in the second—that operated with high resolution and orthogonality. This hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) –RP platform featured an RP <b>trap</b> <b>column</b> plus a mixing loop before the first dimension to facilitate direct aqueous sample loading; an additional sample loop plus a strong cation exchange (SCX) <b>trap</b> <b>column</b> was implemented to circumvent the problem of solvent incompatibility between the two columns. The performance of this system was benchmarked through analysis of the proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resulting in the identification of more than 2000 proteins with abundances spanning from 40 to 〖 10 〗^ 6 copies/cell. Chapter 3 reports a novel online three-dimensional (3 D) HILIC-SCX-RP coupled with porous graphitic carbon (PGC) LC platform derived from the HILIC-RP design, featuring additional SCX fractionations, operating through a charge-centric separation mechanism, to extend the separation efficiency and platform orthogonality; the PGC column was integrated to recapture non-retained hydrophilic analytes for concomitant analyses of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic analytes within the same sample injection event. This integrated technology exhibited superior performance for the proteomics analyses of the total lysate of primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and cynomolgus monkey brain tissue, with enhanced protein and proteome coverage. One of the most comprehensive CGNs proteome to date was characterized: in total, 2201 proteins and 16, 937 unique peptides. This 3 D HILIC-SCX-RP/PGC system allowed the first detailed and simultaneous N-glycomics and N-glycoproteomics analyses of cynomolgus monkey plasma, establishing a glycan library containing 122 proposed N-glycans with confirmed complementary sites of N-glycosylation; 38 N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) –containing N-glycans were also verified through tandem mass spectrometry for the first time. Finally, Chapter 4 describes the first online 2 D PGC-RP LC system with dual sample traps that allowed the implementation of shotgun proteomics and glycomics analyses using less-sophisticated instrumentation. The PGC-platform operated through a mixed mode of mechanisms for peptide separation, taking advantage of both planar contact area–based interactions and hydrophobicity, allowing elimination of the aforementioned RP <b>trap</b> <b>column,</b> mixing loop, and related switching valves for sample loading; thus, this system could be readily assembled on a commercially available MDLC system with minimal modifications. The dual-trap column configuration was adopted, offering desirable high-throughput with almost no idle time for sample fractionation, trapping, or desalting. This 2 D PGC-RP technology performed well, as judged by the results of proteomics and glycoproteomics analyses of cerebellar granule neurons lysates and cynomolgus monkey plasma. A comparison of the HILIC-SCX-RP and PGC-RP analyses in Chapters 2 – 4 revealed that these technologies identified primarily different peptides, consistent with their different mechanisms of separation.

By sequentially using two chemically differenttrapping columns, a polymethacrylate monolith and a packed C 18 one, peptides from complex samplescan be on-line trapped and divided into two fractions, containing respectively mainly medium-large pep-tides and smaller peptides. Then, by means of two switching valves working in parallel, the two fractionswere individually separated by reversed phase chromatography. The whole gradient consisted of twosubgradients, with the first one dedicated to the separation of smaller peptides and the second one to theseparation of larger peptides. Such configuration allowed to identify up to 1476 proteins in a standardE. coli tryptic digest, with improved performance, increased average sequence coverage and reducedsingle unique peptide identifications compared to a conventional shotgun proteomics configurationcomprising only the C 18 <b>trapping</b> <b>column</b> and the analytical colum...|$|R
25|$|Most of the Kandyan kingdom was mountainous and thickly forested, {{inhabited}} by snakes and leeches. The cold, wet climate compounded {{the difficulties of}} the terrain. Invaders were forced to march in single file along narrow paths, stretching an army over long distances. The Kandyans often used these narrow paths to set up ambuscades, <b>trapping</b> advancing <b>columns</b> by suddenly felling trees {{to the front and}} rear.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} here {{an on-line}} {{combination of a}} surface acoustic wave (SAW) biosensor with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (SAW-ESI-MS) that enables the direct detection, identification, and quantification of affinity-bound ligands from a protein–ligand complex on a biosensor chip. A <b>trapping</b> <b>column</b> was used between the SAW-biosensor and the electrospray mass spectrometer equipped with a micro-guard column, which provides simultaneous sample concentration and desalting for the mass spectrometric analysis of the dissociated ligand. First applications of the on-line SAW-ESI-MS combination include (1), differentiation of β-amyloid (Aβ) epitope peptides bound to anti-Aβ antibodies; (2), the identification of immobilized Substance P peptide–calmodulin complex; (3), identification and quantification of the interaction of 3 -nitrotyrosine-modified peptides with nitrotyrosine-specific antibodies; and (4), identification of immobilized anti-α-synuclein–human α-synuclein complex. Quantitative determinations of protein–ligand complexes by SAW yielded dissociation constants (KD) from micro-to low nanomolar sample concentrations. The on-line bioaffinity-ESI-MS combination presented here is expected to enable broad bioanalytical application to the simultaneous, label-free determination and quantification of biopolymer-ligand interactions, as diverse as antigen-antibody and lectin-carbohydrate complexes...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{high performance}} liquid chromatographic separation platform based on strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography and reversed phase (RP) chromatography was developed. Peptides were first {{separated by a}} SCX column under stepwise gradient of 0, 20, 200, 300, 500, 1000 and 2000 mmol/L NH 4 AC buffer. After each fraction was collected and desalted by a RP <b>trap</b> <b>column,</b> further separation was implemented on a RPLC column under linear gradient elution. All the components were identified by mass spectrometry after 2 D separation. The platform {{was applied to the}} analysis of proteins in stomach cancer tissue. The number of identified proteins were 537 and 506 for healthy and tumor tissue respectively. According to the physical characters of proteins identified, the distributions of these identified proteins were obtained and the difference between healthy and tumor tissue was found. The retrieval results were compared to screen out diagnostic proteins related to pathological changes of tumor tissues...|$|E
40|$|Reliable, {{sensitive}} and automatable analytical methodology {{is of great}} value in e. g. cancer diagnostics. In this context, an on-line system for enzymatic cleavage of proteins, subsequent peptide separation by liquid chromatography (LC) with mass spectrometric detection has been developed using “sub-chip” columns (10 – 20 µm inner diameter, ID). The system could detect attomole amounts of isolated cancer biomarker progastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP), in a more automatable fashion compared to previous methods. The workflow combines protein digestion using an 20 µm ID immobilized trypsin reactor with a polymeric layer of 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate-vinyl azlactone (HEMA-VDM), desalting on a polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) monolithic <b>trap</b> <b>column,</b> and subsequent separation of resulting peptides on a 10 µm ID (PS-DVB) porous layer open tubular (PLOT) column. The high resolution of the PLOT columns was maintained in the on-line system, resulting in narrow chromatographic peaks of 3 – 5 seconds. The trypsin reactors provided repeatable performance and were compatible with long-term storage...|$|E
30|$|After protein digestion, the peptide {{sample was}} desalted using a Strata X column (Phenomenex), vacuum-dried and then {{resuspended}} in 200  μL buffer A (2 % ACN, 0.1 % FA). After centrifugation at 20, 000 g for 10  min, the supernatant was recovered {{to obtain a}} peptide solution with a final concentration of approximately 0.5  μg/μL. 10  μL supernatant was loaded on a LC- 20 AD nano HPLC (Shimadzu, Japan) by the autosampler onto a 2  cm C 18 <b>trap</b> <b>column.</b> Then, the peptides were eluted onto a 10  cm analytical C 18 column (inner diameter 75  μm) packed in-house. The sample was loaded at 15  μL/min for 4  min, then the 91  min gradient was run at 400  nL/min starting from 2 to 35 % buffer B (98 % ACN, 0.1 % FA), followed by 5  min linear gradient to 80 %, and maintenance at 80 % B for 8  min, and finally return to 2 % in 2  min.|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} of equilibrium (ab) sorption {{has been proven}} to be a powerful method for preconcentration of gaseous samples for high-speed narrow-bore capillary gas chromatography (GC) in general and field-portable GC instruments, often referred as micro GCs, in particular. Using a simple experimental set-up equipped with the open-tubular enrichment column it is possible to produce a homogeneously enriched sample plug, allowing reproducible injections of an enriched sample into the micro GC. Using a non-polar <b>trapping</b> <b>column</b> enrichment factors found for n-alkanes in the range of C 7 to C 10 ranged from 15 to 150 and agree well with calculated values. Using a highly retentive Thermocap column, the enrichment factor observed for heptane was above 500. As the use of this new preconcentration method requires only minimum modification of the micro GC, the chromatographic performance of the instrument was not compromised by direct coupling to the preconcentration device. Examples of on-line enrichment with portable micro GC analysis of VOCs from air are shown. These examples clearly demonstrate the potentials of the new method in field analysis...|$|R
