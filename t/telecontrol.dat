40|$|OBOTIC {{manipulator}} {{systems have}} been introduced in various surgical fields 4, 10 not only to enhance the surgeon’s dexterity in less invasive surgical procedures, but also to increase the safety and accuracy of surgery. Using mechanical devices {{that can only be}} furnished by robotic systems, these systems also make possible tasks that previously were impossible. 6, 10 An additional benefit {{lies in the fact that}} the robotic system can be <b>telecontrolled.</b> 18 The amount of surgical education and skill development provided to clinicians may soon become limited due to lowered surgical case volumes, especially in the face of the development of nonsurgical methods, the increasing numbers of neurosurgeons, and increasing social demands for highquality care. In the future, difficult tasks that cannot be managed without surgery will be treated by less experienced surgeons.

40|$|The {{proposed}} project {{shows the}} results obtained in the implementation and testing in lacustrine and marine environment of an innovative laterals hydro floating tilting systems control for USV or remote/autonomous surface nautical vehicles. This vehicle {{is based on a}} pending patent belonging to Palermo University (Patent Pending RM 2012 A 000209 and RM 2012 A 000209). The system allows, during operation as a vehicle USV, set changes sailing trim and make turns with very narrow angle with little shunting movements. In fact the main benefits obtained were able to change or adjust the navigation structure by changing the tilt of one or two hydro floating during navigation without intervening directly on the flaps of the vehicle. Another benefit obtained by reversing the position of the two hydro floating {{is to be able to}} make the tight turn in very little room to maneuver and with little propulsion. The system allows, during operation as a vehicle USV, set changes sailing trim and make turns with very narrow angle with little shunting movements. The tilting system control allows a benefit of fuel or energy for electric vehicles and on the reduced space for maneuvering. The experimental tests were carried out on an <b>telecontrolled</b> electric power vehicle coupled with a jet propulsion, (USV) where the sensor telemetry on-line has allowed us to verify the effectiveness of the complete system, just during the performance of trim and maneuver of the vehicle. Then, the proposed system can be used for applications in all the fields of the nautical vehicle.

40|$|Object Robotic surgery can {{be applied}} as a novel technology. Our {{master-slave}} microscopic-micromanipulator system (NeuRobot), which has a rigid endoscope and three robot-arms, has been developed to perform neurosurgical procedures, and employed successfully in some clinical cases. Although the master and slave parts of NeuRobot are directly connected by wire, {{it is possible to}} separate each part and to apply it to telesurgery with some modifications. To evaluate feasibility of NeuRobot in telesurgery, some basic experiments were performed. Methods The quality of telemedicine network system between Shinshu University and one of the affiliated hospitals, which was completely separated from other public network systems, was investigated. The communication delay was calculated from the transmitting and the receiving records in the computers set in each hospital. The relationship between the change in communication delay from the master part to the slave part of NeuRobot (0, 100, 300, 500 and 700 ms) respectively and feasibility of NeuRobot was investigated. The task performance time in each time changing group was compared. Feasibility of NeuRobot in telesurgical usage was evaluated. The master part and the slave part of NeuRobot placed in each hospital were connected through private network system. Interhospitally connected NeuRobot was compared with directly connected one in terms of task performance time. Results Less than 1 ms was required for corresponding the data in a steady transmitting state. Within 2 seconds after connection, relative time delay (maximum 40 ms) and packet loss were sometimes observed. The mean task performance time was significantly longer in over 500 ms delayed group compared with directly connected NeuRobot. There {{was no significant difference in}} the task performance time between directly connected NeuRobot and interhospitally connected NeuRobot. Conclusion Our results proved that telesurgical usage of NeuRobot was feasible. Telesurgical usage of <b>telecontrolled</b> manipulator system is recommended for application in a private network system in order to reduce technical and ethical problems.

5000|$|In year 1974, packet {{switching}} was a technology known only in research circles. The concept started by year 1968 associated to the USA's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) research project ARPAnet. The idea of applying the {{packet switching}} concept to electric utilities control communication networks {{first appeared in}} 1974 when the Swedish Power Utility Vattenfall started to create its TIDAS packet switching network [...] and {{it was followed by}} the Spanish electric utility ENHER, which was targeting to <b>telecontrol</b> and automate its high voltage power network. With that goal ENHER created a specific team of people for developing both the packet switching network and the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system also named <b>telecontrol</b> system. In year 1978 the first four TRAME routers were already available [...] and in year 1980 eight of them were already deployed and operating. [...] The printed circuit boards (PCBs) controlling the communication lines were connected to a shared memory PCB allowing them to exchange data and messages. The project was developed together with its main initial application, the <b>Telecontrol</b> or SCADA system SICL (Sistema Integral de Control Local) [...] with which initially they shared a very similar hardware. By year 1980 the maximum link capacity was 9.600 bit/s which in 1980 was the maximum possible on a voice channel of 4 kHz width. These channels were the basic unit of the then analog communication systems in use. By that time power utilities used either telephone calls or low speed (below 1200bit/s) dedicated links for <b>telecontrol,</b> typically shared among ten high voltage electrical substations.|$|E

50|$|The {{control signal}} is not {{transmitted}} by wire from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig to the transmitting {{radio station in}} Mainflingen but is generated at the place of emission using a control unit developed by the PTB. This control unit, which is housed in an air conditioned room of the transmitting station, is shielded against high-frequency interferences and controlled from Braunschweig. For reasons of operational reliability, the control signal is generated by three independent control channels all equipped with their own caesium atomic clock. In addition a rubidium atomic clock is available on site. To avoid incorrect emissions the output of these three channels are compared in two electronic switch circuits on site. Output for transmission is only generated when {{at least two of}} the three channels are in agreement. Via the public telephone network operational data of the control unit can be called up with the aid of a <b>telecontrol</b> system. Furthermore, the carrier phase time and the states of the second markers are compared in Braunschweig with the setpoints specified by the PTB's atomic master clocks.
