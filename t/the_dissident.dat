500|$|An {{example of}} the low {{threshold}} {{is a point of}} Donetsk psychiatrist Valentine Pekhterev, who argues that psychiatrists speak of the necessity of adapting oneself to society, estimate the level of man's social functioning, his ability to adequately test the reality and so forth. In Pekhterev's words, these speeches hit point-blank on <b>the</b> <b>dissidents</b> and revolutionaries, because all of them are poorly functioning in society, are hardly adapting to it either initially or after increasing requirements. They turn their inability to adapt themselves to society into the view that the company breaks step and only they know how to help the company restructure itself. <b>The</b> <b>dissidents</b> regard <b>the</b> cases of personal maladjustment as a proof of public ill-being. The more such cases, the easier it is to present their personal ill-being [...] as public one. They bite the society's hand that feed them only because they are not given a right place in society. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>dissidents,</b> <b>the</b> psychiatrists destroy the hardly formed defense attitude in <b>the</b> <b>dissidents</b> by regarding [...] "public well-being" [...] as personal one. The psychiatrists extract teeth from <b>the</b> <b>dissidents,</b> stating that they should not bite the feeding hand of society only because the tiny group of <b>the</b> <b>dissidents</b> feel bad being at their place. The psychiatrists claim the need to treat not society but <b>the</b> <b>dissidents</b> and seek to improve society by preserving and improving the mental health of its members. After reading the book Institute of Fools by Viktor Nekipelov, Pekhterev concluded that allegations against the psychiatrists sounded from the lips of a negligible but vociferous part of inmates who when surfeiting themselves with cakes pretended to be sufferers.|$|R

40|$|In 1968, a {{group of}} Soviet dissidents began to print their own newspaper, the Chronicle of Current Events, {{and to work with}} western reporters to spread their message about the {{illegality}} of the ruling regime. By using their own media forms, <b>the</b> <b>dissidents</b> were able to break the government's monopoly on information. More importantly, they used the media technologies to advocate for their two key, interconnected goals of glasnost, or openness, and the rule of law. <b>The</b> <b>dissidents</b> made two main arguments. First, that glasnost was integral to creating an equitable and fair justice system. Second, that speaking truth was legal and not something the government could prosecute. Glasnost served as both a rallying cry and as a weapon. <b>The</b> <b>dissidents</b> called for openness, but also used their media outlets to expose events the government wished to keep quiet. In choosing the two mantras of legality and glasnost, <b>the</b> <b>dissidents</b> consciously put themselves in the shadow of previous groups of Russian reformers who had the same demands. They placed themselves in a historical debate. <b>The</b> <b>dissidents</b> also sought to differentiate their version of glasnost, complete openness, from various government leaders' definitions of the term. This thesis seeks to explore <b>the</b> way <b>dissident</b> media outlets forced the dual goals of glasnost and respect for the rule of law. It will examine the causes and forms of dissident media, and their relationship to the idea of legality. It will also look at the dissidents' calls for glasnost in a historic context, seeking to understand how <b>the</b> <b>dissidents</b> interpreted <b>the</b> term differently than previous generations...|$|R

5|$|Although it was {{the largest}} of the African {{nationalist}} parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues. It was increasingly polarised between moderate évolués and the more radical mass membership. A radical faction headed by Iléo and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. <b>The</b> <b>dissident</b> faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the majority group became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L).

50|$|In 1952 the Iraqi Communist Party {{had adopted}} a new party {{programme}}, {{which was more}} radical in its call for action than the programme in use during Fahd's leadership. The new party programme called for nationalization of oil industry, eradication of British interests {{and the formation of}} a unified popular front under communist leadership. The core of the Rayat ash-Shaghilah consisted of al-Haidari, Aziz Muhammad, Abd us-Salam al-Nasiri and Zaki Khairi, who had criticized the positions of the new party programme whilst in prison and had subsequently been expelled from the party by the party leader Basim. Several other Communist Party members, who were seen as supportive of <b>the</b> <b>dissidents,</b> were also expelled. Amongst them was Abd ur-Razzak as-Safi. In February 1953 the Communist Party main organ, al-Qaidah, denounced <b>the</b> <b>dissidents</b> as 'opportunists and subversives'. Moreover, al-Qaidah made the names of <b>the</b> <b>dissidents</b> public, thus revealing their identities to the police. In response, <b>the</b> <b>dissidents</b> launched <b>the</b> eponymous publication.

5|$|Political {{plans were}} thrown into disarray by Palmerston's death on 18 October 1865. Russell became Prime Minister again, with Gladstone clearly the Liberal Party's leader-in-waiting, and as Leader of the House Disraeli's direct opponent. One of Russell's early {{priorities}} was a Reform Bill, but the proposed legislation that Gladstone announced on 12 March 1866 divided his party. The Conservatives and <b>the</b> <b>dissident</b> Liberals repeatedly attacked Gladstone's bill, and in June finally defeated the government; Russell resigned on 26 June. The dissidents {{were unwilling to}} serve under Disraeli in the House of Commons, and Derby formed a third Conservative minority government, with Disraeli again as Chancellor. In 1867, the Conservatives introduced a Reform Bill. Without {{a majority in the}} Commons, the Conservatives {{had little choice but to}} accept amendments that considerably liberalised the legislation, though Disraeli refused to accept any from Gladstone.|$|E
5|$|Abu Nuwar's enmity with Glubb Pasha, the Arab Legion's {{powerful}} British {{chief of}} staff, his insistence on establishing Arab command over {{the army and}} his influence with Hussein led the latter to dismiss Glubb Pasha and appoint Abu Nuwar in his place. However, Abu Nuwar's ardent support for the pan-Arabist policies of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser contributed to Jordan's increasing isolation from the UK and the US, which were major sources of foreign aid to Jordan. At the same time, existing dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar's leadership by palace officials and veteran Bedouin army units culminated into violent confrontations at the large army barracks in Zarqa between royalist and Arab nationalist units. Two principal accounts emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by Abu Nuwar against Hussein, and <b>the</b> <b>dissident</b> version asserting {{that it was a}} staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan. In any case, Abu Nuwar resigned and was allowed to leave Jordan for Syria. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 years in absentia.|$|E

He assisted in organising and subsequently took part in the Léopoldville Conference in January 1961 to discuss political compromise and reform. He also participated in the Tananarive Conference in March and the following Coquilhatville Conference in April on behalf of Iléo to try and bring about a reconciliation among <b>the</b> <b>dissident</b> factions in the Congo. As result of the latter conference, Iléo created a commission to prepare a new constitution for the Congo and appointed Lihau to chair it.

In June he joined Cyrille Adoula and Jean Bolikango in negotiating with the representatives of the Stanleyville government. Their meetings continued into July and resulted in the reconvening of Parliament and the Stanleyville government agreeing to disband. In January 1963 Lihau was hired to be professor and dean of the faculty of law at the University of Lovanium (later the National University of Zaire). He encouraged his students to adopt a constitutionalist approach to law.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} Bukovsky {{had gathered}} {{and sent to}} the West galvanized human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also struck a chord among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses were carefully documented by <b>the</b> <b>dissident</b> human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation, without access to a lawyer, to be tried {{and sent to the}} camps or a special psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|The non-aligned Indonesian {{government}} of Sukarno {{was faced with}} a major threat to its legitimacy beginning in 1956, when several regional commanders began to demand autonomy from Jakarta. After mediation failed, Sukarno took action to remove <b>the</b> <b>dissident</b> commanders. In February 1958, dissident military commanders in Central Sumatera (Colonel Ahmad Hussein) and North Sulawesi (Colonel Ventje Sumual) declared the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia-Permesta Movement aimed at overthrowing the Sukarno regime. They were joined by many civilian politicians from the Masyumi Party, such as Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, who were opposed to the growing influence of the communist Partai Komunis Indonesia party. Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received arms, funding, and other covert aid from the CIA until Allen Lawrence Pope, an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held Ambon in April 1958. The central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions of rebel strongholds Padang and Manado. By the end of 1958, the rebels were militarily defeated, and the last remaining rebel guerilla bands surrendered by August 1961.|$|E

50|$|Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>dissidents</b> of Sumatra were {{anticipated}} {{to issue}} a demand {{for the establishment of}} an anti-communist government on February 7, 1958, threatening that any denial of this demand would lead to a rival regime. Noting <b>the</b> <b>dissidents</b> deep distrust of Sukarno, prior proposals for compromise from the Djuanda Cabinet were rejected outright. Given their resistance to prior proposals, an intelligence memo indicated that the rival regime was poised to proceed regardless of Sukarno’s response.

5|$|The {{persecution}} in Africa {{also encouraged}} {{the development of}} Donatism, a schismatic movement that forbade any compromise with Roman government or traditor bishops (those who had handed scriptures over to secular authorities). One of the key moments in the break with the mainline Church occurred in Carthage in 304. The Christians from Abitinae {{had been brought to}} the city and imprisoned. Friends and relatives of the prisoners came to visit, but encountered resistance from a local mob. The group was harassed, beaten, and whipped; the food they had brought for their imprisoned friends was scattered on the ground. The mob had been sent by Mensurius, the bishop of the city, and Caecilian, his deacon, for reasons that remain obscure. In 311, Caecilian was elected bishop of Carthage. His opponents charged that his traditio made him unworthy of the office, and declared itself for another candidate, Majorinus. Many others in Africa, including the Abitinians, also supported Majorinus against Caecilian. Majorinus's successor Donatus would give <b>the</b> <b>dissident</b> movement its name. By the time Constantine took over the province, the African church was deeply divided. The Donatists would not be reconciled to the Catholic Church until after 411.|$|E
5|$|The Second Symphony, and Livre pour orchestre and the Cello Concerto which followed, were {{composed}} during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski's life. His {{mother died in}} 1967, and in 1967–70 {{there was a great}} deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production Dziady, which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring, and the Gdańsk Shipyards strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the Cello Concerto of 1968–70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society. Indeed, Rostropovich's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for <b>the</b> <b>dissident</b> Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a direct effect on his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree. In any case, the Cello Concerto was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades. At the work's première with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Bliss presented Rostropovich with the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal.|$|E
