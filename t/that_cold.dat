5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the cathedral}} was overrun by Parliamentarian troops. Along with other destruction, the troops seized {{the books of}} the cathedral library, taking them to Cardiff Castle, where they were burned along with many copies of the Book of Common Prayer. Among those invited to the castle to warm {{themselves}} by the fire on <b>that</b> <b>cold</b> winter day, were the wives of some sequestered clergymen. Also during this time of unrest, a man named Milles, {{who claimed to be}} a practising Puritan, appropriated portions of the cathedral for his own gain. Milles set up a tavern in the cathedral, used part of it as a stable, turned the choir area into a pen for his calves and used the font as a trough for his pigs.|$|E
5|$|The {{crown of}} the South Tower {{contains}} {{a band of}} 25 LED floodlights that remain lit all night. Each LED light consumes little energy and has a lifetime of 40,000 hours. These lights are used to signal the weather, just like {{the lights on the}} John Hancock Tower in Boston. The crown glows red if warmer weather is in the forecast. A blue crown signifies <b>that</b> <b>cold</b> weather is expected soon. Green means that there is at least a 50 percent chance of rain. Amber indicates that the weather will remain unchanged. This is the San Francisco Bay Area's first weather beacon. The crown began lighting up on December 8, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Just after 9:00 PM CST (0300 UTC), a {{supercell}} {{that had}} spawned tornadoes over northern Mississippi {{as well as}} a deadly EF4 in Hardin County, Tennessee, moved to the northeast over Nashville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported there and no significant damage was reported in Nashville or Davidson County, though funnel clouds were sighted during the storm's passage. At the time the supercell moved over Nashville, a National Hockey League game between the Nashville Predators and the Carolina Hurricanes, which was nationally televised on Versus, was being played at the Sommet Center. With just over nine minutes left in the third period, Predators head coach Barry Trotz was told that the game may have to be stopped. Although the game continued to completion, at the game's end fans were not allowed to leave the arena until the storm had passed. National Weather Service Meteorologist Bobby Boyd theorized <b>that</b> <b>cold</b> air downbursts impinged on the development of a strong, low-level circulation as the storm moved through the Nashville area, forcing the area of rotation to remain aloft as it crossed over Davidson County and downtown Nashville.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} study that quantifies the effect of cold {{temperature}} on smartphone input perform- ance, particularly on tapping tasks. Our results show that smartphone input performance decreases when completing tapping tasks in cold temperatures. We show <b>that</b> <b>colder</b> temperature is associated with lower throughput and less accurate performance when using the phone in both one-handed and two-handed operations. We also demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>colder</b> temperature is related to higher error rate when using the phone in one-handed operation only, but not two-handed. Finally, we identify a number of design recommendations from the literature that can be consid- ered as a countermeasure to poorer smartphone input performance in completing tapping tasks in cold temperature...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} {{on the evolution}} of metabolism {{has been the subject of}} debate for a century; however, no consistent patterns have emerged from comparisons of metabolic rate within and among species living at different temperatures. We used experimental evolution to determine how metabolism evolves in populations of Drosophila melanogaster exposed to one of three selective treatments: a constant 16 °C, a constant 25 °C, or temporal fluctuations between 16 and 25 °C. We tested August Krogh 2 ̆ 7 s controversial hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>colder</b> environments select for a faster metabolism. Given <b>that</b> <b>colder</b> environments also experience greater seasonality, we also tested the hypothesis that temporal variation in temperature may be the factor that selects for a faster metabolism. We measured the metabolic rate of flies from each selective treatment at 16, 20. 5, and 25 °C. Although metabolism was faster at higher temperatures, flies from the selective treatments had similar metabolic rates at each measurement temperature. Based on variation among genotypes within populations, heritable variation in metabolism was likely sufficient for adaptation to occur. We conclude <b>that</b> <b>colder</b> or seasonal environments do not necessarily select for a faster metabolism. Rather, other factors besides temperature likely contribute to patterns of metabolic rate over thermal clines in nature...|$|R

25|$|According to ghost hunters, a {{cold spot}} {{is an area}} of {{localized}} coldness or a sudden decrease in ambient temperature. Many ghost hunters use digital thermometers or heat sensing devices to measure such temperature changes. Believers claim <b>that</b> <b>cold</b> spots are an indicator of paranormal or spirit activity in the area; however there are many natural explanations for rapid temperature variations within structures, and there is no scientifically confirmed evidence that spirit entities exist or can affect air temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Climatic modeling, {{tree ring}} data, and {{historical}} climate data show <b>that</b> <b>cold</b> {{weather in the}} Northern Hemisphere is associated with drought in Mesoamerica. Northern Europe suffered extremely low temperatures {{around the same time}} as the Maya droughts. The same connection between drought in the Maya areas and extreme cold in northern Europe was found again at the beginning of the 20thcentury. Volcanic activity, within and outside Mesoamerica, is also correlated with colder weather and resulting drought, as the effects of the Tambora volcano eruption in 1815 indicate.|$|E

25|$|Major threats <b>that</b> <b>cold</b> seep {{ecosystems}} {{and their communities}} face today are seafloor litter, chemical contaminants and climate change. Seafloor litter alters the habitat, by providing hard substrate where none was available before or by overlying the sediment, inhibiting gas exchange, and interfering with organisms {{on the bottom of}} the sea. Studies of marine litter in the Mediterranean include surveys of seabed debris on the continental shelf, slope, and bathyal plain. In most studies, plastic items accounted for much of the debris, sometimes as much as 90% or more of the total, owing to their ubiquitous use and poor degradability.|$|E

Experts claim <b>that</b> <b>cold</b> storage infrastructure will become economically viable only when there is strong and contractually binding demand from organised retail. The risk of cold storing perishable food, without an assured way to move and sell it, puts the economic viability of expensive cold storage in doubt. In the absence of organised retail competition and with a ban on foreign direct investment in multi-brand retailers, foreign direct investments are unlikely to begin in cold storage and farm logistics infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|Cold fusion setups utilize {{an input}} power source (to ostensibly provide {{activation}} energy), a platinum group electrode, a deuterium or hydrogen source, a calorimeter, and, at times, detectors {{to look for}} byproducts such as helium or neutrons. Critics have variously taken issue with each of these aspects and have asserted that there {{has not yet been}} a consistent reproduction of claimed cold fusion results in either energy output or byproducts. Some cold fusion researchers who claim that they can consistently measure an excess heat effect have argued that the apparent lack of reproducibility might be attributable to a lack of quality control in the electrode metal or the amount of hydrogen or deuterium loaded in the system. Critics have further taken issue with what they describe as mistakes or errors of interpretation <b>that</b> <b>cold</b> fusion researchers have made in calorimetry analyses and energy budgets.|$|E
500|$|Without an {{electric}} charge, neutron beams cannot {{be controlled by}} the conventional electromagnetic methods employed for particle accelerators. The magnetic moment of the neutron allows some control of neutrons using magnetic fields, however, including the formation of polarized neutron beams. [...] One technique employs the fact <b>that</b> <b>cold</b> neutrons will reflect from some magnetic materials at great efficiency when scattered at small grazing angles. [...] The reflection preferentially selects particular spin states, thus polarizing the neutrons. [...] Neutron magnetic mirrors and guides use this total internal reflection phenomena to control beams of slow neutrons.|$|E
