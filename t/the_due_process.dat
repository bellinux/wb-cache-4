5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} textually identical to <b>the</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process. Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. <b>The</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>due</b> <b>process</b> clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply {{generally}} to {{all stages of}} criminal proceedings. <b>The</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was the vehicle for the incorporation {{of all of the}} foregoing rights (with the exception of the Grand Jury Clause, the Vicinage Clause, and maybe the Excessive Bail Clause) to apply in state criminal proceedings. Due process is also the catchall vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness, even if the infirmities of a given prosecution do not neatly sound in another enumerated provision.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{substantive}} <b>due</b> <b>process</b> {{argument is}} sometimes used in medical marijuana cases. NORML once {{wrote in an}} amicus brief on United States v.

Some apparently believe that this invalidates <b>the</b> substantive <b>due</b> <b>process</b> argument against <b>the</b> Controlled Substances Act.|$|R

5|$|Black's most {{prominent}} ideological opponent on the Warren Court was John Marshall Harlan II, who replaced Justice Jackson in 1955.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause prohibits {{state and}} local {{government}} officials from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without legislative authorization. This clause has also been used by the federal judiciary to make most of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, as well as to recognize substantive and procedural requirements that state laws must satisfy.|$|E

50|$|The Supreme Court {{declined}} to consider <b>the</b> plaintiffs' substantive <b>due</b> <b>process</b> claims in Ingraham v. Wright. Lower courts {{have adopted a}} variety of approaches to <b>the</b> substantive <b>due</b> <b>process</b> issue, none of which offer much protection {{for students who are}} subjected to corporal punishment at school. The Supreme Court has repeatedly denied certiorari (judicial review) on the issue of whether school corporal punishment constitutes a substantive <b>due</b> <b>process</b> constitutional violation.|$|R
5000|$|The AAA {{requires}} {{businesses with}} consumer arbitration clauses inconsistent with <b>the</b> Consumer <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Protocol to waive the offending provisions for all disputes or remove the AAA from their clause. [...] Christopher R. Drahozal and Samantha Zyontz wrote that, {{in a sample}} of 299 cases before the AAA in which an award was issued between April and December 2007, 76.6% of the cases had arbitration agreements that fully complied with <b>the</b> Consumer <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Protocol, and only five cases were conducted despite [...] "unwaived protocol violations." [...] In addition, over 150 businesses modified their arbitration clauses in response to a request by the AAA to conform to <b>the</b> Consumer <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Protocol. [...] Michael L. Rustad, Richard Buckingham, Diane D'Angelo, and Katherine Durlacher stated that numerous social networking websites had arbitration agreements that violated <b>the</b> AAA Consumer <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Protocol. <b>The</b> authors determined that many of the clauses did not adequately inform users about the existence of an arbitration agreement or the consequences of agreeing to arbitration. The standards of <b>the</b> Consumer <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Protocol have been cited by courts resolving disputes over the enforceability of arbitration agreements. In 2003, Reginald Alleyne wrote that courts tended to enforce arbitration agreements if they complied with [...] "minimum 'due process' standards". Jean Sternlight, though, wrote that courts have rarely referenced consumer arbitration standards, and when they do, it is to defeat a challenge that an arbitration clause is unfair.|$|R
5|$|Brady v. Maryland (1963) {{is another}} significant, {{specific}} criminal procedural right guaranteed by <b>the</b> <b>due</b> <b>process</b> clauses. Brady requires a criminal conviction to be reversed {{if the government}} withholds exculpatory (or impeachment) material, within the government's possession, from the defendant, {{and there is a}} reasonable probability that, if such material had been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different ("materiality"). Brady is a holistic, rather than piece-by-piece, inquiry.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Rights was {{originally}} proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment {{applied only to}} laws enacted by the Congress, {{and many of its}} provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as incorporation—through <b>the</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The case {{became known}} as Pierce v. Society of Sisters, a seminal United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that significantly expanded coverage of <b>the</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents, not the state, {{had the authority to}} educate children as they thought best. It upheld the religious freedom of parents to educate their children in religious schools.|$|E

5|$|Two major {{victories}} in the 1930s cemented the ACLUs campaign to promote free speech. In Stromberg v. California, decided in 1931, the Supreme Court sided with the ACLU and affirmed {{the right of a}} communist party member to salute a communist flag. The result {{was the first time the}} Supreme Court used <b>the</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause of the 14th amendment to subject states to the requirements of the First Amendment. In Near v. Minnesota, also decided in 1931, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise prior restraint and prevent a newspaper from publishing, simply because the newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous.|$|E
5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Harry Blackmun held that natural parents have a right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the burden of proof used by New York State is not stringent enough to satisfy the constitutional requirements of <b>the</b> <b>due</b> <b>process</b> clause. In striking down New York's burden, the Court utilized the Mathews test to determine what burden of proof was due.|$|E
5|$|On , 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled in}} the {{landmark}} case of Obergefell v. Hodges, , holding {{that the fundamental}} right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both <b>the</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Fourteen counties in three Southern states continued to deny marriage licenses for same-sex marriage. The Alabama Supreme Court allowed the probate judges of ten counties in Alabama to deny such marriage licenses, the clerk of one Texas county chose to resign rather than issue such licenses, and the clerks of two counties in Kentucky were not issuing licenses due to paperwork delays. Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear ordered all Kentucky county clerks to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses immediately.|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} opinion based this on {{an analysis of}} <b>the</b> 14th Amendment <b>due</b> <b>process</b> concept and an application of the [...] "shocks the conscience" [...] test.

5|$|When the {{government}} seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, {{the government}} provide the person notice, {{an opportunity to}} be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits. The Court has also ruled that <b>the</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest. For example, in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009), the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.|$|E
25|$|A similar legal {{doctrine}} to incorporation is that {{of reverse}} incorporation. Whereas incorporation applies the Bill of Rights to the states through <b>the</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in reverse incorporation, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has been held {{to apply to the}} federal government through <b>the</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Process</b> Clause located in the Fifth Amendment.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} impact of country {{characteristics}} on constituents’ formal participation in <b>the</b> IASB’s <b>due</b> <b>process.</b> We hypothesize {{that there is an}} association between the level of constituents’ partic- ipation and (1) the level of economic development, and (2) the cultural characteristics of the country of origin.

In con- trast, the cultural characteristics measured by Hofstede’s cultural framework can only partially explain that differences.
