40|$|Purpose This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> for the performance analysis of commercial vapor compression refrigerators. The <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> and the refrigerators are equipped {{with a range of}} sensors to monitor respectively the temperature and humidity inside and outside the chamber and the thermodynamic conditions of the working fluid, i. e. temperature, pressure and mass flow rate, in the circuit critical points. The acquisition of sensor data and the refrigerator performance evaluation are provided thanks to a real-time and automatic interface developed adopting LabView© integrated development environment (IDE). The <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> is adopted to compare the performance of refrigerants R 407 f and R 410 a as environmentally-friendly alternatives to the R 404 a, the current working fluid in the considered commercial refrigerator. Indeed, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of R 404 a is approximately twice the value of refrigerants R 407 f and R 410 a. The purpose of the experimental campaign is verify whether the R 407 f and R 410 a refrigerants allow comparable thermodynamic performances to R 404 a without requiring substantial component replacements.   Design/methodology/approach The paper focuses on the description of the developed <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> and the system setup for the experimental campaign of a commercial vapor compression refrigerator. The chamber is composed by a 180 x 180 x 220 cm stainless steel climatic room with an internal volume of 5. 12 m 3, properly insulated by 100 mm of expanded polyurethane. The <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> integrates the commercial vapor compression refrigerator, the refrigerant charging equipment and all the necessary sensors to monitor the environment conditions and evaluate the system performance. Originality/Value Global warming concerns have increased the efforts of the scientific community to identify alternative refrigerants in air conditioning systems with lower environmental impact and many results in the literature show their technical and economical feasibility. However, the introduction of these refrigerant alternatives in industrial products encounters some difficulties and, nowadays, several commercial refrigerators still adopt working fluids with a significant global warming potential. In this context, this paper presents the development and setup of a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> that can be adapted to real refrigerators to compare the thermodynamic performance of different refrigerants. An automatic control and data acquisition systems allow to test the <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> in several technical configurations, i. e. ambient temperature and operating temperatures etc. The experimental campaign, applied to a commercial vapor compression refrigerator, compares the performance of environmentally-friendly refrigerants alternatives, i. e. R 407 f and R 410 a, to the currently adopted working fluid, i. e. R 404 a. The results may lead the company to launch onto the market a similar commercial refrigerator adopting a working fluid with a lower environmental impact...|$|E

40|$|With {{a view to}} {{reducing}} the operating temperature of air heaters, a convector consisting of a plate heat-transfer matrix, placed {{at the bottom of}} an enclosure acting as a chimney, was designed and tested. An inexpensive polymericmaterial (polypropylene) was selected for the heat-transfer plates to achieve a lightweight low-cost unit. An appropriate computer program was used to optimize the prototype convector and to evaluate the influence of the main geometric and operational parameters: plate spacing and height; chimney height; heat carrier temperature and rate. The performance of the unit subsequently fabricated, measured in a <b>thermostatic</b> test <b>chamber,</b> was in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. As an example, an output of 1. 2 kW was obtained for a mean water temperature of 41 °C with a convector volume of 0. 22 m 3, two-thirds of which was occupied by the chimney. The convector exhibited a good thermal output even when fed at very low water rates, thus achieving a thorough cooling of the incoming water. The convector performance could be enhanced by resorting either to higher chimneys or to a mechanical draught. In the latter case, it is shown theoretically that a small fan's power consumption (say 5 W) is sufficient to at least double the natural convection output, provided the heat-transfer matrix is re-optimized. geometric and operational parameters: plate spacin...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical drug release {{modelling}} of biodegradable polymeric {{systems by}} microencapsulation technology in textiles has not progressed much yet, {{because it is}} generally too complex. The release of a therapeutic agent from a formulation applied to the skin surface and its transport to the systemic circulation has a multistep process. The transdermal drug released is a feasible administration route for powerful, low-molecular weight therapeutic agents, which has to be accurate in their control of drug distribution. Moreover, many drugs are difficult to handle because they must be delivered slowly over a prolonged period to have a beneficial effect. In the present work, several examples of practical applications of mathematical models, developed through experimental drug release data, are given. For {{those involved in the}} design and development of biodegradable drug delivery systems, it will be useful to choose the generic mathematical model for several specific drug release problems. This transport model is based on the appropriate solution to Fick's second law of diffusion and can be used to explain drug release kinetics into this complex biological membrane (skin). Microspheres containing active principles were prepared using a solvent evaporation procedure with poly(vinyl alcohol) as surfactant in the external aqueous phase. Several biodegradable microspheres of biocompatible polymers, taken as delivery systems for active agent, have been studied. Polymers were PLGA (Poly(lactide-co-glycolide)) and PCL (poly(e-caprolactone)). The active compounds chosen were cosmetics and drugs, such as gallic acid, caffeine and ibuprofen. The microspheres obtained were characterized by the measure of encapsulation efficiency. The surface morphology and chemical structure of the micro particles were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Nanosizer was used for particle size distribution. The application of the microspheres in the fabrics was carried out using Pad-Dry technique, since it is a simple and efficient technology and its working conditions are harmless to the system. The drug release system was analyzed, through samples of the treated fibre (cotton, polyamide, acrylic and polyester) in order to study the drug delivery behaviour in different media, deionized water and physiological saline (T= 37 ºC). The skin penetration profile by in vitro technique for different active principles was determined using pigskin. The release experiments are performed resorting to the Franz Diffusion cells apparatus (Lara-Spiral, Courtenon, France) consisting of two <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chambers,</b> the upper donor and the lower receptor chamber, divided by a skin biopsy. The main objective {{of this study is to}} create smart textiles which allow a controlled drug release for any active compound/substance. Such objective will allow the control of the textiles drug release in such a way that the active compound is released in the right quantity, at the right time and at the right place. The present study has shown that the main objective has been successfully achieved. According to that, microencapsulation applied on fabrics can be considered as a good controlled release system. As a result, the project reached to a general kinetic model using smart textiles as a mass transport system through the skin. Postprint (published version...|$|R

The system {{is based on}} a special <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> and on an electro-optic system equipped with a fiber-optic scanner. A thin layer of the sensing material to be calibrated can be coated onto a temperature controlled reference surface, which is housed inside the <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber.</b> It was designed {{in such a way as}} to operate under different conditions (from vacuum to atmospheric pressure) in order to evaluate the effect of the surrounding fluid on the surface temperature measurements. The reference surface can be heated both radially, by a wire wound heater, and axially, by a thermoelectric cooler. Experimental investigations were carried out in the temperature range – 50 °C to about 200 °C. The results showed a temperature stability of better than 0. 03 °C and a surface temperature uniformity to within 0. 02 °C. The system was used to characterize a sensitive phosphor. The phosphor calibration curve was thus obtained, with a single-point repeatability of better than 0. 1 °C.

Control temperatures were tested against 3 and 5 °C rises in water temperature in each season. In each temperature treatment, three P concentrations were tested: control (non-enriched, ~ 1. 5 &# 956;g. L- 1 PO 4 (3 +)) and enrichments of four (+ 6 &# 956;g. L- 1 PO 4 (3 +)) and eight (+ 12 &# 956;g. L- 1 PO 4 (3 +)) times natural concentrations; RESULTS: {{the results showed that}} P enrichments alone did not increase chlorophyll-a concentrations, but temperature increases significantly elevated phytoplankton biomass in autumn and winter microcosms. Water temperature increases were followed by significant elevations in the oxygen saturation levels in all microcosms and seasons. The combined effect of increased temperature and P enrichments resulted in the highest chlorophyll-a levels also in autumn and winter. Summer microcosms seem to have been negatively affected by the experimental conditions (too high water temperatures); CONCLUSIONS: the bioassays showed that global temperature rises can significantly elevate the phytoplankton biomass in Peri coastal lagoon, especially in colder months and if followed by increased P inputs, what can lead to major ecological consequences to the water body and to water supply issues in the region...|$|R
30|$|Oxygen {{consumption}} of isolated liver mitochondria was monitored polarographically (Estabrook 1967) with a Clark-type oxygen electrode at 25  °C, in a 1  mL water <b>thermostatic</b> incubation stirred <b>chamber</b> (CB 1 -D Hansatech), with constant stirring. The standard reaction medium consisted of 130  mM sucrose, 50  mM KCl, 5  mM MgCl 2, 5  mM KH 2 PO 4 and 5  mM HEPES at pH 7.2 {{on the basis}} of 1  mg mitochondrial protein per 1  mL buffer. After a 2  min equilibration period, mitochondria were energized with pyruvate–malate (5  mM) or succinate (5  mM) as substrates. Pyruvate–malate indirectly supplies electrons to mitochondrial complex I and succinate directly reduces complex II. Rotenone (3  µM) was used to inhibit complex I and avoid reverse flow of electrons from complex II to complex I. State 4 respiration corresponds to resting oxygen consumption after phosphorylation of a small amount of ADP. State 3 was started by adding ADP (100  nmol mg protein− 1). Uncoupled respiration was initiated by the addition of carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (1  µg mL− 1). The rate of oxygen uptake by mitochondria is expressed as nmol O 2  min− 1  mg protein− 1. Respiratory control ratio (RCR) and ADP/O ratios were calculated (Chance and Williams 1956) in mitochondria energized with pyruvate–malate and succinate.|$|R

Results of stretching process test are {{compared with those}} of tensile test. The sheet has an anisotropic character for angle to hot-extrusion direction(ϕ= 0 °, 45 °, and 90 °). Here, ϕ= 0 ° means a direction of extrusion. Tensile specimens cut down to three directions of ϕ= 0 °, 45 °, and 90 ° are a shape of 14 mm in elongation, 3 mm in width and 0. 44 mm in thickness.

This subject has encouraged new researches on biocomposite concretes with the aim to exploit renewable resources like vegetal fibres intended as materials whose production processes are generally characterized by low costs and energy demand. This biocomposite is obviously much lighter than concrete and, therefore, can be suitably used in such cases where a structure cannot be overloaded, for instance in the realization of a green covering {{on top of a}} preexistent building.

The ability to survive heat-shocks was investigated in cold stenothermal species, threatened of extinction by global warming. IV instar larvae of Diamesa cinerella gr. were collected seasonally (from March 2005 to March 2006) in the Noce river (Trentino, NE Italy) at two altitudes (1300 and 2600 m a. s. l.).

Upon getting hints from a basic system configuration assumed as reference setup about the multiple bifurcation event possibly governing transition to complex dynamics, an improved experimental apparatus is used to make it technically accessible. Results obtained by varying three control parameters, namely the frequency and amplitude of excitation and the temperature of a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> embedding the experimental system, allow us to characterize in-depth various occurring classes of motion ill terms of time and spatial complexity, to describe peculiar and/or persistent features of transition to nonregular dynamics, and to trace them back to a canonical scenario from bifurcation theory. Variable response paths are detected via bifurcation diagrams and spectra of singular values of measurement results, and overall behaviour charts are built ill the excitation parameter space. Considering the temperature as a controllable parameter shows to be fundamental for: (i) indirectly setting cable material properties to values for which the conjectured codimension 2 bifurcation becomes apparent, (ii) qualitatively referring the experimental unfolding of regular and nonregular cable dynamics to the theoretical unfolding of the divergence-Hopf bifurcation normal form, and (iii) determining system response {{not only in the}} strict neighbourhood of the organizing divergence-Hopf bifurcation but also in the ensuing postcritical regions where the dependence of material damping on temperature affects secondary bifurcations to low-dimensional homoclinic chaos.

40|$|Problem of {{aluminium}} in beer has been elaborated in several papers {{over the last}} decade. However, the effect {{of aluminium}} on organoleptic properties of beer has been observed in few papers {{where it has been}} stated that aluminium gives beer a »metallic« and bitter flavour without any observations on particular aroma compound changes. Also, the number of reports on precise changes of aroma components throughout different storage conditions is surprisingly scarce. In order to investigate the changes of aluminium concentration along with aroma compound changes, graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectrophotometry (GF-AAS) with Zeeman background correction and gas chromatography with static headspace sampler (GC-HSS) were used in this work. Analyses were conducted periodically throughout seven months of storage on three different brands of beer from name breweries. Samples were taken before and after filling in aluminium cans. One part of samples was stored in a refrigerator (4 °C) and the other in a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> (22 °C). The effects of beer brand and storage conditions on aluminium concentration and level of aroma compounds were measured. To prove the effect of aluminium concentration on the changes of aroma compounds, the adequate level of aluminium sulphate was added to bottled beer samples stored at 28 °C. Although different beer types showed significantly different aluminium concentration, it could be the result of other factors (different batches of identical beer type showed significantly different aluminium concentration as well). Samples that were stored in the refrigerator were protected from aluminium migration from the can to the beer and showed increased aroma stability. Level of aroma constituents of analyzed beer brands was significantly different.

40|$|Background: We {{wanted to}} {{investigate}} the physical state of biological membranes in live cells under the most physiological conditions possible. Methods: For this we have been using laurdan, C-laurdan or M-laurdan to label a variety of cells, and a biphoton microscope equipped with both a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> and a spectral analyser. We also used a flow cytometer to quantify the 450 / 530 nm ratio of fluorescence emissions by whole cells. Results: We find that using all the information provided by spectral analysis to perform spectral decomposition dramatically improves the imaging resolution compared to using just two channels, as commonly used to calculate generalized polarisation (GP). Coupled to a new plugin called Fraction Mapper, developed to represent the fraction of light intensity in the first component in a stack of two images, we obtain very clear pictures of both the intra-cellular distribution of the probes, and the polarity of the cellular environments where the lipid probes are localised. Our results lead us to conclude that, in live cells kept at 37 °C, laurdan, and M-laurdan to a lesser extent, have a strong tendency to accumulate in the very apolar environment of intra-cytoplasmic lipid droplets, but label the plasma membrane (PM) of mammalian cells ineffectively. On the other hand, C-laurdan labels the PM very quickly and effectively, and does not detectably accumulate in lipid droplets. Conclusions: From using these probes {{on a variety of}} mammalian cell lines, as well as on cells from Drosophila and Dictyostelium discoideum, we conclude that, apart from the lipid droplets, which are very apolar, probes in intracellular membranes reveal a relatively polar and hydrated environment, suggesting a very marked dominance of liquid disordered states. PMs, on the other hand, are much more apolar, suggesting a strong dominance of liquid ordered state, which fits with their high sterol contents...|$|E

The superplasticizers are the chemical admixture used in the mix to improve the fluidity of mortar. Many factors influenced the superplasticizer to disperse the cement particle in the mortar. Nature and amount of replaced cement by slag, mixing procedure, delayed addition time, and heat stimulation technique of superplasticizer cause the varied effect on the fluidity of the cementitious material. In this experiment, the superplasticizers were heated for 1 hour under 60 °C in a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber.</b> Furthermore, the effect of delayed addition time of heat stimulated superplasticizers (SP) was also analyzed. This method was applied to two types of polycarboxylic acid based ether SP (precast type superplasticizer (SP 2) and ready-mix type superplasticizer (SP 1)) in combination with a partial replacement of normal Portland cement with blast furnace slag (BFS) with 30 % w/c ratio. On the other hands, the fluidity, air content, fresh density, and compressive strength for 7 and 28 days were studied. The {{results indicate that the}} addition time and heat stimulation technique improved the flow and air content, decreased the density, and slightly decreased the compressive strength of mortar. Moreover, the slag improved the flow of mortar by increasing the amount of slag, and the effect of external temperature of SP on the flow of mortar was decreased. In comparison, the flow of mortar was improved on 5 -minute delay for both kinds of SP, but SP 1 has improved the flow in all conditions.

The aim of this trial was to study in vitro the effects of quebracho tannin extract (QT) on the rumen biohydrogenation (BH) of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) contained in soybean and linseed oils. Two control diets were prepared using grass hay (770 g/kg on dry matter, DM), soybean meal (55 g/kg DM), barley meal (135 g/kg DM), supplemented with 35 g/kg DM of soybean (SOC diet) or linseed oil (LOC diet). Other two diets (SOCT and LOCT) were obtained by the integration of SOC and LOC with QT (49 g/ kg DM). Feeds (2 g DM) were incubated in triplicate with 200 ml of rumen liquor in a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> (39 °C) equipped with thirty-six 300 ml glass fermentation vessels. Incubation times were 6, 12 and 18 h. At each fermentation time, rumen liquor was fractionated in order to obtain liquid and solid associated bacteria (SAB). Only SAB were considered for the fatty acid analysis. QT induced a decrease of the BH of PUFA, favouring the accumulation of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid. After 18 h of fermentation the content of linoleic acid was reduced by 76 % and 42 % in SOC and SOCT feed, respectively, whereas the content of linolenic acid was reduced by 85 % and 73 % in LOC and LOCT feed, respectively. Conversely, the accumulation in rumen liquor of vaccenic acid, total CLA and the other intermediates of BH process was lower when QT was added to both SOC and LOC feeds. The content of 18 : 0 was significantly lower in both SOCT (- 33 %) and LOCT (- 17 %) feeds, if compared with the same feeds without QT. In conclusion, QT was effective in the reduction of the BH of PUFA in rumen liquor, {{especially in the case of}} linoleic acid...|$|E
3000|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  7, the plasma waves {{radiating}} from the Space Shuttle experiment had a frequency of over 10  kHz. The closed-loop {{frequency of the}} preamplifier {{was designed to be}} 10  kHz to improve the temperature dependence in the target frequency band (10 – 100  kHz). Tests for the ASIC preamplifiers were conducted in the temperature range from - 60 to + 100 ^∘C to evaluate the temperature sensitivity of the gain without/with the BGR circuit in a <b>thermostatic</b> <b>chamber</b> (MC- 712, ESPEC Corp.). The temperature dependence of the ASIC preamplifier was evaluated by the gain without the loop antenna, because of electromagnetic noise from the facility. Figure  8 shows the measurement (panels a and c) and simulation (panels b and d) results of the gain profile for each temperature. The temperature behavior without/with the BGR circuit shows a reasonable agreement between the measurements and the simulations. The ASIC preamplifier was operated in the temperature range from - 30 to + 100 ^∘C without the temperature-compensated BGR circuit in the simulations (panel b), but the operational temperature range was 0 to + 100 ^∘C in the measurements (panel a). The reason of small errors would be caused by the inaccuracy in the SPICE parameters related to the temperature drift. On the other hand, the operational temperature range was improved from - 60 to + 100 ^∘C by using the temperature-compensated BGR circuit for the measurements and simulations (panels c and d). It is clearly seen that the temperature-compensated BGR circuit can be effective above 10  kHz. The temperature dependence of the gain showed a linearly decreasing trend in units of dB. The temperature coefficients of the gain without/with the BGR circuit are listed in Table  4 for each frequency. The temperature coefficients of the gain below 10  kHz were about - 12 ∼ - 8 × 10 ^- 3  dB/^∘C without/with the BGR circuit for the measurements and - 7 ∼ - 5 × 10 ^- 3  dB/^∘C for the simulations, respectively. These values are almost the same as those for the ASIC preamplifier for MSCs (Rhouni et al. 2013). In the frequency range within the closed-loop bandwidth, the temperature coefficients cannot be controlled, because they are determined by the thermal drift of the polysilicon resistors embedded in the chip, as shown in Eq. (6). They are not inferior in quality, but the temperature coefficients of the gain were dramatically improved by using the BGR circuit. Then, the values reach to - 2.6 and + 0.46 [...]...|$|E
