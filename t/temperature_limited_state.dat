40|$|An attempt {{toward the}} {{operational}} formulation of quantum thermodynamics {{is made by}} employing the recently proposed operations forming positive operator-valued measures for generating thermodynamic processes. The quantity of heat {{as well as the}} von Neumann entropy monotonically increases under the operations. The fixed point analysis shows that repeated applications of these operations to a given system transform from its pure ground state at zero temperature to the completely random state in the high <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> with intermediate <b>states</b> being generically out of equilibrium. It is shown that the Clausius inequality can be violated along the processes, in general. A bipartite spin- 1 / 2 system is analyzed as an explicit example. Comment: 22 pages and 1 figure.

40|$|We {{consider}} the van der Waals free energy functional in a bounded interval with inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions imposing the two stable phases at the endpoints. We compute the asymptotic free energy cost, as {{the length of}} the interval diverges, of shifting the interface from the midpoint. We then discuss the effect of thermal fluctuations by analyzing the phi(4) (1) -measure with Dobrushin boundary conditions. In particular, we obtain a non-trivial limit in a suitable scaling in which {{the length of the}} interval diverges and the <b>temperature</b> vanishes.

40|$|Cracking {{of space}} shuttle main engine {{high-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump knife-edge seals {{has been observed}} in several units. Although this cracking has not resulted in the complete fracture of any units, the consequences of such a fracture could be severe. As a result, life limits have been imposed on existing units that effectively require the complete replacement of the units following each flight, with substantial cost and schedule implications. This burden prompted efforts to develop alternative fleet management strategies that would not significantly increase risk. The objective of this effort {{was to assess the}} probability of initiating and growing a crack to a specified failure length in specific flight units for different usage and inspection scenarios. Prior investigations by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center had determined that these seals are sensitive to fluid-structure instability, or flutter. The probabilistic fracture assessment model developed in this investigation combined a series of submodels describing the usage, temperature history, flutter tendencies, tooth stresses and numbers of cycles, fatigue cracking, nondestructive inspection, and finally the probability of failure. The analysis accounted for unit-to-unit variations in <b>temperature,</b> flutter <b>limit</b> <b>state,</b> flutter stres...|$|R

40|$|The initial curing of {{concrete}} specimens for quality assurance is addressed in different ways in testing standards, which often specify requirements {{that are difficult to}} meet in practice unless very costly initial curing chambers are available. The failure to meet these requirements {{in many areas of the}} world does not appear to result in adverse consequences. This study analyzed six initial curing temperature schemes, all with cycles similar to natural conditions to avoid the simplifications inherent in constant temperature curing. Three strengths {{of concrete}} and two initial curing times (24 and 72 hours) were used in this study. The findings showed that initial curing time had no effect on 28 -day strength.

40|$|The phase {{structure}} of a homopolymer chain is investigated {{in terms of a}} universal theoretical model, designed to describe the infrared limit of slow spatial variations. The effects of chirality are studied and compared with the influence of a short-range attractive interaction between monomers, at various ambient temperature values. In the high <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> the homopolymer chain is in the self-avoiding random walk phase. But at low temperatures, two different phases are possible: When short-range attractive interactions dominate over chirality, the chain collapses into a space- filling conformation. But when the attractive interactions become weaker, there is a low temperature unfolding transition and the chain becomes like a straight rod. Between the high temperature and low <b>temperature</b> <b>limits,</b> several intermediate <b>states</b> are observed. For sufficiently high values of short-range attraction, the conventional θ-regime is observed between the self-avoiding random walk phase and the space filling collapsed phase. But when chirality increases, there is a trasition from the θ-regime to a pseudogap state. Moreover, a regime akin the θ-regime is identified between the pseudogap state, and the low temperature phase where the chain is like a straight rod. Applications to polymers and proteins, in particular collagen, are suggested. Comment: Journal version of the paper, published in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} the antiferro{{magnetic}} (AF) heavy fermion metal YbRh_ 2 Si_ 2 in a magnetic field B indicate {{the presence of a}} jump in the Hall coefficient at a magnetic-field tuned quantum state in the zero <b>temperature</b> <b>limit.</b> This quantum <b>state</b> occurs at B≥ B_c 0 and induces the jump even though the change of the magnetic field at B=B_c 0 is infinitesimal. We investigate this by using the model of heavy electron liquid with the fermion condensate. Within this model the jump takes place when the magnetic field reaches the critical value B_c 0 at which the ordering temperature T_N(B=B_c 0) of the AF transition vanishes. We show that at B→ B_c 0, this second order AF phase transition becomes the first order one, making the corresponding quantum and thermal critical fluctuations vanish at the jump. At T→ 0 and B=B_c 0, the Grüneisen ratio as a function of temperature T diverges. We demonstrate that both the divergence and the jump are determined by the specific low temperature behavior of the entropy S(T) ∝ S_ 0 +a√(T) +bT with S_ 0, a and b are temperature independent constants.

40|$|Physics-based {{models are}} {{routinely}} {{used to predict}} the performance of engineered systems to make decisions such as when to retire system components, how to {{extend the life of}} an aging system, or if a new design will be safe or available. Model verification and validation (V&V) is a process to establish credibility in model predictions. Ideally, carefully controlled validation experiments will be designed and performed to validate models or submodels. In reality, time and cost constraints limit experiments and even model development. This paper describes elements of model V&V during the development and application of a probabilistic fracture assessment model to predict cracking in space shuttle main engine high-pressure oxidizer turbopump knife-edge seals. The objective of this effort was to assess the probability of initiating and growing a crack to a specified failure length in specific flight units for different usage and inspection scenarios. The probabilistic fracture assessment model developed in this investigation combined a series of submodels describing the usage, temperature history, flutter tendencies, tooth stresses and numbers of cycles, fatigue cracking, nondestructive inspection, and finally the probability of failure. The analysis accounted for unit-to-unit variations in <b>temperature,</b> flutter <b>limit</b> <b>state,</b> flutter stress magnitude, and fatigue life properties. The investigation focused on the calculation of relative risk rather than absolute risk between the usage scenarios. Verification predictions were first performed for three units with known usage and cracking histories to establish credibility in the model predictions. Then, numerous predictions were performed for an assortment of operating units that had flown recently or that were projected for future flights. Calculations were performed using two NASA-developed software tools: NESSUS(Registered Trademark) for the probabilistic analysis, and NASGRO(Registered Trademark) for the fracture mechanics analysis. The goal of these predictions was to provide additional information to guide decisions on the potential of reusing existing and installed units prior to the new design certification...|$|R

40|$|The {{in-plane}} ρ_ab(H) and the out-of-plane ρ_c(H) magneto-transport in {{magnetic fields}} up to 28 T {{has been investigated}} {{in a series of}} high quality, single crystal, hole-doped La-free Bi 2201 cuprates for a wide doping range and over a wide range of temperatures down to 40 mK. With decreasing hole concentration going from the overdoped (p= 0. 2) to the underdoped (p= 0. 12) regimes, a crossover from a metallic to and insulating behavior of ρ_ab(T) is observed in the low temperature normal state, resulting in a disorder induced metal insulator transition. In the zero <b>temperature</b> <b>limit,</b> the normal <b>state</b> ratio ρ_c(H) /ρ_ab(H) of the heavily underdoped samples in pure Bi 2201 shows an anisotropic 3 D behavior, in striking contrast with that observed in La-doped Bi 2201 and LSCO systems. Our data strongly support that that the negative out-of-plane magnetoresistance is largely governed by interlayer conduction of quasiparticles in the superconducting state, accompanied by a small contribution of normal state transport associated with the field dependent pseudogap. Both in the optimal and overdoped regimes, the semiconducting behavior of ρ_c(H) persists even for magnetic fields above the pseudogap closing field H_pg. The method suggested by Shibauchi et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5763, (2001)) for evaluating H_pg is unsuccessful for both under- and overdoped Bi 2201 samples. Our findings suggest that the normal state pseudogap is not always a precursor of superconductivity. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures, published in PRB Nov 200...|$|R

The approach used in the present paper estimates the relationship between rates of temperature change and upper <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> for survival in order to evaluate the maximum long-term survival temperature (Ts). This new approach integrates both the exposure time and the exposure temperature in the evaluation of <b>temperature</b> <b>limits.</b> Using data previously published for different temperate and Antarctic marine environments, we calculated Ts in each environment, which allowed us to calculate a new index: the Warming Allowance (WA). This index is defined as the maximum environmental temperature increase which an ectotherm in a given environment can tolerate, possibly with a decrease in performance but without endangering survival over seasonal or lifetime time-scales. It is calculated as the difference between maximum long-term survival temperature (Ts) and mean maximum habitat temperature. It provides a measure of how close a species, assemblage or fauna are living to their <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> for long-term survival and hence their vulnerability to environmental warming.
