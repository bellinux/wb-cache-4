40|$|This essay explores Hemingway’s {{depiction}} {{of women in}} the novel <b>To</b> <b>Have</b> and <b>Have</b> Not. In <b>To</b> <b>Have</b> and <b>Have</b> Not, the novel explored in this essay, traits of Hemingway’s renowned sexist {{depiction of}} women <b>have</b> been investigated, and the purpose of the essay was to illuminate that the women of <b>To</b> <b>Have</b> and <b>Have</b> Not are reduced <b>to</b> roles which resembles Simone de Beauvoir’s observations, namely the perception of women as the Other, assuming subordinate roles. In order to achieve this task, a close reading <b>has</b> been done on Hemingway’s novel <b>To</b> <b>Have</b> and <b>Have</b> Not, and his portrayal of five female characters in the novel <b>has</b> been analyzed. Simone de Beauvoir’s theory <b>has</b> been applied for an understanding of these female characters in order to see if these women were portrayed in a manner resembling de Beauvoir notions, that is, marked by patriarchal perspectives. The conclusion drawn in this essay is that all the women in the novel are portrayed as "absolute sex", subordinated to men. Thus, the depictions {{of the women in the}} novel <b>To</b> <b>Have</b> and <b>Have</b> Not were found <b>to</b> correspond to patriarchal gender roles as described by Simone de Beauvoir...|$|R
