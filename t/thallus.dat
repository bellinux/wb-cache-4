5|$|The {{elliptical}} brown-colored flecks, {{which can}} be observed in both the red and pink zones of the <b>thallus,</b> are made of confluentic acid and calcium oxalate monohydrate. The monohydrate is thought to be a more chemically stable metabolic byproduct of calcium oxalate dihydrate; the function of confluentic acid in the brown flecks is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The lichen has a {{distinct}} prothallus—fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the <b>thallus</b> onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the <b>thallus</b> {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of beta-carotene. The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is a crustose lichen, {{because it}} {{grows in the}} form of a surface crust. The <b>thallus,</b> or body of the lichen is spread out flat and can be either tightly to loosely {{attached}} to the growing surface. It is 0.15–0.30mm thick, and can be smooth, or have low radiating ridges. The older, central region of the lichen surface has many reproductive structures called isidia; they resemble granules that are 0.1–0.4 by 0.1mm. The species relies entirely on vegetative means to reproduce, and is not known to have any sexual structures. From the center outwards, three color zones can be differentiated in mature specimens; the first grayish-green, the second white, and finally a bright red cottony rim.|$|E
5|$|The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature {{states that}} names of fungi adopted by Fries in Systema Mycologicum vols. 1–3 are sanctioned, that is, they are conserved against earlier {{homonyms}} and competing synonyms. This {{means that the}} name Hypochnus rubrocinctum has priority over Byssus sanguinea. The type material of H.rubrocinctum was examined by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in Berlin; it has since been destroyed, probably during the Second World War. The drawing in Erhenberg's 1820 publication serves as the lectotype. The species {{was transferred to the}} genus Cryptothecia by Swedish lichenologist Göran Thor in 1991, {{on the basis of its}} similarity with C.striata such as the <b>thallus</b> with radiate ridges, granular isidia, and presence of para-depsides (gyrophoric acid in C.striata and confluentic acid in C.rubrocincta).|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the <b>thallus.</b> The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E
25|$|The {{holdfast}} is a root-like {{mass that}} anchors the <b>thallus</b> {{to the sea}} floor, though unlike true roots it is not responsible for absorbing and delivering nutrients {{to the rest of}} the <b>thallus.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Alfacar and Viznar, Andalucia (Spain), P.furfuracea is {{used for}} {{respiratory}} complaints. The <b>thallus</b> is washed and boiled {{for a long time}} to prepare a decoction which is drunk.|$|E
25|$|The {{generic name}} {{is derived from}} the Latin {{language}} pelta (small shield), and refers to the shield-shaped <b>thallus</b> in these species. The common name, the dog lichen, refers to the perceived resemblance of P. caninus to a dog.|$|E
500|$|The <b>thallus</b> is the {{vegetative}} {{body of a}} lichen {{that contains}} the lichen mycobiont (fungus) and the photobiont (algae and/or cyanobacteria). In P.acicularis, the primary <b>thallus</b> (<b>thallus</b> horizontalis) is spread out like a granular crust {{on the surface of}} its substrate. It is light green when young, but becomes gray in age or when dry. The pseudopodetia (upright stalk-like extensions of the <b>thallus</b> made of vegetative tissue) range from [...] high, and are about 1mm thick; they grow in dense clusters. Most pseudopodetia are either unbranched or forked into two branches, with the stalks curved so as to appear as if combed; less frequently, they are erect like pins, and up to [...] tall. Some specimens are highly branched in {{the upper part of the}} pseudopodetia, causing them to bear some resemblance to P.robustus, although this morphology is uncommon. Internally, the pseudopodetia are solid when young, becoming hollow with age, and are composed of long, thin, highly gelatinized hyphae with narrow cavities about 0.5μm wide. The lower part of older pseudopodetia becomes blackened internally. The algal layer is not continuous—contrasting with lichen species that have thalli that stratify into discrete tissue types, including a photobiont layer—and occurs with the mycobiont in the form of granules. These granules may be absent from some parts of the <b>thallus</b> surface. Pycnidia (flask-like structures, resembling perithecia, in which conidia are produced) occur in the tips of small sterile pseudopodetia or in the tips of small lateral branches of older pseudopodetia.|$|E
500|$|No {{contemporary}} {{references to}} this darkness {{have been found}} outside of the New Testament. Later commentators speculated about a [...] reference in a work by the chronicler <b>Thallus.</b> In the ninth century, the Byzantine historian George Syncellus quoted from the third-century Christian historian Sextus Julius Africanus, who remarked that [...] "Thallos dismisses this darkness as a solar eclipse". It is not known when <b>Thallus</b> lived, and {{it is unclear whether}} he himself made any reference to the crucifixion. Tertullian, in his Apologeticus, told the story of the crucifixion darkness and suggested that the evidence must still be held in the Roman archives.|$|E
500|$|Physcia caesia is a foliose lichen {{that forms}} small rosettes, {{typically}} measuring [...] across at maturity, {{though it can}} reach diameters of up to [...] The <b>thallus</b> is pale gray shading to darker gray in the center, and adheres closely to the substrate on which it grows. Its convex lobes are linear, typically measuring [...] in width, though occasionally as wide as [...] Forms in some areas, including Greenland, can be considerably darker, with a <b>thallus</b> ranging from gray to dark gray; they can also have broader or narrower lobes. The lichen's surface is white-spotted, though {{this is not always}} obvious. It has blue-gray soredia, which are piled in round mounds (such aggregations are known as soralia) across the thallus's upper surface. The lower surface is white to brown with short, dark rhizines. Physcia caesia only rarely has apothecia. Where present, these are black discs measuring up to [...] across, with prominent thalline margins (which means the <b>thallus</b> extends up {{around the edges of the}} apothecia) and a grayish pruinescence. Each ascus contains 8 spores, which are thick-walled and brown, measuring [...] x [...] [...] Its photobiont is the green algae Trebouxia impressa, a species associated with many Physcia lichens.|$|E
500|$|Physcia caesia {{was long}} {{considered}} to be a species pair with the very similar Physcia aipolia; the latter is regularly covered with black apothecia, and typically grows epiphytically. Physcia caesia may also be confused with Physcia poncinsii, but the latter has [...] "crateriform" [...] (hollowed, like a bowl or saucer) rather than rounded soralia, and obviously convex lobes. It may also be confused with Physcia dubia which, like Physcia caesia, can be quite variable; however, P. dubia has lip-shaped soralia (which tend to be primarily [...] ), and its <b>thallus</b> does not react with potassium hydroxide.|$|E
500|$|P. aciculare {{has both}} crustose (crust-like) and fruticose <b>thallus</b> (shrub-like) body parts. The lichen starts {{out as a}} {{granular}} crust on the rock surface, and develops fruticose stalks, or pseudopodetia, up to [...] tall and about 1mm thick that have rounded black apothecia at the tips. The stalks are erect and curved so as to appear combed. It grows directly on silicate rocks in dense clusters. It is found {{on the west coast}} of North America up to Alaska, and in eastern Eurasia. In addition to green algae, the lichen contains cyanobacteria that help contribute to soil fertility by supplying fixed nitrogen.|$|E
500|$|The conidiophores of P.acicularis are 30μm long, and unbranched. They have {{terminal}} sickle-shaped conidia {{that measure}} 6 by 1μm. The apothecia (reproductive structures {{covered with the}} spore-producing asci) [...] are abundant, usually with one or several on {{the tips of the}} pseudopodetia. They are black, hemispherical or roughly triangular, and measure up to 1.5mm in diameter. The hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing layer of cells containing the asci) is up to 240μm thick, and about two-thirds of it is pigmented; {{the lower part of the}} hymenium is sterile, consisting of only paraphyses. The asci are eight-spored. The ascospores are rounded when young, becoming spindle-shaped when mature, with dimensions of 21.0–29.5 by 4.5–5.5μm. The generative tissue (hyphae that eventually forms the <b>thallus)</b> is closely interwoven with short, broad cells that have large cavities. The generative tissue is pigmented black-brown, with the color being most intense below the paraphyses, becoming less so towards the stalk region.|$|E
500|$|Sea palms {{are found}} on the rocky shores of western North America, from {{as far north as}} Vancouver Island, to the {{southern}} central coast of California. [...] They live in the middle to upper intertidal zones in very wavy areas. [...] High wave action may increase nutrient availability and moves the blades of the <b>thallus,</b> allowing more sunlight to reach the organism so that it can photosynthesize. [...] In addition, the constant wave action removes competitors, such as the California mussel. [...] Recent studies have shown that Postelsia grows in greater numbers when such competition exists. A control group with no competition produced fewer offspring than an experimental group with mussels; from this it is thought that the mussels provide protection for the developing gametophytes. [...] Alternatively, it is thought that the mussels may prevent the growth of competing algae such as Corallina or Halosaccion, allowing Postelsia to grow freely after wave action removes the mussels.|$|E
500|$|Postelsia has two {{distinct}} morphologies: one for its diploid, monoicous sporophyte stage, {{which is the}} dominant portion of the life cycle, and one for its smaller, haploid, dioecious gametophyte stage. [...] Like all seaweeds, the sporophyte stage of Postelsia consists of a <b>thallus,</b> which {{is made up of}} a stem-like stipe topped with possibly over 100 leaf-like blades, and rests on a root-like holdfast. [...] The holdfast anchors the organism to the rocks it lives on. [...] The sea palm has no vascular system; the stipe is only for support of the organism and holds the fronds up over other organisms so they can receive more light. [...] The stipe is merely a firm, hollow tube, able to withstand the open air of low tide conditions as well as the crashing waves of high tide. [...] The blades are grooved, with the sporangia held within these grooves. [...] The gametophyte stage is microscopic, consisting of only a few cells. [...] The gametophytes produce sperm and eggs to create new sporophytes.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Thallus,</b> of whom {{very little}} is known, and none of whose {{writings}} survive, wrote a history allegedly around the middle to late first century CE, to which Eusebius referred. Julius Africanus, writing c 221, links a reference in the third book of the History to the period of darkness described in the crucifixion accounts {{in three of the}} Gospels [...] It is not known whether <b>Thallus</b> made any mention to the crucifixion accounts; if he did, it would be the earliest noncanonical reference to a gospel episode, but its usefulness in determining the historicity of Jesus is uncertain. The dating of <b>Thallus</b> is dependent on him writing about an event during the 207th Olympiad (49-52 AD), which means he wrote after that date, not near that date. This depends on the text being corrupt, which would mean <b>Thallus</b> could have been writing after the 217th Olympiad (89-92 AD), or even the 167th Olympiad (112-109 BC). He is first referenced by Theophilus, writing around 180 AD, which means <b>Thallus</b> could have written any time between 109 BC and 180 AD. [...] All we know is <b>Thallus</b> mentioned a solar eclipse, and as solar eclipses are not possible at Passover, that would mean <b>Thallus</b> was not talking about the crucifixion of Jesus at all.|$|E

2500|$|A new genus of lichen, Winfrenatia, {{has been}} {{recovered}} from the Rhynie chert. The lichen comprises a <b>thallus,</b> made of layered, aseptate hyphae; a number of depressions are formed on its top surface.

2500|$|Menegazzia is a genus of lichenized fungi {{containing}} roughly 70 accepted species. The {{group is}} {{sometimes referred to}} as the tree flutes, honeycombed lichens, or hole-punch lichens. [...] The most obvious morphological feature of the genus is the distinctive perforations spread across the upper side of the <b>thallus.</b> This makes the group easy to recognise, even for those not particularly familiar with lichen identification.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>thallus</b> of Menegazzia is {{its most}} {{distinctive}} feature. [...] It is foliose, dorsiventral, lobate, and often rosette-forming, though many species {{can also be}} irregularly spreading. [...] It is heteromerous, that is, it contains an upper cortex, medulla, green algal layer (occupied by Trebouxia spp.), and lower cortex. [...] The <b>thallus</b> can be loosely or closely attached to the substrate, depending on the species. Lobes are generally hollow and inflated, with perforations throughout the corticate upper surface. [...] Only two species of Menegazzia are known which do not contain perforations (M. eperforata, and an as yet undescribed taxon from Papua New Guinea). [...] Many species can be sorediate, {{but only a few}} isidiate. Maculae are often present, especially at the lobe tips. The lower surface is also corticate, naked, and often uniformly attached to the substrate (except in M. inflata). This surface is always blackened, and without rhizines. [...] Internal cavities have walls which are most often white, but in some species they can be pigmented or blackened.|$|E
2500|$|Forms {{deviating}} {{from the}} standard morphology usually have more specific names, such as [...] "bolete", [...] "puffball", [...] "stinkhorn", and [...] "morel", and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called [...] "agarics" [...] in reference to their similarity to Agaricus or their order Agaricales.

2500|$|Sextus Julius Africanus further {{refers to}} the {{writings}} of historian Thallus: [...] "This darkness <b>Thallus,</b> in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun. For the Hebrews celebrate the passover on the 14th day according to the moon, and the passion of our Saviour falls {{on the day before}} the passover; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes under the sun."

6000|$|From the <b>thallus</b> of a sea-weed up to {{the leaf}} of a highly {{developed}} phænogam, we find, at all stages, a contrast between {{the inner and outer}} parts of these flattened masses of tissue. In the higher Algæ [...] "the outermost layers consist of smaller and firmer cells, while the inner cells are often very large, and sometimes extremely long;"[51] and in the leaves of trees the epidermal layer, besides differing in the sizes and shapes of its component cells from the parenchyma forming the inner substance of the leaf, is itself differentiated by having a continuous cuticle, and by having the outer walls of its cells unlike the inner walls.[52] Especially significant is the structure of such intermediate types as the Liverworts. Beyond the differentiation of the covering cells from the contained cells, and the contrast between upper surface and under surface, the frond of Marchantia polymorpha clearly shows us the direct effect of incident forces; and shows us, too, how it is involved with the effect of inherited proclivities. The frond grows from a flat disc-shaped gemma, the two sides of which are alike. Either side may fall uppermost; and then of the developing shoot, the side exposed to the light [...] "is under all circumstances the upper side which forms stomata, the dark side becomes the under side which produces root-hairs and leafy processes."[53] So that while we have undeniable proof that the contrasted influences of the medium on the two sides, initiate the differentiation, we have also proof that the completion of it is determined by the transmitted structure of the type; since it is impossible to ascribe the development of stomata to the direct action of air and light. On turning from foliar expansions, to stems and roots, facts of like meaning meet us. Speaking generally of epidermal tissue and inner tissue, Sachs remarks that [...] "the contrast of the two is the plainer the more the part of the plant concerned is exposed to air and light."[54] Elsewhere, in correspondence with this, it is said that in roots the cells of the epidermis, though distinguished by bearing hairs, [...] "are otherwise {{similar to those of the}} fundamental tissue" [...] which they clothe,[55] while the cuticular covering is relatively thin; whereas in stems the epidermis (often further differentiated) is composed of layers of cells which are smaller and thicker-walled: a stronger contrast of structure corresponding to a stronger contrast of conditions. By way of meeting the suggestion that these respective differences are wholly due to the natural selection of favourable variations, it will suffice if I draw attention to the unlikeness between imbedded roots and exposed roots. While in darkness, and surrounded by moist earth, the outermost protective coats, even of large roots, are comparatively thin; but when the accidents of growth entail permanent exposure to light and air, roots acquire coverings allied in character to the coverings of branches. That the action of the medium causes these and converse changes, cannot be doubted when we find, on the one hand, that [...] "roots can become directly transformed into leaf-bearing shoots," [...] and, on the other hand, that in some plants certain [...] "apparent roots are only underground shoots," [...] and that nevertheless [...] "they are similar to true roots in function and in the formation of tissue, but have no root-cap, and, when they come to the light above ground, continue to grow in the manner of ordinary leaf-shoots."[56] If, then, in highly developed plants inheriting pronounced structures, this differentiating influence of the medium is so marked, it must have been all-important at the outset while types were undetermined.|$|E
50|$|Jensenia liverworts are dioicous. Compared to Pallavicinia liverworts, their <b>thallus</b> grows erect, and {{branches}} tree-like, rather than trailing the ground.

It gradually forms an organized pseudocortex. The photobiont consists of green globose coccoid cells. It produces a thick <b>thallus</b> and (usually) lacks rhizohyphae and ascending <b>thallus</b> margins.|$|E
5000|$|Niebla dilatata is {{recognized}} by the <b>thallus</b> divided into flattened twisted branches that broadly expand above the base, the branches thickened and wavy (undulate) along margins, often with abundant pycnidia and/or apothecia, and by the <b>thallus</b> containing the lichen substance divaricatic acid.

50|$|Lichens grow in a {{wide range}} of shapes and forms (morphologies). The shape of a lichen is usually {{determined}} by the organization of the fungal filaments.
