5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot {{of the show is}} the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire. Salon.com described the title {{as a metaphor for the}} viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police with access <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret</b> world, just as the show does for the viewer. Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E

5|$|Alice Nutter {{was unusual}} among the accused in being {{comparatively}} wealthy, {{the widow of}} a tenant yeoman farmer. She made no statement either before or during her trial, except to enter her {{plea of not guilty}} to the charge of murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft. The prosecution alleged that she, together with Demdike and Elizabeth Device, had caused Mitton's death after he had refused to give Demdike a penny she had begged from him. The only evidence against Alice seems to have been that James Device claimed Demdike had told him of the murder, and Jennet Device in her statement said that Alice had been present at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice may have called in on the meeting at Malkin Tower on her way <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret</b> (and illegal) Good Friday Catholic service, and refused to speak for fear of incriminating her fellow Catholics. Many of the Nutter family were Catholics, and two had been executed as Jesuit priests, John Nutter in 1584 and his brother Robert in 1600. Alice Nutter was found guilty.|$|E

With Mace planning to announce S.H.I.E.L.D. to the world as a legitimate agency, he has had Coulson helping him with public relations. Mack asks Johnson to return to S.H.I.E.L.D. with them, as she was an agent and friend of theirs before leaving to become Quake.

When the time came Louisy refused, backed by the Americans, who wanted to keep Odlum out of office at all costs. This saw Odlum turn against his own government and even vote against the budget. A second proposal that Louisy resign was rejected on 30 December 1980, with the power struggle continuing despite his agreement to hand over some of his portfolios. The dispute continued into 1981, with Odlum attracting controversy by announcing on 3 March {{that he had not}} ignored the possibility of his grouping within the Labour Party splitting and joining the United Workers Party.|$|E
5|$|Scientist Hector Hammond is {{summoned by}} his father, Senator Robert Hammond, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret</b> {{government}} facility {{to perform an}} autopsy on Abin Sur's body {{under the watchful eye}} of Amanda Waller. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond, giving him telepathic and telekinetic powers at the cost of his sanity. After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his father's influence, Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a party. Jordan saves the senator and the party guests, including his childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris. Back at the government facility, Hammond uses telekenisis to successfully kill his father by burning him alive. Hammond also elevates Waller high above the floor. As she's falling, Jordan arrives and saves the injured Waller by creating a pool of water which whisks her away out of further danger. During the encounter Jordan learns of Parallax coming to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Taper was not Levin's {{only work}} for The Spectator. He wrote {{on a wide}} range of subjects, from a {{campaign}} for the release of three Arabs imprisoned by the British authorities, to supporting publication of the banned novel Lady Chatterley's Lover, and denunciation of the retired Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard. The last led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret</b> meeting of more than 20 senior judges to see whether Levin could be prosecuted for criminal libel; there was no prosecution, and his accusations about Goddard's vindictiveness, deceit and bias have relatively recently been claimed to have been justified. In 1959, Gilmour, while remaining as proprietor, stepped down as editor and was succeeded by his deputy, Brian Inglis; Levin took over from Inglis as assistant editor. Later in that year, after the general election victory of another of his bêtes noires, Harold Macmillan, Levin gave up the Taper column, professing himself to be in despair.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode {{can be traced back}} to an early idea Vince Gilligan, the writer of the episode, had. His {{original}} idea featured a man holding an individual hostage on a Tilt-A-Whirl. Gilligan pitched this idea at several meetings and it soon became a recurring joke. Most of the comments Gilligan received noted that his premise lacked an explicit mystery to investigate and so Gilligan decided that after the ride was shut off, the man's head would explode. Researching various government experiments, Gilligan discovered the controversial use of low-frequency waves. The secret military experiment featured in this episode is based on two real-life military experiments, Project HAARP and Project ELF. The former is a U.S. Army experiment dealing with electromagnetic radiation in the Earth's ionosphere, and the second is a U.S. Navy experiment dealing with long wavelengths. Thus, a script was crafted that featured an individual that, due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret</b> experiment, could not slow down for fear of rupturing his head.|$|E
5|$|While {{still being}} trained, Alejandro steals a black {{stallion}} resembling Tornado {{from the local}} garrison.

At the party he gains Elena's admiration and enough of Montero's trust to be invited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret</b> meeting where several other noblemen are present. Montero hints at a plan to retake California for the Dons by buying it from General Santa Anna, who needs money to fund his upcoming war with the United States.|$|E
5|$|After the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he {{is caught}} by Batman {{and taken to}} Arkham Asylum, which {{temporarily}} houses {{many members of the}} Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret</b> Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.|$|E

Raynor is captured by Nova and Mengsk declares that he was executed, much to Kerrigan's grief. However, Mengsk later contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor is still alive and under his custody, using him as a leverage to have her keep the Zerg swarm, now reunited under her command, away from Dominion Territory. Kerrigan then manages to rescue Raynor with the Raiders' help and despite his rejection of Kerrigan at first for choosing to abandon her humanity {{in order to save}} him, he and his forces join the swarm for a final battle on Korhal to overthrow Mengsk, saving Kerrigan once more when the Emperor tries to destroy her with the artifact, ultimately leading to Mengsk's death at her hands. Reconciled with Kerrigan, Raynor bids farewell to her as she leaves with the Zerg swarm to confront Amon, the fallen Xel'Naga which intends to return and exterminate both the Zerg and Protoss races.|$|E
5|$|When {{transferred}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>secret</b> underwater government base, Osborn takes {{steps to}} ensure his release from prison. He uses a group of followers known as the 'Green Goblin Cult' to break out {{with the aid of}} corrupt senators; he plans to turn himself in after killing his fellow escapees, setting him up as a 'champion' of the judicial system. After the breakout he awaits his trial in a new prison, this one controlled by his cult members. Using his staged persona as a voice for the 'disenfranchised', Osborn plans to regain the Iron Patriot armor and creates a new team of Dark Avengers, this time substituting June Covington for Scarlet Witch, Ai Apaec for Spider-Man, Barney Barton for Hawkeye, Skaar for Hulk, Superia for Ms. Marvel, Gorgon for Wolverine and an A.I.M.-rebuilt Ragnarok for Thor. In the team's first fight with the New Avengers, Osborn reveals he has the Super-Adaptoid's powers, declares himself the head of world security, and orders that the Avengers be arrested for war crimes. However, double agent Skaar betrays Osborn, allowing the Avengers to dogpile Osborn's body, overloading him with superpowers and sending him into a coma. A.I.M. and HYDRA pick up Osborn's leftover resources, and H.A.M.M.E.R. is disbanded. After the Hobgoblin returns to New York, a nurse and doctor are called to Norman's hospital room, only to find him gone.|$|E
