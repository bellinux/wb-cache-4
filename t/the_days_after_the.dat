5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> storm, airstrikes {{and attacks}} {{continued}} {{elsewhere in the}} country, and only days after Chapala, Cyclone Megh followed a similar path, causing additional damage. Relief distribution was disrupted due to the poor communications in the region, worsened by the ongoing civil war, with the hardest hit areas under al-Qaeda control; aid trucks had to pass security clearances, resulting in delays. Workers began restoring communications and clearing roads in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> storm. By 19November, most of the displaced residents had returned home, although some remained in shelters due to house damage. Southern portions of Yemen saw food and fuel shortages following the two storms. Mukalla experienced an outbreak of dengue fever by January 2016 due to the floods, affecting 1,040people; earlier efforts to kill disease carrying mosquitoes were ineffective due to residual floods and unsanitary conditions. Seven people died due to the outbreak. A locust outbreak also began in December 2015 due to the floods.|$|E

5|$|By Hattie's {{one year}} anniversary, {{private and public}} workers {{repaired}} and rebuilt buildings affected by the storm. New hotels were constructed, and many stores were reopened. Prime Minister George Cadle Price successfully appealed for assistance from the British government, which ultimately provided £20millionin loans. In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> storm, the government announced plans to relocate the capital of British Honduras farther inland on higher ground. Work on the new capital, Belmopan, was completed in 1970.

5|$|By September 5, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, {{and other}} {{organizations}} had served 100,000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane in Mississippi, and federal food stocks became available {{for the state to}} distribute to storm victims. Still, resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest-hit locations, and long lines formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen. With dwindling supplies, the Salvation Army had to procure food {{from other parts of the}} region to serve to victims. In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> hurricane, an increase in heart attack deaths in the Harrison County area was noted.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> storm, the Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Mounted Police {{operated}} {{search and}} rescue missions, while families waited on the beach. The Canadian Red Cross set up headquarters in Escuminac to assist the victims. Due to storm fatalities, 24adults became widows, and 83children lost a father. As a result, the New Brunswick Fishermen's Disaster Fund was created to assist the families. The fund raised $400,000 {{in a few months}} from donations from throughout Canada, as well as Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, the latter who was {{on a tour of the}} country at the time.|$|E
5|$|Many Massachusetts {{residents}} of the time perceived the quake as punishment from God for immoral behavior. In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> earthquake, special prayer services were held and civic authorities declared fast days. A number of sermons and other writings were published as a consequence, including Jeremiah Newland's Verses Occasioned by the Earthquakes in the Month of November, 1755 and Thomas Prince's Earthquakes the Works of God and Tokens of his Just Displeasure. Not all explanations of the event were theological; John Winthrop, a Harvard professor, proposed an alternate explanation {{having to do with}} heat and chemical vapors inside the surface of the earth.|$|E

A number of taxi firms stopped work early in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> attack in fear of reprisals. In November 2001 Home Secretary David Blunkett banned all marches in Peterborough for three months as it was feared violence would be caused by the Anti-Nazi League and National Front who both sought to hold protests on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Power crews {{restored}} 75% of {{the power}} outages in the Eastern Shore of Maryland by {{two days after the}} hurricane struck, and by one week after the hurricane the power was restored completely to the Eastern Shore. Buildings in Washington, D.C., remained closed for two days after the hurricane. After the hurricane, several people in central and western Maryland were injured with three killed from carbon monoxide due to improperly running generators in their houses. Additionally, others were injured due to chain saws and cleaning up debris. In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> hurricane, the Calvert County Hospital reported an extra 130 patients per day.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{military}} {{conducted an}} intensive search for I-174 in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> {{attack in the}} mistaken belief {{that she had been}} significantly damaged. This search was not successful and highlighted the unsatisfactory communications between the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). However, another Japanese submarine passing through the area may have been sunk by RAAF aircraft. Because of Japan's deteriorating strategic situation, I-174 was the last Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) submarine to operate off the Australian east coast.|$|E
5|$|After Chataan {{affected}} Chuuk state, the island's {{residents were}} {{in need of}} food, clothes and medicine. Only a few crops were not destroyed by the storm; much of the breadfruit was stripped from the trees, and fruit not destroyed by the storm were damaged by parasites. In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> storm, the local Red Cross deployed about 100volunteers to search for victims buried by landslides. However, rescue operations were hampered by persistent flooding after the storm. Initially the death toll was unknown, and it was feared that hundreds of people had been killed. Six people who were seriously injured on Chuuk were flown to The Queen's Medical Center in Hawaii for treatment; they were initially scheduled to fly to Guam Memorial Hospital, but the facility was full. About 2,000residents affected by the storm evacuated to government-run shelters. The Red Cross shipped various relief supplies, including raincoats and water, to the affected areas. By July4, power systems were restored and the airport reopened. Although there was enough food in the immediate aftermath, the destruction of crops and cattle posed a long-term food shortage.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{members of}} Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni {{provided}} $2,500 {{to the town}} of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief. Soldiers also helped nearby residents and farmers to complete the rice harvest, after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines. The local government of Iwakunda distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses. Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country. Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled ¥58.8billion (US$53million), the tenth-highest for any natural disaster in the country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with ¥12.6billion (US$11.4million). The total was split between ¥49billion (US$44million) in housing claims and ¥7.9billion (US$71million) in car claims. The Japanese government provided food, water, and rescue workers to the affected areas in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> storm, along with Japan Post, the local post system; trucks were mobilized to affected towns, accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Fanele {{struck the}} country during a series of {{government}} protests, and consequently the national government provided little response to the storm. Instead, United Nations (UN) agencies quickly provided relief to affected citizens. The World Food Programme prepared 87metric tons (MT) of cereal and 13MT of various types of pulses. Five United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) trucks arrived in Morondova on January25 with various supplies. In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> storm, contaminated floodwaters resulted in cases of dysentery. To {{prevent the spread of}} disease, UNICEF provided vaccines, de-worming tablets, and water cleaning devices. Within three days of the storm's landfall, the agency also began distributing health kits and bed nets. As many schools were affected, UNICEF set up temporary classrooms in tents, while workers began fixing and cleaning the damaged buildings. Despite the quick response by the UN, thousands of people were left without aid. The Malagasy Red Cross deployed its volunteers to affected areas, although disrupted transportation services and the political situation hindered relief efforts.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> landing, {{the ground}} forces secured the Jacquinot Bay area. AIB {{personnel}} manned an outpost to warn {{of the approach}} of Japanese forces, while the combat troops patrolled and established positions near the main landing area. On 6 November the company from the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion was moved by landing craft to the northern shore of Jacquinot Bay, and subsequently guarded the tracks leading to this area. This unit later relieved the AIB of responsibility for maintaining some of its positions {{to the east of}} Jacquinot Bay. During this period the 14th/32nd Battalion remained near the landing area, though one of its companies gradually established an outpost between 8 and 12 November.|$|E
5|$|Following {{several weeks}} of air attacks and a short naval bombardment, {{soldiers}} of the Australian 24th Brigade were landed on Labuan from American and Australian ships on 10 June. The Australians quickly captured the island's harbour and main airfield. The greatly outnumbered Japanese garrison was mainly concentrated in a fortified position {{in the interior of}} Labuan, and offered little resistance to the landing. The initial Australian attempts to penetrate the Japanese position in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> invasion were not successful, and the area was subjected to a heavy bombardment. A Japanese raiding force also attempted to attack Allied positions on 21 June, but was defeated. Later that day, Australian forces assaulted the Japanese position. In the following days, Australian patrols killed or captured the remaining Japanese troops on the island. A total of 389 Japanese personnel were killed on Labuan and 11 were captured. Australian casualties included 34 killed.|$|E
