5|$|Elemental bismuth is denser in {{the liquid}} phase than the solid, a {{characteristic}} it shares with germanium, silicon, gallium and water. Bismuth expands 3.32% on solidification; <b>therefore,</b> <b>it</b> was long {{a component of}} low-melting typesetting alloys, where it compensated for the contraction of the other alloying components, to form almost isostatic bismuth-lead eutectic alloys.|$|E
5|$|For a fully {{secret trust}} to be valid, <b>therefore,</b> <b>it</b> must be proved that there was intention, that this was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee {{accepted}} his obligations. Intention {{is one of the}} three certainties, and applies to {{fully secret trust}}s {{in the same way as}} it does to other express trusts.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess {{certainly}} began a long American {{tradition of}} romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, {{who was only}} a child in Smith’s original accounts. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it</b> deserves recognition for inaugurating a genre, {{but it can be}} criticized for diminishing the potential richness of the subject matter.|$|E

5|$|The note {{appears to}} have {{originally}} been signed, but the name was torn off or burned off so that her body could not be identified. When the announcement was printed in the local newspaper, The Cambrian, <b>therefore,</b> <b>it</b> did not refer to Imlay specifically.|$|E
5|$|This {{follows from}} the fact that finding Hamiltonian cycles in maximal planar graphs is NP-complete. In a maximal planar graph, the book {{thickness}} is two if and only if a Hamiltonian cycle exists. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it</b> is also NP-complete to test whether the book thickness of a given maximal planar graph is two.|$|E

5|$|A strong upper-level trough {{moving through}} the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward, which also {{triggered}} the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated {{that it did not}} have the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it</b> is not considered to be a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275mi (445km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Although pure oxygen pre-breathing is an {{effective}} method to protect against altitude DCS, it is logistically complicated and expensive {{for the protection of}} civil aviation flyers, either commercial or private. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it</b> is currently used only by military flight crews and astronauts for protection during high-altitude and space operations. It is also used by flight test crews involved with certifying aircraft, and may also be used for high-altitude parachute jumps.|$|E

5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is not possible to know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; <b>therefore,</b> <b>it</b> is not possible to plan the shots as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E
5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka {{questioning}} {{the accuracy of the}} Buddhagosha's work. This is because of the changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. As indicated by the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but wished to be reborn in heaven. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it</b> is not advisable to follow these texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which has been written by Arhaths.|$|E
5|$|Congolese {{soldiers}} of the Force Publique were involved in fighting with Italian forces during the East African Campaign and were instrumental to forcing Italian forces out of Abyssinia, suffering 500 casualties. 13,000 Congolese troops served under British command in Nigeria. Detachments of Congolese soldiers also served in the Middle East and Burma. In total, the Force Publique comprised approximately 40,000 men and was racially segregated meaning that blacks could not become officers. Throughout the war, <b>therefore,</b> <b>it</b> was commanded by white officers.|$|E

50|$|There {{is another}} video which {{was added to}} VEVO that {{features}} the remix with Chipmunk. It {{is the same one}} but it completely cuts out Diggy Simmons and the intro. Chipmunk does not make an appearance, <b>therefore</b> <b>it's</b> edited with dancing scenes.|$|R
5|$|Elemental gallium is {{not found}} in nature, but it is easily {{obtained}} by smelting. Very pure gallium metal has a silvery color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass. Gallium liquid expands by 3.1% when it solidifies; <b>therefore,</b> <b>it</b> should not be stored in glass or metal containers because the container may rupture when the gallium changes state. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with {{a short list of}} other materials that includes water, silicon, germanium, antimony, bismuth, and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Empress Maud, {{the only}} {{legitimate}} living child of Henry I, landed in England in 1139 {{in an attempt}} to press her claim to the monarchy. She was soon besieged by King Stephen's forces at Arundel castle. Stephen allowed Maud a safe conduct to Bristol and provided her with an escort, which included William de Braose, suggesting that he was an adherent of King Stephen. William was present as a witness when three charters were issued by Stephen at Lewes dated to the years 1148–53, <b>therefore</b> <b>it</b> appears that he remained loyal to the king until the Treaty of Wallingford ended the hostilities.|$|E
5|$|In {{many social}} insect communities, sex is {{determined}} through haplodiploidy. Haploid male drones develop from unfertilized eggs while diploid females develop from fertilized eggs. Queens of a colony may mate {{with one or}} several drones. On average, a queen shares half of her genes with her sons, but only shares a quarter of her genes with the sons of fertile female workers. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it</b> is in the queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, and not the sons of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.|$|E

50|$|The Owsley County Fiscal Court {{purchased}} the sculpture and surrounding land in 2008 from Clyde and Dianna Combs. There are no signs informing would-be visitors of its actual location; <b>therefore,</b> <b>it's</b> {{difficult to find}} for any potential tourists who wish to visit the site.|$|R
50|$|Monk Reading the Scripture (和尚看經) is at Stronghold No.26 (兩六據點) in Siyin. Facing Jhongjhu Harbor (中柱港), {{the huge}} stone on the {{hillside}} stands erect, {{as if it were}} a monk, reading Tipitaka scripture, indifferent to the mundane matters. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it’s</b> called 'Monk Reading the Scripture'.|$|R
5|$|In some jurisdictions, asexuals have legal protections. While Brazil bans since 1999 {{whatever}} pathologization or attempted {{treatment of}} sexual orientation by mental health professionals through the national ethical code, the U.S. state of New York has labeled asexuals as a protected class. However, asexuality does not typically {{attract the attention of}} the public or major scrutiny; <b>therefore,</b> <b>it</b> has not been the subject of legislation as much as other sexual orientations have.|$|E
5|$|Melatonin is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which {{is the ability of}} a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it</b> has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} overall size and crest size also {{corresponds}} to age. Immature specimens are known from both females and males, and immature males often have small crests similar to adult females. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it</b> seems that the large crests only developed in males when they reached their large, adult size, making the sex of immature specimens difficult to establish from partial remains.|$|E
30|$|The {{agricultural}} commodity is {{a component of}} market economy. Its price is irreversibly influenced by other economic variables and exogenous variables including weather and price changes. This kind of change is definitely not a fluctuation around the mean value [31 – 33]. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>it’s</b> a reasonable hypothesis.|$|R
50|$|Chromite sand {{is a solid}} {{solution}} of spinels. Its advantages are a low percentage of silica, a very high fusion point (1850 C), and a very high thermal conductivity.
