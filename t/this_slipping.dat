40|$|The usual type of California {{earthquake}} {{is associated}} with a relative horizontal slipping of the two faces of a fault which lies essentially in a vertical plane. As a consequence of <b>this</b> <b>slipping,</b> the surface of the ground experiences a severe motion in the neighborhood of the fault during large earthquakes. This surface ground motion can be measured, and for the relatively small number of strong ground motions that have been recorded the maximum horizontal acceleration measured was 0. 33 of gravity. For obvious reasons the accumulation of data on strong ground motion is a slow process, so that it will be many years before a sufficiently large body of observations is amassed to give a reasonably complete picture of what can be expected in the way of destructive seismic motions. Analysis of the problem is rendered difficult {{by the fact that it}} is not possible to make direct observations of the mechanism that generates the seismic waves, for the usual California earthquake originates at a depth of approximately ten miles, although in some large earthquakes the slipping on the fault has extended to the surface of the ground...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Spondylolithesis {{is defined}} as forward {{slipping}} of a vertebral body on distal vertebra, and <b>this</b> <b>slipping</b> causes a spectrum of symptoms from mild back pain to overt spinal stenosis. The various treatment modality for spondylolisthesis is introduced. In general, the slip of lesser than 50 per cent can be successfully treated with in situ fusion in children and early adolescent without neurologic deficit. Operative reduction of spondylolisthesis may be indicated in cauda equina syndrome, progressive slip surpassing 40 to 50 per cent, major deformity causing decompensation or distress, major pain or deficit plus two or more risk factor. Risk factors for in situ fusion include the following: slip angle greater than 25 degrees, trapezoidal L 5, rounded sacral end plate, hyperlordosis exceeding 50 degrees L 2 -S 1, L 5 radiculopathy requiring decompression, female adolescents, excess lumbosacral mobility, sign of sacral root stretch. Stabilization after decompression of high grade isthmic spondylolisthesis is difficult due to insufficiency of fusion base, gap between the bases and incompetent anterior disc support. So posterior lumbar interbody fusion(PLIF) offered anterior support, reduction of the deformity and a broad fusion base may be applied. PLIF may be indicated in spinal stenosis with narrow neu-roforaminal space, isthmic spondylolisthesis with instability after removal of posterior structure of vertebra, grade 3, 4 isthmi...|$|E
40|$|In the Spanish Pyrenees, the Sant Corneli-Bóixols thrust-related {{anticline}} displays an outstandingly preserved growth strata sequence. These strata lie {{on top of}} a major unconformity exposed at the anticline's forelimb {{that divides}} and decouples a lower pre-folding unit from an upper syn-folding one. The former consists of steeply dipping to overturned strata with widespread bedding-parallel slip indicative of folding by flexural slip, whereas the syn-folding strata above define a 200  m amplitude fold. In the inner and outer sectors of the forelimb, both pre- and syn-folding strata are near vertical to overturned and the unconformity angle ranges from 10 to 30 °. In the central portion of the forelimb, syn-folding layers are gently dipping, whereas the angular unconformity is about 90 ° and the unconformity surface displays strong S–C shear structures, which provide a top-to-foreland slip sense. This sheared unconformity is offset by steeply dipping faults, which are at low angles to the underlying layers of the pre-folding unit. Strong shearing along the unconformity surface also occurred in the inner sector of the forelimb, with S–C structures providing an opposite, top-to-hinterland slip sense. Cross-cutting relationships and slip senses along the pre-folding bedding surfaces and the unconformity indicate that regardless of its orientation, layering in the pre- and syn-folding sequences of the Sant Corneli-Bóixols anticline were continuously slipped. <b>This</b> <b>slipping</b> promoted an intense stress deflection, with the maximum component of the stress tensor remaining at low angles to bedding during most of the folding process...|$|E

40|$|This is a text {{printed on}} paper. I have written it using a computer. You might read this text in re-digitalized form, as a PDF file. In this case, {{you see it}} as the image of the {{document}} it became; it exists as a picture of itself. The pages in a PDF-file are not tangible (Gittelman, Paper Knowledge 114 ff). However, if you are indeed reading this text in digital form, {{there will have to be}} some tangible thing making you see the image of this document. Some thing is functioning as an interface right now. Although I do not know exactly what this thing is, I know for certain that there is something here, slipping your mind as you read this text. This knowledge and <b>this</b> <b>slipping</b> away is what this thesis is about. This thesis aims to question the sustaining support of digital objects. I try to challenge the habitualization towards digital devices, the forgetting of the physical interface that leads to the supposition of digital immateriality, by making the com- puter apparent as an absurd thing that escapes language. Leaning on Heidegger’s »Question Concerning Technology« and Mel Bochner’s mural stating that »No Thought Exists Without a Sustaining Support«, I seek to position myself among these strange and aloof digital things and their effects. I attempt to encircle the ungraspable realm of the computer’s black box by explicating its formal material (Kirschenbaum), which results from the fundamentally irresolvable tension between the metaphysical idea of the Turing machine and the worldly stuff that embodies and performs it. First, I approach this stuff through language. I introduce three metaphors to compare the computer to other worldly things: ruins (considering the existence of the machine, its resting body, and the expectations and promises it entails), vessels (thinking about its function), and windows (reflecting the notion of digital transparency and contingency). Then, I verbally enter the computer, contemplating how its mechanism depends on an act of inscription, a physical in-formation of material, and how its effects can therefore also be understood as writing, as embodied information. However as computing has become ubiquitous, seamless and powerful enough to super- sede the speed of thinking (Kittler S), it has become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to phenomenologically grasp any friction resulting from this embodiment in the workings of the machines as they operate. In my practice, I physically grapple with this highly evasive body of digital media. Building on the metaphors and terminology I establish, and looking for comparisons between Bochner’s post-conceptual sensibility and post-digital ideas, I aim to evoke the things on which I rely but that lie outside of language: I attempt 3 4 blank with a knowing futility to (re-) insert myself in the processes of digital translation. I slow the effects of the computer down, I empty out its already silent interfaces, aiming to re-present it. I constellate and associate pieces of work, suggesting a grammar rather than a narrative, in order to listen to the »language of things« (Benjamin) ...|$|E
40|$|According to Norwegian law it is {{forbidden}} to discard dead or dying fish. With recent {{new information about}} mortality of pelagic fish species that have been crowded and released from purse seines, the Norwegian authorities have introduced new regulations for “slipping” (i. e. release of catch from purse seines while the fish {{is still in the}} water) in late phases of hauling a seine. The main objective of this project has been to develop technologies and methods that reduce the extent of unaccounted mortality after crowding and slipping in purse seine fisheries for mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and herring (Clupea harengus). The project has been guided by a combined steering and reference committee consisting of active purse seine fishermen, personnel from the fishing gear industry and from fisheries management, who have had the mandate to prioritize research tasks within the frames identified by the project plan. According to recommendations from the steering committee the work has focused on the following two main research areas: 1) To develop methods and equipment for identification of species and catch quality/size in a seine during hauling. The aim was to give the skipper tools to decide whether a catch should be slipped or kept at a stage of hauling where the fish is still viable if released. 2) to develop methods, equipment and procedures for lenient catch regulation from a seine set, with as little stress, physiological load and damage to released fish as possible. The aim was to give the skipper methods and equipment for releasing catch in a responsible manner if slipping is necessary. It is also a goal that the slipping procedure may be approved as a standard method by the authorities. Initially we tried to develop sampling methods based on permanent installations in the net and devices attached to it (i. e. bags built into the net walls and maneuverable landing nets), but with limited success. More successful is the development of a small sampling trawl that is shot into the seine with a line-thrower during net hauling, which was towed back to the vessel by using a small power block. This method showed a promising potential for use as a handy tool for catch identification, and it has now been developed to a stage where it can be tested by the fishing fleet at a commercial level. UV camera systems {{to be used as a}} tool for observing the seine net and the fish inside the net for scientific purposes have also been developed and tested. These systems may also in the future be further developed to commercial products for catch identification, but this has still a long way to go before it reaches a commercial level. Much effort has been put into developing lenient slipping methods, based on technologies traditionally used by seine fishermen for live storage of pelagic fish. One key feature of a responsible slipping technique is that the net can be rapidly opened to make an escape route that is wide enough for the fish to swim freely out of the net. It is also important that it gives the fishermen the opportunity to shut the net when the desired amount has been released. This project has shown that by minor adjustments to components of the bunt (end section) of the seine, this goal may be achieved. <b>This</b> <b>slipping</b> system has the potential to be further refined into a standardized slipping method that may be accepted both by the authorities and the fishing fleet. The costs of adapting existing seines to the new method are low. The most expensive part will be connected to installing an extra winch for handling the opening ropes, if necessary. Further work on standardizing slipping technology is now being planned...|$|E
