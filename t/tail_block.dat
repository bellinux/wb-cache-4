Docking is done almost exclusively on draft horses and hitches. Unique to the Anglo-Saxon world, nickering is the sectioning of the tail muscles, which has the effect of raising the tail. The animal must wear a [...] "tail set" [...] device after the operation to complete the process of muscle atrophy. This device is unpleasant and prevents the horse from going outside. <b>Tail</b> <b>blocking</b> is done by injection of alcohol into the nerve that controls the movement of this appendage, preventing the horse from moving its tail.

Magnetite nanoparticles display strong ferrimagnetic behavior and are less sensitive to oxidation than magnetic transition metal nanoparticles such as cobalt, iron, and nickel. For in vivo applications, well-defined organic coatings are needed to surround the magnetite nanoparticles and prevent any aggregation. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop complexes of magnetite nanoparticles coated with well-defined hydrophilic polymers so that they could be dispersed in aqueous fluids. Focal points have included the following:[*] (1) Investigations of polymer systems that bind irreversibly to magnetite at the physiological pH, (2) the design of block copolymers with anchor and <b>tail</b> <b>blocks</b> to enable dispersion in biological fluids, and (3) investigations of copolymer block lengths to maximize the concentration of bound magnetite. Hydrophilic triblock copolymers with controlled concentrations of pendent carboxylic acid binding groups were designed as steric stabilizers for magnetite nanoparticles. These copolymers were comprised of controlled molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) <b>tail</b> <b>blocks</b> and a central, polyurethane anchor block containing carboxylic acids. Stoichiometric aqueous solutions of FeCl 2 and FeCl 3 were condensed by reaction with NH 4 OH to form magnetite nanoparticles, and then a dichloromethane solution of the block copolymer was added to adsorb the copolymer onto the magnetite surfaces. Stable magnetite dispersions were prepared with all of the triblock copolymers. The polymer−nanomagnetite conjugates described in this paper had a maximum saturation magnetization of 34 emu/g. Magnetization curves showed minimal hysteresis. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) confirmed the magnetite crystal structure.

50|$|High lead logging is {{a method}} of cable logging using a spar, yarder and loader. It was {{developed}} by Oscar Wirkkala. It is accomplished with two lines (cables) and two winches (or cable drums).

Butt rigging is installed where the two lines join and the logs are hooked to the butt rigging with chokers. The procedure is to wind up the main line and the logs are pulled in, wind up the haulback and the butt rigging is pulled out for more logs or another 'turn'.|$|E

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of several}} homopolymer polypeptides on α-Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 particles and surfaces was investigated to identify possible anchor and tail blocks for brush-forming block copolypeptides. Poly-L-(glutamic acid) (GLU) and poly-L-(aspartic acid) (ASP) {{were found to}} adsorb on positively charged and nearly neutral Al 2 O 3, while the GLU did not adsorb on negatively charged SiO 2. Poly-L-proline (PRO) adsorbed only slightly on the alumina, but showed high affinity adsorption on silica. These results are useful in designing a brush forming block copolymer with the GLU acting as the anchor block and the PRO as the <b>tail</b> <b>block.</b> An important finding in this work is that these unstructured polypeptides, or proteins that only have primary and secondary structure, have adsorption behavior {{that is similar to}} that of synthetic polymers.

How motor protein activity is controlled in cells is unresolved, but it is likely coupled to changes in protein conformation and cargo association. By applying the quantitative method fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) stoichiometry to fluorescent protein (FP) –labeled kinesin heavy chain (KHC) and kinesin light chain (KLC) subunits in live cells, we studied the overall structural organization and conformation of Kinesin- 1 in the active and inactive states. Inactive Kinesin- 1 molecules are folded and autoinhibited such that the KHC <b>tail</b> <b>blocks</b> the initial interaction of the KHC motor with the microtubule. In addition, in the inactive state, the KHC motor domains are pushed apart by the KLC subunit. Thus, FRET stoichiometry reveals conformational changes of a protein complex in live cells.

40|$|Microphase-separated morphologies of {{side-chain}} {{liquid crystal}} (LC) diblock copolymers {{have been examined}} as substrate-supported thin films. The film thicknesses ranged from 0. 5 to 10 times the block copolymer period (L). These novel materials are of interest because they exhibit self-oriented electro-optical properties in the bulk state, and may exhibit interesting field dependent nanometer-scale ordering as thin films. A primary challenge in taking advantage of these properties involves the fundamental understanding {{and control of the}} nano-domain morphology, which is strongly affected by the substrate, block copolymer properties, and LC alignment within the domains. In these studies, an amorphous side-chain LC diblock polymer system has been synthesized containing a side-chain mesogen with a chiral alkyl end. Experiments were conducted using Atomic Force Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and X-ray Specular Reflectometry, to determine the complex surface morphology. Contact angle measurements and angle-resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometry were also conducted to determine LC orientation at different interfaces. From this information, final models of complex morphologies were derived for different block copolymer compositions, including lamellar, cylindrical, and new smectic-bilayered morphologies. To better understand the ordering of the LC mesogen at different interfaces, LC homopolymer films were studied. LC anchoring was planar at the substrate, but homeotropic at the air interface due to exposure of the non-polar mesogen <b>tail.</b> <b>Block</b> copolymer thin films were then examined for compositions ranging from 40 % to 85 % weight fraction of the LC block. (cont.) Due to the wetting properties of the LC diblock copolymer, novel LC terraces were observed on the top surfaces corresponding to single smectic layer spacing. For diblock thin films, both blocks coexist at the air surfaces to form a mixed surface. Hybrid morphologies, consisting of both symmetrical and anti-symmetrical wettings, were noted for the lamellar morphology with film thicknesses between 0. 5 and 1. 5 Lo. The surface properties are determined by LC orientation, which depends on the film thickness. Homeotropic anchoring of the smectic LC mesogens at the air interface was observed in both the homopolymer and the block copolymers, resulting in smectic terraces on the top surfaces of the films. In thicker films, when the influence of the substrate was decreased, the lamellar orientation was found to undergo a transition from parallel stacking near the substrate to perpendicular arrangement at the air surface. Effects of annealing and solvent exposure on the resulting thin-film behavior were also addressed. by Jung-Sheng Wu. Thesis (Ph. D.)

50|$|Polymers on the {{surfaces}} of the colloidal fraction of soils promote steric stabilization of those particles by preventing them from approaching each other and aggregating. This effect is seen {{in a variety of}} aqueous and nonaqueous environments, and is not affected by electrolytes in solution. The degree of steric stabilization depends on the amount of clay surface covered by adsorbed polymers, the strength of the polymer bond, the thickness of the polymer layer, and the favorability of the solvent for the polymer loops and <b>tails.</b> <b>Block</b> and graft copolymers, made up of two different homopolymers with differing solubilities in the suspension medium, are most often used for steric stabilization. When synthesized to have alternating regions of hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers, copolymers can stabilize the suspension because their hydrophobic group adsorbs strongly to the colloid surface while the hydrophilic group is attracted to the solvent. In general, the adsorption of polymers to clay surfaces is entropically favored because one polymer molecule displaces many water molecules which were previously bound to the soil particle.|$|R

40|$|Biological {{responses}} to mechanical stress require strain-sensing molecules, whose mechanically induced conformational changes are relayed to signaling cascades mediating changes in cell and tissue properties. In vertebrate muscle, the giant elastic protein titin {{is involved in}} strain sensing via its C-terminal kinase domain (TK) at the sarcomeric M-band and contributes to the adaptation of muscle in response to changes in mechanical strain. TK is regulated in a unique dual autoinhibition mechanism by a C-terminal regulatory <b>tail,</b> <b>blocking</b> the ATP binding site, and tyrosine autoinhibition of the catalytic base. For access to the ATP binding site and phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory tyrosine, the C-terminal autoinhibitory tail needs to be removed. Here, we use AFM-based single-molecule force spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and enzymatics to study the conformational changes during strain-induced activation of human TK. We show that mechanical strain activates ATP binding before unfolding of the structural titin domains, and that TK can thus act as a biological force sensor. Furthermore, we identify the steps in which the autoinhibition of TK is mechanically relieved at low forces, leading to binding of the cosubstrate ATP and priming the enzyme for subsequent autophosphorylation and substrate turnover...|$|R
40|$|The {{most severe}} form of malaria in humans {{is caused by}} the {{protozoan}} parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The invasive form of malaria parasites is termed a merozoite and it employs an array of parasite proteins that bind to the host cell to mediate invasion. In Plasmodium falciparum, the erythrocyte binding-like (EBL) and reticulocyte binding-like (Rh) protein families are responsible for binding to specific erythrocyte receptors for invasion and mediating signalling events that initiate active entry of the malaria parasite. Here we have addressed the role of the cytoplasmic tails of these proteins in activating merozoite invasion after receptor engagement. We show that the cytoplasmic domains of these type 1 membrane proteins are phosphorylated in vitro. Depletion of PfCK 2, a kinase implicated to phosphorylate these cytoplasmic <b>tails,</b> <b>blocks</b> P. falciparum invasion of red blood cells.

40|$|Novel {{hydrophilic}} triblock copolymers {{which form}} micelles {{in aqueous solution}} were studied by static and dynamic light scattering (SLS and DLS), small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and densitometry. The polymers were symmetric A–B–A block copolymers having two poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) <b>tail</b> <b>blocks</b> and a polyurethane (PU) center segment that contained pendant carboxylic acids. The aggregation number of the micelles decreased with increasing PEO mass content. When attempting to fit the SANS data {{it was found that}} no single model was suitable over the entire range of block lengths and PEO mass concentrations investigated here. For the polymer with the highest aggregation number, the data were fitted with a triblock model consisting of a homogeneous core with a corona of non-interacting Gaussian chains for which only two free parameters were required: the radius of the core and the radius of gyration of the corona. In this case, the core was found to be effectively dry. At lower aggregation numbers, a star polymer model generated significantly better fits, suggesting the absence of any identifiable central core structure. Good agreement was found between the sizes measured by DLS, SANS and theoretical predictions of micelle size from a density distribution theory. These results show that when significant changes in aggregation number occur, the nanostructure of the micelle can change substantially even for polymers that are remarkably similar. © 2010, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

In order to replicate in endothelial cells pathogenic hantaviruses inhibit the early induction of beta interferon (IFN-β). Expression of the cytoplasmic {{tail of the}} pathogenic NY- 1 hantavirus Gn protein is sufficient to inhibit RIG-I- and TBK 1 -directed IFN responses. The formation of TBK 1 -TRAF 3 complexes directs IRF- 3 phosphorylation, and both IRF- 3 and NF-κB activation are required for transcription from the IFN-β promoter. Here we report that the NY- 1 virus (NY- 1 V) Gn tail inhibits both TBK 1 -directed NF-κB activation and TBK 1 -directed transcription from promoters containing IFN-stimulated response elements. The NY- 1 V Gn tail coprecipitated TRAF 3 from cellular lysates, and analysis of TRAF 3 deletion mutants demonstrated that the TRAF 3 N terminus is sufficient for interacting with the NY- 1 V Gn tail. In contrast, the Gn tail of the nonpathogenic hantavirus Prospect Hill virus (PHV) failed to coprecipitate TRAF 3 or inhibit NF-κB or IFN-β transcriptional responses.

But, in a dice game, Pandavas lost their Kingdom and were exiled for a 12-year term and in the 13th year must remain in hiding (with a rider that if they were detected during this period they would undergo the exile denovo). Mythological legend states that during the Pandavas' exile (imposed by their cousin Duryodhana of the Kaurava dynasty), in order to subdue Bhima’s (second of the five Pandava brothers) arrogance, Hanuman considered to be the brother of Bhima (both Vayu's children, appeared in the forest disguised as a weak and aged monkey.

We identified a novel basic protein motif consisting of a cluster of three dibasic residues (356 RR 357, 359 KK 360, and 362 KK 363) in the membrane-proximal domain of the L-selectin tail {{as well as a}} doublet of aspartic acid residues (369 DD 370) in the membrane-distal end of the L-selectin tail involved in mu 1 A binding. Stimulation of Raw 264. 7 macrophages with PMA augmented the amount of mu 1 A associated with anti-L-selectin immunoprecipitates. However, fulllength GST-mu 1 A did not bind to the phospho-L-selectin tail or phospho-mimetic S 364 D L-selectin tail.

Molecular docking of the L-selectin tail to mu 1 A was used to identify the mu 1 A surface domain binding the L-selectin tail and to explain how phosphorylation of the L-selectin tail abrogates mu 1 A interaction.

Antibodies against the electroeluted protein and a peptide representing the 20 amino terminal residues bind specifically on immunoblots to the 43 -kD protein and to the major products arising from proteolysis during isolation. By immunocytochemistry, the protein is found in ventricle and atrium in patterns consistent with the known distribution of {{gap junction}}s. Both antibodies bind exclusively to gap junctions in fractions from heart examined by EM after gold labeling. Since only domains of the protein exposed at the cytoplasmic surface should be accessible to antibody, we conclude that the 43 -kD protein is assembled in gap junctions with the amino terminus of the molecule exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the bilayer, that is, {{on the same side}} as the carboxy terminus as determined previously. By combining proteolysis experiments with data from immunoblotting, we can identify a third cytoplasmic region, a loop of some 4 kD between membrane protected domains. This loop carries an antibody binding site. The protein, if transmembrane, is therefore likely to cross the membrane four times. We have used the same antisera to ascertain if the 43 -kD protein is involved in cell-cell communication. The antiserum against the amino terminus blocked dye coupling in 90 % of cell pairs tested; the antiserum recognizing epitopes in the cytoplasmic loop and cytoplasmic <b>tail</b> <b>blocked</b> coupling in 75 % of cell pairs tested. Preimmune serum and control antibodies (one against MIP and another binding to a cardiac G protein) had no or little effect on dye transfer. Our experimental evidence thus indicates that, in spite of the differences in amino acid sequence, the gap junction proteins in heart and liver share a general organizational plan and that there may be several domains (including the amino terminus) of the molecule that are involved in the control of junctional permeability...|$|R
