25|$|Psychoanalysts {{diagnose}} uncertainty as {{the dominant}} attitude {{to life in the}} postmodern society. This uncertainty can be caused by the pressure which is executed from the society to the humans. It is the uncertainty to fail, but also the fear of their own limits, not to achieve something what the society expects, and especially the desire for recognition in all areas of life. In today's society we are in a permanent competition. Appearance, occupation, education of the children - everything is compared to a media staged ideal. Everything should be perfect, because this deep-rooted aversion to all average, the pathological pursuit to excellence - these are old traditions. Who ever wants more - on the job, from the partner, from the children, from themselves - will one day be burned out and empty inside. He is then faced with the realization that perfection does not exist. Who is nowadays empty inside and burned out, is in the common language a Burnout. But due to the definitional problems Burnout is till this date not a recognized illness. An attempt to define this concept more closely, can be: a condition that gets only the passionate, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> not a mental illness but only a grave exhaustion (but can lead to numerous sick days). It can benefit the term that it is a disease model which is socially acceptable and also, to some extent, the individual self-esteem stabilizing. This finding in turn facilitates many undetected depressed people, the way to a qualified treatment. According to experts in the field, in addition to the ultra hard-working and the idealists mainly the perfectionist, the loner, the grim and the thin-skinned are especially endangered of a burnout. All together they usually have a lack of a healthy distance to work.|$|E

500|$|Called {{the other}} album {{masterpiece}} (along with Cyprus Avenue), [...] "Madame George" [...] is almost ten minutes long and {{tells of the}} mysterious madame [...] "in a corner playing dominoes in drag", among other things. It also has a setting of Cyprus Avenue in Belfast with impressionistic lyrics that give stream-of-conscious details that are seemingly unrelated. Erik Hage describes {{the effect of the}} sensory experience of the lyrics, the instrumentation and Morrison's impassioned vocals on the listener and the album as being [...] "like some kind of twilight state between sleeping and wakefulness", engaging the listener to project themselves into the spell of the song. Rolling Stones album reviewer wrote: [...] "The crowning touch is 'Madame George', a cryptic character study {{that may or may not}} be about an aging transvestite but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> as heartbreaking a reverie as you will find in pop music." [...] Morrison has denied that the song is about a transvestite, as others, including Lester Bangs, have believed. The original title of the song is [...] "Madame Joy" [...] and Morrison later changed the title although he actually sings the words [...] "Madame Joy" [...] in the song. An earlier recording for Bang Records with slightly altered lyrics, backing singers, a much swifter tempo and a [...] "bizarrely inappropriate party atmosphere" [...] changes the tone considerably from the Astral Weeks recording.|$|E

[...] "He has a way of letting the ball hit the bat <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> not impressive to the eye.

Still, MDK2: Armageddon is a solid shooter with plenty of ingenuity and slick presentation." [...] Nintendo World Report's Jared Rosenberg called the Wii version [...] "a well-designed action platformer that will take {{quite a bit of}} time to get through. Varied play mechanics keep the shooter fresh and the humorous story should occasionally put a smile on your face. It can be challenging and at times frustrating, but overall, it is a fun romp."

2500|$|Charles Oliver {{writes the}} novel shows a central Hemingway theme of [...] "maintaining control over one's life, {{even in the}} face of terrible odds." [...] Cantwell knows he is dying and faces death [...] "with the dignity which he {{believes}} he has maintained throughout his military service." [...] Oliver thinks the two male characters, Cantwell and Alvarito, have an unstated understanding – both men love Renata, but Cantwell accepts and is happy to know Renata will almost certainly marry Alvarito. Within hours of dying he says to himself: [...] "You have said goodbye to your girl and she has said goodbye to you. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> simple". The theme of death is central in Hemingway's writings and his characters routinely achieve redemption at the moment of death, which can be seen as a form of existentialism. Jean-Paul Sartre believed to face death well is to live a heightened existence.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they can really do. [...] They are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class [...] that is more advantageous to for them. [...] In testing and classification they don't show what they can really do. [...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{at least}} one case, Chang Wang, the {{president}} of Acu-Gen, has phoned a pregnant woman one month after giving her the sex prediction to inform her that her test indicated an [...] "excess of genetic material in her blood" [...] and advised her to see her doctor in order [...] "to rule out problems like Down's syndrome or Trisomy 18". Wang explains this means [...] "with a certain possibility, that her fetus {{has a kind of}} genetic problem. Of course later on, we had used our technology to prove that she has a chromosome problem: Trisomy 18. That means that this baby [...] going to have a developmental problem and is going to probably cease to exist right after the birth." [...] Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts disputes the possibility of the test being used for such a diagnosis. She says, [...] "The test involves looking at genetic sequences on the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. If he gave a diagnosis of Trisomy 18, that involves a different chromosome, Chromosome 18. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> something that is not advertised in the packaging associated with the test. [...] "It is possible that, upon being told of a problem by Acu-Gen, a woman may seek to have an amniocentesis or other invasive procedure which may be an unnecessary risk if the Acu-Gen diagnosis was in error. In this case, the woman delivered a healthy baby free from both Trisomy 18 and Down syndrome.|$|E

2500|$|More than a {{half century}} ago, Mario Bauzá {{developed}} arranging in-clave to a high art. Another name for clave is guide-pattern, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> how Bauzá related to it. Bauzá taught Tito Puente, and Puente's arrangers in turn, learned from him. The techniques were passed down {{from one generation to}} the next. It's worth noting that many of the highly educated, new generation of Cuban musicians reject the idea of 3-2/2-3 clave. Both the clave genius Dafnis Prieto, and Alain Pérez, an important innovator in timba and Cuban jazz, reject the concept. Many of the younger musicians even reject the fundamental concept of [...] "clave rules." [...] Pérez states: [...] "I just don't treat the clave as a study or a profound analysis conceived around where it overlaps and where it comes in. I didn't learn it in that way" [...] (2002: web). New York-based Bobby Sanabria laments the pervasiveness of this attitude in Cuba: [...] "The lack of clave consciousness in Cuba is starting to be felt more and more where the rhythmic equilibrium established by the clave direction is being sacrificed due to lack of knowledge in how to work with it from an arranging standpoint by young arrangers especially in the timba movement" [...] (2010: 251). Perhaps Juan Formell, founder of Los Van Van, summed up this contemporary Cuban clave attitude best when he said: [...] "We Cubans like to think we have clave license [...] [...] [...] and we don't feel obsessed about the clave as many others do" [...] (1999: 16). There is currently a [...] "clave schism" [...] between these two schools of thought.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, CBS News {{broadcast}} a 60 Minutes {{critique of the}} doctrinal assessment, and interview of Farrell and Sartain. Sartain described his role as follows: [...] "In {{the context of the}} Church, we're always going to have the concern about being faithful to Christ. And all I can say to you [...] is I don't have any doubt about the reason why the Holy Father has asked me to do this, which is his genuine love and concern for religious women." [...] On the other hand, Farrell noted that there is disagreement over the meaning of vows of obedience for nuns: [...] "Well I think there is one of the areas of misunderstanding and difference. Our first obedience is to God. What we obey is God and God's call to us as expressed in so many different sources, it's not just the teaching authority of the Church, although <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> a legitimate part of it." [...] "We have never wanted the men to tell us what to do." [...] She added that the motivation of the inquisition by men in the Vatican appeared to be motivated by their fears rather than the love and concern Sartain cited. Farrell commented: [...] "I don't know, but it feels to me like fear. What would happen if women really were given a place of equality in the Church?" [...] The Holy See says [...] "good works aren't the issue, its annual meetings" [...] are the issue. [...] "It doesn't make sense," [...] Sartain reasoned about the speakers selected by the LCWR, [...] "that a conference of Women Religious would want to give a platform to somebody who would espouse ideas antithetical to what the Church teaches." ...|$|E
