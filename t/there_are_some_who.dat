5|$|The {{effects of}} the drug begin 10–40minutes after ingestion, and last 2–6hours {{depending}} on dose, species, and individual metabolism. The half life of psilocybin is 163±64minutes when taken orally, or 74.1±19.6minutes when injected intravenously. A dosage of 4–10mg, corresponding roughly to 50–300micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg) of body weight, is required to induce psychedelic effects. A typical recreational dosage is 10–50mg psilocybin, which is roughly equivalent to 10–50grams of fresh mushrooms, or 1–5grams of dried mushrooms. A {{small number of people}} are unusually sensitive to psilocybin, such that a normally threshold-level dose of about 2mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses. In contrast, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> require relatively high doses to experience noticeable effects. Individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large role in determining a person's response to psilocybin.|$|E

25|$|They {{say that}} Tartessus is a {{river in the}} land of the Iberians, running down into the sea by two mouths and that between these two mouths lies a city of the same name. The river, which is the largest in Iberia and tidal, those of a later day called Baetis and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> think that Tartessus was the ancient name of Carpia, a city of the Iberians.|$|E

An 'old line' department, USDA {{was one of}} the last federal {{agencies}} to integrate and perhaps the last to include women and minorities in leadership positions. Considered a stubborn bureaucracy and slow to change, USDA is also perceived as playing a key role in what some see as a conspiracy to force minority and socially disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{four and a half}} million {{citizens}} of Lebanon proper, there is a sizeable Lebanese diaspora. There are more Lebanese people living outside of Lebanon (8.6-14 million), than within (4.3 million). The majority of the diaspora population consists of Lebanese Christians; however, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> are Muslim. They trace their origin to several waves of Christian emigration, starting with the exodus that followed the 1860 Lebanon conflict in Ottoman Syria.|$|E
25|$|Wajib As-salat are compulsory, {{non-performance}} {{of which}} renders one a sinner. However, {{the evidence of}} the obligation is open to interpretation, with some of the madhab saying it is obligatory while others saying it is optional. To deny that a fard salah is obligatory is an act of disbelief while denying the obligation of a wajib salat is not disbelief. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> believe that as the 5 prayers are obligatory, it automatically renders all other prayers optional.|$|E

I just struggled with it myself for a long time but I came to realize: Life is that gift from God that I think even if life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.|$|E
25|$|The first {{map that}} showed Saint Pierre and Miquelon was the Mappa mundi of 1500 created by Juan de la Cosa, {{where they were}} {{labelled}} 'Illa de la Trenidat'. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> argue that the 'Green Islands' encountered during the two pre-1472 Portuguese expeditions under João Vaz Corte-Real and the 1501 Portuguese expedition under his son Gaspar Corte-Real were St. Pierre and the islands near it. A map drawn by Johannes Ruysch published in 1507 depicts Miquelon, St. Pierre and the surrounding islands, and labelled as Barbatos.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{year of the}} buildings' construction, {{as well as the}} {{architect}} responsible are subject to some debate. The architects generally credited with Colonnade Row's design is Alexander Jackson Davis, Ithiel Town, and James Dakin, who were believed to have designed the homes for the Astor and Vanderbilt families. Town and Dakin are believed to have begun work on the project, which they called LaGrange Terrace, during the winter of 1831–32, during which they worked on a number of design projects. Davis is not believed to {{have played a role in}} the final construction of the building, which was completed in 1833 according to the Landmarks Commission, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> believe that he did not work on the design at all.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian Charter {{has little}} to say, {{explicitly}} at least, about economic and social rights. On this point, it stands in marked contrast with the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> feel economic rights ought to be read into section 7 rights to security of the person and section 15 equality rights to make the Charter similar to the Covenant. The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent standard of living and can help the civil rights flourish in a livable environment. Canadian courts, however, have been hesitant in this area, stating that economic rights are political questions and adding that as positive rights, economic rights are of questionable legitimacy.|$|E
500|$|Although the flitch {{ceremony}} at Dunmow is generally held to have originated with the Fitzwalters in the 13th century <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> would date it to earlier Norman or Saxon times, one suggested date being 1104, {{the founding of}} the Little Dunmow Priory. [...] This is partly because the flitch of Dunmow seems to have already been common knowledge in very early works such as the prologue to Chaucer's [...] "Wife of Bath" [...] and also in the Visions of Pierce Plowman by William Langland. [...] Some would also read passages in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as alluding to the Dunmow flitch.|$|E
500|$|Black also {{tended to}} favor law and order over civil rights activism. This led him to read the Civil Rights Act narrowly. For example, he dissented in a case {{reversing}} convictions of sit-in protesters, arguing to limit {{the scope of the}} Civil Rights Act. In 1968 he said, “Unfortunately <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> think that Negroes should have special privileges under the law.” Black felt that actions like protesting, singing, or marching for [...] "good causes" [...] one day could lead to supporting evil causes later on; his sister-in-law explained that Black was [...] "mortally afraid" [...] of protesters. Black opposed the actions of some civil rights and Vietnam War protesters and believed that legislatures first, and courts second, should be responsible for alleviating social wrongs. Black once said he was [...] "vigorously opposed to efforts to extend the First Amendment's freedom of speech beyond speech," [...] to conduct.|$|E

500|$|Several {{writers and}} sports personalities {{consider}} this Sewanee team {{one of the}} greatest football teams ever to play. Former Penn State coach Joe Paterno once said: [...] "While <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> would swear to the contrary, I did not see the 1899 Sewanee football team play in person. Winning five road games in six days, all by shutout scores, has {{to be one of the}} most staggering achievements in the history of the sport. If the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) had been in effect in 1899, there seems little doubt Sewanee would have played in the title game. And they wouldn’t have been done in by any computer ratings." [...] Tony Barnhart in Southern Fried Football: The History, Passion and Glory of the Great Southern Game listed Sewanee as his number 1 Southern football team of all-time. A 16-team playoff to determine the best team in college football history with winners decided by fan votes was run by the College Football Hall of Fame, called the March of the Gridiron Champions. Sewanee, starting at the lowest seed, won the tournament.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{well-documented}} later hieroglyphs known as [...] "Epi-Olmec", and while <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> believe that Epi-Olmec {{may represent a}} transitional script between an earlier Olmec writing system and Mayan writing, the matter remains unsettled.|$|E

2500|$|The Arithmetica is {{the major}} work of Diophantus and the most {{prominent}} work on algebra in Greek mathematics.

2500|$|In {{the modern}} game, the Sri Lankan pace bowler Lasith Malinga {{has a very}} {{distinctive}} action which is authentic roundarm. This has earned him the name [...] "Slinga Malinga". <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>who</b> question the legality of this action, but it is legal, because his arm does not straighten from a bent position as he bowls. This is the strict definition of bowling vis-à-vis throwing. In fact, many bowlers bowl with a slightly bent arm; {{the key is that}} they do not straighten it as they bowl.|$|E
