It is thought to have previously been a white dwarf that, {{as a result of a}} very late thermal pulse, swelled and became a red giant.

25|$|When {{the plasma}} {{rises from the}} foot points towards the loop top, as always occurs during the initial phase of a compact flare, it is defined as chromospheric evaporation. When the plasma rapidly cools and falls toward the photosphere, it is called chromospheric condensation. There may also be {{symmetric}} flow from both loop foot points, causing a build-up of mass in the loop structure. The plasma may cool rapidly in this region (for a <b>thermal</b> <b>instability),</b> its dark filaments obvious against the solar disk or prominences off the Sun's limb.|$|E
25|$|Prior to HPLC {{scientists}} used standard liquid chromatographic techniques.

GC was ineffective for many biochemists because of the <b>thermal</b> <b>instability</b> of the solutes. As a result, alternative methods were hypothesized which would soon result in the development of HPLC.|$|E

40|$|Reactor {{fuel rod}} surface {{area that is}} {{perpendicular}} to coolant flow direction (+S) i. e. perpendicular to the P creates areas of coolant stagnation leading to increased coolant temperatures resulting in localized changes in fluid properties. Changes in coolant fluid properties caused by minor increases in temperature lead to localized reductions in coolant mass flow rates leading to localized <b>thermal</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Reductions in coolant mass flow rates result in further increases in local temperatures exacerbating changes to coolant fluid properties leading to localized thermal runaway. Unchecked localized thermal runaway leads to localized fuel melting.

40|$|Preferential {{heat and}} mass {{transfer}} induces diffusive <b>thermal</b> <b>instabilities</b> in premixed laminar flames.

We investigate the properties of such instabilities in C 4 H 10 -C 3 H 8 /air flames. The adiabatic burning velocity of the laminar premixed flame was measured at different equivalence ratios while exhibiting cellular instabilities. Direct photographs have been captured to qualitatively asses the effect of burner plate temperature on the cellular structure of the flame.

2500|$|Speculation on {{silicon hydride}} {{chemistry}} started from the 1830s, contemporary {{with the development}} of synthetic organic chemistry. Silane itself, as well as trichlorosilane, were first synthesised by Friedrich Wöhler and Heinrich Buff in 1857 by reacting aluminium–silicon alloys with hydrochloric acid, and characterised as SiH4 and SiHCl3 by Charles Friedel and Albert Ladenburg in 1867. Disilane (Si2H6) followed in 1902, when it was first made by Henri Moissan and Samuel Smiles by the protonolysis of magnesium silicides. Further investigation had to wait until 1916 because of the great reactivity and <b>thermal</b> <b>instability</b> of the silanes; it was then that Alfred Stock began the study of silicon hydrides in earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques, as they were found as contaminants of his focus, the boron hydrides. The names silanes and boranes are due to him, based on analogy with the alkanes. Moissan and Smiles' method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via [...] protonolysis of metal silicides is still used, although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of the products that occurs simultaneously, and thus the preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride in etheric solutions at low temperatures. Direct reaction of HX or RX with silicon, possibly with a catalyst such as copper, is also a viable method to produce substituted silanes.|$|E

40|$|The time {{a nucleus}} needs to {{populate}} its deformation space is ruled by dissipation, that is, {{the transfer of}} energy between intrinsic and collective degrees of freedom. The study of fission allows for gaining information {{on the strength of}} dissipation within a broad range of deformation.

50|$|Pyrolysis oil, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as biocrude or biooil, is a synthetic fuel under investigation as substitute for petroleum.

This high oxygen content results in non-volatility, corrosiveness, immiscibity with fossil fuels, <b>thermal</b> <b>instability,</b> and a tendency to polymerize when exposed to air.

40|$|Bondi {{theory is}} often assumed to {{adequately}} describe {{the mode of}} accretion in astrophysical environments. However, the Bondi flow must be adiabatic, spherically symmetric, steady, unperturbed, with constant boundary conditions.
