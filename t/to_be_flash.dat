5000|$|... "I Can't Get Started" [...] is the plaintive song {{of a man}} who has {{achieved}} and won everything he could hope for, except the attention of the woman he desires. The rarely heard verse explains the situation ("I'm a glum one, it's explainable, I met someone unattainable, Life's a bore, the world is my oyster no more. All the papers where I led the news, With my capers, soon will spread the news: 'Superman turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>flash</b> in the pan.'") Gershwin’s lyrics ("I've flown around the world in a plane ... Settled revolutions in Spain ... Been consulted by Franklin D ... Greta Garbo has asked me to tea") are so topical and totally dated to the headlines of the 1930s that they break the mold for ballads. Yet they have such a clever, endearing charm that only a brave singer will dare to replace them (Sinatra dared with [...] "...designed the latest IBM brain..."). The melody, true to the theme of the lyrics, starts out at a low pitch and rarely goes very far up. A moving melody line carries the descriptive lines of text, however, until it comes to the bridge, where the text turns more emotional. There the song borders on despondency.|$|E

In a match against North American Champion Jeff Jarrett, The New Blackjacks found themselves torn apart when Barry Windham mistimed a lariat and hit team-mate Justin [...] "Hawk" [...] Bradshaw when trying to aid him from interference from Cornette and The Rock 'n' Roll Express. This {{turned out to be}} not so accidental as after the match he attacked Bradshaw again and declared alliance with his origins in the NWA. Windham appeared the next week without his facial hair, severing ties with Bradshaw, but after winning a match with Jeff Jarrett against Legion of Doom, his former team mate rushed the ring and chased away the NWA contingent. Accepting a challenge from the tag team, Bradshaw revealed his ad hoc partner <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Flash</b> Funk who offered little assistance once the Express took him out behind the referee's back leading Bradshaw to fight an effective handicap match. Despite winning the match, he suffered a post-match beat down after being hit with Cornette's tennis racket and suffered a four-man elevated neck breaker followed by a figure-four leg lock, with the Express stretching his arms and Windham - now sporting blond hair, further separating his image with Bradshaw - striking with a running bodysplash.|$|E
30|$|Sublimation {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out to determine the effect of mixing dust with porous ice on the isotopic composition of the sublimate gas. Disaggregated samples, in particular, were produced with high porosities by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and crushing to sand (mm) sized particles. When dust was incorporated in the mixture <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>flash</b> frozen, the D/H ratio of the sublimate gas was seen to decrease with time from the bulk ratio. The more dust was added to the mixture, the more pronounced was this effect.|$|E
40|$|Among {{the many}} factors that effect the {{atomization}} of a fuel spray in a com- bustion chamber, the flow {{characteristics of the}} fuel inside the injector nozzle play significant roles. The enthalpy of the entering fuel can be elevated such that it {{is higher than the}} local or downstream saturation enthalpy, which will result in the flash-boiling of the liquid. The phase change process dramatically effects the flow rate and has the potential to cause subsonic two-phase choking. The timescale over which this occurs is comparable to the flow-through time of the nozzle and hence any attempt to model this phenomenon needs to be done as a finite rate process. In the past the Homogeneous Relaxation Model (HRM) has been successfully employed to model the vaporization in one dimension. Here a full three dimensional imple- mentation of the HRM model is presented. Validations have been presented with experiments using water as working fluid. For the external spray modeling, where the fuel is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>flash</b> boiling, the phase change process plays a role alongside the aerodynamic breakup of the liquid and must be considered for obtaining the fuel spray characteristics. In this study the HRM model is coupled with Linearized Sheet Instability Analysis (LISA) model, for primary atomization, and with Taylor Analogy Breakup (TAB) model for secondary breakup. The aerodynamic breakup model and phase change based breakup model are designed as competing processes. The mechanism which satisfies its breakup criterion first during time integration is used to predict resulting drop sizes...|$|E

40|$|Gas-producing {{energetic}} materials {{that can be}} readily ignited with a photoflash are typically opaque sensitive primary explosives. This study explores the photoactivity of select high-nitrogen (HiN) compounds that are much less sensitive than primary explosives. These HiN materials produce large amounts of gas upon decomposition. This makes them suitable for use in actuators, igniters, or micro-thrusters. Detailed Ignition studies were conducted using similar shaped pulses at two different wavelength ranges; specifically using a xenon photoflash and a single wavelength CO 2 laser. Several select HiN materials were tested for flash ignitability, and those that were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>flash</b> ignitable were further ignited with CO 2 laser heating. By comparing ignition behavior at various laser and flash intensities, some ignition mechanisms are suggested. Thermal heating, regardless of source, {{appears to be the}} dominant mechanism responsible for ignition and photochemical effects appear to be negligible in the ignition of the materials considered in this study. Higher laser and photoflash irradiance is shown to require less energy, and is therefore more efficient. The opacity of the material is an important consideration in ignitability, but not a sufficient criteria. Opaque materials that successfully propagate well in small capillary tubes are seen to be more likely to successfully flash ignite. It is suggested that {{this is due to the}} higher burning rate of these materials and also in part to the exothermic reaction occurring at or near the burning surface, rather than further from the burning surface. Both of these characteristics better allow reaction to proceed without quenching and will lead both to more successful microchannel combustion and flash/laser ignition. ...|$|E

An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the wind characteristics of a particular location in University of Ilorin, Nigeria. The daily wind data for this location (lat. 8. 48 N, long. 4. 67 E) at three different heights of 10 m, 20 m and 30 m were measured over a period of six months. Although there seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>flashes</b> of higher wind speed at H = 20 m due to not too far away trees having more leaves up there and causing occasional turbulence, consistent wind availability still occurs at H = 30 m.
