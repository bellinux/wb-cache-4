5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on June 3. It tracked westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean, and on June 15 it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean. The system continued westward, and late on June 16 a low pressure area developed about 300miles (480km) southwest of San José, Costa Rica. At around 1200UTC on June 17, Dvorak classifications began on the disturbance, though initially its convection was broadly distributed and disorganized. The next day, however, an area of concentrated convection developed just south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Ships in the vicinity confirmed <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surface circulation within the system, while satellite imagery showed <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> central dense overcast.
