40|$|Objective {{measurement}} of the subglottic lumen is still lacking in clinical practice. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the accuracy of ultrasound and video-bronchoscopy in measuring the subglottic diameter in the pediatric population. This was a blind, prospective clinical study. Ten children undergoing non-life threatening bronchoscopy had their subglottic diameters measured with ultrasound, video-bronchoscopy and endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>sizing.</b> Ultrasound and video-bronchoscopy strongly correlated with endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>sizing</b> in measuring the subglottic diameter. Ultrasound had measurements that were always smaller while video-bronchoscopy had measurements that were slightly larger than endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>sizing.</b> Video-bronchoscopy may be more accurate than endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>sizing</b> as the latter method will often underestimate the size of the lumen due to its own limitations. The smaller values obtained by ultrasound suggest it is not ideal to give absolute measurements in this area, but rather a potential tool to detect change of lumen size on follow-up...|$|R

50|$|This section {{lists the}} more common tube ratings for general lighting. Many more tube ratings exist, often country-specific. The Nominal Length may not exactly match any {{measured}} dimension of the tube. For some <b>tube</b> <b>sizes,</b> the nominal length (in feet) is the required spacing between centers of the lighting fixtures to create a continuous run, so the tubes are a little shorter than the nominal length.|$|R
50|$|The {{steam drum}} {{internals}} and <b>tube</b> <b>sizes</b> are arranged so that subcooled water travels {{down the tubes}} into the lower drum. The water is then distributed to the other tubes where it is partially converted to steam {{and returned to the}} steam drum. Drum internals includes primary and secondary cyclone separators, baffle plates rose pipe, and dry pipe. Main function of steam drum is to provide water storage and space to separate steam from water.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are five}} major [...] "wire line" [...] tube sizes {{typically}} used. Larger tubes produced larger diameter rock cores and require more drill power to drive them.

50|$|Tube Pullers- Used {{to break}} the seal and pull {{expanded}} tubes from a tube sheet. A spear or expanding collet is inserted and engaged into the tube inner diameter. A ram or gun applies force to exert an extracting force on the tube. The power to pull the tube is generated manually or through an hydraulic pump. The hydraulic pump can be manually, electrically or pneumatically driven. The pulling force required will vary with the <b>tube</b> <b>size</b> and wall, {{the depth of the}} tube sheet and tube material.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1930s special amplifying tubes were {{developed}} which deliberately [...] "folded" [...] the electron beam, by having it strike a dynode to be reflected into the anode. This {{had the effect}} of increasing the plate-grid distance for a given <b>tube</b> <b>size,</b> increasing the transconductance of the tube and reducing its noise figure. A typical such [...] "orbital beam hexode" [...] was the RCA 1630, introduced in 1939. Because the heavy electron current in such tubes damaged the dynode surface rapidly, their lifetime tended to be very short compared to conventional tubes.|$|E
50|$|Mid-'77 {{the front}} forks {{had a major}} redesign, fork tube {{diameter}} increased from 34 to 35 mm and internals were changed (although this also holds true for various years of the same <b>tube</b> <b>size).</b> The entire fork assembly (with triple tree) will swap either way but fork parts are not equivalent. Also the brake caliper changed from a 48 mm dual piston cast iron design for the 34 mm fork to a 40 mm aluminum single piston floating caliper for the 35 mm forks. The brake caliper mounting lugs on the fork sliders are of different spacing for the 34 mm and 35 mm forks so the calipers can't be swapped.|$|E

5000|$|CRT rear-projection television: Small {{cathode ray}} tubes create {{the image in}} the same manner that a {{traditional}} CRT television does, which is by firing a beam of electrons onto a phosphor-coated screen; the image is projected onto a large screen. This is done to overcome the cathode ray <b>tube</b> <b>size</b> limit which is about 40 inches, the maximum size for a normal direct-view-CRT television set (see image). The projection cathode ray tubes can be arranged in various ways. One arrangement is to use one tube and three phosphor (red, green, blue) coatings. Alternatively, one black-and-white tube can be used with a spinning color wheel. A third option is to use three CRT's, one each for red, green, and blue.|$|E
5000|$|Ross Siragusa founded Continental Radio and Television Corp. as a {{maker of}} {{consumer}} electronics (radios and phonographs) in Chicago during 1934. This later became Admiral Corp. Its annual sales were about $2 million. Admiral supplied the U.S. military with electronic equipment during World War II, {{and was one of}} the major television manufacturers in the early era of that medium. In 1950, for instance, Admiral was selling a line of seven TV sets, with four models having a 12.5 in <b>tube</b> <b>size</b> (between $179.95 and $379.95, equivalent to [...] to [...] today), a 16 in model at $299.95 (...) , and two 19 in models (at $495 and $695, equivalent to [...] and [...] ). Success in television sales enabled the company to branch out into major appliances such as refrigerators by the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|High {{frequency}} oscillatory ventilation {{was first}} described in 1972 {{and is used}} in neonates and adult patient populations to reduce lung injury, or to prevent further lung injury. HFOV is characterized by high respiratory rates between 3.5 and 15 hertz (210 - 900 breaths per minute) and having both inhalation and exhalation maintained by active pressures. The rates used vary widely depending upon patient size, age, and disease process. In HFOV the pressure oscillates around the constant distending pressure (equivalent to mean airway pressure MAP) which in effect {{is the same as}} positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Thus gas is pushed into the lung during inspiration, and then pulled out during expiration. HFOV generates very low tidal volumes that are generally less than the dead space of the lung. Tidal volume is dependent on endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>size,</b> power and frequency. Different mechanisms (direct bulk flow - convective, Taylorian dispersion, Pendelluft effect, asymmetrical velocity profiles, cardiogenic mixing and molecular diffusion) of gas transfer are believed to come into play in HFOV compared to normal mechanical ventilation. It is often used in patients who have refractory hypoxemia that cannot be corrected by normal mechanical ventilation such {{as is the case in}} the following disease processes: severe ARDS, ALI and other oxygenation diffusion issues. In some neonatal patients HFOV may be used as the first-line ventilator due to the high susceptibility of the premature infant to lung injury from conventional ventilation.|$|E

40|$|SummaryRegulation of {{epithelial}} <b>tube</b> <b>size</b> {{is critical}} for organ function. However, the mechanisms of <b>tube</b> <b>size</b> control remain poorly understood. In the Drosophila trachea, tube dimensions are regulated by a luminal extracellular matrix (ECM) [1 â 4]. ECM organization requires apical (luminal) secretion of the protein Vermiform (Verm), which depends on the basolateral septate junction (SJ) [5, 6]. Here, we show that apical and basolateral epithelial polarity proteins interact to control tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>size</b> independently of the Verm pathway. Mutations in yurt (yrt) and scribble (scrib), which encode SJ-associated polarity proteins [7, 8], cause an expansion of tracheal tubes but do not disrupt Verm secretion. Reducing activity of the apical polarity protein Crumbs (Crb) suppresses the length defects in yrt but not scrib mutants, suggesting that Yrt acts by negatively regulating Crb. Conversely, Crb overexpression increases tracheal tube dimensions. Reducing crb dosage also rescues tracheal size defects caused by mutations in coracle (cora), which encodes an SJ-associated polarity protein [8, 9]. In addition, crb mutations suppress cora length defects without restoring Verm secretion. Together, these data indicate that Yrt, Cora, Crb, and Scrib operate independently of the Verm pathway. Our data support a model in which Cora and Yrt act through Crb to regulate epithelial <b>tube</b> <b>size...</b>|$|E

40|$|By {{studying}} self-avoiding polygons (SAPs) in (L, M) -tubes (a tubular sublattice of {{the simple}} cubic lattice) as a sequence of 2 -spans, transfer matrices {{can be used to}} obtain theoretical and numerical results for these SAPs. As a result, asymptotic properties of these SAPs, such as pattern densities in a random SAP and the expected span of a random SAP, can be calculated directly from these transfer matrices. These same results can also be obtained for compact polygons, as well as SAPs under the influence of an external force (called compressed or stretched polygons). These results can act as tools for examining the entanglement complexity of SAPs in (L, M) -tubes. In this thesis, it is examined how transfer matrices can be used to develop these tools. The transfer matrix method is reviewed, and previous transfer matrix results for SAPs in (L, M) -tubes, as well as SAPs subjected to an external force, are presented. The transfer matrix method is then similarly applied to compact polygons, where new results regarding compact polygons are obtained, including proofs for a compact concatenation theorem and for a compact pattern theorem. Also in this thesis, transfer matrices are actually generated (via the computer) for relatively small <b>tube</b> <b>sizes.</b> This is done for the general case of SAPs in (L, M) -tubes, {{as well as for the}} compact and external force cases. New numerical results are obtained directly from these transfer matrices, and a new algorithm for generating polygons is also developed from these transfer matrices.

40|$|Seedlings {{low quality}} can result due to {{problems}} in irrigation and/or nutrition of seedlings in their nursery phase. Regarding irrigation, problems can arise related to low uniformity of water application or its management, leading to lack or excess of water. While the excess can leach nutrients, the deficit can affect plant growth. Thus, this work had as objective to evaluate irrigation efficiency of a microsprinkler irrigation system at a forest native species nursery and also at sub-irrigation of forest native species being raised in recipient tubes The microsplinkler irrigation efficiency evaluation {{was performed in}} a native forest nursery at Itutinga - MG city, held in completely randomized design in split plots scheme, with the irrigation equipment on the plot (three levels: MA- 20, Rondo and Inverted Rotor Spray) and three forest species on subplot. For efficiency evaluation in large tubes, the categories of subplot were: Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O. Ktze., Syagrus romanzoffiana (Cham.) Glassman and Joannesia princeps Vell. In small tubes, the three levels of subplots were the species: Guazuma ulmifolia Lam., Anadenanthera macrocarpa Benth. and Aspidosperma polyneuron Muell. The sub-irrigation efficiency evaluation was conducted in a greenhouse located at UFLA, in two sub-irrigation tanks with three replications, through calculation of uniformity coefficients for each sub-irrigated species, done in three replications. The largest application efficiency was obtained for the MA- 20 emitter.
