In the present scenario <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> verifies <b>the</b> authenticity of <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> services without <b>the</b> knowledge of user’s identity. <b>The</b> <b>cloud</b> provides massive data access directly through the internet. Centralized storage mechanism is followed here for effective accessing of data. Cloud service providers are normally acquires the software and hardware resources and <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> consumers are avail the services through the internet access in lease basis. Cloud security is enhanced through cryptography technique applied to <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> security to avoid vulnerability. The intractable computability is achieved in <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> by using <b>the</b> public key cryptosystem. This paper proposed the approach of applying Hyper elliptic curve cryptography for data protection in <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> with <b>the</b> small key size. The proposed system has the further advantage of eliminating intruder in cloud computing. Efficacy {{of the system is}} to provide the high security of <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> data...|$|R

Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185–270K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 bar with temperatures of 190–235K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10–20 bar and temperatures are 270–330K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.|$|E

The role of eagles, however, was controversial, because in the same region there was a belief that an eagle flying in front of thunderstorm clouds was a manifestation of an ala, leading <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> toward the crops, rather than driving them away.|$|E
