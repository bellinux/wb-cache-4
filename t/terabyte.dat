5|$|The {{previous}} state {{internet traffic}} are routed through a hub in Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur, {{passing through a}} submarine cable connecting the Peninsular with Kota Kinabalu. The systems are considered as costly and inefficient especially due {{to the price of}} leasing bandwidth with the large distance. In 2000, there is a plan to establish Sabah own internet hub but the plan was unreachable due to the high cost and low usage rates in the state. Other alternative plan including using the Brunei internet gateway in a short term before establishing Sabah own gateway. By 2016, the federal government has start to establish the first internet gateway for East Malaysia with the laying of 60 <b>terabyte</b> submarine cable which are developed by a private company named Xiddig Cellular Communications Sdn. Bhd. {{at a cost of about}} RM850 million through the Private Funding Initiative (PFI). Under the 2015 Malaysian Budget project of 1Malaysia Cable System Project (SKR1M), a new submarine cable for high speed internet has been built from Kota Kinabalu to Pahang in the Peninsular which completed in 2017. The 1Malaysia submarine cable system linking the state capital with Miri, Bintulu and Kuching in Sarawak together with Mersing in Johor with an increase of bandwidth capacity up to 12 <b>terabyte</b> per second. Another submarine cable, the BIMP-EAGA Submarine and Terrestrial (BEST) Cable Project is currently being built from Kota Kinabalu to Tawau to connecting Sabah with Brunei, Kalimantan and Mindanao which will be completed in 2018. In early 2016, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the state government and China's largest networking company, Huawei to set Sabah to become information and communications technology (ICT) hub by leveraging on Huawei's ICT expertise. More free high speed Wi-Fi hotspots are being planned in Sabah, especially to the state capital.|$|E

25|$|Speaking in 2015 {{regarding}} a possible re-release {{of the game}} via Steam or GOG.com, Louis Castle explained the source code and assets were lost when Westwood moved its studio from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, thus making a re-release or a HD-remaster impossible. Even if the code was found, to restore almost a <b>terabyte</b> of assets, whether for new pre-rendered backdrops or full real-time 3D, would cost {{tens of millions of}} dollars, making a re-release as unlikely as a sequel.

25|$|For {{the audio}} and sound {{engineering}} on the tour, DiGiCo SD7 consoles {{were used by}} mixing specialists Andy Meyer and monitor engineers Matt Napier and Sean Spuehler. Since Madonna wanted to have an authentic feel with the live sound, Spuehler mixed her vocal effects and then added it to the house consoles. During {{the duration of the}} concert, the singer ventures {{into the middle of the}} crowd as the runway approaches, resulting in the spill of the microphone in her hand constantly changing. The sound crew employed timecode to achieve this, whereby like the lighting and the choreography, the sound feed also changed depending on where the singer was onstage. All the musicians accompanying Madonna wore in-ear monitor, with additional monitoring for musical director/keyboardist Kevin Antunes, a thumper for drummer Brian Frasier-Moore and sidefills for the dancers. All the inputs from the different personnel including Madonna were fed into the SD7 console. A Multichannel Audio Digital Interface(MADI) was used to record all the shows to a digital audio workstation in RAID drives. They were archived into four <b>terabyte</b> backup disks.|$|E
25|$|The concerts were {{digitally}} {{recorded by}} 28 HD cameras, both human operated and robotic, collecting about 500 gigabytes of audio/video per hour—roughly a <b>terabyte</b> (TB) per show. To handle their data storage needs, U2 used several products from EMC Corporation, {{the first time}} the company had a musical client. To archive uncompressed footage and access it on-demand during the shows' production, the tour staff used an EMC VNXe3200 portable flash storage unit worth about US$25,000; it was configured with 22.9 TB of storage but was expandable up to 450 TB. After each show, tour staff used an EMC Data Domain 2500 system to back up footage; with storage up to 6.6 petabytes and an hourly throughput of 13.4 TB, the Data Domain system could complete a nightly backup before the crew disassembled the stage. On previous tours, U2 relied on USB flash drives for storage. Video imagery was loaded on the set's video screens with two d3 Technologies d3 4×4 media servers. Due to the need to load video on the fly, all storage was locally networked, as a cloud storage configuration would have increased latency. EMC's solution satisfied certain requirements dictated by the band, such as: mobility through a flight case form factor; expandable storage; and the capability to handle the large data loads from many cameras.|$|E

500|$|Windows Server 2012, {{along with}} Windows 8, {{includes}} {{a new version}} of Hyper-V, as presented at the Microsoft BUILD event. Many new features have been added to Hyper-V, including network virtualization, multi-tenancy, storage resource pools, cross-premises connectivity, and cloud backup. Additionally, many of the former restrictions on resource consumption have been greatly lifted. Each virtual machine in this version of Hyper-V can access up to 64 virtual processors, up to 1 <b>terabyte</b> of memory, and up to 64 terabytes of virtual disk space per virtual hard disk (using a new [...]vhdx format). Up to 1024 virtual machines can be active per host, and up to 8000 can be active per failover cluster. SLAT is a required processor feature for Hyper-V on Windows 8, while for Windows Server 2012 it is only required for the supplementary RemoteFX role.|$|E
500|$|The first {{source of}} over-provisioning {{comes from the}} {{computation}} of the capacity and use of gigabyte (GB) as the unit instead of gibibyte (GiB). Both HDD and SSD vendors use the term GB to represent a decimal GB or 1,000,000,000 (=109) bytes. Like most other electronic storage, flash memory is assembled in powers of two, so calculating the physical capacity of an SSD {{would be based on}} 1,073,741,824 (=230) per binary GB or GiB. The difference between these two values is 7.37% (=(230− 109)/ 109× 100%). Therefore, a 128GB SSD with 0% additional over-provisioning would provide 128,000,000,000 bytes to the user (out of 137,438,953,472 total). This initial 7.37% is typically not counted in the total over-provisioning number, and the true amount available is usually less as some storage space is needed for the controller to keep track of non-operating system data such as block status flags. The 7.37% figure may extend to 9.95% in the <b>terabyte</b> range, as ...|$|E
