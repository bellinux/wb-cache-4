5|$|On May 9, 1987, {{improperly}} assembled bearings in Il-62M engine number 2 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 overheated {{and exploded}} during cruise over {{the village of}} Lipinki, causing the shaft to break in two; this caused the low-pressure turbine disc to spin to enormous speeds and disintegrate, damaging engine number 1 and cutting the control pushers. The crew managed to return to Warsaw, using nothing but <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> to control the crippled aircraft, but on the final approach, the trim controlling links burned and the crew completely lost control over the aircraft. Soon after, it crashed {{on the outskirts of}} Warsaw; all 183 on board perished. Had the plane stayed airborne for 40 seconds more, it {{would have been able to}} reach the runway.|$|E

40|$|The {{difference}} in dynamic {{pressure in the}} propeller slipstreams as measured by sensors is divided by the freestream dynamic pressure generating a quantity proportional to the differential thrust coefficient. This quantity is used to command an electric trim motor to change the position of <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> thereby retrimming the airplane to the new asymmetric power condition. The change in position of the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> produced by the electric trim motor is summed with the pilot's input to produce the actual <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> position...|$|R

25|$|The Boeing Model 247 was {{an early}} United States airliner, {{considered}} the first such aircraft to fully incorporate advances such as all-metal (anodized aluminium) semimonocoque construction, a fully cantilevered wing and retractable landing gear. Other advanced features included control surface <b>trim</b> <b>tabs,</b> an autopilot and de-icing boots for the wings and tailplane.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trim</b> <b>tabs</b> {{are small}} {{surfaces}} {{connected to the}} trailing edge of a larger control surface, such as a rudder, on an aircraft, used to control the trim of the controls, i.e. to counteract aerodynamic forces and stabilise the aircraft in a particular desired attitude without the need for the operator to constantly apply a control force. This is done by adjusting the angle of the tab relative to the larger surface.|$|E
50|$|In the NTSB {{investigation}} report, {{the cause}} was attributed to extreme pitch-up to 14g+ caused {{by the loss of}} the port elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> due to wear in the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> mounts, exacerbated by lock-nuts on the mounting bolts losing their self-locking ability due to use past their normal life.|$|R
2500|$|Changing {{the setting}} of a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> adjusts the neutral or resting {{position}} of a control surface (such as an elevator or rudder). As the desired position of a control surface changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position—to zero, if used correctly. [...] Thus the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> acts as a servo tab. [...] Because the center of pressure of the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is further away from the axis of rotation of the control surface than the center of pressure of the control surface, the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the control surface. The position of the control surface on its axis will change until the torque from the control surface and the trim surface balance each other.|$|R
50|$|The Cessna 152 is {{equipped}} with differential ailerons that move through 20 degrees upwards and 15 degrees downwards. It has single-slotted flaps which are electrically operated and deploy {{to a maximum of}} 30 degrees. The rudder can move 23 degrees to either side and is fitted with a ground-adjustable <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b> The elevators move up through 25 degrees and down through 18 degrees. An adjustable <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is installed on the right elevator and is controlled by a small wheel {{in the center of the}} control console. The <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> moves 10 degrees up and 20 degrees down relative to the elevator chordline.|$|R
25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{control surfaces}} of SpaceShipOne {{are designed to}} operate in two distinct flight regimes, subsonic and supersonic. The supersonic flight regime is of primary interest during the boost phase of a flight, and the subsonic mode when gliding. There are separate upper and lower rudders, and elevons. These are controlled using aviation-style stick and pedals. In supersonic mode the <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> are controlled electrically, whereas the subsonic mode uses mechanical cable-and-rod linkage.|$|E
25|$|The {{design team}} also {{attempted}} to minimize {{changes in the}} aircraft's trim at varying speeds, thus reducing the pilot's workload. They were so successful in this regard that they found in-flight-adjustable aileron and rudder <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> were not necessary. Small, fixed tabs were fitted to control surfaces and adjusted for proper balance during initial test flights. Only the elevator trim needed to be adjusted in flight (a feature common to all aircraft). This was accomplished by tilting the entire horizontal tailplane with an electric motor, with an angle of incidence ranging from −3° to +5°.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} and empennage have {{a wooden}} structure and carbon fibre skin. The engine is 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912S flat-four, driving a variable pitch propeller. The cabin {{is over the}} wings, with two pairs of side-by-side seats. Entry is by two upward-opening doors {{and there is a}} baggage space behind the rear seats. At the rear the vertical surfaces are straight-edged and swept, with a long dorsal strake. The horizontal surfaces are approximately trapezoidal in plan, with an unswept leading edge.Both the rudder and elevators are fabric covered.

To measure the hinge moment experienced by the trim-tab at various test conditions, two miniaturized balances were designed and fabricated. Gain scheduled proportional integral controller was developed to control the SMA actuated smart <b>trim</b> <b>tab.</b> It was confirmed during the tests that the trim-tab could be controlled at the desired position against the aerodynamic loads acting on it for the various test conditions...|$|R
25|$|LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055, an Ilyushin Il-62M, on 9 May 1987. According to the Polish investigatory commission, {{the cause}} of the crash was the {{disintegration}} of an engine shaft due to faulty bearings inside engine No. 2, which seized, causing extensive heat. This in turn caused the consequent damage to engine No. 1, rapid decompression of the fuselage, and a fire in the cargo hold, as well as the loss of elevator controls and progressive electrical failures. Zygmunt Pawlaczyk decided to return to Warsaw Okecie Airport using only <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> to control the flight of the aircraft. He lost his struggle to land about 5km from the runway in the Kabacki Forest. All 172 passengers and 11 crew members perished.|$|E
25|$|The CFM Shadow is a two-seat {{ultralight}} of pod and boom layout, either factory or home-built from kits. It is a {{high wing}} aircraft, with a short fuselage constructed of Fibrelam with a fibreglass nose cone and plywood sides, seating two in tandem in an enclosed cockpit. Dual control can be fitted and was standard on later models. The fuselage carries a tricycle undercarriage, with a castoring nosewheel; wheel fairings are an option. A Rotax two-cylinder two-stroke engine is mounted, exposed, immediately behind this pod in pusher configuration. The unusual empennage is carried on a fine aluminium boom and consists of an inverted narrow rectangular tail fin and large rudder below the boom plus a swept tailplane with small tapered upright end plate fins. The elevators are full span, with electrically operated <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b> All rear surfaces have aluminium structures covered with polyester fabric.|$|E
25|$|The wings had {{constant}} chord with roughly elliptical tips, with roots joining the upper longerons. On each side, {{a pair of}} streamlined struts from {{the front and rear}} wing spars at mid-span transmitted lift loads {{to the end of the}} stub wing. There was another, slighter pair of struts from each engine mounting vertically to the wing. The wing structure was mostly metal, with some wooden components, then fabric covered. Each wing carried a pair of ailerons with <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> to reduce control loads. The fuselage was built around the usual four metal longerons and covered with an aluminium skin. Pilot and co-pilot sat side by side with dual control in an enclosed cabin just ahead of the leading edge, with fuselage windows on either side for lateral and downward vision. Access to the large passenger cabin, 4.60 m long, was via a radio compartment. The cabin seated ten passengers, five down each side with their own window. At the back were baggage spaces and toilet facilities. Passengers entered by a port-side door and luggage loaded through a door on the other side.|$|E
5000|$|In former Trim-Tab servo systems, {{the pivot}} {{movement}} of the servo blade around its vertical axis {{has been carried out}} by a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> Servo tab, which however costs some force due to the fact, that the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is moved in the opposite direction to turn the servo blade.The same holds for a <b>trim</b> <b>trim</b> <b>tab,</b> which is mounted at a big distance behind the ship's rudder, connected to it at its upper and lower end. This construction is called [...] "The Saye's Rigg". Another version of wind vane self steering on sail boats is known as the vertical axis vane and usually, because of the inferior steering force output compared to Servo Pendulum devices it makes use of a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> hung off the rudder to control the course of the boat. The vane spins at right angles to the ground and can lock to the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> in any desired position, as the boat falls off the wind the vane will be turned by the wind and will take the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> with it which in turn causes the rudder to move in the opposite direction and thus corrects course. Generally self steering like this, with a <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> can only be used on boats with transom (or aft hung double enders) rudders as the <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> needs to be mounted directly to and aft of the rudder to produce the desired effect, and of course has to be controlled even as the rudder swings side to side. This is typically accomplished by use of a slotted bar in which the connection to the vane assembly can slide in as the rudder turns. These self steering systems are generally simpler and are thus easier to set and adjust course as they don't make use of lines controlling the rudder but control it more directly through solid linkages.A related device has been used on some windmills, the fantail, a small windmill mounted at right angles to the main sails which automatically turns the heavy cap and main sails into the wind, (invented in England in 1745). (When the wind is already directly into the main vanes, the fantail remains essentially motionless.) ...|$|R
50|$|When a {{servo tab}} is employed, it is {{moved into the}} {{slipstream}} opposite to the control surface's desired deflection. For example, in order to trim an elevator to hold the nose down, the elevator's <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> will actually rise up into the slipstream. The increased pressure {{on top of the}} <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> surface caused by raising it will then deflect the entire elevator slab down slightly, causing the tail to rise and the aircraft's nose to move down. In the case of an aircraft where deployment of high-lift devices (flaps) would significantly alter the longitudinal trim, a supplementary <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> is arranged to simultaneously deploy with the flaps so that pitch attitude is not markedly changed.|$|R

500|$|The new {{wing of the}} Spitfire F Mk 21 and its successors was {{designed}} to help alleviate this problem. Its stiffness was increased by 47%, and a new design of aileron using piano hinges and geared <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> meant that the theoretical aileron reversal speed was increased to [...] Alongside the redesigned wing Supermarine also experimented with the original wing, raising the leading edge by one inch (2.54cm), {{with the hope of}} improving pilot view and reducing drag. This wing was tested on a modified F Mk 21, also called the F Mk 23, (sometimes referred to as [...] "Valiant" [...] rather than [...] "Spitfire"). The increase in performance was minimal and this experiment was abandoned.|$|E
500|$|Flying at , {{the pilot}} located his target through a bombsight {{window in the}} cockpit floor. The pilot moved the dive lever to the rear, {{limiting}} the [...] "throw" [...] of the control column. The dive brakes were activated automatically, the pilot set the <b>trim</b> <b>tabs,</b> reduced his throttle and closed the coolant flaps. The aircraft then rolled 180°, automatically nosing the aircraft into a dive. Red tabs protruded from the upper surfaces of the wing as a visual indicator to the pilot that, {{in case of a}} g-induced black-out, the automatic dive recovery system would be activated. The Stuka dived at a 60-90° angle, holding a constant speed of 500–600km/h (350-370mph) due to dive-brake deployment, which increased the accuracy of the Ju 87's aim.|$|E
500|$|The second {{prototype}} had a redesigned single vertical stabiliser and a 610PS (...) Junkers Jumo 210 A engine installed, {{and later}} the Jumo 210 Da. The first A series variant, the A-0, was of all-metal construction, with an enclosed cockpit under a [...] "greenhouse" [...] well-framed canopy; bearing twin radio masts on its aft sections, diagonally mounted {{to either side of}} the airframe's planform centreline and unique to the -A version. To ease the difficulty of mass production, {{the leading edge of the}} wing was straightened out and the ailerons' two aerofoil sections had smooth leading and trailing edges. The pilot could adjust the elevator and rudder <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> in flight, and the tail was connected to the landing flaps, which were positioned in two parts between the ailerons and fuselage. The A-0 also had a flatter engine cowling, which gave the pilot a much better field of vision. In order for the engine cowling to be flattened, the engine was set down nearly [...] The fuselage was also lowered along with the gunner's position, allowing the gunner a better field of fire.|$|E

500|$|A new {{specification}} {{was issued}} as S.8/43 {{to cover the}} development of the Firebrand T.F. Mk III (B-45) with the [...] Bristol Centaurus VII radial engine. Two prototypes were converted from incomplete F Mk Is and 27 additional aircraft were delivered, completing the first batch of 50 aircraft. The first prototype flew on 21 December 1943, but construction of the new aircraft was very slow with the first flight not being made until November 1944. Most changes were related to the installation of the larger-diameter Centaurus engine, including air intakes for the carburetor and oil cooler in the wing-root extensions that formerly housed the engine's radiators. Spring-loaded <b>trim</b> <b>tabs</b> were also fitted to all control surfaces. Production aircraft after the first 10 were fitted with the improved Centaurus IX engine. The Mk III was found to be unsuitable for carrier operations for a variety of reasons. The new engine produced more torque than the Sabre, and rudder control was insufficient on takeoff with the full flaps needed for carrier use. Visibility while landing was very poor, the tailhook attachment to the airframe was too weak, and the aircraft had a tendency to drop a wing at the stall while landing, so development continued to rectify these issues.|$|E
2500|$|The PL.3 had a {{low wing}} built entirely of wood, covered with plywood, {{tapering}} uniformly both in chord and thickness from wide, deep roots to rounded tips. The tail was conventional, the tailplane set at mid-fuselage with straight swept leading edges and carrying elevators with <b>trim</b> <b>tabs.</b> [...] The fin was triangular, with a rounded rudder ending above the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dorsal fin}} kits became {{available}} in August 1944, and available as retrofits for P-51Bs and P-51Cs (but rarely {{used on the}} [...] "razorback" [...] -B and -C Mustangs), and to early P-51Ds and P-51Ks that had not already been built with them. Also incorporated was a change to the rudder <b>trim</b> <b>tabs,</b> which would help prevent the pilot over-controlling the aircraft and creating heavy loads on the tail unit.|$|E

The 1998 incident did not lead to a crash, but Hannah reported that when the elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> came off, the airplane pitched up and subjected him to over 10 Gs and a loss of consciousness. When he regained consciousness, the plane had climbed to over 9,000 feet. In that incident, Hannah had been able to bring the damaged plane in for a safe landing.|$|R
25|$|Investigation of {{the crash}} {{uncovered}} some errors in the information {{used to determine the}} position of the aircraft's centre of gravity. It became clear that the aircraft had taken off with its centre of gravity slightly outside the approved limits. Investigators also found evidence that the takeoff may have been performed with the elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> still set for landing. If the elevator <b>trim</b> <b>tab</b> had not been set for takeoff this would have been exacerbated by the incorrect position of the centre of gravity and the aircraft would have been uncontrollable.|$|R
