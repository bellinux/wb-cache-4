5|$|Glue binder {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55). The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce <b>the</b> <b>glaze.</b>|$|E

50|$|The U.S. DOE {{explains}} drawbacks to roof-angled glazing: Glass {{and plastic}} have little structural strength. When installed vertically, glass (or plastic) bears {{its own weight}} because only a small area (the top edge of <b>the</b> <b>glazing)</b> is subject to gravity. As the glass tilts off the vertical axis, however, an increased area (now the sloped cross-section) of <b>the</b> <b>glazing</b> has to bear the force of gravity. Glass is also brittle; it does not flex much before breaking. To counteract this, you usually must increase the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>glazing</b> or increase <b>the</b> number of structural supports to hold <b>the</b> <b>glazing.</b> Both increase overall cost, and the latter will {{reduce the amount of}} solar gain into the sunspace.|$|R

50|$|Light {{transmission}} (for this article, the perceivable {{visible spectrum}} between 390 nm and 750 nm is considered) through glass is diminished either by light reflection or light absorption of <b>the</b> <b>glazing</b> material. <b>The</b> total light transferred through <b>the</b> <b>glazing</b> material (light transmission) {{is reduced by}} reflection and/or absorption. In art framing, light reflection causes glare, while light absorption also may cause the transmitted colors to be dulled or distorted. While type of the glass substrate will affect the light absorption of <b>the</b> <b>glazing,</b> <b>the</b> surface treatment can affect light scattering, light reflection and in some cases, light absorption.

25|$|The use of lead glaze {{has several}} {{advantages}} over alkali glazes {{in addition to}} their greater optical refractivity. Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the ceramic body. Alkali glazes must first be mixed with silica and fritted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful glaze must not crawl, or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the surface tension of <b>the</b> <b>glaze.</b> It must not craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the thermal contraction of <b>the</b> <b>glaze</b> and the ceramic body do not match properly. Ideally, <b>the</b> <b>glaze</b> contraction should be 5–15% less than the body contraction, as glazes are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead glaze has a linear expansion coefficient of between 5 and 7×10−6/°C, compared to 9 to 10×10−6/°C for alkali glazes. Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5×10−6/°C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7×10−6/°C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15–25% CaO. Therefore, the thermal contraction of lead glaze matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali glaze, rendering it less prone to crazing. A glaze should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of pinholes as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900–1100°C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead glaze mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali glazes.|$|E
25|$|These {{could be}} applied in three {{different}} ways. Lead could be added directly to a ceramic body {{in the form of}} a lead compound in suspension, either from galena (PbS), red lead (Pb3O4), white lead (2PbCO3·Pb(OH)2), or lead oxide (PbO). The second method involves mixing the lead compound with silica, which is then placed in suspension and applied directly. The third method involves fritting the lead compound with silica, powdering the mixture, and suspending and applying it. The method used on a particular vessel may be deduced by analysing the interaction layer between <b>the</b> <b>glaze</b> and the ceramic body microscopically.|$|E
25|$|Tin-opacified glazes {{appear in}} Iraq {{in the eighth}} century AD. Originally {{containing}} 1–2% PbO; by the eleventh century high-lead glazes had developed, typically containing 20–40% PbO and 5–12% alkali. These were used throughout Europe and the Near East, especially in Iznik ware, {{and continue to be}} used today. Glazes with even-higher lead content occur in Spanish and Italian maiolica, with up to 55% PbO and as low as 3% alkali. Adding lead to the melt allows the formation of tin oxide more readily than in an alkali glaze: tin oxide precipitates into crystals in <b>the</b> <b>glaze</b> as it cools, creating its opacity.|$|E

Faïence parlante bears mottoes often on decorative labels or banners. Apothecary wares, including albarelli, can bear the names of their intended contents, generally in Latin and often so abbreviated to be unrecognizable to the untutored eye. Mottoes of fellowships and associations became popular in the 18th century, leading to the faïence patriotique that was a specialty of the years of the French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|The Longquan celadons {{were among}} the finest {{of a range of}} celadon wares {{produced}} in China, and led stylistic and technical developments. The celadons were produced in a range of shades of colour, centred on olive-green, but extending to greenish blues (regarded as desirable, but less common) and browns. All these colours come from the glaze; the body beneath is sometimes left partly unglazed as part of the decoration, when it fires to a terracotta brown. The wares are hardly ever painted; decoration comes from the vessel shape and carved or incised designs in the body. Shapes were originally mostly simple, allowing <b>the</b> <b>glaze</b> colour to create the main effect of a piece, but in later periods raised decoration was common.|$|E
25|$|Atzompa {{has been}} making pottery for at least 500 years.

The green glazed ware is mostly formed into utilitarian items such as pots, cazuelas, jars, bowls and more. More recently, artisans in the town have been experimenting with various other styles of pottery, mostly decorative times {{in a variety of}} styles. One of these is called “pastillaje” where very small and fine pieces of clay are formed and pressed onto the main surface of the piece to create decoration. The town also has an outlet for its ware called the Casa de las Artesanias.|$|E

25|$|Most pottery {{produced}} in central Mexico is fired at low temperatures (low-fire) {{and covered with}} a glaze made with lead and other minerals. This is because lead will fuse and produce a shine at a firing temperature of less than 800C, while alternatives require temperatures twice as high. The use of lead in these wares has produced health warning in both Mexico and the United States, with the risks being known as early as the late 19th century. Lead from <b>the</b> <b>glaze</b> tends to leach into foods after repeated use. Use of this type of ware has been linked to elevated blood levels in children in Mexico City, Oaxaca and other places and severely high levels in children of potters. The lead content is highest in Oaxacan pottery. This lead content has blocked most rurally produced ceramics from the United States market, where they could fetch much higher prices.|$|E
