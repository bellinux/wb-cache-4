25|$|There {{have been}} two major kinds of splits from the SSPX. Two notable splits of the first kind {{involved}} priests who viewed the SSPX as too liberal and who use the form that the Mass had before Pope John XXIII. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>kind</b> involved groups who have reconciled with the Holy See and who, like the SSPX, use the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal.|$|E
25|$|An {{established}} {{convention in}} the scientific community defines vitreous electrification as positive, and resinous electrification as negative. The exactly opposite properties of the two kinds of electrification justify our indicating them by opposite signs, but the application of the positive sign to one rather than to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kind</b> must be considered as a matter of arbitrary convention—just as {{it is a matter of}} convention in mathematical diagram to reckon positive distances towards the right hand.|$|E

25|$|Logical {{analysis}} {{shows that there}} are two different kinds of statements; one kind includes statements reducible to simpler statements about the empirically given; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kind</b> includes statements which cannot be reduced to statements about experience and thus they are devoid of meaning. Metaphysical statements belong to this second kind and therefore they are meaningless. Hence many philosophical problems are rejected as pseudo-problems which arise from logical mistakes, while others are re-interpreted as empirical statements and thus become the subject of scientific inquiries.|$|E

2500|$|Basso profondo is {{the lowest}} bass voice type. According to J. B. Steane in Voices, Singers, and Critics, the basso profondo voice [...] "derives from a method of tone-production that {{eliminates}} the more Italian quick vibrato.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1999, the Brooklyn Museum did battle with then-New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over the {{exhibition}} [...] "Sensation," [...] with charges of presenting sexually and religiously offensive art. [...] In {{the face of all}} this, and the series of battles in the American culture war, The Art of the Motorcycle stood as a counterpoint, and possibly the high-water mark for <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kind</b> of museum show: [...] not offensive, not exclusive, but welcoming to the sensibilities of the general public. [...] People who were baffled and irritated by modern and postmodern art could feel good about this show. [...] The financing, while critics cried foul, was private. [...] The show was by nature consented to directly by those who paid the bills, rather than passive taxpayers, and it was aimed at keeping the audience happy, rather than inciting rage with, say, US flags stuffed into toilets, as had been done in one famous museum exhibit decades earlier.|$|E

60|$|He {{began to}} {{accompany}} his {{mother on the}} meat-trail, and he saw much of the killing of meat and began to play his part in it. And in his own dim way he learned the law of meat. There were two kinds of life--his own kind and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kind.</b> His own kind included his mother and himself. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>kind</b> included all live things that moved. But <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kind</b> was divided. One portion was what his own kind killed and ate. This portion was composed of the non-killers and the small killers. The other portion killed and ate his own kind, or was killed and eaten by his own kind. And out of this classification arose the law. The aim of life was meat. Life itself was meat. Life lived on life. There were the eaters and the eaten. The law was: EAT OR BE EATEN. He did not formulate the law in clear, set terms and moralise about it. He did not even think the law; he merely lived the law without thinking about it at all.|$|E
