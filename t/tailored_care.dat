40|$|Background: Most {{studies of}} shared {{decision-making}} focus on acute treatment or screening decision-making encounters, yet {{a significant proportion}} of primary care is concerned with managing patients with chronic disease. Aim: To investigate provider perspectives on the role of patient involvement in chronic disease decision-making. Design: A qualitative, grounded theory study of patient involvement in diabetes care planning. Setting and participants: Interviews were conducted with 29 providers (19 general practitioners, eight allied health providers, and two endocrinologists) who participated in diabetes care planning. Results: Providers described a conflict between their responsibilities to deliver evidence-based diabetes care and to respect patients' rights to make decisions. While all were concerned with providing best possible diabetes care, they differed in the emphasis they placed on 'treating to target' or practicing 'personalized care'. Those preferring to 'treat to target' were more assertive, while 'personalized care' meant being more accepting of the patient's priorities. Providers sought to manage patient involvement in decision-making according to their objectives. 'Treating to target' meant involving patients where necessary to <b>tailor</b> <b>care</b> to their needs and abilities, but limiting patient involvement in decisions about the overall agenda. 'Personalized care' meant involving patients to <b>tailor</b> <b>care</b> to patient preference. Discussion and conclusions: Respecting a patient's autonomy and delivering high-quality diabetes care are important to providers. At times it may not be possible to do both, so a careful balance is required. Involving patients in decision-making may be a means to this end, rather than an end in itself...|$|R

40|$|Epilepsy is {{a serious}} {{neurological}} condition that has important medical, psychological and social consequences. Up to 90 % of patients with epilepsy are not under hospital supervision at any one time; {{the role of the}} general practitioner is therefore of central importance. There seems little doubt that community care of people with epilepsy must be improved. This article reviews the research findings on the quality of care of people with epilepsy, examines the barriers to effective community care, and looks at local and national initiatives to improve the care of patients with epilepsy in the community. Finally, the review considers how care can best be provided in an efficient, effective and acceptable manner within the resources of present day general practice.

40|$|One aim of {{this study}} was to explore the role, or subject position, {{patients}} take in the care they receive from nurses in their own home. Another was to examine the subject position that patients say the nurses take when giving care to them in their own home.

The findings show that patients constructed their subject position as ‘safeguard’, and the nurses’ subject position as ‘substitute’ for themselves. These subject positions provided the opportunities, and the obstacles, for the patients’ possibilities to receive care in their home. The subject positions described have ethical repercussions and illuminate that the patients put great demands on <b>tailored</b> <b>care...</b>|$|E

40|$|Stroke {{continues}} to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. According to the National Stroke Association (NSA, 2004) and the American Heart Association (AHA, 2004), there are over 750, 000 new or recurrent strokes per year, with many resulting in residual disability. Stroke survivors Often deal with the physical, psychosocial, and emotional consequences of stroke long after they have left the safety of professional rehabilitation. Patient instruction from nurses prior to discharge, while necessary, may be done at a point in the recovery process when the stroke survivor is not ready to learn how to deal with such consequences. Using the Mauk Model for Poststroke Recovery, nurses can identify which phase of recovery a survivor is in, and thus <b>tailor</b> <b>care</b> to his or her needs.

40|$|Surgical {{resection}} of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma {{offers a}} distinct benefit in long-term survival, {{but it is}} a complex procedure. The tumour may extend into segmental branches of the bile ducts, or involve the portal vein and/or hepatic artery. Curative-intent resection requires a combined extrahepatic bile duct and partial liver resection, sometimes including a portal vein resection and reconstruction. These extended procedures are associated with a high risk of postoperative mortality, even more so because many patients present with obstructive jaundice. Selecting the optimal treatment in patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma is a trade-off between opportunities for long-term survival against the danger of procedural risks: surgery offers a chance for long-term survival or cure, but perioperative complications may cause abrupt death. This thesis aimed to provide recommendations and clinical decision rules for <b>tailored</b> <b>care</b> in patients with resectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} an empirical {{evaluation of the}} human resources management (HRM) effectiveness in relation to quality of labor and quality of care in older people’s and nursing homes. The authors suggest that innovative policies, in terms of HRM and work design, {{increase the likelihood of}} lower stress rates and higher scores on quality of care. The data supply little empirical evidence for this hypothesis, which means that innovative policy practices have very little effect on the realities of stress, burnout, and individually <b>tailored</b> <b>care.</b> A question that arises from this is whether the search for best practices is then equal to a measure for nothing. This is not the authors ’ opinion. The reference framework for research must be turned round. This can be achieved by no longer starting from the normative (practice) theory but starting instead with excellent practice, which can teach researchers important content and policy lessons...|$|E
40|$|Introduction There {{is limited}} {{information}} about the experiences and educational needs of health professionals who {{may be required to}} provide care for people with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) especially in the later stages of the disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the experiences of, and need for, education of these health professionals. Methods Interviews and focus groups were conducted with 31 health professionals with some experience in providing palliative care for people with MND. Thematic content analysis was used to identify common themes. Results A key theme, Just One Step Ahead, emerged, that describes the central capability health professionals identified as necessary to help individuals plan and prepare for disease and lifestyle changes just before they arise. Two subthemes also emerged: Expertise in MND and Bespoke Communication. Expertise in MND described the required understanding of the disease and the particular individual's version of the disease to allow the health professional to plan, advise, support and anticipate the needs of the person living with MND. Bespoke Communication was the facility to <b>tailor</b> <b>care</b> messages sensitively and effectively to the range of people involved in care (patients, family, healthcare team members). Conclusions Care of people with MND requires up-to-date expertise about the disease and skilled communication abilities to manage complexity and change. Timely and focused education and specialist MND support for care providers are essential to <b>tailored</b> and responsive <b>care</b> and a widely available education programme has been developed to address these needs...|$|R
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative chronic kidney disease (CKD) guidelines, CKD has been identified as common, particularly in the elderly. The outcomes for those with CKD can be poor: mortality, initiation of renal replacement therapy, and progressive deterioration in kidney function, with its associated complications. In young people with CKD, the risk of poor outcome is high and the social cost substantial, but the actual number of patients affected is relatively small. In the elderly, the risk of poor outcome is substantially lower, but due to the high prevalence of CKD the actual number of poor outcomes attributable to CKD is higher. Predicting which patients are at greatest risk, and being able to <b>tailor</b> <b>care</b> appropriately, has significant potential benefits. Risk prediction models in CKD are being developed and show promise but thus far have limitations. In this review we describe the pathway for developing and evaluating risk prediction tools, and consider what models we have for CKD prediction and where next...|$|R

40|$|Shared {{decision-making}} is {{an essential}} - but often neglected - component of evidence-based medicine. In practice, doctors, nurses and patients encounter dilemmas which are understandable, but not insurmountable. We illustrate this {{by means of a}} complex decision concerning therapy in the advanced stage of Parkinson's disease. Evidence of effectiveness differs with each individual therapy, and, in practice, the experiences of neurologists also vary widely. In addition, the various treatment strategies all require a different sort of daily care, and have differing impacts on people's lives. It is time that we worked towards a realistic view of shared decision-making. Shared decision-making cannot be generalised to a 'one size fits all' strategy that we can choose to apply or not to apply at will. It should be a flexible instrument which, depending on the individual and the specific situation, can be put to use to deliver the best <b>tailored</b> <b>care...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies in}} breast cancer domains have {{identified}} seven distinct clinical phenotypes (groups) using immunohistochemical analysis {{and a variety of}} unsupervised learning techniques. Consensus among the clustering algorithms has been used to categorise patients into these specific groups, but often at the expenses of not classifying all patients. It is known that fuzzy methodologies can provide linguistic based classification rules to ease those from consensus clustering. The objective {{of this study is to}} present the validation of a recently developed extension of a fuzzy quantification subsethood-based algorithm on three sets of newly available breast cancer data. Results show that our algorithm is able to reproduce the seven biological classes previously identified, preserving their characterisation in terms of marker distributions and therefore their clinical meaning. Moreover, because our algorithm constitutes the fundamental basis of the newly developed Nottingham Prognostic Index Plus (NPI+), our findings demonstrate that this new medical decision making tool can help moving towards a more <b>tailored</b> <b>care</b> {{in breast cancer}}...|$|E
40|$|With {{escalating}} {{health expenditure}} and a shrinking purse, there is increased {{focus on the}} cost efficacy of still patented versus generic medications in general, and for atypical antipsychotics in particular. In a recent BMC Medicine article, Godman and colleagues presented data indicating poor uptake of the off patent atypical antipsychotic risperidone, arguing for authorities to mandate its greater use. This is under the assumption of clinical equivalence of atypical antipsychotics. This commentary argues that there are clinically meaningful differences between atypical antipsychotics and important inter-individual heterogeneity in clinical response and tolerability. Access to {{a broad range of}} atypical antipsychotics enables clinicians to tailor care, taking consideration of differential efficacy and adverse effects profile {{in order to meet the}} needs of individual patients with improved real world effectiveness of treatment. Restriction of agent choice risks detracting from optimal clinical care, with possible poorer outcomes and greater costs of care.
