5|$|Time Gal is a FMV-based game {{which uses}} {{pre-recorded}} animation rather than sprites {{to display the}} on-screen action. Gameplay is divided into levels, referred to as time periods. The game begins in 4001 AD with the theft of a time <b>travel</b> <b>device.</b> The thief, Luda, steals the device {{to take over the}} world by changing history. Reika, the protagonist also known as Time Gal, uses her own time <b>travel</b> <b>device</b> to pursue him; she travels to different time periods, such as 70,000,000 BC, 44 BC, 1588 AD, and 2010 AD, in search of Luda. Each time period is a scenario which presents a series of threats that must be avoided or confronted. Successfully navigating the sequences allows the player to progress to another period.|$|R
50|$|His current {{right arm}} is a prosthetic, stolen from Forge. A nuclear-powered battle-ready arm, {{incorporates}} in its design a time-travel device, {{the ability to}} channel his energy blasts through, and enhanced strength and resilience. It has since been destroyed after Bishop tried {{to use it to}} time travel from 6700 A.D. to 2010 to kill Cable and Hope Summers due to Cable tampering with the time <b>travelling</b> <b>device</b> within it.

5000|$|The plot {{follows a}} secret {{branch of the}} United States' National Security Agency which has {{developed}} a time <b>travelling</b> <b>device</b> based upon alien technology found at Roswell. As {{the opening of the}} show says, the Chronosphere, or Backstep Sphere, sends [...] "one human being back in time seven days" [...] to avert disasters. The show's name refers {{to the fact that the}} Backstep Project can only backstep seven days because of limitations imposed by the fuel source and its reactor. As the fuel source is limited, there is a strict mandate that they only Backstep for events relating to [...] "National Security". The backstep team and the equipment are stationed in a base called Never Never Land, which is in a secret location somewhere in the desert of Nevada.|$|E
50|$|The third Agent Axis first {{appeared}} in World's Finest Comics #250 (April/May 1979), and was created by Gerry Conway. He is a foe of the World's Finest Team: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Arrow and Black Canary. The heroes travel to Earth-One in the year 1942 to repair damages to the time stream caused by Ravager, a being {{with the ability to}} travel through time. Agent Axis is a Nazi agent who kills Professor Ronsom, an American scientist working on a time <b>travelling</b> <b>device,</b> who is in fact a younger incarnation of the Ravager himself. He later joins forces with the Ravager in order to bring the secrets of time travel to Nazi Germany. During a battle in Bavaria the World's Finest Team manages to activate the chronal transponder near the Ravager, returning the heroes to their proper time and place with no memory of the prior events. Presumably agent Axis is also returned to his correct place and time.|$|E
50|$|The urban legend (or {{alternate}} history) {{states that}} a facility manned by renegade Princeton professors conducted quantum physics and chaos theory experiments, {{and according to}} conspiracy theories, discovered a new theory for dimensional <b>travel</b> using a <b>device</b> called The EGG. This device was to later inspire a children's TV series called Galidor to use an interdimensional <b>travel</b> <b>device</b> of the same name. Ong's Hat is often cited as the first ARGs on many lists of alternate reality games.|$|R

50|$|Sea Monsters is a 2003 BBC {{television}} trilogy {{which used}} computer-generated imagery to show past life in Earth's seas. In the U.S. {{it was known}} as Chased by Sea Monsters. It was made by Impossible Pictures, the creators of Walking with Dinosaurs, Walking with Beasts and Walking with Monsters. In the series, the British wildlife presenter Nigel Marven is shown travelling to seven past seas {{in the history of}} the Earth and scuba diving there, in order of dangerousness with the most dangerous last. He travels in a white sailboat or motorboat roughly 24 m (80 ft) long named 'The Ancient Mariner'. His time <b>travelling</b> <b>device</b> is not mentioned or shown, and the closest thing to it is his time map, showing the timeline of the seven deadliest seas and the creatures that lived at the time. He uses a scuba set with a fullface mask so he can talk underwater to produce the commentary. He performs some dives using a strong shark cage, which is spherical to make it harder for large sea creatures to bite it.|$|E
40|$|Current {{transformers}} (CTs) are precision {{devices that}} scale high currents down to values {{that can be}} easily handled by measurement equipment. To support CT applications in revenue metering, a comparison on AC current transformer calibration systems was performed among 15 European national metrology institutes using a precision CT as the <b>travelling</b> <b>device.</b> The first comparison results for the transformation ratios (4, 5, 6, 8, 10) kA/ 5 A of the travelling CT at nominal burden of 5 VA and 15 VA indicate good agreement between the participating laboratories. The main differences are found for phase displacement, at least partly caused by the instability of the traveling standard...|$|E

50|$|Spock determines from {{questioning}} Mordreaux that he {{was imprisoned}} for developing and using a time <b>travel</b> <b>device.</b> Spock concludes that the older Mordreaux who murdered Kirk was from a different timeline in which Mordreaux became insane and returned to take revenge on those he blamed for his persecution. Since Kirk's death was committed through time travel, Spock constructs a time <b>travel</b> <b>device</b> {{to go back and}} try to save Kirk, without success; this results in Scotty's earlier observations. Spock then tries to go even farther back in time to repair the damage to spacetime caused by Mordreaux's earlier time travel; the naked singularity {{was one of the first}} physical manifestations of this damage. However, Spock's efforts are complicated by the proliferation of timelines and the difficulty in modifying them. During one of these trips, Spock encounters the younger Braithewaite on Aleph Prime, explaining why the lawyer found him familiar.|$|R
50|$|Simultaneously, Joseph Adams (another Yance-man) {{is put on}} {{a special}} mission by Brose.

40|$|Electronic <b>travel</b> <b>devices</b> {{are used}} to {{transform}} information about the environment that would normally be perceived through the visual sense into a form that can be perceived {{by people who are}} blind or have low vision through another sense (Blasch, Long, & Griffin-Shirley, 1989). They are divided into two broad categories: primary devices and secondary devices. A primary device is one that a person who is blind may use safely and efficiently by itself, independent of a cane or a dog guide. A secondary device is one that must be used in conjunction with a cane or a dog guide to ensure safe and efficient travel (Farmer, 1980). Electronic <b>travel</b> <b>devices</b> are further classified according to function and design. Type 1 devices (such as the Mowat, Polaron, and Sensory 6) are single-output devices for previewing the characteristics of an object ("object preview") and are commonly referred to as "go-no-go " systems. Type 2 devices (including the Laser Cane and Wheelchair Pathfinder) have multiple outputs for previewing objects and involve the use of lasers to provide a "go-no-go " source o...|$|R

5000|$|Gott also {{proposed}} a [...] "time mirror": a time <b>travel</b> <b>device</b> {{based on the}} principle of time delays. The device would be situated near a black hole some hundred or more light years from Earth. The device would act as a light collector and would power the light rays deformed and curved by the gravitational depression of the black hole. The collector would then reveal the past as detailed by the photons that had originated from Earth.|$|R

When he reawakens he finds that Bishop has stolen a robotic arm and all the notes on Cable's time <b>travel</b> <b>device.</b> He tries to rewrite the notes, but fails due to a time paradox. He instead starts to secure the Eagle's Nest against further attack, to prevent himself from being {{vulnerable}} again.|$|R
5|$|This {{episode is}} the forty-ninth from the fifth season of Adventure Time. Visually, the episode is framed having the {{important}} {{events of the}} story occur in its center, bordered circularly. Small polygonal creatures appear {{in the margins of}} the outer frame. Film and television critic Eric Kohn, in IndieWire, dubbed the inner frame a time bubble, absorbing the creatures Bubblegum experiments on with the time <b>travel</b> <b>device.</b> Following Lumpy having her memory erased in the episode, Johnnie appears in the outer frame.|$|R
