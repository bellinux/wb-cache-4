40|$|For both {{manufacturing}} companies and service firms, {{the basis of}} competition is shifting fast. Manufacturers are finding they must compete by selling services; service firms now have to provide products as well as services. The emerging battleground is known as “integrated solutions” and it is where leading companies such as IBM, General Electric, Rolls-Royce and EDS already compete aggressively. Rolls-Royce provides airlines with “power by the hour” selling engines along with the services to maintain and upgrade them over many years. Services provider EDS now manages and integrates different suppliers’ technologies and products {{as part of its}} business outsourcing solutions. However, the integrated solutions approach is {{not simply a matter of}} blending products and services. Customers are buying guaranteed solutions for trouble-free operations. So the key is to develop and deploy the right capabilities — and to structure the organization so these capabilities match customers’ needs. This article offers a blueprint for implementing integrated solutions, drawing on extensive research with such companies as Alstom <b>Transport,</b> <b>Cable</b> and Wireless, Thales, Ericsson and Atkins. The article highlights the importance of four prerequisite capabilities and shows the organization structures necessary for success — structures that are no longer bounded by product, service or geographic lines. The article then lays out three levels of organizational capability to chart the journey that integrated-solutions providers must take...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of cable propelled systems fully integrated to {{urban public transport}} systems has become an innovative trend in recent years, for some Colombian cities. The most prominent examples include the cities of Medellin and Manizales, where these infrastructures have been built and have been running for several years. In fact, it should be highlighted that Manizales hosted, {{during the first half}} of the 20 th century, the longest cable system in the world, which operated for nearly forty years and was a cornerstone in the development of the region. This historic cable allowed for the transportation of large shipments of coffee to the Magdalena River, so that they could be exported all over the world. In this paper we provide a thorough assessment of the cable system in Manizales. We evaluate its costs, in a comparative perspective against the impacts generated by the system, via time savings in daily travel; due to its full integration with the public transport system, we also provide empirical evidence or the related passenger demand variability. Upon the implementation of the first cable system, additional similar projects have been initiated. We provide an insight into a cable system designed for recreation, currently being built, and describe the planning process for the most recent public <b>transport</b> <b>cable</b> system being designed. All these systems are evaluated from the supply-side, measuring accessibility, from the demand-side, modeling the complete urban transport system for the city, and from the political side, describing the determinants of the decisions that ultimately stimulate the implementation of these projects in sustainable mobility. Based on the results obtained, we offer conclusions in regards to the actual competitiveness of cable propelled systems, arguing on whether these should be considered as valid urban passenger transport solutions...|$|E
