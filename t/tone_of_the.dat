5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part in the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel. The <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of}} the dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E

5|$|The {{critical}} {{reception for}} the episode was mostly positive. Many reviewers {{commented that the}} dark <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final episode was characteristic of the series, and that killing off the protagonist was an appropriate way to conclude. The characters of Victor and Margaret returned in a short sketch for Comic Relief's Red Nose Day telethon on 16 March 2001.|$|E

5|$|The {{tawny owl}} {{subspecies}} are often poorly differentiated, {{and may be}} at a flexible stage of subspecies formation with features related to the ambient temperature, the colour <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local habitat, {{and the size of}} available prey.

5|$|Arp and Janco {{drifted away}} from the {{movement}} ca. 1919, when they created the Constructivist-inspired workshop Das Neue Leben. In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity. When Vinea submitted his poem Doleanțe ("Grievances") {{to be published by}} Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between the reserved <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.|$|E

40|$|A {{new musical}} scale devised by the author, based on natural logarithms, is described. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{logarithmic}} pitches bear no correspondence to <b>the</b> twelve <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient tuning system attributed to Pythagoras, based on ratios of whole numbers, nor to <b>the</b> chromatic <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> scales in equal temperament used widely {{in the modern}} era. Logarithms obey a special arithmetic compared to whole and rational numbers, which {{can be heard in}} beat frequencies between <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale, suggesting extended harmonic possibilities by incorporating the beat frequencies into compositions. The author uses the broad term "non-Pythagorean" to describe the logarithmic musical scale, as <b>the</b> ratios <b>of</b> pitches are usually irrational numbers.

5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain {{that not all}} his life was fraud and exaggeration. They believe that aside from the bombast and boastful <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> account that carries his name, {{there is evidence that}} he carried out useful work, such his discovery of large-scale guano deposits which {{led to the development of}} a full-scale industry. He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, evidence to suggest that this death might have been staged, and that he lived on in exile, possibly in South America.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, Howling Bells {{recorded}} Heartstrings at Assault & Battery Studios, in London. The {{album was}} primarily produced by Marks, but Moulder supported {{the effort and}} was given credit as co-producer. Marks set the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment in the recording studio and the band felt extremely open and comfortable in her presence. Her female nature was credited with her ability to elicit exceptional performances from the band, more so than any of her record producer counterparts who worked with Howling Bells previously. The band moved on from former label Cooking Vinyl and established a partnership with Birthday Records, a small, independent record label founded by former Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Nick Hodgson.|$|E

Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial based references, impersonations & characterisations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic and his ability to speak in multiple accents and eight languages.|$|E

5|$|In the {{drafts of}} the Alien Resurrection screenplay, writer Joss Whedon {{included}} a death {{scene in which}} a lifeform was sucked through {{a gap in the}} hull of a ship. In the second draft, Perez was sucked through a fist-sized breach in the hull of the Auriga; this was changed in the final version to the Newborn being sucked through the window of the Betty. 20th Century Fox executives were skeptical about the final version, seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alien franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama {{was critical of}} former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speech, saying that the speech veered {{from that of a}} ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E
5|$|Starting in August 1941, when {{it became}} clear to some in the Propaganda Ministry and the Wehrmacht high command that the war would likely extend into 1942, Goebbels grew {{increasingly}} concerned about the triumphant <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communiques. However, a string of spectacular victories in September, especially in the Battle of Kiev, removed any restraint from the texts, making propagandists's work more difficult later on, when they had to explain the Wehrmacht's failures to the German public which was rapidly losing confidence in a swift victory.|$|E
25|$|Whistled {{language}} is rare compared to spoken language, {{but it is}} found in cultures around the world. It is especially common in tone languages where the whistled <b>tones</b> transmit <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syllables (<b>tone</b> melodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words). This might be because in tone languages the tone melody carries more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> functional load <b>of</b> communication while non-tonal phonology carries proportionally less. <b>The</b> genesis <b>of</b> a whistled language has never been recorded in either case and has not yet received much productive study.|$|R

50|$|Chinese language, Hmong-Mien {{languages}}, and Tai-Kadai {{languages are}} analytic languages that have similar grammar, pronunciation, and syllable structure.They {{all started with}} four tones, soon afterward developed into different phonological tones such as checked <b>tone</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voiced and voiceless properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial. <b>The</b> aspiration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial and <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vowel in checked tone led to further <b>tone</b> development <b>of</b> dialects in these languages. Cantonese in Jiangyang area for the Chinese language developed eight different <b>tones</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vowel. The aspiration property also determined <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> development <b>of</b> Tai-Kadai language, <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> eventually developed into sixteen types <b>of</b> <b>tone.</b> Zongdi dialect <b>of</b> Hmong-Mien language had also experienced the change in <b>tone</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aspiration property.|$|R
5|$|The 2009 {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as an origin story, but the project {{evolved into a}} re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer {{to feel a little}} sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes. Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.|$|E
5|$|The A and B {{clarinets}} {{have nearly}} the same bore and use the same mouthpiece. Orchestral clarinetists using the A and B instruments in a concert could use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A and B have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> E clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. The bass clarinet has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{letter was}} written in {{response}} to the many charges put forth by the British supporters of Wood's patent against the Irish, including claims of papal influence and of treason. A large portion of the letter is a response to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that Wood's coin could be beneficial to the Irish people. The <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> letter is clear: Wood's allies are promoting an evil that will harm Ireland. However, Wood is only a secondary target—figures like Walpole are mocked for their role in the controversy.|$|E
