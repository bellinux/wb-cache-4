Leonid Gorbovsky, whose Tariel II has delivered scientific equipment to Rainbow, pays {{a visit to}} Matvei Vyazanitsyn, the general director of the planet, then returns to his ship, when <b>the</b> <b>ominous</b> news come. Camill contacts (via videophone) the nearest scientist village and issues a warning that the Wave Sklyarov saw is closely followed by another one of a new type. According to him, it cannot be stopped like the ones before and therefore the Rainbow world council must begin the evacuation of the planet immediately. At this moment the Wave reaches Camill's observation tower and he dies once again.|$|E
25|$|After {{having his}} way with Aoi, Yuuko and Manaka are taken into the room via a secret door. With all 3 captured, Kimura reveals his plans to make them his sex slaves. Yuuko tries to cover for her daughters and pleads with him to take her instead. He {{considers}} this and tells Yuuko he might spare her daughters if she can prove her worth. Yuuko gives him a very long blowjob while her two daughters watch. When Kimura seems pleased at her performance, Yuuko thinks she has won her daughters' freedom. Instead, Kimura reveals that he will never change his mind {{and that they are}} all there to stay. Yuuko breaks down in the end, Manaka breaks next and finally Aoi as well. The game ends with <b>the</b> <b>ominous</b> title card that as a new day starts the Kiryu family horror has 'only just begun'.|$|E

25|$|Although several {{theories}} of the ultimate cause of the singer's death persist to this day (including a few rather sinister ones), given what is now known about cardiovascular disease, {{it seems likely that}} by {{the time of his death}} Vysotsky had an advanced coronary condition brought about by years of tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse, as well as his grueling work schedule and the stress of the constant harassment by the government. Towards the end, most of Vysotsky's closest friends had become aware of <b>the</b> <b>ominous</b> signs and were convinced that his demise was only a matter of time. Clear evidence of this can be seen in a video ostensibly shot by the Japanese NHK channel only months before Vysotsky's death, where he appears visibly unwell, breathing heavily and slurring his speech. Accounts by Vysotsky's close friends and colleagues concerning his last hours were compiled in the book by V. Perevozchikov.|$|E
25|$|After {{the guards}} release Prithvi, Nandita is possessed again in her bathroom, with same lines {{appearing}} in the mirror. She goes to Prithvi for help, but he refuses her, showing her a new painting in which she is hanging herself and the same lines seem to appear behind her. He also shows her some news clippings {{about the death of}} the priest and David Cooper, with the same lines written behind them. Nandita thanks him and leaves to attend a party with Yash. There she is possessed and attacked again, and starts bleeding. Meanwhile, Prithvi prepares himself to help Nandita by burning <b>the</b> <b>ominous</b> painting of Nandita, which symbolises that he will protect her. He spots Nandita running from the party, apparently bleeding, and follows her. He finally catches up to her in a slum, where he sees her writing the same lines as before with her blood. He tries to stop her, but realises that she is possessed. She then tries to commit suicide but he prevents her from doing so. Yash arrives to find Nandita in Prithvi's arms.|$|E
25|$|Long {{before the}} Tarnopol Ghetto was set up, {{and only two}} days after the arrival of the Wehrmacht, up to 2,000 Jews were killed in the provincial capital of Tarnopol, one-third of them by the Ukrainian People's Militia. Some of the victims have been decapitated. The SS shot the {{remaining}} two-thirds, in the same week. In Stanisławów – another provincial capital in the Kresy macroregion – the single largest massacre of Polish Jews prior to Aktion Reinhardt was perpetrated hand in glove by Orpo, SiPo and the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police (brought in from Lwów) on 12 October 1941; tables with sandwiches and bottles of vodka had been set up about the cemetery for shooters who needed to rest from the deafening noise of gunfire; 12,000 Jews were murdered before nightfall. A total of 31 deadly pogroms were carried out throughout the region in conjunction with the Belarusian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian Schuma. Further east, during the massacre in Jedwabne, over 300 Jews died (Institute of National Remembrance's Final Findings), burned alive in a barn set on fire by a group of Polish men in the presence of German Ordnungspolizei. The circumstances surrounding the events in Jedwabne are still debated, and include <b>the</b> <b>ominous</b> presence of the Einsatzgruppe Zichenau-Schroettersburg under SS-Obersturmführer Hermann Schaper deployed in Bezirk Bialystok, as well as German Nazi pressure, anti-Semitism, but also resentment over Jewish cooperation with the Soviet invaders during the Polish-Soviet War of 1920 as well as the alleged Jewish participation in anti-Polish terror following Soviet 1939 invasion of Kresy in accordance with the Nazi-Soviet Pact.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} summer, and early fall of 1995 saw {{the release of}} Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., and GZA's Liquid Swords, which {{would turn out to}} be the group's two most {{significant}} and well-received solo projects. Cuban Linx was a diverse, theatrical criminological epic that saw RZA move away from the raw, stripped-down beats of the early albums and towards a richer, cinematic sound more reliant on strings and classic soul samples. The album is highly notable in that it revived, and expanded the Mafioso rap subgenre, which started to decline several years beforehand. Lavish living and the crime underworld are referenced throughout using quotes from the John Woo movie The Killer, with the mystique of the Wu-Tang Clan deepened by the adoption of crime boss aliases and the crew name Wu-Gambinos. The album introduced a flurry of slang words to the rap lexicon, and many artists have gone on to imitate its materialism. Cuban Linx featured all but one Wu member, and featured the debut from Cappadonna. The album also featured rapper Nas, who was the first non-Wu-Tang-affiliated MC to appear on a Wu-Tang Clan album. GZA's Liquid Swords had a similar focus on inner-city criminology akin to Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, but it was far darker, both in GZA's grim lyrics and in <b>the</b> <b>ominous,</b> foreboding production that saw RZA experimenting more with keyboards than ever before. Liquid Swords features guest appearances from every Wu-Tang Clan member, and is linked together by excerpts from the movie Shogun Assassin. 1995 also saw the release of the Wu Wear clothing line, which {{would turn out to be}} massively successful, and influential on hip hop culture. It initially started as a mere way to make money from the demand for bootleg Wu-Tang Clan shirts, and evolved into an extensive collection of designer garments. Soon, other hip hop artists were making similar ventures and by the mid-2000s, a clothing line was almost a prerequisite for hip hop superstardom, with clothing lines launched by Puff Daddy, Jay-Z, Busta Rhymes, Nelly, Ludacris, 50 Cent, and more.|$|E
25|$|At the Manor Christmas party, Will {{once again}} sees Dawson and Old George {{who seem to}} know him well. Miss Greythorne and Merriman debate about {{when and how to}} {{approach}} Will about his destiny. Maggie Barnes (Amelia Warner), an attractive local girl appears at the party and Will becomes upset when one of his older brothers approaches her and begins chatting to her. Will leaves the Manor, and an ominous figure mounted on a white horse and accompanied by dogs chases Will. As <b>the</b> <b>ominous</b> figure prepares to kill Will, who is currently no match for him, Miss Greythorne, Merriman, Dawson, and Old George suddenly appear and save Will. Merriman names the threatening figure as The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), who warns them all that in five days' time his power – The Dark – will rise. The four adults are the last of the Old Ones – ancient warriors who serve The Light – and take Will on a walk through time and space to a place called the Great Hall, which in the present day is the church the Stantons attend. Will is the last of the Old Ones to have been born: he is the seventh son of a seventh son whose power begins to ascend on his fourteenth birthday, though Will disputes this idea because he believes he is the sixth son. Will is The Seeker: the sign-seeker who must locate six Signs whose possession will grant The Light power over The Dark. The Rider is also seeking them. Will returns home to his attic room and falls and twists his ankle. The doctor who calls is The Rider in disguise but he is recognized by Will. The Rider demonstrates his powers on Will’s ankle by alternately healing it and making it much worse before restoring it to its injured state; he offers Will the chance to have any desire he wants fulfilled in exchange for giving him the signs. Will discovers he has a lost twin brother named Tom, who, as a baby, mysteriously disappeared one night and was never found. Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning superhuman strength, commanding light and fire, telekinesis, stepping through time, and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted.|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Robert Christgau found the Wu-Tang Clan [...] "grander" [...] and [...] "goofier" [...] than their West Coast contemporaries and concluded, [...] "Expect the masterwork this album's reputation suggests and you'll probably be disappointed—it will speak directly only to indigenous hip hoppers. Expect a glorious human mess, {{as opposed to}} <b>the</b> <b>ominous</b> platinum product of their opposite numbers, and you'll realize the dope game isn't everyone's dead-end street".

500|$|... "Séance Time" [...] is {{the sixth}} and final episode of the second series of the British dark comedy {{anthology}} television programme Inside No. 9. It was first broadcast on 29 April 2015 on BBC Two. The episode was written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, and directed by Dan Zeff. It stars Pemberton, Shearsmith, Alison Steadman, Alice Lowe, Sophie McShera, Dan Starkey, Cariad Lloyd and Caden-Ellis Wall. The episode begins with Tina (McShera) arriving at a Victorian villa for a séance. Hives (Shearsmith) sits her at a table and then escorts <b>the</b> <b>ominous,</b> shrouded Madam Talbot (Steadman) into the room.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Summaries of Work done at Little Rock Arsenal, C.S.A." [...] {{continue}} {{at about the}} same pace and scale from August 1862 until August 1863. Appended to the [...] "Summary" [...] for August, 1863 is <b>the</b> <b>ominous</b> notation, [...] "During the last week in the month, nearly all stores at the Arsenal have been packed and sent to Arkadelphia, in obedience to orders from Chief of Ordnance, District of Arkansas." [...] This then marks the beginning of the evacuation of ordnance activities from Little Rock, with the city being surrendered to the advancing Federal troops of Frederick Steele's Arkansas Expedition on September 11, 1863.|$|E
500|$|After an emotionless strings passage which {{encloses}} another brief {{warning from}} violas, woodwinds cry out amid a percussive background. While the monotonous rhythm of snare drum sustains, violins respond tortuously, {{only to be}} overwhelmed by {{the mood of the}} [...] "savage and destructively egotistical" [...] (Simpson’s description) clarinet and flute. The turmoil continues as the bass struggles up a dominant from C to G, invoking a new clash between snare drum and percussion; the attempt at struggle fails as the bass is foiled at G flat when <b>the</b> <b>ominous</b> violin melody is distorted and disintegrates. The huge incongruity between harmonic and melodic parameters threatens the music with fracture and collapse. After gloomy phrases from various woodwinds, the music fades, leaving a feebly pulsing D with tiny hints of percussion sounds.|$|E

500|$|Arguing that The Day After Tomorrow is [...] "kinda like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey... for kids", science-fiction {{writer and}} {{reviewer}} Christopher Mills expresses disappointment with {{the effect of}} the black hole itself, but describes the fall into the anomaly as [...] "very colourful". However, in contrast with Muir, he views the sequences set inside Altares during the descent as [...] "a bit of a hoot", directing particular criticism at the actors' exaggerated gesticulations. Commenting that the plot contains [...] "plenty of wonky pseudo-science and insanely improbable coincidences", Mills also recalls his fascination at [...] "how 'British'... the characters , facing each new peril with remarkable calm and 'stiff upper lip' stoicism. By the time they're caught in the clutches of <b>the</b> <b>ominous</b> black hole, they're apparently so resigned to being jerked around by the universe that they just hold hands and calmly await their fate." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} game's promotion, Bethesda {{employed}} COPILOT Music and Sound {{to develop}} <b>the</b> <b>ominous</b> [...] "The Drunken Whaler", {{a modified version of}} the sea shanty [...] "Drunken Sailor". Copilot decided to use ordinary children to sing the lyrics instead of a professional youth choir, aiming to achieve a dark, haunting quality to the music. However, they found it difficult to recruit children from local schools to sing about slit throats and hungry rats, and instead used child actors, adult singers who could imitate children, and the children of their friends. Instruments included violins, detuned and distorted guitars, and a [...] "whaler stomp" [...] created by the team, who stamped on wooden boards to create a pulsating sound. [...] "The Drunken Whaler" [...] appeared in the game's trailer and attracted a positive reception during its presentation at the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). Following its debut, the trailer was watched over 850,000 times on YouTube, and it was awarded the Machinima Best Trailer award.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] {{want to be on the}} radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' <b>the</b> <b>ominous</b> professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|E
