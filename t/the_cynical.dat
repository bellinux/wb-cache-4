5|$|Hellblazer {{boosted the}} {{popularity}} and {{image of the}} occult detective fiction genre and shaped it to its modern form. Many modern examples of the genre such as Hellboy, Supernatural, Grimm, The Originals, and The Dresden Files {{have been influenced by}} it, and many imitators of both the series and its character flourished such as Criminal Macabre, Gravel, Planetary, and others. Its elements and style have been used countless of times in other works and many analogues of <b>the</b> <b>cynical</b> John Constantine have appeared.|$|E

5|$|Manju (Sripriya) {{was raised}} in a {{dysfunctional}} family that consisted of a timid father and a philandering mother; she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another, leading to her degenerating into a cynical woman. Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu (Rajinikanth), who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun (Kamal Haasan), who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at <b>the</b> <b>cynical</b> attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.|$|E

25|$|However, it is {{fact that}} {{four out of}} five Germans {{complain}} about too much stress. One in six under 60 swallows at least once a week, a pill for the soul, whether it is against insomnia, depression or just for a bit more drive in the stressful everyday life. The phases of burnout can be described, among other things, first by great ambition, then follows the suppression of failure, isolation and finally, <b>the</b> <b>cynical</b> attitude towards the employer or supervisor. Concerned persons have very often also anxiety disorders and depressions, which are serious mental diseases. Depressions are the predominant causes of the nearly 10,000 suicides that occur alone each year in Germany. The implications of such imbalances can be further measured in figures: In 1993, early retirement due to mental illness still made 15.4 percent of all cases. In 2008, there were already 35.6 percent. Even in the days of illness, the proportion of failures due to mental disorders increased. Statisticians calculated that 41 million absent days in 2008 went to the account of these crises, which led to 3.9 billion euros in lost production costs.|$|E

He further explained that the emotional responses of people he knew who were in relationships seemed [...] "incredibly insincere and blown out of proportion" [...] and inspired <b>the</b> <b>cynical</b> lyrics of the song.|$|E

500|$|Elections {{director}} Alexander Payne {{was eager}} to cast Witherspoon as Tracy, based on her performances in Freeway and the 1991 film The Man in the Moon, and Witherspoon was equally eager {{to sign on to}} the project—but not to play Tracy.

500|$|Troilus and Cressidas sources include Chaucer, Lydgate, Caxton and Homer, {{but there}} are creations of Shakespeare's own too and his tone is very different.

Shakespeare's treatment of the theme of Troilus' love is much more cynical than Chaucer's, and the character of Pandarus is now grotesque. Indeed, all the heroes of the Trojan War are degraded and mocked. Troilus' actions are subject to the gaze and commentary of both the venal Pandarus and of <b>the</b> <b>cynical</b> Thersites who tells us: ...|$|E
