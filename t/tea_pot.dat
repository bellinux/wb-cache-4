25|$|Many of {{the active}} {{substances}} in black tea do not develop at temperatures lower than 90°C (194°F). As a result, black tea in the West is usually steeped in water near its boiling point, at around 99°C (210°F). The most common fault when making black tea is to use water at too low a temperature. Since boiling point drops with increasing altitude, {{it is difficult to}} brew black tea properly in mountainous areas. Warming the <b>tea</b> <b>pot</b> before steeping is critical at any elevation.|$|E
25|$|Generally, 4grams of tea per 200 ml of water. Unlike green teas, which turn bitter when brewed {{at higher}} temperatures, black tea should be steeped in water {{brought up to}} 90–95°C. The first brew should be 60 sec., the second brew 40 sec., and the third brew 60 sec. If your tea is of high quality, you can {{continue}} to brew by progressively adding 10 sec. to the brew time following the third infusion (note: when using a larger <b>tea</b> <b>pot</b> the ratio of tea to water {{will need to be}} adjusted to achieve similar results).|$|E
25|$|At higher Reynolds numbers, {{the flow}} became chaotic {{resulting}} in broad-band sound. The hole tone has been rediscovered {{in the form}} of the <b>tea</b> <b>pot</b> whistle. They found that above a Reynolds number of 2000, hole tone operation occurred with symmetric vortex evolution and a constant Strouhal number with Reynolds number. Comparison of their data with data in the figure suggests that the cylindrical enclosure between the two orifices raises the Strouhal number. There was no mention of frequency jumps. They noted that at lower speeds, the cylindrical volume responded as a Helmholtz resonator. Baron Rayleigh was aware of this whistle; it was called the bird call then.|$|E

25|$|Wilson and {{his colleagues}} have {{simulated}} the human whistle by creating a cylinder 2.04 inches in diameter with a rounded orifice at one end that supplied a jet and another rounded orifice {{at the other end of}} the same diameter and on the same axis. The geometry was very similar to that of the <b>tea</b> <b>pot</b> whistle. After a number of tests at various speeds, orifice diameters, and orifice thicknesses, they concluded that the whistle was created by a Helmholtz resonance in the cylinder volume. There was enough data for one case in their study to calculate the Strouhal and Reynolds numbers. The results are shown in the figure on the right.|$|E
