It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds. In 1941 he began working with uranium hexafluoride, the only known gaseous compound of uranium, {{and was able to}} separate uranium-235. At Columbia, Urey had Karl Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.|$|E

However, Maynard dies after he gets locked in <b>the</b> <b>centrifuge,</b> and Nico manages to escape by tricking Spallaci's men. Back in Rome, Nico informs George that the monatomic gold {{is being used to}} build a weapon called the Ark. They return to the monastery and witness Father Gregor shoot Gianelli; Nico is taken away and George is knocked out. When he awakens, the dying Gianelli hands over a manuscript in Latin, and tells him that the Ark's purpose is to use the monatomic gold to destroy the unbelievers. George goes to rescue Nico and meets Anna Maria in the catacombs, who tells him her side of the story and that the Ark needs a human interface to be activated. George arrives at the ceremony to see Nico chained to the Ark, ready to become the new Angel of Death. Mevlut, who is in fact ex-Turkish security and only pretended to be a waiter and priest, enters the scene armed with a gun, but Anna Maria points her gun at him as well. George succeeds in stopping the ceremony in time and frees Nico, but Anna Maria and Mevlut shoot each other and die.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} coup, the clandestine nuclear energy project {{was no longer}} a secret to the outside world. Part of his {{strategy}} was the promotion of nuclear proliferation in anti-western states (such as North Korea, Iran, and communist China) to aid their own nuclear ambitions, to divert international attention which was difficult. In 1981, Zia contracted with China when he sent weapon-grade uranium to China and also built <b>the</b> <b>centrifuge</b> laboratory which increasingly enhanced the Chinese nuclear programme. This act encouraged Abdul Qadeer Khan, who allegedly tried to aid the Libyan nuclear programme but because Libya–Pakistan relations were strained, Khan was warned of serious consequences.

25|$|Following {{the crew}} wake up call, the two crews {{set to work}} on the day's planned activities. Fincke and Magnus tested latches on the Exposed Facility Berthing Mechanism for the Japanese Kibo laboratory.

The component ran initially on Thursday evening, but shut itself down during that initial test, and shut down again the following morning after two hours of operations.

500|$|For {{spacecraft}} interior shots, ostensibly {{containing a}} giant centrifuge that produces artificial gravity, Kubrick had a [...] rotating [...] "ferris wheel" [...] built by Vickers-Armstrong Engineering Group {{at a cost}} of $750,000. The set was [...] in diameter and [...] wide. Various scenes in the Discovery centrifuge were shot by securing set pieces within the wheel, then rotating it while the actor walked or ran in sync with its motion, keeping him {{at the bottom of the}} wheel as it turned. The camera could be fixed to the inside of the rotating wheel to show the actor walking completely [...] "around" [...] the set, or mounted in such a way that the wheel rotated independently of the stationary camera, as in the jogging scene where the camera appears to alternately precede and follow the running actor. The shots where the actors appear on opposite sides of the wheel required one of the actors to be strapped securely into place at the [...] "top" [...] of the wheel as it moved to allow the other actor to walk to the [...] "bottom" [...] of the wheel to join him. The most notable case is when Bowman enters <b>the</b> <b>centrifuge</b> from the central hub on a ladder, and joins Poole, who is eating on the other side of <b>the</b> <b>centrifuge.</b> This required Gary Lockwood to be strapped into a seat while Keir Dullea walked toward him from the opposite side of the wheel as it turned with him.|$|E
500|$|Scaling this up to a {{production}} plant presented a formidable technical challenge. Urey and Cohen estimated that producing a kilogram (2.2lb) of uranium-235 per day would require up to 50,000 centrifuges with [...] rotors, or 10,000 centrifuges with [...] rotors, assuming that 4-meter rotors could be built. The prospect of keeping so many rotors operating continuously {{at high speed}} appeared daunting, and when Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required. Beams, Urey and Cohen then began work {{on a series of}} improvements which promised to increase the efficiency of the process. However, frequent failures of motors, shafts and bearings at high speeds delayed work on the pilot plant. In November 1942 <b>the</b> <b>centrifuge</b> process was abandoned by the Military Policy Committee following a recommendation by Conant, Nichols and August C. Klein of Stone & Webster.|$|E
