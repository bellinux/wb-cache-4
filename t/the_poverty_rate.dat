2500|$|Another way {{of looking}} at poverty is in {{relative}} terms. [...] "Relative poverty" [...] can be defined as having significantly less income and wealth than other members of society.

25|$|Government {{safety net}} {{programs}} {{put in place}} since the War on Poverty have helped reduce <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>rate</b> from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012, according to a Supplemental Poverty Model (SPM) created by Columbia University, while the official U.S. Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by itself {{has done little to}} reduce poverty. According to the 2013 Columbia University study which created the (SPM) method of measuring poverty, without such programs <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>rate</b> would be 29% today. An analysis of the study by Kevin Drum suggests the American welfare state effectively reduces poverty among the elderly but provides relatively little assistance to the working-age poor. A 2014 study by Pew Charitable Trusts shows that without social programs like food stamps, social security and the federal EITC, <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>rate</b> in the U.S. would be much higher. Nevertheless, the U.S. has the weakest social safety net of all developed nations. Sociologist Monica Prasad of Northwestern University argues that this developed because of government intervention rather than lack of it, which pushed consumer credit for meeting citizens' needs rather than applying social welfare policies as in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> among solo mothers vary a lot between {{countries}} {{there is one}} common feature: solo mothers perform worse in terms of financial resources compared to married or cohabiting mothers. Even in countries with low <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> in general, <b>the</b> differences in income between solo mothers and married/cohabiting mothers remain and are significant. It is interesting {{to ask the question}} why? Again referring to a cross national setting we see that <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> vary widely {{between countries}} and this raises the hypothesis that different factors play a role in determining solo mothers' economic well being. In this paper the main question is: What is preventing Swedish and Belgian solo mothers from poverty? Sweden and Belgium are interesting to look at for several reasons. Looking at <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> for solo mothers in both countries, we see that they are low compared to many other countries. Sweden in 1992 and Belgium in 1990 had <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> for solo mothers of 3. 8 % (Hobson and Takahashi, 1997) and 8 % (Bradshaw, 1996 a) whereas <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> for solo mothers in some other European countries were much higher: The Netherlands (20. 9 %) (1991) Germany (41 %) (1990) United Kingdom (58 %) (1990) 2. Although both countries have relatively low <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> for solo mothers, {{they do not have the}} same type of social policies. If we take Esping-Andersen's typology of welfare regimes (1990) as a point of reference we find two different welfare regimes. Sweden is defined as a social democratic welfare state and Belgium as a conservative/corporatist welfare state. 3. One would expect the latter to be more orientated towards the male breadwinner ideology with worse outcomes for women without male breadwinner, This is apparently not the case for solo mothers in Belgium. All this makes it interesting to look at these two countries. Is public policy the main reason for <b>the</b> low <b>poverty</b> <b>rates</b> and how can it be explained that different policies have almost the same outcomes...|$|R
