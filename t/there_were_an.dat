5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E

After the war {{a small group of}} breeders worked to save the Exmoor, and during the 1950s ponies began to be exported to North America.

5|$|As an {{important}} industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, {{particularly during the}} Manchester Blitz of December 1940.

The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended.

5|$|At La Brea, predatory {{birds and}} mammals were {{attracted}} to dead or dying herbivores that had become mired, and then these predators became trapped themselves. Herbivore entrapment was estimated to have occurred once every fifty years, and for every instance of herbivore remains found in the pits <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> estimated ten carnivores. C.d.guildayi {{is the most common}} carnivoran found at LaBrea, followed by Smilodon. Remains of dire wolves outnumber remains of gray wolves in the tar pits by a ratio of five to one. During the Last Glacial Maximum, coastal California, with a climate slightly cooler and wetter than today, is thought to have been a refuge, and a comparison of the frequency of dire wolves and other predator remains at LaBrea to other parts of California and North America indicates significantly greater abundances; therefore, the higher dire wolf numbers in the LaBrea region did not reflect the wider area. Assuming that {{only a few of the}} carnivores that were feeding became trapped, it is likely that fairly sizeable groups of dire wolves fed together on these occasions.|$|E
