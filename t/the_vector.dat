5|$|The {{electric}} field was formally {{defined as the}} force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: the {{electric field}} is the local gradient of the electric potential. Usually expressed in voltspermetre, <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> direction of the field is the line of greatest slope of potential, and where the equipotentials lie closest together.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the scientific method from about the mid-19th century on demanded testable hypotheses and verifiable phenomena for causation and transmission. Anecdotal reports, and the discovery in 1881 that mosquitos were <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> of yellow fever, {{eventually led to the}} investigation of mosquitoes in connection with malaria.|$|E
5|$|Amanita phalloides {{has been}} {{conveyed}} to new countries across the Southern Hemisphere with {{the importation of}} hardwoods and conifers.

Recreational and sport fishing, including fishing led by a professional guide, will not require a CFIA permit.|$|E
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{in animals}} usually known as path integration, means the putting {{together}} of cues from different sensory sources within the body, {{without reference to}} visual or other external landmarks, to estimate position relative to a known starting point continuously while travelling on a path {{that is not necessarily}} straight. Seen as a problem in geometry, the task is to compute <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Russian {{government}} announced {{that all of}} its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to <b>the</b> <b>Vector</b> Institute in Koltsovo. With {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union and unemployment of many of the weapons program's scientists, U.S. government officials have expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who might wish to use virus as means of biological warfare. Specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect, however, proved to be mistaken.|$|E

2500|$|The latter {{definition}} {{ignores the}} direction of <b>the</b> <b>vectors</b> and thus describes the angle between one-dimensional subspaces [...] and [...] spanned by <b>the</b> <b>vectors</b> [...] and [...] correspondingly.|$|R
50|$|These vectors can {{be thought}} of as a series of stages or tasks that deal with feeling, thinking, believing, and {{relating}} to others. Individuals may progress through <b>the</b> <b>vectors</b> at different rates. <b>The</b> <b>vectors</b> have a tendency to interact with each other, and this can cause reevaluation of issues associated with vectors that had already been worked through. Although <b>the</b> <b>vectors</b> do build on one another, <b>the</b> <b>vectors</b> do not follow a strict sequential order. Developing in multiple vectors allows individuals to function with greater stability and intellectual complexity.|$|R
5|$|The orbital angular {{momentum}} of electrons is quantized. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that {{is proportional to the}} {{angular momentum}}. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital (so called, paired electrons) cancel each other out.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematics}} terminology, <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> {{space of}} bras is the dual space to <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> space of kets, and corresponding bras and kets are related by the Riesz representation theorem.|$|E
25|$|Since the physicist's {{concept of}} force has a {{direction}} and a magnitude, {{it may be}} seen as a vector. As an example, consider a rightward force F of 15 newtons. If the positive axis is also directed rightward, then F is represented by <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> 15 N, and if positive points leftward, then <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> for F is −15 N. In either case, the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> is 15 N. Likewise, <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> representation of a displacement Δs of 4 meters would be 4 m or −4 m, depending on its direction, and its magnitude would be 4 m regardless.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> Laplace–Runge–Lenz <b>vector</b> {{is named}} after Pierre-Simon de Laplace, Carl Runge and Wilhelm Lenz. It {{is also known as}} <b>the</b> Laplace <b>vector,</b> <b>the</b> Runge–Lenz <b>vector</b> and <b>the</b> Lenz <b>vector.</b> Ironically, none of those {{scientists}} discovered it. [...] <b>The</b> LRL <b>vector</b> has been re-discovered several times and is also equivalent to <b>the</b> dimensionless eccentricity <b>vector</b> of celestial mechanics. [...] Various generalizations of <b>the</b> LRL <b>vector</b> have been defined, which incorporate the effects of special relativity, electromagnetic fields and even different types of central forces.|$|R
5000|$|A lexicode of minimum {{distance}} d and length n over a finite field {{is generated by}} starting with <b>the</b> all-zero <b>vector</b> and iteratively adding <b>the</b> next <b>vector</b> (in lexicographic order) of minimum Hamming distance d from <b>the</b> <b>vectors</b> added so far.

25|$|Although an {{explicit}} inverse {{is not necessary}} to estimate <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> of unknowns, it is unavoidable to estimate their precision, found in the diagonal of the posterior covariance matrix of <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> of unknowns.|$|E
25|$|The algebraically {{imaginary}} part, being geometrically {{constructed by}} a straight line, or radius vector, which has, in general, for each determined quaternion, a determined length and determined direction in space, {{may be called}} <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> part, or simply <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> of the quaternion.|$|E
25|$|The flaviviruses can {{be divided}} into 2 clades: one with <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> borne viruses and the other with no known vector. <b>The</b> <b>vector</b> clade in turn can be {{subdivided}} into a mosquito borne clade and a tick borne clade. These groups {{can be divided}} again.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, the {{exterior}} algebra of a vector space (or, more generally, of a module over a commutative ring) is an associative algebra that contains <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> space (or module), and {{such that the}} square of any element of <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> space (or module) is zero. The exterior algebra is universal {{in the sense that}} every embedding of <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> space or module in an algebra that has these properties may be factored through {{the exterior}} algebra.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>vector</b> of {{the eclipse}} path at the {{midpoint}} of the eclipse aligning with <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> of the Earth's rotation (i.e. not diagonal but due east). For solar eclipses at the ascending node (odd numbered saros) this occurs approximately 12 days after the summer solstice.|$|E
25|$|First, <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> {{equality}} will {{be inserted}} {{for the first}} term in the force equation above. Maxwell's equation will be substituted in for the second term in <b>the</b> <b>vector</b> equality. Then the two terms which contain time derivatives can be combined into a single term.|$|E
5000|$|... where [...] is {{the angle}} between the {{directions}} of <b>the</b> two <b>vectors,</b> <b>the</b> intensity {{will be the}} highest if <b>the</b> normal <b>vector</b> points in <b>the</b> same direction as <b>the</b> light <b>vector</b> ( [...] , <b>the</b> surface will be perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} light), and the lowest if <b>the</b> normal <b>vector</b> is perpendicular to <b>the</b> light <b>vector</b> ( [...] , <b>the</b> surface runs parallel with the direction of the light).|$|R
25|$|A {{number is}} a square if every number in its {{exponent}} vector is even. For example, <b>the</b> <b>vectors</b> (3,0,0,1) and (1,2,0,1) add to (4,2,0,2), so (56)(126) is a square. Searching for a square requires knowledge {{only of the}} parity of the numbers in <b>the</b> <b>vectors,</b> so {{it is possible to}} reduce <b>the</b> entire <b>vector</b> mod 2 and perform addition of elements mod 2: (1,0,0,1) + (1,0,0,1) = (0,0,0,0). This is particularly efficient in practical implementations, as <b>the</b> <b>vectors</b> can be represented as bitsets and addition mod 2 reduces to bitwise XOR.|$|R
50|$|Example Simple {{examples}} of this include <b>the</b> velocity <b>vector</b> in Euclidean space, which is <b>the</b> tangent <b>vector</b> of <b>the</b> position <b>vector</b> (considered {{as a function of}} time). Also, the acceleration is <b>the</b> tangent <b>vector</b> of <b>the</b> velocity.|$|R
