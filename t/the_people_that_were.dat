Before the cover of Sgt.

The Beatles—according to McCartney—needed a new name, so on the flight back to England, Evans and McCartney played with words {{to see if they}} could come up with something new. Evans innocently asked McCartney what the letters [...] "S" [...] and [...] "P" [...] stood for on the pots on their meal trays, and McCartney explained that it was for salt and pepper, which led to the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band name. They arrived back in London on 19 November 1966. Before the cover of Sgt.

500|$|Stephanie Chamberlain in {{her article}} [...] "Fantasicing" [...] Infanticide: Lady Macbeth and the Murdering Mother in Early Modern England" [...] argues that though Lady Macbeth wants power, her power is “conditioned on maternity”, which was a “conflicted status in early modern England.” Chamberlain argues that the {{negative}} images of Lady Macbeth as a mother figure, such as when she discusses her ability to [...] "bash the brain of the babe that sucks her breast", reflect controversies concerning the image of motherhood in early modern England. In early modern England, mothers were often accused of hurting <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> placed in their hands. Lady Macbeth then personifies all mothers of early modern England who were condemned for Lady Macbeth’s fantasy of infanticide. Lady Macbeth’s fantasy, Chamberlain argues, is not struggling to be a man, but rather struggling with the condemnation of being a bad mother that was common during that time.|$|E
500|$|The {{fall of the}} Vreede-Fijnje Bewind {{opened the}} way for the actual {{implementation}} of the new constitution. The [...] "Interim Directory" [...] that now came to power (consisting of a few of the dissenting Agenten) made haste with organizing elections for the Representative Assembly that convened on 31 July. By the middle of August a new Uitvoerend Bewind had been appointed and the Agenten who had been behind the coup, resumed their original positions. This new regime now started to implement the policies that their radical predecessors had written into the constitution. The coup of June therefore was not a reactionary revolution, but only brought about a change in personnel. Soon most of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> arrested at both the January and June coups were released in the spirit of reconciliation that the new regime advocated. The make-up of the Representative Assembly closely resembled that of the second National Assembly of 1797.|$|E
500|$|The {{field of}} 34 drivers {{was the biggest}} in an IndyCar series race in 14 years. A typical oval track race has six to eight fewer drivers, except for the Indianapolis 500, which {{normally}} has a 33-car field. ESPN.com senior motorsports writer Terry Blount wrote: [...] "Obviously more cars presents more danger.

Chris Powell, president of Las Vegas Motor Speedway, defended the race, saying that the circuit had passed all of the IndyCar Series' accreditation procedures and was deemed suitable for racing. He also went on the record to say that despite the media reporting the concerns of several drivers over the safety of the event, none of those concerns had been raised with him.|$|E

According to some sources, the IRA claimed to have killed two surveillance officers allegedly hidden in the laundry van, and two MRF members at the massage parlour.

[...] "I think for us, the reason why we signed with Columbia was because of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> there.

2500|$|Although the CMAS {{proved to}} not have a {{feminine}} bias, Quarter and Laxer found that females tend to score higher on the TMAS than their male counterparts. An example of these questions endorsed more frequently by females is, “I cry easily”. Similarly, Goodstein and Goldberger found that 17 of the 38 questions {{were more likely to}} be endorsed by females than males. [...] Gall found that when she tested the femininity versus masculinity qualities of men and women, then compared them to the TMAS score, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> more feminine, either male or female, were more likely to have a positive correlation with their anxiety level score. Based on this, Gall agreed with previous research that stated the TMAS is more strongly female based.

2500|$|A Midrash taught that, as {{reported}} in the words [...] "Judah came near to him" [...] in [...] Judah did not cease from answering Joseph word for word until he penetrated to his very heart. Rabbi Judah taught that in the words of [...] "Judah came near" [...] for battle, as in 2 Samuel [...] where it says: [...] "So Joab and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> with him drew near to battle." [...] Rabbi Nehemiah said that [...] "Judah came near" [...] for conciliation, as in [...] where it says that [...] "the children of Judah drew near to Joshua" [...] to conciliate him. The Rabbis said that coming near implies prayer, as in 1 Kings [...] where it says that [...] "Elijah the prophet came near" [...] to pray to God. Rabbi Leazar combined all these views, teaching that [...] "Judah came near to him" [...] ready for battle, conciliation, or prayer. Rabbi Jeremiah ben Shemaiah taught that Judah exclaimed that he would only need to utter one word (dabar) and bring a plague (deber) upon the Egyptians. And Rav Hanan taught that Judah became angry, and the hairs of his chest pierced through his clothes and forced their way out, and he put iron bars into his mouth and ground them to powder.|$|E
2500|$|Winona LaDuke (Anishinabeg), {{the author}} of Reclaiming the Sacred: The Power of Naming and Claiming has argued that [...] "Papal law was the {{foundation}} of colonialism" [...] and [...] "Centuries of papal bulls posited the supremacy of Christendom over all other beliefs, sanctified manifest destiny, and authorized even the most brutal practices of colonialism." [...] Through colonization, Indigenous people became subject to a racist patriarchal system that significantly shifted the social, economic, and cultural practices of pre-contact Indigenous societies. The economic, political, and spiritual power granted to women in Indigenous communities was threatening to the arriving Europeans who used [...] "Xenophobia and a deep fear of Native spiritual practices" [...] to justify genocide {{as a means of}} domination. Kim Anderson writes in her book A Recognition of Being: Reconstructing Native Womanhood that [...] "the Europeans who first arrived in Canada were shocked by the position of Aboriginal women in their respective societies. It was not long before they realized that, in order to dominate the land and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> occupying it, they needed to disempower the women. Indigenous systems that allocated power to women were incompatible with the kind of colonial power dynamics that would be necessary to maintain colonial power." [...] Additionally, [...] "while women's traditional roles in Indigenous communities vary widely, colonization has reordered gender relations to subordinate women, regardless of their pre-contact status." [...] Colonization worked to restructure Indigenous social systems to fit within the white settler ideal.|$|E
