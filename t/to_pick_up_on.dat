25|$|The avian ear {{is adapted}} <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> slight and rapid changes of pitch found in bird song. General avian tympanic {{membrane}} form is ovular and slightly conical. Morphological {{differences in the}} middle ear are observed between species. Ossicles within green finches, blackbirds, song thrushes, and house sparrows are proportionately shorter {{to those found in}} pheasants, Mallard ducks, and sea birds. In song birds, a syrinx allows the respective possessors to create intricate melodies and tones. The middle avian ear is made up of three semicircular canals, each ending in an ampulla and joining to connect with the macula sacculus and lagena, of which the cochlea, a straight short tube to the external ear, branches from.|$|E
25|$|In the sport's early days, {{football}} {{was very much}} focused on attack and, as such, many teams (e.g. Royal Engineers, 1872) played with a 1–2–7 formation (one defender, two mid-fielders and seven attackers). The single defender {{was known as the}} three-quarter-back, and he {{was supported in part by}} two half-backs from mid-field who would be in charge of orchestrating the game with short passing. Up front, the seven forwards were split into four wing forwards and three centre forwards. The wingers' main task was to use their pace <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the long balls sent forward by the half- and three-quarter-backs, whereas the centre forwards were charged with taking the short passes from the half-backs.|$|E
25|$|In Adone, Marino quotes and rewrites {{passages}} from Dante's Divine Comedy, Ariosto, Tasso and the French {{literature of the}} day. The aim of these borrowings is not plagiarism but rather to introduce an erudite game with the reader who must recognise the sources and appreciate {{the results of the}} revision. Marino challenges the reader <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the quotations and to enjoy {{the way in which the}} material has been reworked, as part of a conception of poetic creation in which everything in the world (including the literature of the past) can become the object of new poetry. In this way, Marino also turns Adone into a kind of poetic encyclopaedia, which collects and modernises all the previous productions of human genius.|$|E

25|$|Searches for Naultinus {{are often}} {{inconclusive}} because the animals simply avoid detection. Improved detection methods would allow scientists to monitor populations much more accurately {{and a number}} of different studies in recent years have been doing research into this area – some key ideas are a new type of cover mounted on trees for animals to hide in, pheremone lures and even terriers trained <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the scent of native geckos. Naultinus have been reintroduced to some predator free areas and are present at other locations where their habitat is protected and where pest control is being carried out but because Naultinus have a very slow breeding rate, recovery of populations is inevitably a relatively slow and gradual process.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, Fiedler {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} professor at the University of Montana in Missoula. In February 1941 his first son, Kurt, was born two months prematurely. He elected to join the Navy Reserve after the United States entered World War II in December 1941 due to incipient fissures in his marriage and a previously unrequited thirst for adventure. Following enlistment, he gained admission to the Navy's Japanese Language School in Boulder, Colorado, where he was placed in an intensive fourteen-month course taught by a melange of Japanese American businessmen and missionaries. Initially suspected to be a security risk, Fiedler's lieutenant (junior grade) commission was delayed until the conclusion of a comprehensive background investigation; although Baxter Hathaway, a colleague at Montana, declared that Fiedler was a Lovestoneite, the investigator failed <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the allusion.|$|E

500|$|The battle {{system of}} Battle Network was a {{positive}} stand-out aspect for many critics. In his Battle Network series decade retrospective, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish felt the first game suffered from terrible plotting, unbalanced play design, and unattractive and annoying environment navigation. Still, Parish perceived the game's combat mechanics to be its sole reason for success, marrying the original Mega Man action qualities with an RPG structure and requiring [...] "a combination of sharp thinking and quick reflexes" [...] on the player's part. Speer found battle within the game to rightfully capture the spirit of Mega Man as its [...] "most original and compelling feature". Harris likewise regarded the battle interface to be well-designed, a refreshing change from traditional Japanese RPGs, what gives the game its charm, and a very appreciative addition to the game's limited multiplayer mode. Fudge summarized the combat as [...] "very easy to learn, but difficult to master -- and yet very satisfying". He admitted that the random encounters can occasionally be overwhelming. Brogger considered the gameplay both deep and simple <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on,</b> but thought the menu system to be [...] "clunky" [...] at times and its battles to be repetitive.|$|E
500|$|Van der Weyden depicts Hell as a gloomy, crowded {{place of}} both close and distant fires, and steep rock faces. The damned tumble helplessly into it, {{screaming}} and crying. The sinners descend into Hell with heads mostly bowed, dragging each other along as they go. Traditionally, a Last Judgement painting would depict the damned tormented by malevolent spirits; yet here the souls are left alone, {{the only evidence}} that they are tormented is in their expressions. The hellscape is painted so as to instil terror, but without devils. [...] Erwin Panofsky was the first <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> this absence, and proposed that van der Weyden had opted to convey torment in an inward manner, rather than through elaborate descriptions of devils and fiends. He wrote, [...] "The fate of each human being... inevitably follows from his own past, {{and the absence of}} any outside instigator of evil makes us realize that the chief torture of the Damned is not so much physical pain as a perpetual and intolerably sharpened consciousness of their state". According to Bernhard Ridderbos, van der Weyden accentuated the theme by [...] "restricting the number of the dead and treating them almost as individuals. As the damned approach the abyss of hell they become more and more compressed." ...|$|E

2500|$|In modern times, {{this debate}} has largely {{surrounded}} Chomsky's {{support of a}} universal grammar, properties that all natural languages must have, through the controversial postulation of a language acquisition device (LAD), an instinctive mental 'organ' responsible for language learning which searches all possible language alternatives and chooses the parameters that best match the learner's environmental linguistic input. Much of Chomsky's theory is founded on the poverty of the stimulus (POTS) argument, the assertion that a child's linguistic data is so limited and corrupted that learning language from this data alone is impossible. As an example, many proponents of POTS claim that because children are never exposed to negative evidence, that is, information about what phrases are ungrammatical, the language structure they learn would not resemble that of correct speech without a language-specific learning mechanism. [...] Chomsky's argument for an internal system responsible for language, biolinguistics, poses a three factor model. [...] "Genetic endowment" [...] allows the infant to extract linguistic info, detect rules, and have universal grammar. [...] "External environment" [...] illuminates the need to interact with others {{and the benefits of}} language exposure at an early age. [...] The last factor encompasses the brain properties, learning principles, and computational efficiencies that enable children <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> language rapidly using patterns and strategies.|$|E
