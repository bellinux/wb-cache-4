40|$|As {{part of the}} DOE Plutonium Vulnerability Assessment, an {{investigation}} was made to characterize the can failures at LLNL. Since the LLNL Plutonium Facility was opened for plutonium operations in 1961, there have only been three can failures that could be remembered by plutonium handlers, vault workers, chemical analysts, and material managers. Only one of these can failures was discovered during the processing of more than 606 packages containing plutonium {{as part of the}} LLNL Plutonium Inventory Reduction Program. A very low failure rate, especially since some of the 606 cans had been in storage for two to three decades. Two of the three containers that failed were made of aluminum and were packaged with 1. 25 inch diameter plutonium metal spheres. The cans were split down their entire length and the plutonium metal was heavily oxidized. The secondary gallon container of the third package failure was found to be imploded in the storage vault. Upon closer examination, the plastic bags around the inner pint can were badly melted and the lid on the can was loose. Like the other two failures, the metal was heavily oxidized. In all three of the can failures, it is theorized that air entered the inner can through incomplete sealing and the oxygen in the air then reacted with the plutonium metal to produce plutonium oxide. Air was supplied to the inner can by permeation through the surrounding plastic bag. The air could have either diffused through the bag or could have been pumped through the twisted and <b>taped</b> <b>ends</b> of the inner most bag. The inner bags and cans were packaged into second bags and cans in an air atmosphere; therefore, trapping air inside the packaging configuration that could have passed through the bags. A failure of the inner can integrity would be necessary for the air to pass into it. In all three LLNL can failure cases, it is believed that the seal of the inner can was not sufficient to prevent a breach of the can environment...|$|E

50|$|The main {{advantage}} of the RCA tape cartridge over reel-to-reel machines is convenience. The user {{is not required to}} handle unruly <b>tape</b> <b>ends</b> and thread the tape through the machine before use, making the medium of magnetic tape more friendly to casual users. In addition, since the cartridge carries both supply and take-up reels, the cartridge {{does not have to be}} rewound before the tape is removed from the machine and stored. Because of these conveniences, the RCA tape cartridge system did see some success in schools, particularly in student language learning labs.|$|R
50|$|Early {{half-inch}} tape {{had seven}} parallel tracks of data {{along the length}} of the tape allowing, six-bit characters plus one bit of parity written across the tape. This was known as seven-track tape. With the introduction of the IBM System 360 mainframe, nine-track tapes were introduced to support the new 8-bit characters that it used. Effective recording density increased over time. Common seven-track densities started at 200, then 556, and finally 800 cpi and nine-track tapes had densities of 800 (using NRZI), 1600 (using PE), and 6250 cpi (using GCR). This translates into about 5 MB to 140 MB per standard length (2400ft) reel of <b>tape.</b> <b>End</b> of file was designated by a <b>tape</b> mark and <b>end</b> of <b>tape</b> by two tape marks.
