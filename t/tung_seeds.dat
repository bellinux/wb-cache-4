40|$|Diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) {{catalyze}} {{the final}} and rate-limiting step of triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms. DGAT genes {{have been identified}} in numerous organisms. Multiple isoforms of DGAT are present in eukaryotes. We previously cloned DGAT 1 and DGAT 2 genes of tung tree (Vernicia fordii), whose novel seed TAGs are useful {{in a wide range of}} industrial applications. The objective of this study was to understand the developmental regulation of DGAT family gene expression in tung tree. To this end, we first cloned a tung tree gene encoding DGAT 3, a putatively soluble form of DGAT that possesses 11 completely conserved amino acid residues shared among 27 DGAT 3 s from 19 plant species. Unlike DGAT 1 and DGAT 2 subfamilies, DGAT 3 is absent from animals. We then used TaqMan and SYBR Green quantitative real-time PCR, along with northern and western blotting, to study the expression patterns of the three DGAT genes in tung tree tissues. Expression results demonstrate that 1) all three isoforms of DGAT genes are expressed in developing seeds, leaves and flowers; 2) DGAT 2 is the major DGAT mRNA in <b>tung</b> <b>seeds,</b> whose expression profile is well-coordinated with the oil profile in developing tung seeds; and 3) DGAT 3 is the major form of DGAT mRNA in tung leaves, flowers and immature seeds prior to active tung oil biosynthesis. These results suggest that DGAT 2 is probably the major TAG biosynthetic isoform in <b>tung</b> <b>seeds</b> and that DGAT 3 gene likely plays a significant role in TAG metabolism in other tissues. Therefore, DGAT 2 should be a primary target for tung oil engineering in transgenic organisms...|$|E
40|$|Triacylglycerols (TAG) are {{the major}} {{molecules}} of energy storage in eukaryotes. TAG are packed in subcellular structures called oil bodies or lipid droplets. Oleosins (OLE) {{are the major}} proteins in plant oil bodies. Multiple isoforms of OLE are present in plants such as tung tree (Vernicia fordii), whose seeds are rich in novel TAG {{with a wide range}} of industrial applications. The objectives of this study were to identify OLE genes, classify OLE proteins and analyze OLE gene expression in tung trees. We identified five tung tree OLE genes coding for small hydrophobic proteins. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment demonstrated that the five tung OLE genes represented the five OLE subfamilies and all contained the "proline knot" motif (PX 5 SPX 3 P) shared among 65 OLE from 19 tree species, including the sequenced genomes of Prunus persica (peach), Populus trichocarpa (poplar), Ricinus communis (castor bean), Theobroma cacao (cacao) and Vitis vinifera (grapevine). Tung OLE 1, OLE 2 and OLE 3 belong to the S type and OLE 4 and OLE 5 belong to the SM type of Arabidopsis OLE. TaqMan and SYBR Green qPCR methods were used to study the differential expression of OLE genes in tung tree tissues. Expression results demonstrated that 1) All five OLE genes were expressed in developing <b>tung</b> <b>seeds,</b> leaves and flowers; 2) OLE mRNA levels were much higher in seeds than leaves or flowers; 3) OLE 1, OLE 2 and OLE 3 genes were expressed in <b>tung</b> <b>seeds</b> at much higher levels than OLE 4 and OLE 5 genes; 4) OLE mRNA levels rapidly increased during seed development; and 5) OLE gene expression was well-coordinated with tung oil accumulation in the seeds. These results suggest that tung OLE genes 1 - 3 probably play major roles in tung oil accumulation and/or oil body development. Therefore, they might be preferred targets for tung oil engineering in transgenic plants...|$|E
40|$|Tung tree (Vernicia fordii) {{provides}} the sole source of tung oil {{widely used in}} industry. Lack of fatty acid composition and molecular markers hinders biochemical, genetic and breeding research. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine fatty acid profiles and develop unigene-derived simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in tung tree. Fatty acid profiles of 41 accessions showed that the ratio of a-eleostearic acid was increasing continuously with a parallel trend to the amount of tung oil accumulation while the ratios of other fatty acids were decreasing in different stages of the seeds and that a-eleostearic acid (18 : 3) consisted of 77 % of the total fatty acids in tung oil. Transcriptome sequencing identified 81, 805 unigenes from tung cDNA library constructed using seed mRNA and discovered 6, 366 SSRs in 5, 404 unigenes. The di- and tri-nucleotide microsatellites accounted for 92 % of the SSRs with AG/CT and AAG/CTT being the most abundant SSR motifs. Fifteen polymorphic genic-SSR markers were developed from 98 unigene loci tested in 41 cultivated tung accessions by agarose gel and capillary electrophoresis. Genbank database search identified 10 of them putatively coding for functional proteins. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that all 15 polymorphic SSR-associated unigenes were expressed in <b>tung</b> <b>seeds</b> and some of them were highly correlated with oil composition in the seeds.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tung oil is an {{industrial}} drying oil containing ca. 90 % PUFA. We previously reported on enzymes {{required for the}} synthesis of linoleic (6 % of FA) and eleostearic (80 %) acids and here describe the cloning and functional analysis of an omega- 3 FA desaturase (FAD 3) required for the synthesis of linolenic acid (1 %). The tung FAD 3 cDNA was identified by screening a <b>tung</b> <b>seed</b> cDNA library using the polymerase chain reaction and degenerate primers encoding conserved regions of the FAD 3 enzyme family. Expression of this cDNA in yeast cells, cultured {{in the presence of}} linoleic acid, resulted in the synthesis and accumulation of linolenic acid, which accounted for up to 18 % w/w of total cellular FA. Tung FAD 3 activity was significantly affected by cultivation temperature, with the great-est amount of linolenic acid accumulating in yeast cells grown at 15 °C. The amount of linolenic acid synthesized in yeast cells by tung FAD 3 is ca. 10 -fold higher than that observed by expres-sion of a rapeseed (Brassica napus) FAD 3 in yeast, suggesting that tung FAD 3 might be useful for biotechnological production of omega- 3 FA in transgenic organisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{seed oil}} {{derived from the}} tung (Aleurites fordii Hemsl.) tree {{contains}} approximately 80 % α-eleostearic acid (18 : 3 Δ 9 cis, 11 trans, 13 trans), an unusual conjugated fatty acid that imparts industrially important drying qualities to tung oil. Here, we describe the cloning and functional analysis of two closely related Δ 12 oleate desaturase-like enzymes that constitute consecutive steps in the biosynthetic pathway of eleostearic acid. Polymerase chain reaction screening of a tung seed cDNA library using degenerate oligonucleotide primers resulted in identification of two desaturases, FAD 2 and FADX, that shared 73 % amino acid identity. Both enzymes were localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Bright-Yellow 2) cells, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that FADX was expressed exclusively within developing <b>tung</b> <b>seeds.</b> Expression of the cDNAs encoding these enzymes in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) revealed that FAD 2 converted oleic acid (18 : 1 Δ 9 cis) into linoleic acid (18 : 2 Δ 9 cis, 12 cis) and that FADX converted linoleic acid into α-eleostearic acid. Additional characterization revealed that FADX exhibited remarkable enzymatic plasticity, capable of generating a variety of alternative conjugated and Δ 12 -desaturated fatty acid products in yeast cells cultured {{in the presence of}} exogenously supplied fatty acid substrates. Unlike other desaturases reported to date, the double bond introduced by FADX during fatty acid desaturation was in the trans, rather than cis, configuration. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that tung FADX is grouped with Δ 12 fatty acid desaturases and hydroxylases rather than conjugases, which is consistent with its desaturase activity. Comparison of FADX and other lipid-modifying enzymes (desaturase, hydroxylase, epoxygenase, acetylenase, and conjugase) revealed several amino acid positions near the active site that may be important determinants of enzymatic activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{tung tree}} (Vernicia fordii), a non-model woody plant {{belonging}} to the Euphorbiaceae family, is a promising economic plant due to the high content of a novel high-value oil in its seeds. Many metabolic pathways are active during seed development.

A total of 76 proteins were successfully identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS/MS). These proteins were grouped into 11 classes according to their functions. The major groups of differentially expressed proteins were associated with energy metabolism (25 %), fatty acid metabolism (15. 79 %) and defense (14. 47 %).

The city of Gainesville remained solvent throughout the Great Depression, and unemployment was lower than in most of the country. Agriculture continued to be a mainstay of the local economy. In 1922 tung trees were planted in Alachua County, and Gainesville became the center of tung oil production in the United States. Tung oil had previously been available only from China. Both tung oil and <b>tung</b> tree <b>seeds</b> were shipped around the world from Gainesville. The University of Florida, with about 1,000 employees and 2,000 students, helped stabilize the local economy during the Depression.

40|$|Tung tree (Vernicia fordii) is an {{important}} woody oil tree. <b>Tung</b> tree <b>seeds</b> contain 50 - 60 % oil with approximately 80 mole α-eleostearic acid (9 cis, 11 trans, 13 trans octadecatrienoic acid). Fatty acid synthesis is catalyzed by the concerted action of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase, a multienzyme complex including β-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase (KAS). Little is known about KAS in tung tree. The objective {{of this study was}} to clone KAS genes and analyze their expression profiles in tung tree.

The deduced VfKAS III protein shared approximately 80 % identity with homologous KAS IIIs from other plants. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that KAS II and KAS III were expressed in all of the tissues and organs tested but exhibited different expression patterns in tung tree. The expression levels of KAS II in young tissues were much lower than those in mature tissues, whereas the highest expression levels of KAS III were observed in young stem and young leaf.

All 11 reference genes showed {{a wide range of}} Ct values in all samples, indicating that they differently expressed. Three softwares – geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper – were used to determine the stability of these references except for ALB (2 S albumin), which presented a little divergence. The results from the three softwares showed that ACT 7 (Actin 7 a), UBQ (Ubiquitin), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase) and EF 1 a (elongation factor 1 -a) were the most stable reference genes across all of the tested tung samples and <b>tung</b> developing <b>seeds,</b> while ALB (2 S albumin) was unsuitable as internal controls.

Each TAG was coated into a microplate well, and the lipase activity was measured by optical density increase at 272 nm due to transition of α-eleostearic acid from the adsorbed to the soluble state. The sn- 1, 3 -regioselective lipases human pancreatic lipase (HPL), LIP 2 lipase from Yarrowia lipolytica (YLLIP 2), and a known sn- 2 lipase, Candida antarctica lipase A (CALA) were used to validate this method.

40|$|Biodiesel is a {{renewable}} fuel conventionally generated from vegetable oils and animal fats that conforms to ASTM D 6751. Depending {{on the free}} fatty acid content of the feedstock, biodiesel is produced via transesterification, esterification, {{or a combination of}} these processes. Currently the cost of the feedstock accounts for more than 80 % of biodiesel production cost. The main goal of this project was to evaluate and develop non-conventional feedstocks and novel processes for producing biodiesel. One of the most novel and promising feedstocks evaluated involves the use of readily available microorganisms as a lipid source. Municipal wastewater treatment facilities (MWWTF) in the USA produce (dry basis) of microbial sludge annually. This sludge is composed of a variety of organisms, which consume organic matter in wastewater. The content of phospholipids in these cells have been estimated at 24 % to 25 % of dry mass. Since phospholipids can be transesterified they could serve as a ready source of biodiesel. Examination of the various transesterification methods shows that in situ conversion of lipids to FAMEs provides the highest overall yield of biodiesel. If one assumes a 7. 0 % overall yield of FAMEs from dry sewage sludge on a weight basis, the cost per gallon of extracted lipid would be $ 3. 11. Since the lipid is converted to FAMEs, also known as biodiesel, in the in Situ extraction process, the product can be used as is for {{renewable fuel}}. As transesterification efficiency increases the cost per gallon drops quickly, hitting $ 2. 01 at 15. 0 % overall yield. An overall yield of 10. 0 % is required to obtain biodiesel at $ 2. 50 per gallon, allowing it to compete with soybean oil in the marketplace. Twelve plant species with potential for oil production were tested at Mississippi State, MS. Of the species tested, canola, rapeseed and birdseed rape appear to have potential in Mississippi as winter annual crops because of yield. Two perennial crops were investigated, Chinese tallow tree and <b>tung</b> tree. High <b>seed</b> yields from these species are possible because, there stature allows for a third dimension in yield (up). Harvest regimes have already been worked out with tung, and the large seed makes shedding of the seed with tree shakers possible. While tallow tree seed yields can be mind boggling (12, 000 kg seed/ha at 40 % oil), genotypes that shed seed easily are currently not known. Efficient methods were developed to isolate polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters from bio-diesel. The hypothesis to isolate this class of fatty acids, which are used as popular dietary supplements and prescription medicine (OMACOR), was that they bind transition metal ions much stronger than their harmful saturated analogs. AgBF 4 has the highest extraction ability among all the metal ions tested. Glycerol is a key product from the production of biodiesel. It is produced during the transesterification process by cleaving the fatty acids from the glycerol backbone (the fatty acids are used as part of the biodiesel, which is a fatty acid methyl ester). Glycerol is a non-toxic compound with many uses; however, if a surplus exists in the future, more uses for the produced glycerol needs to be found. Another phase of the project was to find an add-on process to the biodiesel production process that will convert the glycerol by-product into more valuable substances for end uses other than food or cosmetics, focusing at present on 1, 3 -propanediol and lactic acid. All three MSU cultures produced products at concentrations below that of the benchmark microorganisms. There was one notable isolate the caught the eye of the investigators and that was culture J 6 due to the ability of this microorganism to co-produce both products and one in particularly high concentrations. This culture with more understanding of its metabolic pathways could prove a useful biological agent for the conversion of glycerol. Heterogeneous catalysis was examined as an alternative to overcome the disadvantages of homogeneous transesterification, such as the presence of salts in the glycerine phase and the continuous lost of catalyst. A maximum soy biodiesel yield of 85 % was obtained by BaO in 14 minutes, whereas, PbO, MnO 2, CaO and MgO gave a maximum yields of 84 %, 80 %, 78 % and 66 % respectively at 215 °C. The overall reaction order of PbO, MnO 2, BaO, CaO and MgO was found to be 1, 1, 3, 1 and 1 respectively. The highest rate constant was observed for BaO, which was 0. 0085 g 2. mole- 2. min- 1. The performance of biodiesel in terms of type (e. g., NOx, and CO) and quantity of emissions was tested using soy biodiesel, blends of biodiesel and ethanol, and differently aged diesel engines. It was determined that saturated methyl esters, and relatively high oxygen content in the fuel, caused by addition of ethanol, increased the NOx emissions from new diesel engines compared to petroleum diesel...|$|R
