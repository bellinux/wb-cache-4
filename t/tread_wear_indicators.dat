5000|$|Wear bars (or <b>wear</b> <b>indicators)</b> {{are raised}} {{features}} {{located at the}} bottom of the tread grooves that indicate the tire has reached its wear limit. When the <b>tread</b> lugs are <b>worn</b> to the point that the wear bars connect across the lugs, the tires are fully worn and should be taken out of service. Most wear bars indicate a remaining tread depth of 1.6 mm and are tires are deemed [...] "worn out" [...] when the <b>tread</b> is <b>worn</b> down to that point.|$|R

This study basically assessed <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> pattern of tyres in passenger cars used on Nigeria roads. The result obtained showed that 75. 4 % of the assessed tyres showed uneven wear pattern resulting from incorrect tyre-road contact effects. This observed high proportion of uneven tyre <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> pattern implies high rate of inconsequential regard for tyre safety...|$|R
50|$|Street tires {{will also}} include <b>wear</b> limit <b>{{indicators}}</b> {{in the form}} of small raised bridges within the grooves. When the <b>tread</b> is <b>worn</b> down enough that the limit indicators make contact with the road, the tire is deemed to be {{at the end of its}} service life. Brake pads use similar indicators {{in the form of}} notches on their surface that disappear when they are used.|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> {{particles}} are investigated: <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> particles from a steel brush abrader (TrBP) and particles produced during a steering pad run (TrSP). A leaching experiment in water at pH = 7. 5 for 24 and 48 h {{was carried out}} on TrBP to simulate environmental degradation. Images of all materials were collected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) together with element microanalytical (EDX) data. Surface morphology is described by a function of wave number (the “enhanced spectrum”) obtained from SEM image analysis and non-linear filtering. A surface roughness index, ρ, {{is derived from the}} enhanced spectrum. The innovative contribution of this work is the representation of morphology by means of ρ, which, together with EDX data, allows the quantitative characterization of the materials. In particular, the surface roughness of leached TrBP is shown to decay in time and is related to the corresponding microanalytical data for the first time. The morphology of steering pad TrSP, affected by included mineral particles, is shown to be more heterogeneous. Differences in morphology (enhanced spectra and ρ), elemental composition and surface chemistry of TrBP and TrSP are discussed. All methods described and implemented herewith can be immediately applied to other types of <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> material. The arguments put forward herewith should help in the proper design of those experiments aimed at assessing the impact of <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> materials on the environment and on human health...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{abnormal}} <b>tread</b> <b>wear.</b> Poor wheel alignment can cause excessive wear of the innermost or outermost ribs. Gravel roads, rocky terrain, and other rough terrain causes accelerated wear. Over-inflation above the sidewall maximum can cause excessive wear {{to the center of}} the tread. Modern tires have steel belts built in to prevent this. Under-inflation causes excessive wear to the outer ribs. Unbalanced wheels can cause uneven tire wear, as the rotation may not be perfectly circular. Tire manufacturers and car companies have mutually established standards for <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> testing that include measurement parameters for tread loss profile, lug count, and heel-toe wear. See also Work load above.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tread</b> <b>worn</b> away completely: {{especially}} when the wear on the outer rubber exposes the reinforcing threads within, the tire {{is said to be}} bald and must be replaced as soon as possible. Sometimes tires with <b>worn</b> <b>tread</b> are recapped, i.e. a new layer of rubber with grooves is bonded onto the outer perimeter of a worn tire. Since this bonding may occasionally come loose, new tires are considered superior to recapped ones.|$|R

40|$|Rolling {{resistance}} and <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> of tires do particularly influence the maintenance costs of commercial vehicles. Although tire labeling is established in Europe, it is meanwhile well-known that, {{due to the}} respective test procedures, these labels do not hold in realistic application scenarios in the field. This circumstance arises from the development phase of tires, where the respective performance properties are mainly evaluated in tire/wheel standalone scenarios in which {{the wide range of}} usage variability of commercial vehicles cannot be considered adequately. Within this article we address a method to predict indicators for rolling {{resistance and}} <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> of tires in realistic application scenarios considering application-based factors of influence like specific customers, operation circumstances, regional dependencies, fleet specific characteristics etc. Moreover, the prescribed methodology may also be transferred to the prediction of fuel consumption and pollutant emission. The basic framework of the overall procedure is based on a geo-referenced description of the world. This framework is realized in the software tool VMC® (Virtual Measurement Campaign) which allows a systematic analysis of the usage variability of commercial vehicles in the sense mentioned above. The basic idea for predicting rolling resistance and <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> of tires is the decomposition of actual routes into a suitable set of load cases depending on curvature radius, longitudinal slope and velocity. The respective tire energy losses are computed for all load cases - by means of a simulation model of the vehicle equipped with a CDTire/ 3 D tire model - and are finally stored in a result catalogue. In order to predict the tire energy loss for a realistic application scenario one partitions actual routes into the predefined load cases and superposes the total energy loss from the result catalogue...|$|R

50|$|Later, and better, {{patterns}} were the Dunlop 'Traction' tread pattern of 1922 and the 'Triple stud' pattern of 1927. These {{followed the same}} principle of a solid central rib with square-edged blocks, but were developed to improve <b>tread</b> <b>wear.</b> The central rib became a thin and almost vestigial rib between square blocks. The side blocks were now isolated from the centre, although linked by another narrow rib, and their {{leading and trailing edges}} formed a trapezium rather than a square. This triple square stud pattern was a successful pattern for narrow tyres, including motorcycles, and remained popular from several manufacturers into the 1950s.|$|R

40|$|This review {{discusses}} key {{technologies of}} intelligent tires focusing on sensors and wireless data transmission. Intelligent automobile tires, which monitor their pressure, deformation, wheel loading, friction, or <b>tread</b> <b>wear,</b> {{are expected to}} improve the reliability of tires and tire control systems. However, in installing sensors in a tire, many problems have to be considered, such as compatibility of the sensors with tire rubber, wireless transmission, and battery installments. As regards sensing, this review discusses indirect methods using existing sensors, such as that for wheel speed, and direct methods, such as surface acoustic wave sensors and piezoelectric sensors. For wireless transmission, passive wireless methods and energy harvesting are also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Sidewall {{deflection}} is not {{a direct}} measurement of rolling friction. A high quality tire with a high quality (and supple) casing will allow for more flex per energy loss than a cheap tire with a stiff sidewall. Again, on a bicycle, a quality tire with a supple casing will still roll easier than a cheap tire with a stiff casing. Similarly, as noted by Goodyear truck tires, a tire with a [...] "fuel saving" [...] casing will benefit the fuel economy through many tread lives (i.e. retreading), while a tire with a [...] "fuel saving" [...] tread design will only benefit until the <b>tread</b> <b>wears</b> down.|$|R
