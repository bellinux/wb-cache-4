5|$|Although Morgan {{was briefly}} {{seen as a}} hero, {{widespread}} fears concerning plutocracy and concentrated wealth soon eroded this view. Morgan's bank had survived, but the trust companies that were a growing rival to traditional banks were badly damaged. Some analysts believed that <b>the</b> <b>panic</b> had been engineered to damage confidence in trust companies so that banks would benefit. Others believed Morgan took advantage of <b>the</b> <b>panic</b> to allow his U.S. Steel company to acquire TC Although Morgan lost $21 million in <b>the</b> <b>panic,</b> and {{the significance of the}} role he played in staving off worse disaster is undisputed, he also became the focus of intense scrutiny and criticism.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{second term}} saw renewed {{economic}} turmoil. In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a New York brokerage house, collapsed after {{it failed to}} sell all of the bonds issued by Jay Cooke's Northern Pacific Railway. The collapse rippled through Wall Street, and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds were also ruined. On September 20, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for ten days. Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for {{advice on how to}} resolve the crisis, which became known as <b>the</b> <b>Panic</b> of 1873. Grant believed that, as {{with the collapse of the}} Gold Ring in 1869, <b>the</b> <b>panic</b> was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers. He instructed the Treasury to buy $10 million in government bonds, injecting cash into the system. The purchases curbed <b>the</b> <b>panic</b> on Wall Street but an industrial depression, later called the Long Depression, nonetheless swept the nation. Many of the nation's railroads—89 out of 364—went bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1893, {{a number of}} {{industrial}} firms, including the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the National Cordage Company went bankrupt. The resulting bank runs and failures became known as <b>the</b> <b>Panic</b> of 1893. In June of that year, President Grover Cleveland, who believed that <b>the</b> <b>Panic</b> {{was caused by the}} inflation generated by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, called a special session of Congress in order to repeal it. The act was repealed on November 1, 1893. On June 13, 1898, Congress ordered the coining of all the remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act into silver dollars. Silver dollar production rose again, until the bullion was exhausted in 1904, when it ceased.|$|E

40|$|By using bank-level data {{pertaining}} to {{the period of the}} Showa Depression in Japan, we examine whether banking panics caused solvent banks to close down and fail. We find that bank fundamentals were weakly related to the failures during <b>the</b> <b>panics.</b> This result implies that the confusion on the part of depositors regarding bank asset quality was not negligible during <b>the</b> <b>panics.</b> Further, we find that during <b>the</b> <b>panics,</b> <b>the</b> Bank of Japan (BoJ) selectively provided liquidity assistance to solvent banks that suffered heavy withdrawals. The BoJ as a lender of last resort prevented the closures of these solvent banks and mitigated the potential problems of <b>the</b> <b>panics.</b> Copyright 2009 Oxford University Press 2009 All rights reserved, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Cleveland's {{second term}} began, <b>the</b> <b>Panic</b> of 1893 struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute {{economic}} depression. <b>The</b> <b>panic</b> was worsened by the acute shortage of gold {{that resulted from}} the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session {{to deal with the}} problem. The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of <b>the</b> <b>panic</b> had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats – and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal. Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it {{marked the beginning of the}} end of silver as a basis for American currency.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Panic</b> of 1893 {{caused the}} price of silver to crash; the gold price, however, {{remained}} fixed, as the United States was on the gold standard. The influx of silver miners into the gold mines caused a lowering of wages. Mine owners demanded longer hours for less pay.|$|E
50|$|Balance sheet {{insolvency}} is seen {{as another}} possible explanation for <b>the</b> banking <b>panic.</b> However, data shows that most bank failures due to balance sheet insolvency happened between <b>the</b> <b>panics</b> between 1930-1933 while most bank failures due to illiquidity happened during <b>the</b> actual bank <b>panics.</b> Illiquidty shocks were observed by measuring increased hoarding.|$|R

5|$|A severe depression, <b>the</b> <b>Panic</b> of 1873, {{began in}} the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. Many in the United States came to believe the gold {{standard}} too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those, and sought to restore bimetallism. The inflation caused by such a policy would enable debtors to repay what they owed more easily. The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in a dollar in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.|$|E

5|$|After {{the railroads}} from Boston to Lowell, Worcester, and Providence were {{chartered}} in 1830 and 1831, railroads to other surrounding cities including Newburyport and Portsmouth were proposed.

5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's {{primary concern}} was <b>the</b> <b>Panic</b> of 1837.

Wickliffe maintained the state's credit by paying the interest due on state securities.
