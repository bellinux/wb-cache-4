50|$|On March 25, 1985, {{by virtue}} of {{legislative}} and administrative acts, a referendum was made <b>to</b> <b>redivide</b> the municipality into the current 27 barangays. They were named after the revolutionary leaders of the province of Cavite - including those related to the great general to whom the municipality was named after - and the barangay captains and other prominent personalities who led the former 10 barangays. The first appointed officials of the barangays were sworn into office en masse on June 27, 1985.|$|E
50|$|While Antony and {{the other}} Triumvirs {{ratified}} the Treaty of Brundisium <b>to</b> <b>redivide</b> the Roman world among themselves, the rebel general Sextus Pompey, the son of Caesar's rival Pompey the Great, was largely ignored. From his stronghold on Sicily, he continued his piracy activities across Italy and blocking the shipment of grain to Rome. The lack of food in Rome caused the public to blame the Triumvirate and shift its sympathies towards Pompey. This pressure forced the Triumvirs to meet with Sextus in early 39 BC.|$|E
50|$|Beginning with Lord Wrottesley's {{proposals}} in the 1820s there were various attempts to decimalise the pound sterling {{over the next}} century and a half. These attempts came to nothing significant until the 1960s when {{the need for a}} currency more suited to simple monetary calculations became pressing. The decision to decimalise was announced in 1966, with the pound <b>to</b> be <b>redivided</b> into 100, rather than 240, pence. Decimal Day was set for 15 February 1971, and a whole range of new coins were introduced. Shillings continued to be legal tender with a value of 5 new pence until 31st December 1990.|$|R
50|$|Similar to a wide-ban, a shinsōban (新装版) is a {{new edition}} {{released}} with (usually) a new cover. The volumes in such a release usually have new color pages and other extras. For example, in 2002, Sailor Moon was reedited; some pages were completely re-drawn and most dialogues were rewritten by the author. Plus, the chapters were <b>redivided</b> <b>to</b> fit into 12 volumes instead of 18.|$|R

He had Hiempsal killed; then defeated Adherbal in battle. Rome intervened and, due to bribes paid by Jugurtha, merely caused the lands <b>to</b> be <b>redivided.</b> Eventually Jugurtha again attacked Adherbal, besieging him {{in the city of}} Cirta. Rome again sent its agents to broker a settlement. But in 112 Jugurtha accepted the city's terms of surrender; nonetheless Adherbal was tortured and killed, and Italian traders were slaughtered.

40|$|As I {{have shown}} in “On the {{arbitrariness}} {{of the division}} in sections of the genus Fissidens ” (in press) the section Pachylomidium is not sharply separated {{from some of the}} other ones. Consequently it was united with these sections. The resulting section is to be called Fissidens. Several objections could he raised against my still continuing a series of papers on the “section Pachylomidium”. The above implicates that almost certainly synonyms will be overlooked and that it is possible that on occasion closely related species will, neither in the keys nor in the text, be compared. Moreover, it is, without including the complete section Fissidens, senseless to try <b>to</b> <b>redivide</b> it. Though the present series of papers can be no more than a rather arbitrary beginning of a monograph of the section Fissidens, I intend to complete the once undertaken task (cf. Bruggeman-Nannenga 1973). Of course I will try to meet the above objections by comparing the included species with those species from 1...|$|E

2500|$|In his memoirs, Berlioz {{described}} in excruciating detail the intense frustrations he experienced {{in seeing the}} work performed. For five years (from 1858 to 1863), the Paris Opéra – the only suitable stage in Paris – vacillated. Finally, tired of waiting, he agreed to let Léon Carvalho, director of the smaller Théâtre Lyrique, mount a production {{of the second half}} of the opera with the title Les Troyens à Carthage. It consisted of Acts 3 <b>to</b> 5, <b>redivided</b> by Berlioz into five acts, to which he added an orchestral introduction (Lamento) and a prologue. As Berlioz noted bitterly, he agreed to let Carvalho do it [...] "despite the manifest impossibility of his doing it properly. He had just obtained an annual subsidy of a hundred thousand francs from the government. None the less the enterprise was beyond him. His theater was not large enough, his singers were not good enough, his chorus and orchestra were small and weak." ...|$|R
50|$|For example, {{an office}} {{building}} can be built using modular parts such as walls, frames, doors, ceilings, and windows. The interior can then be partitioned (or divided) with more walls and furnished with desks, computers, and whatever else is needed for a functioning workspace. If the office needs to be expanded or <b>redivided</b> <b>to</b> accommodate employees, modular components such as wall panels can be added or relocated {{to make the necessary}} changes without altering the whole building. Later, this same office can be broken down and rearranged to form a retail space, conference hall or another type of building, using the same modular components that originally formed the office building. The new building can then be refurnished with whatever items are needed to carry out its desired functions.|$|R

This dissertation examines US efforts to promote social and economic reconstruction in Siberia between 1917 and 1922. After the collapse of the Provisional Government, Siberia became a focal point in the Great Powers' struggle <b>to</b> <b>redivide</b> the existing spheres of influence. This study views the American assistance policy as part of this broader imperial rivalry and necessarily implies a wider perspective on the debate over the American involvement in revolutionary Russia. It demonstrates that this policy simultaneously represented the primary response of American statesmen to events in revolutionary Russia and an important new dimension in their efforts to promote an Open Door political economy. Since American policy-makers considered Bolshevism to be epiphenomenal, the byproduct of widespread instability, the counter-revolutionary tendencies inherent in Wilson's policy toward Siberia were subordinate to the progressive role American Open Door diplomacy played in its struggle against the efforts of the European Powers and Japan to establish spheres of influence in the Russian Empire. Therefore, the American plan for Siberia should be viewed as a distinctly Wilsonian experiment in foreign assistance policy. The Wilson Administration's assistance policy focused on two complementary initiatives: the restoration of operations on the Trans-Siberian Railway and the provision of commercial assistance to the Siberian population via the region's prominent peasant cooperatives. These forms of assistance were aimed at promoting the recovery of Russian civil society in order to help Russia develop its own form of "self-government. " American statesmen believed Siberia would rapidly develop a post-Tsarist civil society because of its rich natural resources and its relatively egalitarian social structure. As this social and economic transformation proceeded, Siberia would provide an unparalleled outlet for American investment and thereby help to solidify an Open Door system. Between 1919 and 1922, the US sponsored the establishment of the inter-Allied Railway Committee for supervision of the Trans-Siberian Railway, an institutional innovation which foreshadowed post-WW II developmental agencies. Finally, this study draws important parallels between the reconstruction efforts in Siberia and the developmental policy the US had been promoting in China since 1900...|$|E
40|$|Combinatorial {{chemistry}} is gaining wide appeal as a technique for generating molecular diversity. Among the many combinatorial protocols, the split/recombine method is quite popular and particularly efficient at generating large libraries of compounds. In this process, polymer beads are equally divided {{into a series}} of pools and each pool is treated with a unique fragment; then the beads are recombined, mixed <b>to</b> uniformity, and <b>redivided</b> equally into a new series of pools for the subsequent couplings. The deviation from the ideal equimolar distribution of the final products is assessed by a special overall relative error, which is shown {{to be related to the}} Pearson statistic. Although the split/recombine sampling scheme is quite different from those used in analysis of categorical data, the Pearson statistic is shown to still follow a chi 2 distribution. This result allows us to derive the required number of beads such that, with 99 % confidence, the overall relative error is controlled to be less than a pregiven tolerable limit L 1. In this paper, we also discuss another criterion, which determines the required number of beads so that, with 99 % confidence, all individual relative errors are controlled to be less than a pregiven tolerable limit L 2 (0 < L 2 < 1) ...|$|R
40|$|When {{sensitive}} lymphocytes are cultured {{with the}} appropriate antigen, lymphoblasts appear after 24 – 48 hr of incubation {{and the number of}} these increases steadily from the 2 nd to the 6 th or 7 th day. Our problem was to discover, at a cellular level, how this increase takes place; whether it is a massive response of many cells, stepwise recruitment of cells into the lymphoblast class, or simply repeated division of a few cells to form clones. In these experiments lymphocytes were incubated with antigen in culture tubes for 2 – 4 days and then a few cells, usually less than 200, were transferred to special microchambers for further culture. In these microchambers the cells could be viewed continually with a microscope and their fate recorded over the next 3 – 5 days by time-lapse cinemicrography. Examination of the film produced in this way showed that lymphoblasts divided and <b>redivided</b> <b>to</b> produce clones of 64 cells or more. It was possible to measure generation times from the film for 301 cells; the majority were between 8 and 13 hr but the range was 7. 5 – 38. 0 hr. There was no clear difference between generation times of human lymphocytes stimulated with tuberculin, streptokinase-streptodrnase, extract of the American pokeweed, or in the mixed leukocyte reaction. Similar times were also found for rat cells in the mixed leukocyte reaction. While these observations show that clonal proliferation does occur and could reasonably account for all the increase of lymphoblasts in lymphocyte cultures, the experiments, because of their design, do not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms such as recruitment may play a role as well, particularly during the first 48 hr after contact between sensitive cells and antigens...|$|R
