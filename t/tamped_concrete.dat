5000|$|The bridge {{comprises}} 22 twin track bridge-deck sections {{together with}} 2 abutments at the ends. The deck sections {{are supported by}} five stone support pillars and sixteen <b>tamped</b> <b>concrete</b> pillars, manufactured using a technique that was new {{at the time of}} the viaduct's construction.|$|E
50|$|On 1 July 1907, the Kempten bypass railway was opened, which {{relieved}} {{the terminal}} station of through traffic, especially freight trains. The bypass connected the lines from Neu-Ulm, Kaufbeuren and Pfronten {{directly to the}} Allgäu Railway to Immenstadt. A new bridge over the Iller was erected for the bypass; it is an arched bridge made of <b>tamped</b> <b>concrete</b> with a length of 155 metres and a main vault with a clearance of 64.5 metres, crossing the river at a height of 33 metres. North {{the bridge of the}} bypass line two more <b>tamped</b> <b>concrete</b> bridges were built on the access line to the terminal station. The wood truss bridge formerly used by the line was converted into a road bridge. A marshalling yard was built on the bypass line for the marshalling of freight trains from Bavaria and neighbouring countries in the northeast towards Lake Constance, Switzerland and south western Europe; it had a capacity of 1,200 wagons per day. At the same time the engine depot was moved about two kilometres from the terminal station to the south of the marshalling yard. In 1933, the yard lost its national significance, because long-distance freight trains ran over the newly electrified Ulm-Augsburg line and avoided the hilly Allgäu line.|$|E
50|$|Pervious {{concrete}} {{is installed}} by being poured into forms, then screeded off, to level (not smooth) the surface, then packed or tamped into place. Due {{to the low}} water content and air permeability, within 5-15 minutes of <b>tamping,</b> the <b>concrete</b> must be covered with a 6-mil poly plastic, or it will dry out prematurely and not properly hydrate and cure.|$|R
5000|$|After leaving high school, young Besser quickly {{acquired}} a {{working knowledge of}} cement, concrete, and what were then the un-perfected and balky hand-operated machines used to <b>tamp</b> wet, flexible <b>concrete</b> into solid shapes. He invented his first improvements to his mill shop's concrete-block tamper in 1904, and further improvements created a machine capable of making 200 rectangular blocks during {{what was then a}} standard 10-hour working day. Repeatedly applying simple principles of power transport and automation, Jesse Besser and his engineering aides steadily improved their concrete-block-producing tamper machines. By 1954, fifty years after the 1904 device, the machines of the Besser Company's lineup could produce 10,000 blocks during a 10-hour period—a productivity improvement of 8.1%/year.|$|R
