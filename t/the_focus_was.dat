5|$|In general, {{the show}} {{began to take}} on a more serious tone as a seriocomic (or dramedy) series, in which <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> on the {{character}} rather than the character type, and moved away from its status as a situation comedy.|$|E
5|$|In the film, {{most of the}} {{numerous}} acts of violence are committed off-screen. The violent acts were also designed to be quick, reflecting the actual speed {{of violence in the}} real world. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> not on the direct victims of the perpetuated violence, but the impact of violence on the perpetrators or witnesses to the act.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, with {{sponsorship}} {{for several}} years, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> to win all three Grand Tours, with Ivan Basso riding both Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France, and Carlos Sastre the Vuelta a España. They had come {{second in the}} 2005 in the Tour and Vuelta, respectively. The team had several time trialists, including Zabriskie, who had won time trials at the Giro and the Tour, Julich, as well as Fabian Cancellara. Others included Jens Voigt and Stuart O'Grady from Australia, the only sprinter name in the team.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} traffic {{problems}} in Nanuet were reduced, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> shifted to West Nyack where Palisades Center was being constructed. First {{proposed in the}} late 1980s, construction finally started in 1995. This caused major delays for motorists when a bridge was constructed from NY59 to Palisades Center south parking lot. To keep this portion of NY59 from being overloaded with mall goers, exit12 of the Thruway with NY303 was re-routed through Palisades Center via Palisades Center Drive.|$|E
5|$|From the 1950s onwards, {{stories about}} Brown were often {{included}} in local {{histories of the}} southeast of South Australia. Examples include Elma Smith's History of Kingston published in 1950, and Kingston Flashback written by local historian Verne McLaren and published in 1970. In Smith's version, the original crime was not discussed, and <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> on the horse ride to Adelaide, and McLaren's account split the legend into two, one about a poisoning by Brown, and another in which Brown and an accomplice cornered Aboriginal people in the Papineau caves, smoked them out and shot them. The second of McLaren's stories ended with Brown's famous ride to Adelaide {{to report to the}} police. Another account was included in Barry Durman's A History of the Baker's Range Settlement, published in 1978. Durman reproduced a newspaper article about the investigation into Brown's involvement in the murders, passed over the manner by which the murders were carried out and stated that the case was not proven, and then told of a wonderful feat of horsemanship by Brown.|$|E
5|$|In most temples, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> {{the cult}} image: {{a statue of}} the temple god which that god's ba was {{believed}} to inhabit while interacting with humans. The sanctuary in these temples contained either a naos, a cabinet-like shrine that housed the divine image, or a model barque containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions. In some cases the sanctuary may have housed several cult statues. To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in total darkness. Whereas in earlier times the sanctuary lay {{at the very back}} of the building, in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple, further insulated from the outside world by the surrounding corridors and rooms.|$|E

5|$|Like most 2nd AIF units, the 2/4th drew its cadre {{staff of}} {{officers}} and senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs) from volunteers from local Militia units. These were augmented by partially trained Other Ranks (ORs) {{from the three}} local recruit training depots; the first batch of these, numbering 394 men, arrived at Northam on 27 November and a further 262 marched in on 4 December. As the battalion was brought up to its authorised strength of around 800 men, personnel were formed into four machine gun companies, 'A' to 'D', under a headquarters company consisting of several specialist platoons—including signals and anti-aircraft platoons—and battalion headquarters. There were no platoon commanders until a contingent arrived from the regional Officer Training Units. Initially training was hampered {{by a lack of}} equipment—only 12 of 48 Vickers machine guns assigned to the battalion were available—so at the start <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> on individual rather than collective training. As more stores arrived, training accelerated with the help of experienced Militia NCOs and First World War veterans, who were brought in to share their experiences with the new troops. Just before Christmas and New Year's leave, the battalion received its distinctive Unit Colour Patch: a black and gold triangle.|$|E
5|$|Liman {{approached}} {{a wide range}} of actors for the role of Bourne, including Brad Pitt, who turned it down to star in Spy Game, as well as Russell Crowe, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise and Sylvester Stallone, before he eventually cast Damon. Liman found that Damon understood and appreciated that, though The Bourne Identity would have its share of action, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> primarily on character and plot. Damon, who had never played such a physically demanding role, insisted on performing many of the stunts himself. With stunt choreographer Nick Powell, he underwent three months of extensive training in stunt work, the use of weapons, boxing, and eskrima. He eventually performed a significant number of the film's stunts himself, including hand-to-hand combat and climbing the safe house walls near the film's conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Miller's Language and Communication {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{significant}} texts in the study of language behavior. The book was a scientific study of language, emphasizing quantitative data, and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon's information theory. It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first part of the book reviewed information theory, the physiology and acoustics of phonetics, speech recognition and comprehension, and statistical techniques to analyze language. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: idiosyncratic differences across people in language use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and social aspects of language use.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the linkages between Social Network Theory (Granovetter 1973) and Organizational Knowledge Theory (Polanyi 1966, Nonaka 1994; Nonaka, Toyama and Byosiere 2001) {{as it relates}} to diffusion of organizational innovation within large organizations. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> on examining these theoretical interrelationships in three case studies delving into major change projects in three large telecommunications firms. Findings indicate that weak ties <b>are</b> vital when <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> on explicit knowledge while strong ties <b>are</b> vital when <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> on tacit knowledge. Further, a model is posed to expand this theoretical interrelationship to include a third dimension: knowledge source...|$|R
5|$|Negotiations {{continued}} during autumn 1938. The Soviets {{reduced their}} demands: a Red Army operation {{was not an}} option anymore and <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> shifted on securing the Gulf of Finland. The Soviets wanted to be informed of key elements of the Finnish–Estonian Gulf blockade, the secret military plan against the Baltic Fleet. Furthermore, Yartsev suggested that the Finns fortify the Suursaari island, but that the Soviets would take care of its defence. During the negotiations, Rudolf Holsti resigned as foreign minister, although not for reasons associated with the negotiations, and his place was taken by Eljas Erkko. Holsti was rather anti-German, so the resignation set off rumours, quickly quelled by the Finnish government, that he had been forced to resign by a Finnish government sympathetic to the Germans. The Finns attempted to appear even-handed, and the interior ministry issued an order banning the extreme-right IKL. The ban was reversed by the Finnish courts as being unconstitutional. Many years later, the minister in charge at that time, Urho Kekkonen, admitted that this was a simple gesture, to suggest to Moscow that Finland did not harbour a German fifth column.|$|E
5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, {{it was hard to}} make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close-up, but even then <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E
