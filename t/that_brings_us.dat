5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. <b>That</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

[...] She quotes Elizabeth Wallace's introduction as saying that it gives modern readers reason to appreciate having a refrigerator and a global food system <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> out-of-season produce. Yet, she observes, the English housewife had many varieties of vegetables, 30 kinds of seafood and 35 kinds of poultry (including hares and rabbits). She notes that the book also describes home remedies, the housewife having to function as [...] " [...] chef, doctor, pharmacist, exterminator, chemist, laundress, and all-around handy-woman." [...] Reflecting that the recipes would [...] "probably never" [...] be used today, and the medicines are useless, the book remains invaluable for researchers, gives readers {{a glimpse into the}} world of Jane Austen and her contemporaries, and richly documents eighteenth-century English life.|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Nielsen {{wrote the}} music for over 290 songs and hymns, most of them for verses and poems by {{well-known}} Danish authors such as N. F. S. Grundtvig, Ingemann, Poul Martin Møller, Adam Oehlenschläger and Jeppe Aakjær. In Denmark, {{many of them are}} still popular today both with adults and children. They are regarded as [...] "the most representative part of the country's most representative composer's output". In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:With certain melodic inflections we Danes unavoidably think of the poems of, for example, Ingemann, Christian Winther or Drachmann, and we often seem to perceive the smell of Danish landscapes and rural images in our songs and music. But {{it is also clear that}} a foreigner, who knows neither our countryside, nor our painters, our poets, or our history in the same intimate way as we do ourselves, will be completely unable to grasp what it is <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to hear and tremble with sympathetic understanding.|$|E

Woolf wanted writers to express themselves {{in such a way that}} it showed life as it should be seen not as [...] "a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged".

2500|$|As The Shooting {{was never}} {{released}} theatrically, and had sparse television showings, it initially {{had a very}} limited core of fans. Those critics who did manage to view the film were extremely enthusiastic, and generally found it superior to Hellman's companion western, Ride in the Whirlwind. Danny Peary in Cult Movies (1981), after admitting that he had difficulties with the [...] "puzzling" [...] climax, noted [...] "But while the end may ask more questions than it answers, the exciting journey <b>that</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to this point {{is one of the}} most rewarding sequences in the history of westerns." [...] Leonard Maltin said it was an [...] "...ultimately powerful film with an offbeat performance by Nicholson as a hired gun... and an incredible, unexpected finale." [...] David Pirie in Time Out wrote, [...] "Probably the first Western which really deserves to be called existential... Hellman builds remorselessly on the atmosphere and implications of the 'quest' until it assumes a terrifying importance in itself... What Hellman has done is to take the basic tools of the Western, and use them, without in anyway diluting or destroying their power, as the basis for a Kafkaesque drama." [...] Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: The Western notes that [...] "Hellman's calculated style, replete with disorientating close-ups and strange moments... confirm the detached fatalism of his story. This is a marvelous film." [...] James Monaco's The Movie Guide described the film as [...] "ighly effective, playing with various levels of character and ideas... it is a fine western stylization that should not be missed." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum has referred to the film as the first acid western, and cited it as an inspiration for Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man. The Shooting has a 100% favorable rating on the [...] "Critical Tomatometer" [...] at the Rotten Tomatoes website.|$|E
