5|$|This pumping {{project was}} {{designed}} to increase the surface area of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake, and thus increase the rate of water evaporation. The pumps drove some of the water of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake into the 320,000-acre (1300-square kilometer) Newfoundland Evaporation Basin in the desert west of the lake. A weir in the dike {{at the southern end}} of the Newfoundland Mountains regulated the level of water in the basin, and it sometimes returned salty water from the evaporation basin into the main body of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake.|$|E

The whales are said to have disappeared into the lake and subsequently sighted multiple times over a number of months, but there have never been any confirmed sightings of the whales since the time of their supposed release.|$|E

5|$|Bounded on each {{sides by}} {{military}} training grounds, the I-80 corridor is overflown by commercial airliners traveling west from Salt Lake City International Airport. The freeway veers north around the Cedar Mountains {{in a small}} gap {{between them and the}} Lakeside Mountains. Further east, the highway passes the Stansbury Mountains, which are located in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. After the mountain ranges, the freeway arrives at the southern shore of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake and closely follows the shore towards the western suburbs of Salt Lake City. However, the historical routes from which the route of I-80 was derived were routed further from the lake, passing through the towns of Grantsville and Tooele before crossing a bottleneck between the Oquirrh Mountains and Stansbury Island in <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake. These communities are now served by SR-138 and SR-36 respectively.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake is fed {{by three}} major rivers and several minor streams. The three major rivers are each fed {{directly}} or indirectly from the Uinta Mountain range in northeastern Utah. The Bear River starts on the north slope of the Uintas and flows north past Bear Lake, into which some of Bear River's waters have been diverted via a man-made canal into the lake, but later empty back into the river {{by means of the}} Bear Lake Outlet. The river then turns south in southern Idaho and eventually flows into the northeast arm of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake. The Weber River also starts on the north slope of the Uinta Mountains and flows into the east edge of the lake. The Jordan River does not receive its water directly from the Uintas, rather it flows from freshwater Utah Lake, which itself is fed primarily by the Provo River; the Provo River does originate in the Uintas, {{a few miles from the}} Weber and Bear. The Jordan flows from the north part of Utah Lake into the southeast corner of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake.|$|E
5|$|While waterspouts form {{mostly in}} the tropics and {{subtropical}} areas, other areas also report waterspouts, including Europe, New Zealand, the Great Lakes, Antarctica and on rare occasions, <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake.

5|$|Lansford W. Hastings, {{an early}} {{immigrant}} from Ohio to the West, went to California in 1842 {{and saw the}} promise of the undeveloped country. To encourage settlers, he published The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California. He described a direct route across the Great Basin which would bring immigrants through the Wasatch Mountains and across <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake Desert. Hastings had not traveled any part of his proposed shortcut until early 1846 on a trip from California to Fort Bridger. The fort was a scant supply station run by Jim Bridger and his partner Pierre Louis Vasquez in Blacks Fork, Wyoming. Hastings stayed at the fort to persuade travelers to turn south on his route. As of 1846, Hastings was the second of two men documented to have crossed the southern part of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake Desert, but neither had been accompanied by wagons.|$|E
5|$|Located {{entirely in}} Salt Lake County, Utah, SR-202 begins at an {{intersection}} with SR-201 and 11500West northwest of Magna, Utah. The road travels northwesterly, bordered {{on the east}} by a large tailing pond owned by Kennecott Utah Copper {{and part of the}} former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad rail line, which is now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP). The parallel rail line intersects a pair of east–west rail lines, the southern line being UP main line, and the northern line being the Feather River Route of the former Western Pacific Railroad, which is now owned by UP. After crossing the rail lines, SR-202 intersects with I-80 near <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake State Park and comes to a terminus at the I-80 frontage road, which provides access to <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake State Park and to the Saltair resort.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake entered written European history {{through the}} records of Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, who learned of its {{existence}} from the Timpanogos Utes in 1776. No European name was given to it at the time, {{and it was not}} shown on the map by Bernardo Miera y Pacheco, the cartographer for the expedition. In 1824, it was observed, apparently independently, by Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost. Shortly thereafter other trappers saw it and walked around it.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River {{watershed}} is {{bounded by}} several other major North American watersheds, which drain {{both to the}} Atlantic or the Pacific, or into endorheic basins.

On the south, the Snake watershed borders that of the Humboldt River in Nevada, and the watershed of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake (the Bear, Jordan and Weber rivers) on the south.|$|E
5|$|The Western Pacific Railroad line, {{part of the}} Feather River Route, that {{parallels}} the cut-off was built between 1906 and 1907, filling a causeway with rock and gravel at a great cost.

5|$|All {{but four}} of the streams lie within the large basin of the Columbia River, {{although}} the river itself does not flow through Idaho. Consequently, the predominant direction of the state's streamflow is northwest towards the Columbia River and its mouth at the Pacific Ocean. The only other major drainage basin in Idaho is <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake watershed in the state's southeastern corner, {{which is part of}} the Great Basin and has no outlet to the ocean. The Bear River, the second-longest stream, is within this watershed, along with the Malad River, Deep Creek, and the Logan River.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is too {{reactive}} {{to occur}} as the free element in nature but is very {{abundant in the}} form of its chloride salts. It is the twentieth most abundant element in Earth's crust and makes up 126parts per million of it, through the large deposits of chloride minerals, especially sodium chloride, that have been evaporated from water bodies. All of these pale in comparison to the reserves of chloride ions in seawater: smaller amounts at higher concentrations occur in some inland seas and underground brine wells, such as <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea in Israel.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E
5|$|The major oceanic {{divisions}} are defined {{in part by}} the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria: these {{divisions are}} (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays and other names. There are also salt lakes, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the Aral Sea and <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{size and}} whether they are counted as islands during any {{particular}} year depends mostly {{on the level of}} the lake.
