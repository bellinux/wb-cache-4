In practice, establishment meant that local taxes were funneled through the local parish to handle the needs of local government, such as roads and poor relief, {{in addition to the}} salary of the minister. <b>There</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bishop in colonial Virginia, and in practice the local vestry, consisting of gentry laymen controlled the parish.

Both were Civil War veterans, {{well known}} and {{respected}} early settlers. Many of the volunteer personnel composed of well known early settlers, merchants and professional men, many of whose descendants are living in Huntington today. In 1876 a night-watchman was hired at $3 per month {{to look after the}} station at night and sound the alarm in case of a fire. This was the first paid employee of the fire department. In 1879 J.W. Verlander became the first Fire Chief, and J.M. Boone became chief in 1880 until 1895. In 1881, four Gamewell Fire Alarm Boxes were installed in the downtown area. These fire alarm boxes were maintained by the telephone company. The system kept growing, and in 1928 construction was completed on a new Gamewell Fire Alarm System and Fire Alarm Headquarters were placed in operation in 1929, and remained in service until 7:32AM November 1, 1986. The Gamewell Fire Alarm System served the City of Huntington faithfully for 105 years. <b>There</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> loss of life or major disaster because of a system malfunction.|$|E

[...] Heisman recalled that, despite his small stature, Strupper had a powerful body: [...] "Stripped down in the dressing rooms Everett was a sight to behold. <b>There</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> better set up lad than he; he was a regular Apollo, beautifully muscled and built and coordinating rhythmically in every movement." ...|$|E

500|$|Molotov, like Stalin, was pathologically mistrustful of others, {{and because}} of it, much crucial {{information}} disappeared. As Molotov once said [...] "One should listen to them, but {{it is necessary to}} check up on them. The intelligence officer can lead you to a very dangerous position... There are many provocateurs here, there, and everywhere." [...] Molotov continued to claim, in a series of published interviews, that <b>there</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> secret territorial deal between Stalin and Hitler during the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Like Stalin, he never recognised the Cold War as an international event. He saw the Cold War as, more or less, the everyday conflict between communism and capitalism. He divided the capitalist countries into two groups, the [...] "smart and dangerous imperialists" [...] and the [...] "fools". Before his retirement, Molotov proposed establishing a socialist confederation with the People's Republic of China (PRC); Molotov believed socialist states were part of a bigger, supranational entity. In retirement, Molotov criticised Nikita Khrushchev for being a [...] "right-wing deviationist".|$|E

But the degree of the Gauss map for the embeddings f and f in R3 are both equal to 1, and do not have opposite sign as one might incorrectly guess. The degree of the Gauss map of all immersions of S2 in R3 is 1, so there is no obstacle. The term [...] "veridical paradox" [...] applies perhaps more appropriately at this level: until Smale's work, there was no documented attempt to argue for or against the eversion of S2, and later efforts are in hindsight, so <b>there</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> historical paradox associated with sphere eversion, only an appreciation of the subtleties in visualizing it by those confronting the idea for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|This tale {{involves}} two German men, Jacob Waltz (or Weitz, Weitzer, Walls, Welz, Walz, et cetera) and Jacob Weiser. However, Blair {{argued that}} there is a strong likelihood that <b>there</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> second man named Weiser, but rather that a single person named Waltz (or a variant thereof) was, over the years, turned into two men as the legend of the Dutchman's mine evolved. Blair contended that this story can be divided into [...] "hawk" [...] and [...] "dove" [...] versions, depending on whether the German(s) are said to behave violently or peacefully. In most versions of the tale, Waltz and/or Weiser located a rich gold mine in the Superstition Mountains (in many versions of the story, they rescue or help a member of the Peralta family and are rewarded by being told the location of the mine). Weiser is attacked and wounded (whether by marauding Apaches or by a greedy Waltz), but survives at least long enough to tell a man called Dr. Walker about the mine. Waltz is also said to make a deathbed confession to Julia Thomas, and draws or describes a crude map to the gold mine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} Irish {{name for}} {{the site of the}} modern city was Daire Calgaich, Old Irish for [...] "oak wood of Calgach", after an unknown pagan. John Keys O'Doherty, Bishop of Derry, sought to identify Calgach with Agricola's opponent Calgacus. A Celtic Christian monastery was founded there in the sixth century; Adomnán names Saint Columba as founder. The name was changed to Daire Coluimb Chille, [...] "oak wood of Columba", first mentioned in the Annals of Ulster for 1121. As the monastic site grew in prominence, the name was reduced to just Doire (now pronounced [...] ). This was later anglicised to Derry. [...] In 1604, [...] "Derrie" [...] was granted its first royal charter as a city by James I of England. The settlement was destroyed in 1608 by Cahir O'Doherty, Irish chieftain of Inishowen. During the Plantation of Ulster by English and Scottish settlers, a new walled city was built across the River Foyle from the old site by the Irish Society, a consortium of the livery companies of the City of London. In recognition of the London investors, the 1613 charter stated [...] "that the said city or town of Derry, for ever hereafter be and shall be named and called the city of Londonderry". The county was created by the same charter, largely based on the previous county of Coleraine, and named [...] "Londonderry" [...] after the new county town so officially <b>there</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> County Derry.
