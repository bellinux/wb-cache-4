40|$|BACKGROUND: Hypertensive {{disorders}} {{of pregnancy}} (HDP) are multisystem disorders unique to human pregnancy. They are becoming the {{leading causes of}} maternal mortality worldwide, {{with the majority of}} deaths occurring in low income countries. However, {{little is known about the}} predictors of maternal mortality in women with HDP. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2008 and 2013 in three university teaching hospitals among 1015 women admitted with a diagnosis of HDP. Statistically significant associations were assessed by the hazard ratio (HR) with 95 % confidence using the Cox proportional hazards model and by the Log Rank test using <b>the</b> Kaplan-Meier <b>survival</b> <b>analyses.</b> RESULTS: There were 51 (5 %) maternal deaths and the majority died after they developed eclampsia. The median delay in arrival among the deaths was longer than the survivors. <b>The</b> multivariate <b>survival</b> <b>analyses</b> showed an increased risk of maternal mortality among women with eclampsia (HR= 8. 4), no antenatal care (HR= 2. 3), being grand multiparous (HR= 2. 8), having low diastolic blood pressure (HR= 4. 5), high creatinine level (HR= 9. 9), use of diazepam as anticonvulsant (HR= 2. 7) and untreated with antihypertensive drug (HR= 4. 2). CONCLUSIONS: The case fatality rate of HDP was among the highest in the world and a delay in initiation of treatment because of delay in health care-seeking contributed to the majority of maternal deaths...|$|R

40|$|In {{many studies}} the {{variable}} {{that is of}} interest to us is the time that would lapse before an event takes place. This event can be death or death from some particular disease; that is why analises of such data are called survival analises. An {{example of such a}} study can be a clinic examination of a new kind of therapy with malign tumors whose prognosis is unfavorable. In such an examination the final occurrence is death or remission. The study may comprise the examined who were yet to experience the final occurrence at the time when the analysis was conducted. Though the time till the final event with these patients is unknown, there are some pieces of information regarding its value; one of them is that this time must be longer than the survival time so far. The value that we have available at the moment of the analysis is called the censured value. The analysis methods must be such as {{to be able to use}} such censured values. Very often many other variables obtained at the beginning of the ex-animation and survival are mutually connected so that these variables can be regarded as prognostic.

40|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) {{is characterized}} by a high risk of recurrence, especially among individuals whose initial episode occurs during adolescence. Identifying predictors of recurrence of MDD among young samples is therefore of paramount clinical importance. Survival analytic models were used to evaluate the effects of dysfunctional cognitions and Axis II personality pathology on MDD recurrence in a sample of 130 previously, but not currently, depressed young adults. Participants were initially assessed for depression, dysfunctional attitudes, and personality pathology during their first semester in college and then reevaluated via the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation interview every 6 months for 18 months.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{utility of}} three {{different}} epithelial mRNA markers to detect clinically significant, disseminated tumour cells in bone marrow (BM) was explored. METHODS: Mammaglobin A (hMAM), trefoil factor 1 (TFF- 1) and prostate derived Ets factor (PDEF) mRNA were quantitated by real-time RT-PCR in BM samples from 192 breast cancer patients undergoing surgery (control group: 26 healthy women). RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 72 months, {{four of the five}} hMAM BM-positive and three of the seven TFF- 1 BM-positive patients experienced a systemic relapse. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses demonstrated significantly shorter recurrence-free-, breast-cancer-specific- and overall survival for both hMAM and TFF- 1 BM-positive patients. In contrast, PDEF mRNA quantitation did not reveal any significant differences in <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>analyses.</b> Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated hMAM mRNA BM expression to be an independent predictor of both overall- (hazard ratio = 5. 896), breast-cancer-specific- (hazard ratio = 10. 208) and systemic-recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio = 14. 304). TFF- 1 status was related to hMAM status (P < 0. 001).

40|$|A {{multistage}} testing {{strategy to}} detect QTL for resistance to infectious salmon anemia (ISA) in Atlantic salmon is proposed. First, genotyping of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) {{were carried out}} using dead offspring from a disease resistance challenge test. Second, AFLP genotyping among survivors followed by a Mendelian segregation test was performed. Third, within-family survival analyses using all offspring were developed and applied to significant TDT markers with Mendelian inheritance. Maximum-likelihood methodology was developed for TDT with dominant markers to exploit linkage disequilibrium within families. The strategy was tested with two full-sib families of Atlantic salmon sired by the same male and consisting of 79 offspring in total. All dead offspring from the two families were typed for 64 primer combinations, resulting in 340 scored markers. There were 26 significant results out of 401 TDTs using dead offspring. In the second stage, only 17 marker families showed Mendelian segregation and were tested in survival analysis.

Less is known about susceptibility, or year to year changes in exposure. We investigated whether particles were associated with survival in a cohort of persons with COPD in 34 US cities, eliminating the usual cross-sectional exposure and treating PM 10 as a within city time varying exposure. Methods Using hospital discharge data, we constructed a cohort of persons discharged alive with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} using Medicare data between 1985 and 1999. 12 -month averages of PM 10 were merged to the individual annual follow up in each city. We applied Cox's proportional hazard regression model in each city, with adjustment for individual risk factors.

40|$|PURPOSE: An {{important}} feature of malignant tumors is the disturbance in the balance between proliferation and cell death. We evaluated the relevance of intrinsic and radiation-induced apoptosis and proliferation for prognosis in rectal cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were selected from a study that randomized for preoperative radiotherapy (RT). Apoptosis and proliferation were scored using specific antibodies in immunohistochemistry. The number of positive cells per square millimeter of carcinoma cells was determined in 98 randomly selected tumors, of which 45 had been irradiated. For <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>analyses,</b> a cohort of 104 patients without positive circumferential resection margins was selected. RESULTS: In nonirradiated patients, high levels of intrinsic apoptosis correlated with better local control (p = 0. 04) and better cancer-specific survival (p = 0. 02). RT increased the median amount of apoptosis from 10. 8 to 21. 5 cells/mm(2) (p = 0. 004), {{but this was not}} predictive for survival. The amount of proliferative cells was not altered after RT and had no influence on prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Intrinsic apoptosis correlated with both local control and cancer-specific survival, but proliferation was not predictive for prognosis. However, although RT increased apoptosis, its prognostic value was lost after RT. This is possibly because in rectal cancer, the proliferative status of tumors is always high and the aggressiveness of the tumor is determined by the number of "spontaneous" apoptotic tumor cells...|$|E

The clinical challenge remains how to improve adherence to evidence-based cardiac care for all patients who can benefit from it. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of drug use after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in reducing total medium-term mortality and to establish whether there are disparities in prescribing all therapies of demonstrated effectiveness. Design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study between 2002 and 2009 using a record linkage database, considering 1327 patients discharged after AMI. Methods: Cox's regression models were used for the survival analysis with time-dependent variables. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the inequalities in the actual use of therapies found significantly associated with a lower mortality in <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>analyses.</b> Results: Therapies independently associated with a lower all-cause mortality risk were antiplatelet drugs, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins.

40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{association}} between autoimmune disease and malignant melanoma (MM) {{has often been}} reported in the literature as a positive prognostic factor for MM. Consequently, we evaluated the influence of different autoimmune diseases on the prognosis of MM. AIM: To evaluate the prognosis of patients with MM who also had an autoimmune disorder, whether tumour-associated, paraneoplastic or drug-induced. METHODS: Autoimmune diseases were classified and analysed as tumour-associated, paraneoplastic or drug-induced. Patients were enrolled according to their clinicopathological features and matched with control groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), and log-rank test was used to evaluate differences between the survival curves. RESULTS: In total, 49 patients with MM and tumour-associated autoimmune disease were included in our analysis. No case of paraneoplastic autoimmune disease was detected. <b>The</b> <b>survival</b> <b>analyses</b> showed a range of results, from a worsening of DFS and OS to a lack of any difference. In a second analysis, we separately analysed patients who developed autoimmune disorders after starting adjuvant therapy with interferon-α; we did not find significant differences between these patients and the untreated patients.

Methods for estimating relative survival are also described. Incidence and vital status data on newly diagnosed European cancer cases were received from 93 cancer registries in 23 countries, covering 151, 400, 000 people (35 % of the participating country population). The third revision of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology was used to specify tumour topography and morphology. Records were extensively checked for consistency and compatibility using multiple routines; flagged records were sent back for correction. An algorithm assigned standardised sequence numbers to multiple cancers. Only first malignant cancers were used to estimate relative survival from registry, year, sex and age-specific life tables. Age-adjusted and Europe-wide survival were also estimated. The database contains 13, 814, 573 cases diagnosed in 1978 - 2002; 92 % malignant. A negligible proportion of records was excluded for major errors. Of 5, 753, 934 malignant adult cases diagnosed in 1995 - 2002, 5. 3 % were second or later cancers, 2. 7 % were known from death certificates only and 0. 4 % were discovered at autopsy.

Methods The prospective Pharmacogenoscan study enrolled consecutive patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at any stage seen between 2005 and 2010 at six hospitals in France, given chemotherapy. After exclusion of patients without RECIST or continuous-scale tumour size data and of those with early death, 464 patients were left for <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>analyses.</b> Cox models were built to assess relationships between RECIST 1. 1 categories or change in continuous-scale tumour size and OS. The best model was defined as the model minimising the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Results OS was 14. 2 months (IQR, 7. 3 - 28. 9 months). According to RECIST 1. 1, 146 (31 %) patients had a partial or complete response, 245 (53 %) stable disease, and 73 (16 %) disease progression. RECIST 1. 1 predicted better OS than continuous-scale tumour in early (< 6 months) predicted survival analyses (p[*]=[*] 0. 03) but the accuracy of the two response evaluation methods was similar in late (≥ 6 months) predicted survival analyses (p[*]=[*] 0. 15).

40|$|Abstract Thirty-six of 39 {{published}} calculated doubling times (Td's) of uveal melanomas {{appeared to}} be longer than 60 days. Metastatic death occurs 35 – 40 Td's after dissemination. The shortest interval between dissemination and metastatic death in individual patients may, therefore, be calculated as 35 × 60 days= 6 years; the interval may extend to 80 years. This suggests, that local therapy cannot influence <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> data within <b>the</b> first 7 post-therapeutic years, because almost all metastatic deaths within these 7 years are due to pretreatment dissemination. For that reason, <b>the</b> published comparative <b>survival</b> <b>analyses</b> after various therapies have within this period failed to show statistically significant death rates differences. Microscopically viable melanoma tissue has been noted in 215 of 231 histopathologically studied irradiated uveal melanomas. Observed mitotic figures 4 – 6 years after irradiation indicate retained reproductive integrity. This constitutes a — by enucleation avoidable — incremental risk for post-irradiation exponential growth and dissemination. The risk cannot become statistically manifest before a≥ 10 -year follow-up period.

Moderate-to-high levels of predictive accuracy for total score were achieved for treatment com-pleters, dropouts, and refusers across four recidivism outcomes. Three risk categories were identified with significantly dif-ferent rates of both sexual and any violent recidivism; failure rates and likelihood ratios for these risk categories over 5 -, 7 -, and 10 -year follow-up periods were reported...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Screening {{can lead}} to earlier {{detection}} of breast cancer and thus to an improvement in <b>survival.</b> <b>The</b> authors studied the life expectancy of women with screen-detected invasive breast cancer (patients) compared with women invited to the breast cancer screening program in Nijmegen, the Netherlands (comparison group). METHODS: Each patient diagnosed between 1975 and 2006 was randomly age-matched with a woman invited in the same calendar year and free from breast cancer {{at the time of}} diagnosis of <b>the</b> patient. <b>Survival</b> <b>analyses</b> were performed to study differences in life expectancy. RESULTS: The life expectancy for 858 patients was 6 years shorter than for the comparison group. However, for 360 patients with small ( or = 15 mm) the life expectancy was 6 to 12 years shorter, depending on tumor size. Furthermore, life expectancy was modified by screening history. For patients who had a negative screening examination 2 years before the detection of their breast cancer, the difference in life expectancy from the comparison group became smaller for the larger tumor sizes (> or = 15 mm). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, about 40 % (360 of 858) of all women with invasive screen-detected breast cancer have the same life expectancy as women from the comparison group (reflecting the general population). For women diagnosed with larger tumors at diagnosis, life expectancy diminishes with increasing tumor size and is modified by screening history...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: Epidemiologic {{studies show}} an {{association}} between higher predialysis serum phosphorus and increased death risk in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. The hypothesis that higher dietary phosphorus intake and higher phosphorus content per gram of dietary protein intake are each associated with increased mortality in MHD patients was examined. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Food frequency questionnaires were used to conduct a cohort study to examine the survival predictability of dietary phosphorus and the ratio of phosphorus to protein intake. At {{the start of the}} cohort, Cox proportional hazard regression was used in 224 MHD patients, who were followed for up to 5 years (2001 to 2006). Results: Both higher dietary phosphorus intake and a higher dietary phosphorus to protein ratio were associated with significantly increased death hazard ratios (HR) in the unadjusted models and after incremental adjustments for case-mix, diet, serum phosphorus, malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome, and inflammatory markers. The HR of the highest (compared with lowest) dietary phosphorus intake tertile in the fully adjusted model was 2. 37. Across categories of dietary phosphorus to protein ratios of 16 mg/g, death HRs were 1. 13, 1. 00 (reference value), 1. 80, and 1. 99, respectively. Cubic spline models of <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>analyses</b> showed similar incremental associations. Conclusions: Higher dietary phosphorus intake and higher dietary phosphorus to protein ratios are each associated with increased death risk in MHD patients, even after adjustments for serum phosphorus, phosphate binders and their types, an...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{disposable}} soma {{theory suggests}} that reproduction occurs {{at the expense of}} physiological resource maintenance (Kirkwood, 1977). Elaborating on this theory, some researchers have proposed that a negative relationship exists between longevity and reproduction (e. g. Westendorp & Kirkwood, 1998). Studies examining this relationship were often restricted to isolated groups that may be considered questionable representations of the general population (Westendorp & Kirkwood, 1998, Korpelainen, 2000). The current study examined whether the number of children a woman bears during her lifetime decreases her lifespan, as posited by the disposable soma theory. Female and male twin pairs from the Swedish Twin Registry were analyzed using a co-twin control model and survival analysis. Twin data helps elucidate whether this phenomenon is accounted for by familial factors or non-shared environmental factors. Based on the results of <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>analyses,</b> there were main effects of birth year, gender, and having any children in predicting lifespan. More specifically, females, individuals who had children, and individuals born in later cohorts versus earlier cohorts had increased chances of survival. Also, birth year accounted for part of the association between having any children and lifespan. The results are consistent with a causal interpretation at the individual level, as the inclusion of co-twin information did not increase the predictability of survival. The evidence in this study does not support the disposable soma theory and sheds light on other factors that might affect lifespan...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{factors associated}} with engagement of U. S. Federal Health Agencies via Twitter. Our specific goals are to study factors related to a) numbers of retweets, b) time between the agency tweet and first retweet and c) time between the agency tweet and last retweet. We collect 164, 104 tweets from 25 Federal Health Agencies and their 130 accounts. We use negative binomial hurdle regression models and Cox proportional hazards models to {{explore the influence of}} 26 factors on agency engagement. Account features include network centrality, tweet count, numbers of friends, followers, and favorites. Tweet features include age, the use of hashtags, user-mentions, URLs, sentiment measured using Sentistrength, and tweet content represented by fifteen semantic groups. A third of the tweets (53, 556) had zero retweets. Less than 1 % (613) had more than 100 retweets (mean  =  284). The hurdle analysis shows that hashtags, URLs and user-mentions are positively associated with retweets; sentiment has no association with retweets; and tweet count has a negative association with retweets. Almost all semantic groups, except for geographic areas, occupations and organizations, are positively associated with retweeting. <b>The</b> <b>survival</b> <b>analyses</b> indicate that engagement is positively associated with tweet age and the follower count. Some of the {{factors associated with}} higher levels of Twitter engagement cannot be changed by the agencies, but others can be modified (e. g., use of hashtags, URLs). Our findings provide the background for future controlled experiments to increase public health engagement via Twitter...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{meta-analysis}} of maximal androgen blockade (MAB) {{concluded that there}} is no survival advantage of MAB over castration alone. However, the results from the largest trials yield conflicting results. METHODS. The design and results of three trials were examined. RESULTS. Most studies were planned to detect an over-optimistic difference in survival and immature data were published. <b>The</b> <b>survival</b> curves show that statistical assumptions are not fulfilled. Excluding from the mete-analysis all trials where a negative impact of disease flare on survival could not be excluded resulted in no difference in survival between MAB and castration. CONCLUSIONS. Trials of MAB should be planned to detect differences of no more than 5 - 10 % in median <b>survival.</b> <b>The</b> <b>analyses</b> should only be carried out on mature data and should take into account the possibility of a negative impact on survival due to disease flare if no anti-androgen has been given initially with an LH-RH agonist.

This indicated prevention program was implemented in school settings for 14 - 15 year-old students judged to be "at risk" for depression {{because of the presence of}} some depressive symptoms and/or a negative attributional style. We previously reported (Arnarson & Craighead, 2009) that this program, when compared to treatment-as-usual, was effective in preventing the first episode of depression and/or dysthymia at 6 -months following completion of <b>the</b> program. <b>Survival</b> <b>analyses</b> of <b>the</b> 12 -month follow-up data indicated that the preventive effects were sustained at the end of 1 year following the completion of the prevention program with only 2 of the prevention program participants reporting an initial episode of MDD/DYS versus 13 of the TAU participants (χ(2)  =  5. 02, p = . 025). Using logistic regression, we also found that initial level of depressive symptoms significantly (p = . 0330) predicted the first episode of depression and/or dysthymia among TAU subjects. The limitations of the study were noted, and future directions of research regarding prevention of depression were discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare sire EBVs for longevity in Chianina beef cattle estimated with linear models and survival analysis. Two datasets were created, one considered all data (SURVall), the other only uncensored records (SURVun). The linear models were used to analyze longevity measured as three correlated dichotomous (yes/no) measures of <b>survival</b> in <b>the</b> first three parities (LIN-S 3) and as an overall measure of lifespan in months (LIN-LPL). Correlation between sire EBVs from <b>the</b> two <b>survival</b> <b>analyses</b> were 0. 85. For LIN-S 3 the correlations of EBVs across parities were between 0. 69 to 0. 93. Medium correlations (from 0. 50 to 0. 62) were found when only uncensored data (SURVun) were compared to the linear model (LIN-S 3). Higher correlations (from 0. 71 to 0. 93) were found when EBV based on both censored and uncensored data (SURVall) were compared to LIN-S 3. Heritability was estimated at 0. 11, 0. 09 and 0. 08 for SURVall, SURVun and LIN-LPL, respectively; and 0. 05, 0. 02 and 0. 02, respectively, for <b>survival</b> in <b>the</b> first three parities according to LIN-S 3. Linear and non-linear models differed in many aspects; the most precise EBV were obtained when all data was used in the evaluatio...|$|R
