This tank survived from D-Day to VE-Day without being knocked out, an improbable achievement {{given the high}} casualty rate amongst front line combat equipment. Bomb crew, originally Troopers A.W. Rudolph, [...] "Red" [...] Fletcher, J.W. (Tiny) Hall, Lance-Corporal R. (Rudy) Moreault and Sergeant Harold Futter, crew commander, kept the tank in service, firing over 6,000 rounds and surviving at least one shell impact. Futter was wounded in July 1944; he and one other man were replaced in Normandy by Lieutenant Paul Ayriss and Trooper Ken Jeroux. Lieutenant J.W. Neill replaced Ayriss in August 1944, and was later awarded the Military Cross. Two more officers to command Bomb were Lieutenant Walter White, who was wounded in April 1945, and Lieutenant Earnest Mingo, who replaced him until the war's end. The tank and crew members Rudolph, Moreault and Hall were {{the subject of a}} Canadian Army Film and Photographic Unit production entitled Green Fields Beyond (number 2090) in 1945. The tank was on display at the Champs de Mars Park, Queen Boulevard North, Sherbrooke, Quebec. In 2003, it received expert refinishing and repainting in a two-week-long <b>technical</b> <b>visit</b> by Canadian Forces maintainers from CFB Valcarter. [...] Nevertheless, by 2011 that work had deteriorated, and Bomb was removed from her plinth.

METHODS We examine the case of implementation of the Sociedade Moçambicana de Medicamentos. Data have been collected using semi-structured interviews (applied to 21 professionals of the Sociedade Moçambicana de Medicamentos, Farmanguinhos, FIOCRUZ, and Itamaraty) and official documents. The data of the interviews have been submitted to content analysis, using the software NVivo. RESULTS Training and <b>technical</b> <b>visits</b> directly influenced the acquisition and, partly, the assimilation of knowledge. Expatriation contributed with the transformation of this knowledge from the development and refinement of operational routines. Finally, the definition of standard operating procedures allowed the Mozambican technicians to be the actors of {{the transformation of the}} knowledge previously acquired and assimilated and, at the same time, it laid the foundations for a future exploration of the knowledge.

Ness pesquisa identificam-se as arenas e os padrões em vigor, as linhas de convergência e d conflito entre os grupos de interesse, a articulação interna e externa das unidade componentes da matriz institucional vigente, elemento que estrutura os movimento estratégicos dos agentes envolvidos. A dissertação indica que as resistências impostas pel atuação de grupos de interesse (públicos e privados), o desenho da matriz institucional, centralização do poder do Presidente da República e o uso político dos fundos de pensão têm imposto grande resistência do modelo de organização estatal, refletindo a ação de mecanismo auto-reforçantes que permitem verificar elementos de trajetória de dependência (pat ependence). Tais aspectos, que são centrais nos comportamentos mantenedores do statu quo, permitem compreender a difícil implementação de mudanças que permitissem um gestão mais moderna e transparente das questões relativas aos fundos de pensão. _______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis study aims to {{describe}} in what measure {{the process of}} external knowledge acquisition by <b>technical</b> <b>visits</b> has been contributing for the institucionalization of external control practices in the Brazilian Court of Accounts (TCU). The <b>technical</b> <b>visits</b> accomplished by TCU, in the period from 1998 to 2004, were identified and characterized, {{as well as the}} socialization and code processes related to them. The institucionalization of external control practices linked to those visits were studied by the use of the variables Links, Resources / Structures and Program. Also, was analyzed the Legitimacy of the use of <b>technical</b> <b>visits</b> as a way to acquire external knowledge. Theoretical support is found in the studies of the Organizacional Learning, especially the study of learning processes, and in the Institutional Theory, including the institutional isomorphism phenomenon. As research methodology, two stages were accomplished, being the first composed by documental exam and the second by accomplishment of 18 semi-structured interviews with people involved with the <b>technical</b> <b>visits.</b> The results suggest that the accomplishment of <b>technical</b> <b>visits,</b> allied to conversion processes of the acquired knowledge, would have {{an important role in the}} institucionalization of external control practices in TCU, considering an isomorphic context. The interaction among those visits, as process of external knowledge acquisition, and the other code and socialization processes, especially reports elaboration, technical documents publication and trainings, made possible the transfer of learning from individual to organizational level. It was identified direct relation among the establishments of more solid and permanent organizacional links with the institucionalization of practices. In what it refers to the <b>technical</b> <b>visits</b> legitimacy, it stands out the presence of Moral Legitimacy, found on the visits evaluation in function of the reached results, and the presence of the Cognitive Legitimacy, by influence of the mimetic isomorphism phenomenon...|$|R

Approaches such as these {{have been used in}} the IT sector over the past decades, {{but this is the first}} attempt to apply it in the area of sustainability. SJS's were tested at the 2012 Greening of Industry Network Conference (GIN 2012) and here we report our experiences from arranging six SJS's at the conference. A typical process of an SJS includes a preparatory phase, the actual jam, and documentation and follow up. The preparatory phase mainly involves identifying hosts and topics to be addressed at the SJS, followed by attracting participants. The jam is started by an introduction of the topics, a <b>technical</b> <b>visit</b> (if appropriate), and a problem-solving workshop, ending with a wrap-up reporting. Thorough documentation is necessary for following up the results of the SJS and preparing for implementation of the identified solutions. We conclude that skill, structure, setting, and surrender of control, as well as finding “red and hot” topics for the jams are the key factors for successful SJS's. Based on our experiences from GIN 2012, we recommend other research conferences in the sustainability field use SJS's if the intention is to boost the interaction between the conference and the host region or non-academic organizations in general. We also suggest that a similar approach can be used in regional development for creating an infrastructure for learning and transformation towards sustainability and initiatives for open innovation...|$|E

The modelled system is compared with the results of another study [2], in which a Multi-Effect Desalination (MED) is powered by a CSP plant for the same location in Italy, using as reference an existing stand-alone gas powered MED plant located at Trapani [3] (which has operated until very recently). The overall aim is to assess and compare these two cogeneration schemes, using as reference the existing MED plant. This work was conducted using as the main simulation tool: the System Advisor Model (SAM) developed by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL); a recent upgrade to SAM made available to this work through Laboratório Nacional de Energia e Geologia I. P. (LNEG); and the Reverse Osmosis System Analysis (ROSA) developed by the Dow Chemical Company. A <b>technical</b> <b>visit</b> to a real commercial RO plant in the south of Portugal (Alvor) was conducted, and the data gathered was used in the validation of the ROSA model. The results for the Trapani case study show that the CSP-RO arrangement has the capability to produce ~ 50 % of the total production of the full scale plant at Trapani, if operated at nominal capacity, year round. Also, the CSP-RO system provides ~ 20 % more electricity and water than the CSP-MED system throughout the studied period of one year. The two co-generation schemes provide promising potential to fight the issues related to fresh water shortages and dependency on fossil fuelled desalination. Thus, they can aid in decreasing the effects associated with CO 2 emissions and climate change...|$|E
