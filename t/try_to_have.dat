Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate, then was elected President. In 1884 he headed a third deputation that brokered the London Convention, under which Britain recognised the South African Republic as a fully independent state.|$|E

Fredriksson had done backing vocal work for Gessle's band Gyllene Tider, and they had worked together on Spännande Ostar and other projects, including an attempt by Gyllene Tider to release an English language album in America. Fredriksson's career was soaring in Sweden, but Gessle was a former boyband member whose solo career was not doing as well.

His idea was to form a duo, singing in English, and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some success in Europe. However, during the 1980s, it was uncommon for Swedish artists to perform in English.|$|E

25|$|Some {{parents want}} to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, {{there may be some}} sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and {{want to know about the}} risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E

Stanford offered the work to the opera impresario Carl Rosa, who refused it and suggested that the composer should <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it staged in Germany: [...] "Its success will (unfortunately) have much greater chances here if accepted abroad." [...] Referring to the enormous popularity of Sullivan's comic operas, Rosa added, [...] "If the work was of the Pinafore style it would be quite another matter."

500|$|... another non-fiction travelogue which Steinbeck {{wrote in}} 1962, {{is seen as}} a more rounded view of the author late in life, but The Log from the Sea of Cortez is {{regarded}} as showing the direct influence of Ed Ricketts and his philosophies on Steinbeck, and provides clues to the underlying rationales for some events in his novels. In particular, [...] "About Ed Ricketts" [...] reveals how closely he was tied to the characters in Steinbeck's novels: parts are taken almost verbatim from descriptions of [...] "Doc" [...] in Cannery Row. The book is also important for seeing something of Ed Ricketts himself. It was the only example of his philosophical writings published in his lifetime.
