5|$|The high US {{demand for}} {{tickets for the}} tour, and the {{difficulty}} which some fans had in getting them, brought attention to rapidity with which tickets turned up on the higher-priced secondary market. Some tickets were being resold on the secondary market for prices of up to $7,500. Additionally, pre-sale passwords were being sold on eBay for bids of up to $400. Although some artists {{were known to be}} holding back tickets from general sale and delivering <b>them</b> <b>straight</b> into the secondary market, Live Nation said that U2 did not engage in this practice.|$|E
5|$|The HTC Dream was {{the first}} ever {{smartphone}} to ship with the Android operating system. The operating system heavily integrates with, and provides apps for various Google services, such as Gmail (with push email support), Maps, Search, Talk, and YouTube, while the contacts and calendar apps can sync with the online Google Contacts and Google Calendar services respectively. The device also ships with an email app supporting other POP3 and IMAP-based mail services, an instant messaging app with support for multiple services, and a WebKit-based web browser. A notification system displays icons for certain events (such as e-mails and text messages) {{on the left side}} of the status bar across the top of the screen; dragging down from the top of the screen exposes a tray with more detailed information for each notification. The Android Market can be used to download additional apps for the device.

25|$|Wasp, {{under the}} command of Master Commandant Jacob Jones {{continued}} to operate along the coast of the middle states after the United States went to war with Britain in June 1812. Her single action came in October. On 13 October, she sailed from the Delaware River and two days later encountered a heavy gale that tore away her jib boom and also washed two crewmen overboard. The following evening, Wasp encountered a squadron of ships and, {{in spite of the fact}} that two of their number appeared to be large men-of-war, made for <b>them</b> <b>straight</b> away. She finally caught the enemy convoy the following morning and discovered six merchantmen under the protection of a 22-gun sloop-of-war, HMS Frolic.|$|E

25|$|Lagrange was a {{favourite}} of the king, {{who used}} frequently to discourse {{to him on}} the advantages of perfect regularity of life. The lesson went home, and thenceforth Lagrange studied his mind and body as though they were machines, and found by experiment the exact amount of work which he was able to do without breaking down. Every night he set himself a definite task for the next day, and on completing any branch of a subject he wrote a short analysis to see what points in the demonstrations or in the subject-matter were capable of improvement. He always thought out the subject of his papers before he began to compose them, and usually wrote <b>them</b> <b>straight</b> off without a single erasure or correction.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} never on a firm {{financial}} footing {{and the situation}} worsened with {{the rising cost of}} coal and the effects of the First World War; additionally competition from Dymond's Horse Drawn Coach and later Motor Buses took much of the traffic off the line even in summer. Few passengers from Bideford Station at East-The-Water would trouble to change again for the B,WH,R at the Quay when alternative transport would take <b>them</b> <b>straight</b> to their destination for less money. Trains did not run at times suitable for manual workers and freight, apart from Westward Ho! Gasworks, had always been a minor consideration. The line could not even manage the ½% dividend of the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway and eventual closure was inevitable. In 1917, the Minister of Munitions requisitioned the line by Government Order for War Service and it duly closed on 28 March of that year. Grenville and Torridge were loaded onto the captured German freighter Gotterdammerung for duty in France, but the ship was torpedoed off the north Cornwall Coast and sank. The wreck was discovered in 2001 and the locomotives may be recovered for restoration as static displays. Kingsley was scrapped in 1937 after having been sold by the Ministry of Munitions to the National Smelting Company.|$|E
25|$|After {{the horrors}} of the Brisbane Test the MCC got to play another upcountry game played in a rodeo dustbowl. Hutton won the toss, batted and put on 112 with Bill Edrich (74), who seemed to have regained his form, before he was out for 40. Peter May made 69 and Jim Wilson 61, but the last five wickets fell for 26 runs., from 291/5 to 317 all out, with the retired Queensland leg spinner Donald Watt taking 5/56 with help from fellow leggie Kenneth Jenkins (4/44). The innings had reduced the {{makeshift}} wicket to the consistency of a golf bunker and Hutton allowed it to be rebuilt for the next day. Opener Wilfred Brown top scored with 22 in the Country innings as they collapsed to 95 off 42.1 eight-ball overs with Peter Loader (3/22), Johnny Wardle (2/22), Bob Appleyard (2/18) and Tom Graveney (2/8) sharing the wickets. Hutton put <b>them</b> <b>straight</b> back in again and this time they did better, Brown making 78 and adding 108 for the second wicket with Renald Sippel (45), but Appleyard (7/51) spun his way {{through the rest of the}} batting order with some help from Graveney (2/49). The home team agreed to play past stumps so that the MCC could dismiss them, and the tourists won by an innings and 12 runs. This received some criticism in the Australian press, who forgot that Hutton had sportingly allowed the wicket to be remade.|$|E

25|$|Harry is Edna’s {{husband and}} Tobias’s best friend. At {{one point in}} the past, Harry and Tobias, coincidentally, had an extramarital affair with the same young woman. Besides both having been {{businessmen}} and meeting at the same club, it is unclear what else Harry and Tobias have in common except that they have known one another {{for a long time and}} neither sleeps with his wife. Harry is something of a reflection of Tobias, but he is even more reserved. Of all the characters in this play, Harry speaks the least. And when he does speak, he is a man of few words with lots of pauses around each one. He prefers to talk around things rather than going at <b>them</b> <b>straight</b> on. He also avoids questions, as when Agnes tries to find out why he and his wife have come to their home. Instead of giving Agnes an answer, he compliments the furnishings in Agnes’s home. He also has the tendency to repeat himself; at one point he repeats the same line four times when he tries to explain how fear has driven his wife and him out of their home. It is Harry, in the end, who tells Tobias that he and Edna have decided to leave. Although Harry prompted the discussion with Edna about resolving the issue of staying at their friends’ house, it is implied that Edna made the decision and that Harry just delivered the message.|$|E
25|$|St Sylvesters {{were the}} first team to qualify for the second round as Erins Hope failed to field a team for the game. Defending champions UCD began their title race with a one-sided victory over Garda. St Judes beat Ballymun Kickhams convincingly and went on to the second round. Naomh Maur {{defeated}} O'Tooles sending <b>them</b> <b>straight</b> to the backdoor round and Naomh Mearnóg defeated their Fingal rivals Fingallians with Cillian O'Driscoll scoring a total of five frees for Mearnóg. Ballyboden will hope to do better than their fourth round appearance in 2006 as they cruised past Trinity Gaels. Raheny defeated Parnells despite a late attempt by the opposition. St Marys beat Whitehall Colmcille with a late goal by substitute Kenneth Kelly. Former Sligo forward T Brennan impressed with seven points in Lucan Sarsfields four point win over St Annes. Na Fianna had a comfortable five point win over St Marks and St Brigids crushed a lacklustre Round Towers. Kilmacud Crokes beat St Vincents by two goals in what proved to be a disappointing game between two of Dublins highest rated teams. Plunkett's forward line proved too hot to handle for a gutsy Olaf's with solid performances from Alan Brogan and Jason Sherlock. Last years Intermediate champions St Peregrines lost their first senior game to Naomh Barróg. Ballinteer St Johns cruised into the second tound with a victory over Clontarf. Thomas Davis went on to play in the backdoor round against St Vincents as they lost to Erins Isle who progress to the next stage.|$|E

500|$|At 21:00, a lone Japanese plane dropped eight bombs, cutting {{telephone}} wires. Once it had departed, yellow flares {{went up and}} a Japanese infantry {{attack was}} launched, supported by mortar fire. Offshore, Dechaineux' destroyers came under attack from four Betty bombers. 1st Squadron, 5th Cavalry, was attacked by about two reinforced platoons, which were met by heavy automatic weapons and mortar fire. The heavy jungle in this sector permitted some infiltration but the Japanese force was {{not strong enough to}} overrun the position. The main Japanese attack was delivered by 2nd Battalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment, {{from the direction of the}} native skidway, together with detachments from the Porlaka area, and fell on 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry. The troopers noticed a change in Japanese tactics. Instead of infiltrating silently, they advanced across the open, talking and in some cases singing. Their advance took <b>them</b> <b>straight</b> into anti-personnel mines and booby traps, which duly exploded, and then into the fields of fire of the Americans' automatic weapons, including several [...]30 water-cooled Browning machineguns, but the advance continued. The guns of the 211th Coast Artillery (AA) Battalion and 99th Field Artillery Battalion fired through the night, attempting to break up the Japanese attack from Porlaka. Shortly after midnight, Japanese barges attempted to cross Hyane harbour but were engaged by anti-aircraft guns and did not reach the American positions. A Bofors 40mm gun position was captured by the Japanese, who in turn were driven off by the Seabees. Manning the [...]30s, the 5thCavalry's gunners piled up the Japanese dead until the guns had to be moved to get clear fields of fire. One of the Browning guns that held the position was later left in its place, as a monument. Sergeant Troy McGill occupied a revetment with his squad of eight men. All were killed or wounded except McGill and another man, whom he ordered to fall back to the next revetment. McGill fired his rifle until it jammed, then clubbed the Japanese with it until he was killed. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

[...] Cao Cao then had Cui Yan stripped off his post, thrown into prison, and ordered to perform hard labour.

[...] Gore's attorneys therefore {{understood that they}} could fight on, and could petition the Florida Supreme Court to repudiate the notion that December 12 was final under Florida law. However, Gore dropped the case, {{because he was not}} optimistic about how the Florida justices would react to further arguments and, as one of his advisers put it, [...] "the best Gore could hope for was a slate of disputed electors". In addition to this, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley argued that fighting on was futile because even if the Florida Supreme Court defied the U.S. Supreme Court and ordered a new recount, [...] "he GOP would take <b>them</b> <b>straight</b> back to Washington, where the [...] Supreme Court would repeat: 'You ain't going to count, okay?
