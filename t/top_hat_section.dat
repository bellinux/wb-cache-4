40|$|Long {{glass fibre}} {{compression}} mouldings {{are prone to}} significant variations in mechanical properties. Stiffness and strength tend to vary across an individual moulding and in addition there are also variations when different mouldings arc compared. Compression mouldings {{in the form of}} a <b>top</b> <b>hat</b> <b>section</b> were produced. This component was first modified to have ribs, then samples of both batches were reinforced with a thin thermoplastic composite plate with continuous fibres. In this way, four different batches were produced, which were tested under 3 -point-bending. Further, this work investigated the changes in mechanical properties across the manufactured <b>top</b> <b>hat</b> <b>section</b> mouldings. Tensile test results strongly indicate that the scatter of mechanical properties increases towards the edges of the compression moulding. When the mouldings were tested under 3 -point-bending, the experimental results were prone to a large scatter and it was not possible to predict the position of failure or the failure mode. However, this work successfully demonstrated that a targeted reinforcement of the moulding with continuous fibres can significantly reduce the performance variations, particular under loading with large strain. The findings of this work could lead to the development of new lightweight structural components, where there is a need for integrating functions into the moulding in order to reduce weight and costs for mass production...|$|E
50|$|Where {{the shaft}} {{is to be}} used for {{hoisting}} it is frequently split into multiple compartments by Shaft Sets, these may be made of either timber or steel. Vertical members in a shaft set are called Guides, horizontal members are called Buntons. For steel shaft guides, the main two options are hollow structural <b>sections</b> and <b>top</b> <b>hat</b> <b>sections.</b> <b>Top</b> <b>hat</b> <b>sections</b> offer a number of advantages over hollow structural sections including simpler installation, improved corrosion resistance and increased stiffness. Mine conveyances run on the guides in a similar way to how a steel roller coaster runs on its rails, both having wheels which keep them securely in place.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most {{models of}} {{radiative}} jets have been computed {{for the special}} case of a <b>top</b> <b>hat</b> initial cross <b>section.</b> This paper discusses the dynamics of both leading and internal working surfaces in jets with more general initial cross sections, based on both an analytic, “thin shell ” model, and on a full numerical simulation. We find that a non-top <b>hat</b> cross <b>section</b> for the jet ram pressure first leads to a strong curvature of the working surface shocks, and at longer timescales {{to the formation of}} a warm, dense “nose cone”. These results have interesting implications for comparisons between radiative jet models and observations of Herbig-Haro objects.

40|$|AbstractA {{theoretical}} {{analysis was}} performed to predict the dynamic axial crushing behaviour of aluminium foam-filled <b>top</b> <b>hat</b> and double <b>hat</b> <b>sections</b> made from mild steel material. The deformation mode from the test results was {{used to create a}} deformation model for the theoretical analysis. According to the energy method and the superfolding element theory, the mean dynamic crushing loads of the aluminium foam-filled <b>hat</b> <b>sections</b> and the interactive effect between the aluminium foam and <b>hat</b> <b>sections</b> were theoretically predicted. The mean dynamic crushing loads and the interactive effect predicted by this theoretical analysis were in good agreement with the experimental results. The theoretical prediction results showed that the interactive effect was mainly from the aluminium foam...|$|R
40|$|In this article, a {{constitutive}} model for quench-hardenable boron steel is presented. Three sets of boron steel blanks are heat treated such that their as-treated microstructures {{are close to}} fully martensitic, bainitic and ferritic/pearlitic, respectively. Hardness measurements show that the resulting blanks cover the full scope of possible hardness values, from 165 HV in the ferritic/pearlitic range to 477 HV in the fully hardened state. These three main grades provide the input data for a {{constitutive model}} consisting of an extended Swift hardening law and a stress triaxiality and Lode angle dependent fracture criterion. The hardening behavior of each grade is determined using standard tensile tests at quasi-static strain rates. The strain-based fracture criterion is calibrated using four different flat fracture samples. The behavior of intermediate hardness grades is approximated by piecewise linear combination of the three calibrated constitutive models. A newly developed tapered tensile test specimen featuring a hardness transition zone in the gauge section is used to verify the model at hand. A four point bending test of a <b>top</b> <b>hat</b> <b>section</b> of intermediate hardness is used to verify the model for complex loading conditions...|$|E
40|$|Finite element (FE) {{formability}} {{analyses are}} everyday {{practice in the}} metal-forming industry to reduce costs and lead time of new metal products. Although the predictive capabilities of FE software codes have improved significantly over the years, unfortunately, the experimental trial-and-error process can still not be entirely replaced by virtual design. The simplistic handling of friction in FE software {{is one of the}} main reasons for this. In this thesis, friction mechanisms in metal forming are addressed and a physical based friction model is proposed to improve the description of friction in metal forming processes. As an input, the model requires the properties of the metal-lubricant combination used and the surface characteristics of the tooling and the workpiece material. As an output, the friction conditions are predicted in both the boundary and mixed lubrication regime, including the effect of surface changes due to normal loading, sliding and straining the underlying bulk material. Adhesion and ploughing effects are accounted for to characterize friction conditions on the micro scale. To account for lubrication effects, special hydrodynamic contact elements have been developed. The boundary friction model and the hydrodynamic friction model have been coupled to describe friction in the mixed lubrication regime. The friction model has been implemented in an FE software code to model boundary and mixed lubrication friction in metal forming simulations, while minimally influencing the computation time. FE simulations have been carried out using the advanced friction model for 2 sheet metal forming processes, i. e. the forming of a <b>top</b> <b>hat</b> <b>section</b> and a cross-die product. In addition, experimental validation of the numerical results was performed. The computed local friction coefficients show a dependency on the punch stroke, punch speed and location in the product. A comparison between numerically and experimentally obtained results demonstrated a good correspondence. Also for varying process settings, the advanced friction model enables the accurate prediction of experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Although {{considerable}} data {{exist on}} the static and dynamic properties of single resistance spot welded joints and simple adhesively bonded joints, there are less data concerning the mechanical properties of more complex structural components. In addition, information on simple joints {{does not provide a}} realistic indication of the performance of structures in service, where joint interactions influence behaviour, and structural design has a significant effect on performance. The automotive body in white (BIW) structure is made up of many components, all contributing to the overall rigidity of the structure. If a component of the BIW can be stiffened by means of an improved design, it is logical to assume that the overall rigidity of the BIW can be increased by similar means. In test programmes, box hat structures or box sections are commonly used to represent automotive components such as pillars and sills. This paper presents an experimental and numerical study to determine the torsional stiffness, elastic limit, and ultimate strength of spot welded, adhesively bonded, and weldbonded box sections. A variety of factors were investigated, using factorial design techniques to determine their effects on the torsional properties of box sections. The effect of load transfer on the torsional properties of spot welded closed <b>top</b> <b>hat</b> (CTH) <b>sections</b> and the difference in torsional properties between weldbonded and adhesively bonded CTH sections were also investigated. The joining system used, the area of the section, and the section thickness were found {{to be the most important}} factors in determining the torsional stiffness of the sections, whereas the substrate strength was the most important factor in determining the elastic limit and ultimate strength of the sections...|$|R
