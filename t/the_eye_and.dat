5|$|On October 13 and 14, two ships, the London Spirit and the Marie Maersk, {{encountered}} {{winds of}} tropical storm or hurricane force. The Marie Maersk was located especially close to <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> its observations were useful to forecasters.|$|E
5|$|Also, third eyelid. A {{transparent}} or translucent third eyelid that {{is drawn}} across the eye for protection, to moisten it while maintaining vision. The nictitating membrane also covers <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> {{acts as a}} contact lens in many aquatic birds. With the exception of pigeons {{and a few other}} species, most birds blink only with their nictitating membrane, and when not sleeping, use the eyelids chiefly only when the eye is threatened with some foreign matter.|$|E

5|$|Dietrich Wildung {{proposed}} that the bust in Berlin was a model for official portraits and {{was used by the}} master sculptor for teaching his pupils how to carve the internal structure of <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> thus the left iris was not added. Gardner's Art Through the Ages and Silverman presents a similar view that the bust was deliberately kept unfinished. Hawass suggested that Thutmose had created the left eye, but it was later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Entropion is the inward rolling of the eyelid, {{commonly}} {{the lower}} lid. This in turn irritates the cornea of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> can cause visual impairment. It is a hereditary disorder seen in both English and American Cocker Spaniels, King Charles Spaniels, English Springer Spaniels plus {{a variety of}} non spaniel breeds.|$|E
5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips to the back of <b>the</b> <b>eye)</b> <b>and</b> anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E

5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near their tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> a large eyespot near its tail, giving {{the impression that the}} head is {{at the tail end of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the head of the female in {{breeding}} plumage is yellow, gradually changing to olive green {{at the back of the}} head, except for the broad yellow rear brow, while the area between <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> the bill is dark greenish grey, and the area around the ear is green. The head is surrounded by a broad yellow collar that includes the chin. The remainder of the female breeding plumage is identical to the male's.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Josquin's motets {{use some}} kind of {{compositional}} constraint on the process; they are not freely composed. Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several of these methods. The motets that use canon can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard and appreciated as such, and another group in which a canon is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be appreciated by <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> by connoisseurs.|$|E

5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of bowel cancer.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support the lens of <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> their destruction can cause the lens {{to fall into the}} wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ivan again reached Category4 {{status as}} it entered the Caribbean Sea. Subsequently, it {{underwent}} an eyewall replacement cycle, and for about 18hours the intensity remained constant as it paralleled the northern coast of Venezuela offshore. Another period of rapid deepening began late on September 8 as its motion {{turned to the}} west-northwest. Hurricane Hunters recorded flight-level sustained winds of 180mph (290km/h) {{to the north and}} northeast of <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> a dropsonde about 630feet (190m) above the surface recorded winds of 200mph (325km/h) and an extrapolated pressure of 916mbar (27.05inHg). Based on the reports, it is estimated Ivan attained Category 5 status at 0600UTC on September 9, while located about 90miles (145km) north of Aruba. At the time, the cyclone was forecast to strike southern Florida as a major hurricane.|$|E

5|$|In non-breeding plumage, the {{nominate}} has greyish-black upper parts, cap, nape, and hindneck, {{with the}} colour {{on the upper}} portion of the latter being contained in a vertical stripe. The dark colour of the cap reaches below <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts {{on the sides of}} the neck, there are white ovals. The rest of the neck is grey to brownish-grey in colour and has white that varies in amount. The breast is white, and the abdomen is whitish. The flanks are coloured in a mix of blackish-grey with white flecks. The colour of the bill when not breeding differs from that of the breeding plumage, with the former being significantly more grey.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} afternoon, an eye feature began to form; subsequently, Hernan was nearing {{hurricane}} status. However, by the nighttime hours, a microwave satellite {{found that the}} center of Hernan was located to the west-southwest of the eye feature, and the intensification ceased {{for the rest of}} the day and into the morning of August 8. Later in the morning, the center of Hernan was determined to be located underneath <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> was determined to have become a hurricane, the fifth of the season, during the afternoon of August 8. Throughout the day, the eye became better defined, indicating that moderate northeasterly wind shear had already begun to diminish. Despite a cloud-filled eye, meteorologists showed Hernan peaking as a category 2 hurricane overnight.|$|E
5|$|Many birds show plumage {{patterns}} in ultraviolet that are {{invisible to the}} human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar {{to the naked eye}} are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. With the exception of pigeons and a few other species, the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten.|$|E

5|$|Neck {{stiffness}} usually presents {{six hours}} after initial onset of SAH. Isolated dilation of a pupil {{and loss of}} the pupillary light reflex may reflect brain herniation {{as a result of}} rising intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull). Intraocular hemorrhage (bleeding into the eyeball) may occur in response to the raised pressure: subhyaloid hemorrhage (bleeding under the hyaloid membrane, which envelops the vitreous body of <b>the</b> <b>eye)</b> <b>and</b> vitreous hemorrhage may be visible on fundoscopy. This is known as Terson syndrome (occurring in 3–13 percent of cases) and is more common in more severe SAH.|$|E
5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the optic nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the visual field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect. The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> the chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the chiasm is affected, visual loss on one side of the visual field occurs.|$|E
5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within the}} body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} direct contact with the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E
