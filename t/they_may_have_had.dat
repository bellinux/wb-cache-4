5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, and, since the males were larger and required more food, males {{would have had}} larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may have allowed the males to target larger prey than the females, and <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to defend females during mating seasons.

5|$|The most {{distinctive}} characteristic of Pteranodon is its cranial crest. These crests consisted of skull bones (frontals) projecting upward and backward from the skull. The {{size and shape}} of these crests varied due to a number of factors, including age, sex, and species. Male Pteranodon sternbergi, the older species of the two described to date (and sometimes placed in the distinct genus Geosternbergia), had a more vertical crest with a broad forward projection, while their descendants, Pteranodon longiceps, evolved a narrower, more backward-projecting crest. Females of both species were smaller and bore small, rounded crests. The crests were probably mainly display structures, though <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> other functions as well.|$|E

5|$|As the {{population}} expanded, {{some of these}} settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets and more marginal land was again settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing) becoming permanent settlements. Perhaps ten per cent of {{the population}} lived {{in one of the}} burghs that had grown up in the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a mean population of about 2,000, and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 {{at the beginning of the}} era, but many were much smaller than 1,000. During the seventeenth century, the number of people living in the capital grew rapidly. It also expanded beyond the city walls in suburbs at Cowgate, Bristo and Westport and by 1750, with its suburbs, it had reached a population of 57,000. The only other towns above 10,000 by the end of the period were Glasgow with 32,000, Aberdeen with around 16,000 and Dundee with 12,000.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} Sue, paleontologist Pete Larson found {{a broken}} and healed fibula and tail vertebrae, scarred facial bones and a tooth from another Tyrannosaurus {{embedded in a}} neck vertebra. If correct, these might be strong evidence for aggressive behavior between tyrannosaurs but whether {{it would have been}} competition for food and mates or active cannibalism is unclear. Further recent investigation of these purported wounds has shown that most are infections rather than injuries (or simply damage to the fossil after death) and the few injuries are too general to be indicative of intraspecific conflict. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. Top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics that only small dromaeosaurs and troodontids remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators, although <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a hard time finding enough meat to scavenge, being outnumbered by smaller theropods. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger like most large carnivores.|$|E

25|$|Modern mammals have {{respiratory}} turbinates, convoluted {{structures of}} thin bone in the nasal cavity. These {{are lined with}} mucous membranes that warm and moisten inhaled air and extract heat and moisture from exhaled air.

Unfortunately these bones are very delicate and therefore have not yet been found in fossils. But rudimentary ridges like those that support respiratory turbinates have been found in advanced Triassic cynodonts, such as Thrinaxodon and Diademodon, which suggests that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> fairly high metabolic rates.|$|E
25|$|There {{has also}} been some {{secondary}} migration of Somalis to the UK from the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark. According to refugee expert Jill Rutter, in some locations, secondary migrants make {{up the majority of}} the Somali community. An academic article published in 2011 suggests that, since 2000, between 10,000 and 20,000 Somalis in the Netherlands have moved to the UK. The driving forces behind this secondary migration included: a desire to reunite with family and friends; a rise in Dutch opposition to Muslim immigration; Somali opposition to housing policies which forced them to live scattered in small groups all over various cities rather than in a larger agglomerated community; a restrictive socio-economic environment which, among other things, made it difficult for new arrivals to find work; and the comparative ease of starting a business and acquiring the means to get off social welfare in the UK. Research into this relocation also suggests that some Somali migrants in the Netherlands did not intend to end up there as a final destination. Their journeys may have been interrupted in the Netherlands, or <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> little choice about their destination. As a result, some secondary migration {{can be seen in the}} context of the desire to complete an intended migration to the UK.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Long Tan {{took place}} on 18 August 1966 in Phuoc Tuy Province, South Vietnam during the Vietnam War between Viet Cong and North Vietnamese units from the Viet Cong 275th Regiment, {{possibly}} reinforced {{by at least one}} North Vietnamese battalion, and D445 Provincial Mobile Battalion, and Australian forces from D Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR). Although the Australians were heavily outnumbered and almost overwhelmed by the Viet Cong the battle ended in a decisive victory for them, establishing their dominance over the province. However, in the years since it was fought the intentions of the Viet Cong, in particular in mortaring the Australian base at Nui Dat on the night on 16/17 August, have been much debated. This has included the possibility that the Viet Cong had intended to attack and overwhelm Nui Dat, with the initial plan to mortar the base to draw a response force into an ambush after which the base would be attacked and captured, but that they had been prevented from doing so after clashing with D Company, 6 RAR. A second possibility was that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the more limited aim of drawing D Company into an ambush to destroy it and secure a small victory over an isolated force. Finally, it was possible no ambush was planned at all, and that the Viet Cong had been moving on Nui Dat in regimental strength when they unexpectedly ran into D Company, resulting in an encounter battle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{analyze the}} {{regulation}} of firms that undertake socially risky activities and can reduce the probability of an accident inflicted on third-parties by carrying out nonverifiable effort. Congress delegates the regulatory task to an Agency, though <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>have</b> different preferences towards the industry. We determine the optimal level of discretion left by Congress to the Agency, showing a trade-off between two effects: the Agency can tailor discretionary policies to its expert knowledge on potential harm, but it imple-ments policies which are too “pro-industry”. Although the Agency should be given full discretion when the firm’s moral hazard problem is socially costless, partial (and sometimes no) discretion is preferred when moral hazard requires that liability rents be left to regulated firms. Discretion is more valuable with, among other things, less significant conflict of interest between Congress and the Agency, more uncertain distributions of damages {{in the sense of}} Blackwell, and when higher-powered incentive regulations are required. We also study how this degree of discretion changes with the political landscape (uncertainty on the Agency’s preferences, and strategic appointment by the Executive) ...|$|R
25|$|Relational ties principle: The fusion {{approach}} {{assumes that}} strongly fused persons care {{not only about}} their collective ties to the group (as an abstract entity), but also their relationships (real or imagined) {{with other members of}} the group. Identity Fusion Theory posits that strongly fused individuals feel kin-like bonds with other group members, even ones with whom <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> little or no contact. Several studies have garnered empirical support for the relational ties principle. Using several interpersonal variations of the classic trolley dilemma, individuals who were strongly fused with their country endorsed saving fellow countrymen by jumping to their deaths in front of a speeding trolley. Moreover, fused participants endorsed pushing aside a fellow countryman who was poised to jump to his death to ultimately benefit the group, and instead jumping themselves. This research suggests that highly fused persons are so strongly aligned with their fellow group members that they would prefer that they themselves die rather than a fellow group member. Additionally, when highly fused individuals learn that other group members might be killed in a hypothetical trolley dilemma, they demonstrate emotional reactions similar to how people react when a family member is in distress. These emotional reactions predicted subsequent endorsements of self-sacrifice for the group. In comparison, the social identity approach assumes that, when the social identity is salient, individuals view their fellow group members as mere interchangeable exemplars of the group (i.e. they evaluate other group members based on their “collective ties” toward the group).|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the battle the Australians were left to {{speculate}} on the reason it occurred. One hypothesis was that the Viet Cong had intended to attack and overwhelm Nui Dat, with the initial plan to mortar the base to draw a response force into an ambush after which the base would be attacked and captured, but that they had been prevented from doing so after clashing with D Company. A second possibility was that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the more limited aim of drawing D Company into an ambush to destroy it and secure a small victory over an isolated force. Finally, it was possible no ambush was planned at all, and that the Viet Cong had been moving on Nui Dat in regimental strength when they unexpectedly ran into D Company, resulting in an encounter battle. The evidence suggested they intended an attack on Nui Dat in some form, while the lack of prepared positions from which to mount an ambush made this unlikely. Brigadier David Jackson—Commander 1 ATF—believed the Viet Cong had been on their way to attack Nui Dat on the night of 18/19 August when D Company intercepted them and this was supported by information from a prisoner captured afterwards. They were carrying large quantities of ammunition and may have had sufficient strength to seriously damage the base, even if its defences were likely strong enough to withstand such an attack. Yet, from the earliest Jackson had felt the Viet Cong would have to engage 1 ATF in a major battle if they wished to retain control of Phuoc Tuy, and this interpretation fitted his previous thinking. In dispatching patrols east of Nui Dat following the mortar attack on 16/17 August Jackson seemingly reacted to his opponent's first move, and he may have allowed himself to be shaped into responding as the Viet Cong had intended.|$|E
