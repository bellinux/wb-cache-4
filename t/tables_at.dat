In the autumn of 1944, Brown took a segregated train to Columbus, Ohio, and began school at Ohio State.|$|E
5|$|The bronze nails, {{with their}} flat tops and raised edges which prevent coins from {{tumbling}} onto the pavement, were made as convenient <b>tables</b> <b>at</b> which merchants could {{carry out their}} business.

5|$|The {{family lived}} in Norman until Warren was 11, when they moved to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, a {{salesman}} at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack—which led to many medical bills, {{as well as a}} pay cut because he could not do his previous work. Eventually, this led to the loss of their car from failure to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog order department at Sears. When she was 13, Warren started waiting <b>tables</b> <b>at</b> her aunt's restaurant.|$|E

5|$|In 1623, Kepler at last {{completed}} the Rudolphine Tables, {{which at the}} time was considered his major work. However, due to the publishing requirements of the emperor and negotiations with Tycho Brahe's heir, it would not be printed until 1627. In the meantime, religious tension — the root of the ongoing Thirty Years' War — once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy. In 1625, agents of the Catholic Counter-Reformation placed most of Kepler's library under seal, and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged. Kepler moved to Ulm, where he arranged for the printing of the <b>Tables</b> <b>at</b> his own expense.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1914, Lady Diana Cooper's future husband, Duff Cooper, then a Foreign Office official, dined at the Ritz {{with the}} Earl of Essex and his American wife, Adele Capell (née Grant) and Patrick Shaw-Stewart, and {{later that day}} {{announced}} that World War I had broken out to the party. Before the war began, the German and Austrian embassies both retained <b>tables</b> <b>at</b> the Ritz Restaurant. The hotel suffered during the war, and lost nearly £50,000 in 1915 alone; the ballroom was usually empty and lights went out by 10pm, but rooms were still in demand and the hoteliers believed it to be worth keeping open. Socialites such as Lady Cynthia Asquith, daughter-in-law of H. H. Asquith and Lord Basil Blackwood were documented in her diaries to have dined at the Ritz {{in the spring of}} 1916. The following year, she held a lavish dinner party with the likes of Osbert Sitwell, Gilbert Russell and Maud Nelke and Clare Tennant.|$|E

25|$|Electronic paper, {{also called}} e-paper, is a display {{technology}} designed {{to mimic the}} appearance of ordinary ink on paper. Electronic paper reflects light like ordinary paper and is capable of holding text and images indefinitely without drawing electricity, while allowing the image to be changed later. Applications of e-paper technology include e-book readers capable of displaying digital versions of books, magazines and newspapers, electronic pricing labels in retail shops, time <b>tables</b> <b>at</b> bus stations, and electronic billboards. Electronic paper was invented in 1973 by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometres across.|$|E
