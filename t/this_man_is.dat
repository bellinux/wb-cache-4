5|$|It is {{revealed}} that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> the actual, corporeal Prismo, and the version Finn and Jake {{are familiar with}} is merely a dream. Prismo explains that killing a wishmaster—as in, waking up the man—is a cosmic crime, but that he will return when his corporal body falls back asleep. At that instant, the Lich springs into action, physically waking and destroying Prismo, killing him. Suddenly, an interdimensional being arrives and begins taking the Lich to the Citadel, to which Finn and Jake give chase.|$|E

They run afoul of a con artist instead; Henry, correctly suspecting <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> up to no good, proclaims his own intention to break into the music business. When the con man repeats the same words to Henry that he said to the music teacher, he is exposed as a fraud; the teacher thanks Henry by giving Punky several free lessons.|$|E
25|$|Jake {{runs into}} a man named Bill outside a coffee shop, not realizing that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> Sarah's father. When Jake confesses that he is heartbroken, Bill {{mentions}} {{that he has a}} daughter who is single but Jake declines. While drinking coffee with Sarah later, Bill quotes something that Jake said to him and Sarah realizes that Jake was talking about her. She heads over to Jake's with Mother Teresa, but he is out on the lake with his boat. When Jake can't hear her yelling from the shore she convinces a girls crew team to take her out to him. Eventually she dives in and swims over to his boat. After climbing in Sarah tells Jake how she feels about him and they kiss. Later, when telling the story of how they met, they mention in unison that they found each other at a dog park.|$|E
25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... <b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun Times {{rated the}} film as the best of 2009, writing, [...] "The Hurt Locker is a great film, an {{intelligent}} film, a film shot clearly so that we know exactly who everybody is {{and where they are}} and what they're doing and why." [...] He applauded how the suspense was built, calling the film [...] "spellbinding." [...] Ebert considered Renner [...] "a leading contender for Academy Awards," [...] writing, [...] "His performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> and what he feels. He is not a hero in a conventional sense." [...] He eventually ranked it the second-best film of the decade, behind only Synecdoche, New York.|$|E
500|$|At the far right, a {{black man}} fondles the breasts of a woman, distracting her from her work, her {{pie-dish}} [...] "tottering like her virtue". Confusion over whether the law permitted slavery in England, and pressure from abolitionists, meant that by the mid-eighteenth century there was a sizeable population of free black Londoners; but the status of <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> not clear. The black man, the girl and bawling boy fill the roles of Mars, Venus and Cupid which would {{have appeared in the}} pastoral scenes that Hogarth is aping. In front of the couple, a boy has set down his pie to rest, but the plate has broken, spilling the pie onto the ground where it is being rapidly consumed by an urchin. The boy's features are modelled on those of a child in the foreground of Poussin's first version of the Rape of the Sabine Women (now held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art), but the boy crying over his lost pie was apparently sketched by Hogarth after he witnessed the scene one day while he was being shaved.|$|E

500|$|Spicer says [...] "Roger Moore re-created Bond as an old-style debonair hero, more {{polished}} and sophisticated than Connery's incarnation, using the mocking insouciance he had perfected {{in his role}} as Simon Templar... Moore's humour was a throwaway, and certainly in the later films, verged on self-parody. It was an essential strand in the increasingly tongue-in-cheek direction of the series which became more light-hearted, knowing and playfully intertextual". Chapman noted that Moore was the most comedic of the Bonds, with a more light-hearted approach to playing the character with a mocking wit and innuendo. Additionally, Moore's one-liners were delivered in a way to suggest that the violence inherent in the films was a joke, as opposed to Connery's, which was used to mitigate the violence. Moore explained his approach to the humour by saying [...] "to me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous... I mean, <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> supposed to be a spy, and yet everybody knows he's a spy... it's outrageous. So you have to treat the humour outrageously as well".|$|E
500|$|Welles's {{adaptation}} of five Shakespeare plays {{was not a}} chronological transcription of the original texts. Shakespearean scholar Kenneth S. Rothwell said that Welles [...] "goes beyond mere tinkering with Shakespeare's scenes; [...] massively reworks, transposes, revises and deletes, indeed reconstructs them." [...] These changes included taking lines of dialogue from one play and inserting them into scenes from another. Specific changes include a scene {{near the end of}} the film in which Hal pardons an imprisoned street rabble-rouser just before his expedition to invade France; Welles slightly altered this scene from Henry V, Act 2, Scene 2. In the film it is stated that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> Falstaff, and that the incident he is pardoning is Falstaff's disturbance of Hal's coronation. Although both the pardoned prisoner and Falstaff are said to drink wine, Shakespeare does not imply that the pardoned prisoner is Falstaff. In both Chimes at Midnight and in Henry V, this scene is followed by Falstaff's death. The film contains no true soliloquies, since characters are never alone and do not speak directly to the audience during their speeches. [...] Henry IV is usually shown standing or sitting with very little action involvedthis, says Anderegg, makes it appear that he speaks only to himself even when others are present. Gielgud was known for his classical interpretation of Shakespeare, and his performance consists almost entirely of words, which are unable to defeat either Northumberland's rebels or Hal's wild behavior. Throughout the film, Falstaff, Hal, and Hotspur imitate Gielgud, mocking the words of Henry IV.|$|E
