40|$|Abstract. Hot-rolling direct {{quenching}} and partitioning (HDQ&P) processes {{were applied to}} both low carbon high silicon vanadium micro-alloyed steel and low carbon low silicon steel with phosphorus addition. Proeutectoid ferrite with an area fraction of about 30 % was introduced {{into some of the}} sheets. Microstructures were characterized using SEM, TEM and XRD. Mechanical properties were investigated by means of uniaxial tensile test. Austenite stabilization, retained austenite stability, tensile deformation and fracture were comprehensively analyzed by making the comparison between the two steels and between the sheets with and without ferrite considering the different precipitation statuses in ferrite. Experimental results showed that <b>the</b> high <b>silicon</b> vanadium micro-alloyed steel contained more retained austenite with higher stability compared with <b>the</b> low <b>silicon</b> phosphorus added steel.

5|$|Since the 1920s, X-ray {{diffraction}} {{has been}} the principal method for determining the arrangement of atoms in minerals and metals. The application of X-ray crystallography to mineralogy began with the structure of garnet, which was determined in 1924 by Menzer. A systematic X-ray crystallographic study of the silicates was undertaken in the 1920s. This study showed that, as the Si/O ratio is altered, the silicate crystals exhibit significant changes in their atomic arrangements. Machatschki extended these insights to minerals in which aluminium substitutes for <b>the</b> <b>silicon</b> atoms of the silicates. The first application of X-ray crystallography to metallurgy likewise occurred in the mid-1920s.
