25|$|Cap-strap {{bindings}} are {{a recent}} modification {{that provide a}} very <b>tight</b> <b>fit</b> to the toe of the boot, and seats the boot more securely in the binding. Numerous companies have adopted various versions of the cap strap.|$|E
25|$|Classical dance costumes {{are highly}} ornate and heavily embroidered, {{sometimes}} including sequins and even semi-precious gems. Most of the costumes {{is thought to}} be what is representative of what divinities wear, this is reflected in the art style of the post-Angkor period. Various pieces of the costume (such as shirts) have to be sewn onto the dancers for a <b>tight</b> <b>fit.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{feature of}} the Sebenza that is highly praised by users is the ease of maintenance, as CRK {{actually}} encourages the customer to disassemble and maintain the knife by including a hex wrench in the box. Another {{feature of the}} Sebenza {{is the use of}} a bushing system around the blade's pivot that keeps the blade at a constant <b>tight</b> <b>fit</b> which is always centered.|$|E
25|$|Crabeaters have {{relatively}} slender bodies and long skulls and snouts {{compared to other}} phocids. Perhaps their most distinctive adaptation is the unique dentition that enables this species to sieve Antarctic krill. The postcanine teeth are finely divided with multiple cusps. Together with the <b>tight</b> <b>fit</b> of {{the upper and lower}} jaw, a bony protuberance near the back of the mouth completes a near-perfect sieve within which krill are trapped.|$|E
25|$|The {{cast iron}} shell, similar in shape to a Minié ball, had a thin lead coating {{which made it}} fractionally larger than the gun's bore and which engaged with the gun's rifling grooves to impart spin to the shell. This system had just been {{developed}} by Martin von Wahrendorff and Giovanni Cavalli in Sweden. This spin, together with the elimination of windage {{as a result of}} the <b>tight</b> <b>fit,</b> enabled the gun to achieve greater range and accuracy than existing smoothbore muzzle-loaders with a smaller powder charge.|$|E

25|$|Double seam rims {{are crucial}} to the joining of the wall to a top or bottom surface. An {{extremely}} <b>tight</b> <b>fit</b> between the pieces must be accomplished to prevent leakage; the process of accomplishing this radically deforms the rims of the parts. Part of the tube that forms the wall is bent, almost at its end, turning outward through 90 degrees, and then bent further, {{toward the middle of}} the tube, until it is parallel {{to the rest of the}} tube, a total bend of 180 degrees.|$|E
25|$|With modern strap bindings, {{the rider}} wears a boot {{which has a}} thick but {{flexible}} sole, and padded uppers. The foot is held onto the board with two buckle straps – one strapped {{across the top of}} the toe area, and one across the ankle area. They can be tightly ratcheted closed for a <b>tight</b> <b>fit</b> and good rider control of the board. Straps are typically padded to more evenly distribute pressure across the foot. While nowhere near as popular as two-strap bindings, some people prefer three-strap bindings for more specialized riding such as carving. The third strap tends to provide additional stiffness to the binding.|$|E
25|$|Its hammer {{action is}} built into a {{removable}} assembly for easy maintenance, after the fashion of the Tokarev TT-30 pistol, whereas its slide rides inside the frame rails, rather than outside as in the traditional Browning pattern. This latter feature mimics the frame-to-receiver interface of its predecessor in Swiss military service, the Luger pistol, allowing for a very <b>tight</b> <b>fit</b> between the slide, barrel and frame without compromising reliability. This construction feature contributes to the unusually high accuracy for which the SIG P210 is known. It ships with a 50-meter (54.7 yd) test target typically showing a group of five to ten shots in a cluster under 5cm (2in) in diameter.|$|E

25|$|Across the 15th and 16th centuries {{there were}} {{primarily}} {{two different types}} of manufactured cannons. The wrought iron cannon and the cast-bronze cannon. Wrought iron guns were structurally composed of two layers: an inner tube of iron staves held together in a <b>tight</b> <b>fit</b> by an outer case of iron hoops. Bronze cannons on the other hand were cast in one piece similar to bells. The technique used in casting bronze cannons was so similar to the bell that the two were often looked upon as a connected enterprise. Church bells in the age of Catholic authority were viewed as idolatrous and met their end as raw metal used for casting cannons.|$|E
25|$|Following its introduction, the MacBook Air {{was greeted}} with a mixed reception. The {{portability}} of the MacBook Air was praised in reviews, but the compromise in features was criticized. The full-sized keyboard, weight, thinness, and Multi-Touch trackpad were appreciated in reviews, while the limited configuration options and ports, slow speed (in non-SSD models), non-user-replaceable battery, small hard drive, and price were criticized. The flip-down hatch {{on the side of}} the original MacBook Air is a <b>tight</b> <b>fit</b> for some headphone plugs and USB devices, requiring users to purchase an extension cable. Apple removed the flip-down hatch on the late 2010 model in favor of open connection ports, as is the case with most other laptops.|$|E
25|$|Lugged steel {{construction}} uses standard cylindrical steel tubes which are connected with lugs, external fittings made {{of pieces of}} steel (sometimes stainless steel) which fit over {{the ends of the}} tubing. Before assembly, the builder cuts the tubes to the desired length and precisely mitres their ends, providing a <b>tight</b> <b>fit.</b> The end of the tubes are inserted into the lugs and subsequently brazed with a silver or brass filler metal. The lug greatly increases the strength of the joint by distributing the molten filler metal over a larger surface area via capillary action. When brazing a bicycle frame, builders may use a small positioning structure called a jig to hold the tubes in place and maintain their precise alignment and frame geometry.|$|E

25|$|Many {{athletic}} shoes {{are designed with}} specific features for specific activities. One of these includes roller skates, which have metal or plastic wheels on the bottom specific for the sport of roller skating. Similarly, ice skates have a metal blade attached to the bottom for locomotion across ice. Skate shoes have also been {{designed to provide a}} comfortable, flexible and durable shoe for the sport of skateboarding. Climbing shoes are rubber-soled, tight-fitting shoes designed to fit in the small cracks and crevices for rock climbing. Cycling shoes are similarly designed with rubber soles and a <b>tight</b> <b>fit,</b> but also are equipped with a metal or plastic cleat to interface with clipless pedals, as well as a stiff sole to maximize power transfer and support the foot.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack {{is a recent}} innovation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, {{who went on to}} found Lowe Alpine and Lowepro, companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment. An internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an {{internal frame}} composed of strips of either aluminum, titanium or plastic, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. A complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The internal frame permits the pack to fit closely to the wearer's back and minimizes shifting of the load, which is desirable when participating in activities that involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing. However, the <b>tight</b> <b>fit</b> reduces ventilation, so these type of packs tend to be more sweaty than external frame packs. The internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment; a few lash points (including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items) may be present, but as the frame is completely integrated, it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack. Internal frame packs originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking, but newer models have improved greatly in these respects. In addition, because of their snug fit, the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities.|$|E
500|$|Although {{she hears}} nothing from Milda after their night together, she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly, so she breaks off with Tonda, who storms the {{dormitory}} demanding his ring back. After {{listening to a}} speech by the housemother on the virtues of fidelity and commitment, she packs up her suitcase and arrives on Milda's doorstep in the big city, ready to resume their romance. Milda is not home, and she meets his parents, who {{have never heard of}} her and don't know what they should do with her. Milda comes home very late, and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty, his parents decide it's only decent to put the girl up for the night on the sofa, requiring Milda to climb into bed with them in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Forman has described this famous scene: [...] "It’s a <b>tight</b> <b>fit.</b> The old man wants to sleep; the son would like to get thrown out so he can join the girl on the couch, but the mother runs the show and won’t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof." [...] Andula, kneeling outside the door of their bedroom, overhears the family squabbling, and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in the least, she breaks down in tears and, the next morning, returns to her home. She tells her friends about her [...] "wonderful" [...] trip to the capital and how nice Milda's parents were to her, especially his father, and then she returns to work at the factory.|$|E
2500|$|Bodices {{were very}} <b>tight</b> <b>fitted</b> {{as a result}} of darts and princess seams. In the early 19th century dropped waists were common, {{creating}} a very long torso.

500|$|In 1929, Wade Dean {{formed the}} Glacier Mining Company and filed mining {{claims to the}} sulfur on Adams' [...] summit plateau. Beginning in 1932, the first {{assessment}} work was done. The initial test pits were dug by hand, but this proved to be dangerous work and an alternative was needed to drill through the up to [...] thick ice cap more safely. The answer was a diamond tipped drilling machine, but, being a heavy machine, {{it could not be}} carried up the newly completed horse and mule trail like other supplies. So it winched itself up the mountain using a series of deadman anchors. 168 pack string trips led by John Perry were made {{over the course of the}} mining activities. The crew stayed in the abandoned Forest Service lookout, a <b>tight</b> <b>fit</b> for the usual eight men and their equipment. This problem was alleviated somewhat in the later years of the project when an enclosed [...] lean-to was added to the cabin. Another smaller lean-to was added later. The conditions and weather above [...] could be incredibly variable with the highest temperature of [...] recorded 12 hours before the lowest temperature of [...] This preliminary mining continued for several years until 1937 when the last crew worked from the summit lookout. In the years following, Dean periodically attempted to restart this venture and in 1946, he and Lt. John Hodgkins made several landings by airplane on the summit ice cap. Although sulfur was found, the amount of the ore that was able to be mined in a season was only enough to make up the cost of getting it off the mountain and was not enough to be competitive. Part of this stemmed from Dean’s desire that if operations were expanded, an ore as well as passenger transport system was needed, and his desire that Adams not be significantly scarred by the operation. The project was fully abandoned in 1959. [...] Adams is the only large Cascade volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.|$|E
2500|$|Sleeves were tightly fit {{during the}} early Victorian era. It matched with the <b>tight</b> <b>fit</b> women’s small waist in the design, and the {{shoulder}} sleeve seamline was drooped more to show a tighter fit on the arm. This eventually limited women’s movements with the sleeves.|$|E
