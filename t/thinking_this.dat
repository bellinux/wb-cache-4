5|$|I am <b>{{thinking}}</b> <b>this</b> {{morning of}} the men in the mills and factories; I am thinking of the women who, for a paltry wage, are compelled to work out their lives; of the little children who, in this system, are robbed of their childhood, and in their early, tender years, are seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon, and forced into the industrial dungeons, there to feed the machines while they themselves are being starved body and soul....|$|E
5|$|Mortier {{accepted}} the bait of a rumored Russian retreat. In {{the early morning}} of 11 November he and Gazan departed from Dürenstein to seize Stein and Krems, presuming the Russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear-guard behind. As they approached Stein, a column of Miloradovich's troops attacked the French forward positions. <b>Thinking</b> <b>this</b> force was the rumored Russian rear guard, Mortier ordered Gen. Gazan to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein. Fighting spread though the villages of Oberloiben, Unterloiben and the farm at Rothenhof. Instead of withdrawing, as a rear guard would, more and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} {{employed}} as caretakers at Mr. Burns' mansion. Mr. Burns cuts the cable television wire and steals the beer, <b>thinking</b> <b>this</b> will ensure hard {{work from the}} family. While there, Groundskeeper Willie discovers that Bart {{has the power to}} read his thoughts and says that if Homer goes insane, he should use this to call him. The deprivation of his two favorite things causes Homer to go insane and a ghostly Moe informs Homer he must kill his family {{in order to get a}} beer. Marge confronts Homer and locks him in the pantry until he has calmed down.|$|E

25|$|The {{course of}} limerence {{results in a}} more {{intrusive}} <b>thinking</b> pattern. <b>This</b> <b>thinking</b> pattern is an expectant and often joyous period with the initial focusing on the limerent object’s admirable qualities: crystallization. Then, under appropriate conditions of hope and uncertainty, the limerence intensifies further.|$|R

5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. By the fifteenth century, beginning in northern Italy, universities had become strongly influenced by Humanist <b>thinking.</b> <b>This</b> put an emphasis on classical authors, questioned some of the accepted certainties of established thinking and manifested itself in the teaching of new subjects, particularly through the medium of the Greek language. In the fifteenth century university colleges had been founded at St John's College, St Andrews (1418) and St Salvator's College was added in 1450. Glasgow was founded in 1451 and King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. St Leonard's College was added at St. Andrews in 1511. Initially, they were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law.|$|E
5|$|In mid-March 1890 Kruger met the new British High Commissioner and Governor Sir Henry Brougham Loch, Loch's {{legal adviser}} William Philip Schreiner, and Rhodes, who had by now {{attained}} a dominant {{position in the}} Transvaal's mining industry and a royal charter for his British South Africa Company to occupy and administer Matabeleland and Mashonaland. A group of Transvaalers planned to emigrate to Mashonaland—the so-called Bowler Trek—and Rhodes was keen to stop this lest it interfere with his own plans. He and Loch offered to support Kruger in his plan to acquire a port at Kosi Bay and link it to the Transvaal through Swaziland if in return the Transvaal would enter a South African customs union and pledge not to expand northwards. Kruger made no commitments, <b>thinking</b> <b>this</b> union might easily turn into the federation Britain had pursued years before, but on his return to Pretoria forbade any Boer trek to Mashonaland.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, <b>thinking</b> <b>this</b> would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E

5|$|By {{the fifteenth}} century, {{beginning}} in northern Italy, universities had become {{strongly influenced by}} humanist <b>thinking.</b> <b>This</b> put an emphasis on classical authors, questioning some of the accepted certainties of established thinking and manifesting itself {{in the teaching of}} new subjects, particularly through the medium of the Greek language. However, in this period, Scottish universities largely had a Latin curriculum, designed for the clergy, civil and common lawyers. They did not teach the Greek that was fundamental to the new humanist scholarship, focusing on metaphysics and putting a largely unquestioning faith in the works of Aristotle, whose authority would be challenged in the Renaissance. Towards the end of the fifteenth century, a humanist influence was becoming more evident. A major figure was Archibald Whitelaw, a teacher at St. Andrews and Cologne who later became a tutor to the young James III and served as royal secretary from 1462 to 1493. By 1497, the humanist and historian Hector Boece, born in Dundee and who had studied at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen. In 1518 Mair returned to Scotland to become Principal of the University of Glasgow. He transferred to St. Andrews in 1523 and in 1533 he was made Provost of St Salvator's College. While in Scotland his students included John Knox and George Buchanan. These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and {{would be one of the}} most important ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life in the sixteenth century.|$|E
25|$|This {{area has}} to do with logic, abstractions, reasoning, numbers and {{critical}} <b>thinking.</b> <b>This</b> also {{has to do}} with having the capacity to understand the underlying principles of some kind of causal system. Logical reasoning is closely linked to fluid intelligence and to general intelligence (g factor).|$|E
25|$|Work by Herbert Benson {{argues that}} humans have an innate 'breakout principle' which {{provides}} creative solutions and peak experiences which allow {{the restoration of}} a 'new-normal' state of higher functioning. This breakout principle is activated by severing connections with current circular or repetitive <b>thinking.</b> <b>This</b> is heavily reminiscent of Health Realization discussion of the Principle of Mind and of how it is activated.|$|E

25|$|For {{the remote}} {{associates}} tasks, the convergent thinkers correctly solved {{more of the}} five remote associates problems then did those using divergent <b>thinking.</b> <b>This</b> was demonstrated to be significantly different by a one-way ANOVA. In addition, when responding to insight problems, participants using convergent thinking solved more insight problems than did the control group, however, {{there was no significant}} difference between subjects using convergent or divergent thinking.|$|E
25|$|Baumeister {{and colleagues}} {{also note that}} volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of {{counterfactual}} <b>thinking.</b> <b>This</b> is worrying because counterfactual thinking ("If I had done something different...") {{is an important part}} of learning from one's choices, including those that harmed others. Again, this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame; these are the results we would expect from increasing people's belief in fatalism.|$|E
25|$|New Age {{meditation}} as practised by {{the early}} hippies is regarded for its techniques of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious <b>thinking.</b> <b>This</b> is often aided by repetitive chanting of a mantra, or focusing on an object. New Age meditation evolved into a range of purposes and practices, from serenity and balance to access to other realms of consciousness to the concentration of energy in group meditation to the supreme goal of samadhi, as in the ancient yogic practice of meditation.|$|E

25|$|Zhang {{tried to}} render {{equality}} without contradiction between the particular and the universal. Zhang believed that conceptual framework is generated through our karmic actions. When compared to his contemporary Liu Shipei's attempt to extract logic from {{the masters of}} the Zhou dynasty, Zhang's writings and thoughts display {{a higher level of}} theoretical sophistication as he had a firmer grasp of the purposes and limitations of European logic as well as knowledge of yinming principles and <b>thinking.</b> <b>This</b> enabled him to draw more convincing parallels between the notions he gleaned from his plethora of sources.|$|E
25|$|A man, {{sometimes}} called Johnny Randle, goes out hunting for birds. Usually this {{is described as}} being in the evening or by moonlight in the rain. He sees something white in the bushes. <b>Thinking</b> <b>this</b> is a swan, he shoots. To his horror he discovers he has killed his true love, Polly Vaughn, sheltering from the rain. Returning home, he reports his mistake to his uncle and is advised not to run away. He should stay and tell the court {{that it was an}} honest mistake. The night before Polly's funeral, her ghost appears to confirm his version of the events.|$|E
25|$|Adolescents' {{thinking}} is less bound to concrete events {{than that of}} children: they can contemplate possibilities {{outside the realm of}} what currently exists. One manifestation of the adolescent's increased facility with thinking about possibilities is the improvement of skill in deductive reasoning, which leads to the development of hypothetical <b>thinking.</b> <b>This</b> provides the ability to plan ahead, see the future consequences of an action and to provide alternative explanations of events. It also makes adolescents more skilled debaters, as they can reason against a friend's or parent's assumptions. Adolescents also develop a more sophisticated understanding of probability.|$|E

25|$|After {{the breach}} of the Hindenburg Line, Haig's forces were through to open country. The Germans retreated to the River Selle (east of Cambrai) after a further British victory at the Second Battle of Cambrai, at which massed cavalry were used. On 10 October Haig {{received}} a paper from Foch recommending the seizure of the Rhineland – he disapproved, <b>thinking</b> <b>this</b> was too much like asking the Germans to surrender. The following day he received a telegram of congratulation from Lloyd George, which annoyed him by implying that the victories had been won by Marshal Foch.|$|E
25|$|There is {{one major}} piece of {{evidence}} suggesting that abnormal connectivity occurs in autism. Autistic brains are known to develop very rapidly early in life, and this could cause problems {{in the development of}} cortical connections. It has been suggested that this early overdevelopment may be a cause for the impaired connectivity in autism. Diffusion tensor imaging studies of autistic brains are consistent with this idea, as they show reduced myelination (see:Myelin) in the areas of the brain that deal with social cognition and theory of mind, or one’s ability to comprehend what another person may be <b>thinking.</b> <b>This</b> provides further evidence for underconnectivity of the autistic brain.|$|E
25|$|Finally {{the deal}} was agreed, and Drake promised to spare what {{remained}} of the town and sail away from it if the ransom was paid promptly.

The Spanish however <b>thinking</b> <b>this</b> as an insult stabbed and killed him which infuriated Drake so much that he had many Spaniards deliberately executed until the murderer was found dead or alive. The Spanish complied and bought the man to justice by hanging him in front of the city. The ransom was finally paid during the last days of January.|$|E
