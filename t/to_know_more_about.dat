5|$|The {{character}} of Brad Follmer {{was created in}} season nine to provide a love interest for Reyes, as the writers believed the audience needed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> her. However, Follmer's unresolved relationship with Reyes also served to heighten the conflict between Doggett and Follmer, as both men had feelings for her. Portraying actress Annabeth Gish was pleased {{that the relationship between}} her character and Scully was similar to that of two sisters, rather than Reyes serving as an antagonist to Scully.|$|E
5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E

50|$|Archie has no {{information}} for ADA Mandelbaum and Inspector Cramer, {{and shortly after}} he returns home Caroline rings the doorbell. She brings {{the news that the}} police have arrested Paul for Karnow's murder, and she wants to hire Wolfe to clear him. Wolfe accepts, but needs <b>to</b> <b>knows</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Karnow's relatives. They had received bequests in Karnow's will, stood to lose those bequests when he turned up alive, and therefore had motive. Caroline knows little about them except that they had always depended on Karnow's support, and have not managed their inheritances prudently. Wolfe sends Archie to bring them to the office.|$|R

25|$|The {{study of}} the Hakka people first drew {{attention}} to Chinese and foreign scholars, missionaries, travellers and writers during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era {{in the middle of}} the nineteen century. Many wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the Hakka people who had started the Taiping Rebellion which almost overthrew the Qing Dynasty. Ernest John Eitel, a prominent German missionary, was one of those who took a great interest in this area.|$|E

It has the ability of a magnetic force; pulling the enemies towards it and get disintegrate by the latter.|$|E

25|$|Feena is {{the princess}} of the Kingdom of Sphere {{on the moon and}} also the main female protagonist. In order to become more {{knowledgeable}} about Earth and be able to follow in her mother's footsteps, she comes to Earth in a homestay with the family of the primary secretary {{to the president of the}} United Nations, Sayaka Hozumi. Since she was very young, she has always wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the Earth and some day she hopes to surpass her mother in trying to bridge the gap between the Earth and the Kingdom of Sphere. She is well educated in terms of literature and science and has great sword skills. However, she is somewhat naive in matters of the heart and has a tendency to jump into situations without thinking, (such as jumping into a river to save a drowning puppy, without knowing how to swim, and mistaking moths for aliens). Feena once came to Earth when she was a child, and met Tatsuya previously after her mother's death, in which Tatsuya tried to comfort her. She eventually falls in love with him and later marries him to finally bring peace between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E

The TV Critic gave the episode a rating of 63/100, saying that its [...] "good intrigue from the writers because we want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Kate and what she did", while also stating that the [...] "lack of action may affect some who are hooked on 24's style of relentless developments and tension." [...] Josh Wolk rated [...] "Tabula Rasa" [...] a B+, saying that [...] "Kate's story is intriguing, though she's still not quite believable as a fugitive badass." ...|$|E

500|$|Brittany's role in {{the show}} was {{initially}} intended to be minor, but grew {{towards the end of}} the first season. She does not have any solo musical performances during season one, but Morris hoped she would have one in the second season. On April 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported that Morris would be upgraded to a series regular for season two. Speaking to E! Online, Morris commented: [...] "It's so fun.

500|$|Lehto {{recalled}} that making a character-driven story {{was a great}} challenge—players would come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> them as they progressed through the campaign, but the Spartan characters also had to behave intelligently. [...] "The Halo games consistently featured protagonists that were silent during gameplay sequences. Community manager Brian Jarrard pushed for allowing players to choose a female Noble Six and have the cinematics and dialogue change accordingly. The post-credit game sequence {{was the subject of}} intense discussion; some at Bungie wanted to remove it. Executive producer Joe Tung noted, [...] "the 'survive' component ... felt great to us.
