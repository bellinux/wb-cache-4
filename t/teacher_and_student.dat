5|$|Because it {{was among}} the first novels he {{released}} under his own name, Balzac did not use characters in La Peau de chagrin from previous works. He did, however, introduce several individuals who resurfaced in later stories. Most significant of these is Eugène de Rastignac, the older gentleman who tutors Valentin in the vicious ways of high society. Thirty pages into the writing of his 1834 novel Le Père Goriot, Balzac suddenly crossed out the name he had been using for a character– Massiac– and used Rastignac instead. The relationship between <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>student</b> in La Peau de chagrin is mirrored in Le Père Goriot, when the young Rastignac is guided in the ways of social realpolitik by the incognito criminal Vautrin.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Cambridge Vaughan Williams {{continued}} his weekly lessons with Parry, and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray. He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove {{as director of the}} college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>student</b> were stormy. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, Brahms and Wagner, and he stood up to his teacher as few students dared to do. Beneath Stanford's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music.|$|E

40|$|This study {{takes an}} explorative {{approach}} to judgments {{of student learning}} from causal relations in an explanatory text by both <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students.</b> First, the possible differences in judgment accuracy between <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> is examined, to assess to which extent they can accurately predict student performance. Second, differences in cue-utilization (the correlation between judgments of <b>student</b> learning <b>and</b> specified cues) for <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> are explored. <b>Teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> may use different cues prior to making judgments about learning.

Chinese teach Mandarin to New Zealanders <b>and</b> Chinese <b>students</b> are learning English from New Zealand teachers.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{perspectives}} of <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> on codeswitching as a teaching-learning technique outside of classroom contexts in Raffles International College (RIC), a private college {{in the heart of}} Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Despite having English as its medium of instruction, the <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students,</b> especially those with spoken ability in English, Malay and Chinese, often practice codeswitching, which serves many functions in conversations (Auer, 1998; as cited in Riehl, 2005). This paper examines the attitudes of <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> to codeswitching in RIC, and the teachers’ and students’ perceptions of codeswitching as a teaching and learning strategy. Data was collected through nonparticipant observation, likert-type questionnaire, and short interview sessions. The participants of the study were 28 <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> 85 <b>students.</b> In addition to that, three teachers were purposively selected for conversation observations and interview sessions. It was found that codeswitching is natural, acceptable and inevitable in the context of RIC, that the <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> generally have positive attitudes to codeswitching, <b>and</b> the <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> have mixed perception of codeswitching as teaching and learning strategy, as well as a gap of expectation towards the practice of codeswitching in the contexts of the college. From the findings of this research, the researcher identified that codeswitching is used as a technique to scaffold the teaching-learning of <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> of RIC. In conclusion, despite previous researches’ findings on codeswitching as a speech style, it is still considered as a strategy for the <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> of RIC outside of classroom contexts to communicate and achieve their teaching-learning goals...|$|R

The result show that {{a high number of}} questions are asked, more than one per minute <b>and</b> that both <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> ask the same amount of questions. This contradicts earlier findings were teachers questions dominate. Another significant finding is that the distribution of questions over time is very similar between <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students.</b> In a comparison between different teachers the conclusions can be drawn that the amount of questions asked in a classroom correlates more to the specific teacher than any other factor. This study also shows that both <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>students</b> are satisfied with the dialog and that the socio-cultural theories about dialogue base teaching have been assimilated into the Swedish classroom...|$|R

25|$|Obtuse Angle – {{generally}} {{agreed to be}} based on James Parker, Blake’s fellow apprentice during his time with Basire. George Mills Harper, however, believes that Angle is instead based on Thomas Taylor (Harper agrees with Erdman that Sipsop is not based on Taylor but on William Henry Mathew). Harper argues that Angle seems to be an educator, and his relationship with many of the other characters is that of a <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>student.</b> This is significant because there is evidence that Blake took lessons in Euclid under Taylor, hence Angle's apparent role as teacher. Erdman supports this theory. Rawlinson suggests that Angle may be partially based on Blake's friend George Cumberland, as well as the antiquarian Francis Douce.|$|E
