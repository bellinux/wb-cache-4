5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E
5|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{programs have}} received resistance from {{some people in}} Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (the three countries with remaining polio cases). There is distrust surrounding vaccines in Pakistan as in 2011 the CIA organized a fake vaccination program {{in order to help}} find Osama Bin Laden. Additionally, some people believe that the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims. In 2015, the World Health Organization announced a deal with the Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control. However, on September 11, 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and says that the group will continue <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> these kinds of attacks. This resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the three remaining countries.|$|E

500|$|In Enron's {{natural gas}} business, the {{accounting}} had been fairly straightforward: in each time period, the company listed actual costs of supplying {{the gas and}} actual revenues received from selling it. However, when Skilling joined the company, he demanded that the trading business adopt mark-to-market accounting, citing that it would represent [...] "true economic value." [...] Enron became the first non-financial company to use the method to account for its complex long-term contracts. Mark-to-market accounting requires that once a long-term contract was signed, income is estimated as {{the present value of}} net future cash flow. Often, the viability of these contracts and their related costs were difficult to estimate. Due to the large discrepancies of attempting to match profits and cash, investors were typically given false or misleading reports. While using the method, income from projects could be recorded, although they might not have ever received the money, and in turn increasing financial earnings on the books. However, in future years, the profits could not be included, so new and additional income had to be included from more projects to develop additional growth to appease investors. As one Enron competitor stated, [...] "If you accelerate your income, then you have <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> more and more deals to show the same or rising income." [...] Despite potential pitfalls, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the accounting method for Enron in its trading of natural gas futures contracts on January 30, 1992. However, Enron later expanded its use to other areas in the company to help it meet Wall Street projections.|$|E
500|$|A billionaire socialite who dedicates {{himself to}} {{protecting}} Gotham City from its criminal underworld as a bat-masked vigilante who is hailed as its [...] "Dark Knight" [...] at night. Bale {{said he was}} confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle {{as in the previous}} film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether [...] " [...] something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> that. At some point, you have to exorcise your demons." [...] He added, [...] "Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer, you have somebody who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it." [...] Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: [...] "I have no problem with competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie." ...|$|E

50|$|An illusory promise, or {{one which}} the {{promisor}} actually has no obligation <b>to</b> <b>keep,</b> <b>does</b> not count as consideration. The promise must be real and unconditional. This doctrine rarely invalidates contracts; it {{is a fundamental}} doctrine in contract law that courts should try to enforce contracts whenever possible. Accordingly, courts will often read implied-in-fact or implied-in-law terms into the contract, placing duties on the promisor. For instance, if a promisor promises to give away {{a third of his}} earnings for the year and earns nothing, he has no actual obligation to do anything.|$|R
