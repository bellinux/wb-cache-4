50|$|SIGABA {{was similar}} to the Enigma in basic theory, in that it used a series of rotors <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> every {{character}} of the plaintext into a different character of ciphertext. Unlike Enigma's three rotors however, the SIGABA included fifteen, and did not use a reflecting rotor.|$|E
50|$|The Lorenz {{cipher machine}} had twelve wheels, and was thus most advanced, complex, faster {{and far more}} secure than the {{three-wheeled}} Enigma.

50|$|JADE was the codename {{given by}} US codebreakers to a Japanese World War II cipher machine. The Imperial Japanese Navy used the machine for {{communications}} from late 1942 until 1944.

5000|$|The Chaocipher [...] is a cipher method {{invented by}} J. F. Byrne in 1918 and {{described}} in his 1953 autobiographical Silent Years. He believed Chaocipher was simple, yet unbreakable.

5000|$|It {{was common}} <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> a message after first {{encoding}} it, {{to increase the}} difficulty of cryptanalysis. With a numerical code, this was commonly done with an [...] "additive" [...] - simply a long key number which was digit-by-digit added to the code groups, modulo 10. Unlike the codebooks, additives would be changed frequently. The famous Japanese Navy code, JN-25, was of this design.|$|E
5000|$|Used by the {{diplomatic}} service {{rather than the}} armed forces, beginning in 1937 this alphabetic typewriter was used <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> naval attache traffic. The U.S. called this the [...] "Purple" [...] code, because they kept intercepted traffic in purple binders. Although the Japanese purchased the Enigma machine they chose to base their cipher machine on a different technology. Rather than use rotors the Japanese used a stepping switch.|$|E
5000|$|In the Chinese cipher's {{method of}} transposing, {{the letters of}} the message are written from right to left, down and up columns to {{scramble}} the letters.

For example, if the message needed <b>to</b> be <b>enciphered</b> was THE DOG RAN FAR, the Chinese cipher would look like this: ...|$|R
5000|$|Enigma {{messages}} had <b>to</b> be written, <b>enciphered,</b> transmitted (by Morse), received, deciphered, {{and written}} again, while Typex messages were typed and automatically enciphered and transmitted {{all in one}} step, with the reverse also true.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} be as easy <b>to</b> {{decipher}} as <b>encipher,</b> some rotor machines, most notably the Enigma machine, were designed to be symmetrical, i.e., encrypting twice with the same settings recovers the original message (see involution).|$|R
5000|$|<b>To</b> <b>encipher,</b> {{a letter}} in the second row is simply {{replaced}} by the number labeling its column. Letters {{in the third and}} fourth rows are replaced by a two-digit number representing their row and column numbers. Mapping one-digit numbers to common letters reduces the length of the ciphertext, while also concealing the identities of the two-digit numbers by reducing the frequency of their first digits. Here is an example: ...|$|E
5000|$|In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an {{algorithm}} {{for performing}} encryption or decryption - {{a series of}} well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. <b>To</b> <b>encipher</b> or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, [...] "cipher" [...] is synonymous with [...] "code", as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.|$|E
5000|$|The Stencil Subtractor {{frame was}} a ciphered text recyphering tool that {{was invented by}} British Army Intelligence Officer and {{cryptographer}} John Tiltman [...] and was ready for trial by April 1941 but was not adopted officially by the British Forces until March 1942, and not brought into service until June 1943. [...] It replaced the venerable and vulnerable Subtractor tables which had been previously used <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> British military (Military communications) and civilian codes during World War II.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} Zygalski sheets was a cryptologic {{technique}} {{used by the}} Polish Cipher Bureau before and during World War II, and during the war also by British cryptologists at Bletchley Park, <b>to</b> decrypt messages <b>enciphered</b> on German Enigma machines.|$|R
5000|$|The Alphabetum Kaldeorum {{was meant}} {{primarily}} for the encipherment of diplomatic correspondence; its alphabet implies that predominantly Latin texts were coded: u and v are equated; w was to be written as double v; j is missing. For frequently arising letters the Alphabetum Kaldeorum provides several different versions, which were used at random so that a decipherment attempt using the classical frequency analysis method should fail. [...] "Nulla", cipher-letters with no plaintext assignment which were to be ignored, were also often added <b>to</b> the <b>enciphered</b> texts <b>to</b> further render frequency-analysis useless.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Raymond Desch (23 May 1907 [...] - [...] August 3, 1987) was an American {{electrical}} engineer and inventor. During World War II, he was Research Director {{of the project}} to design and manufacture the US Navy version of the bombe, a cryptanalytic machine designed <b>to</b> read communications <b>enciphered</b> by the German Enigma.|$|R
50|$|When {{captured}} German Enigma operators {{revealed that}} they had been instructed <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> numbers by spelling them out rather than using the top row of the keyboard, Alan Turing reviewed decrypted messages and determined that the word eins ("one") appeared in 90% of messages. Turing automated the crib process, creating the Eins Catalogue, which assumed that eins was encoded at all positions in the plaintext. The catalogue included every possible rotor position for EINS with that day's wheel order and plugboard connections.|$|E
50|$|Holmes {{has no idea}} {{of which}} disk is used <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> which letter, but he does know that the offset between the {{plaintext}} letter and the ciphertext letter must {{be the same for}} all ten characters. This gives him a way of penetrating the cipher by lining up the plaintext and ciphertext characters of the crib; forming them into pairs; determining the offsets for the plaintext letters and ciphertext letters for each disk; and then searching for a common offset in the matrix of offset.|$|E
5000|$|Rejewski also {{exploited}} cipher clerk laziness. Scores {{of messages}} would be enciphered by several cipher clerks, {{but some of}} those messages {{would have the same}} encrypted indicator. That meant that both clerks happened to choose the same three letter starting position. Such a collision should be rare with randomly selected starting positions, but lazy cipher clerks often chose starting positions such as [...] "AAA", [...] "BBB", or [...] "CCC". Those security mistakes allowed Rejewski to solve each of the six permutations used <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> the indicator.|$|E
50|$|Chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) - in {{this attack}} the {{cryptanalyst}} {{is able to}} choose a number of plaintexts <b>to</b> be <b>enciphered</b> and {{have access to the}} resulting ciphertext. This allows him to explore whatever areas of the plaintext state space he wishes and may allow him to exploit vulnerabilities and nonrandom behavior which appear only with certain plaintexts. In the widely used public-key cryptosystems, the key used to encrypt the plaintext is publicly distributed and anyone may use it, allowing the cryptanalyst to create ciphertext of any plaintext he wants. So public-key algorithms must be resistant to all chosen-plaintext attacks.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThreshold {{cryptography}} {{allows a}} message <b>to</b> be <b>enciphered</b> through {{the cooperation of}} several entities among which {{no one knows the}} whole secret key. However, if the key pair is generated using an usual centralized algorithm, then there is an entity which knows the whole secret key. In this paper, we present an implementation of a distributed algorithm to generate RSA keys, previously proposed by Boneh and Franklin. Using this implementation, we analyze how many parties can jointly generate the key and we show that a few dozens of ordinary nodes distributed worldwide can achieve this task...|$|R
40|$|Data {{encryption}} (cryptography) is {{utilized in}} various applications and environments. The specific utilization of encryption and {{the implementation of}} the AES will be based on many factors particular to the computer system and its associated components. Communication security provides protection <b>to</b> data by <b>enciphering</b> it at the transmitting point and deciphering it at the receiving point. File security provides protection <b>to</b> data by <b>enciphering</b> it when it is recorded on a storage medium and deciphering it when it is read back from the storage medium. In the proposed design the security method uses symmetric Cryptography technique which provides same keys to sender and receiver to transfer the information for reducing the design complexity. The transferred information is stored in the memory unit for further using it or for further processing using low cost buffer element. Transmission cables are used to provide communication between the connected devices. Control logic is used to provide the patters for transmission through crypto unit...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to their personal weapons (which included an M1 carbine and a Colt automatic pistol for each member) and sabotage equipment, the teams dropped with the Type B Mark II radio, more {{commonly referred to as}} the B2 or [...] "Jed Set", which was critical for communicating with Special Force Headquarters in London. They were also issued pieces of silk with five hundred phrases that they were likely to use in radio traffic replaced with four-letter codes to save time in transmission, and one-time pads <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> their messages.|$|E
50|$|Rejewski {{could look}} at a day's cipher traffic and solve for the {{permutations}} at the six sequential positions used <b>to</b> <b>encipher</b> the indicator. Since Rejewski had the cipher key for the day, he knew and could factor out the plugboard permutation. He assumed the keyboard permutation {{was the same as}} the commercial Enigma, so he factored that out. He knew the rotor order, the ring settings, and the starting position. He developed a set of equations that would allow him to solve for the rightmost rotor wiring assuming the two rotors to the left did not move.|$|E
50|$|Wadsworth's {{cipher system}} {{involved}} {{a set of}} two disks, one inside the other, where the outer disk had the 26 {{letters of the alphabet}} and the numbers 2-8, and the inner disk had only the 26 letters. The disks were geared at a ratio of 26:33. <b>To</b> <b>encipher</b> a message, the inner disk was turned until the desired letter was at the top position, with the number of turns required for the result transmitted as ciphertext. Due to the gearing, a ciphertext substitution for a character did not repeat until all 33 characters for the plaintext letter had been used. He received recognition for this method only posthumously.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{characteristics}} method no longer worked, {{the inclusion of}} the enciphered message key twice gave rise to a phenomenon that the cryptanalyst Henryk Zygalski was able to exploit. Sometimes (about one message in eight) one of the repeated letters in the message key <b>enciphered</b> <b>to</b> the same letter on both occasions. These occurrences were called samiczki (in English, females—a term later used at Bletchley Park).|$|R
5000|$|A major {{weakness}} of the system, however, was that no letter could be <b>enciphered</b> <b>to</b> itself. This meant that some possible solutions could quickly be eliminated because of the same letter appearing {{in the same place}} in both the ciphertext and the putative piece of plaintext. Comparing the possible plaintext Keine besonderen Ereignisse (literally, [...] "no special occurrences"—perhaps better translated as [...] "nothing to report"), with a section of ciphertext, might produce the following: ...|$|R
