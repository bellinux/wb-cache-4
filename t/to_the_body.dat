5|$|As {{with all}} endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from these pupae emerge fully formed, sexually mature adult beetles, or imagos. Pupae never have mandibles (they are adecticous). In most pupae, the {{appendages}} are not attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and {{are said to}} be exarate; in a few beetles (Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae etc.) the appendages are fused with the body (termed as obtect pupae).|$|E

5|$|Gonopods {{occur in}} a {{diversity}} of shapes and sizes, and {{in the range from}} closely resembling walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between closely related species but very little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held {{vertically}} {{at an angle}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, {{and a pair of}} thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{provided}} by dietary supplements is often found as iron(II) fumarate, although iron(II) sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one-third to two-thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate), is often added to {{foods such as}} breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> when chelated to amino acids and is also available {{for use as a}} common iron supplement. Glycine, the cheapest and most common amino acid is most often used to produce iron glycinate supplements.|$|E

5|$|Pupa: The pupae in {{most species}} are adecticous (with no {{functional}} mandibles in the pupal state) and obtect (with appendages fused or glued <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body),</b> {{while others are}} decticous (with functional mandibles present in the pupal state) and exarate (having the antennae, legs, and wings free).|$|E
5|$|Saltwater fish tend to lose water {{because of}} osmosis. Their kidneys return water <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> The reverse happens in {{freshwater}} fish: {{they tend to}} gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.|$|E
5|$|The floury {{baker is}} {{distinguished}} {{from a similar}} undescribed species A. sp. nr curvicosta (the little floury baker) by {{the structure of the}} male genitalia and an audibly distinct call. Members of Aleeta and Tryella are easily distinguished from other Australian cicadas as they lack tymbal covers, while the costal margin of their forewings gets larger toward the point where the wing is attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> In these genera it is clearly wider than the costal vein.|$|E

5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation {{to and from the}} body and the pulmonary circulation to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs.|$|E
5|$|The {{height of}} horses is usually {{measured}} at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back. This point is used {{because it is a}} stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of the horse.|$|E
5|$|The left {{ventricle}} is much thicker {{as compared with}} the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the entire body. Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The {{left ventricle}} pumps blood <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood to the heart itself, the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery.|$|E
25|$|A major {{limitation}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> therapeutic {{potential is}} the possibility of bacteria developing resistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> peptides, and particularly if that produces a resistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body's</b> own immune system use of those peptides. That is, providing a lot of the peptides as a therapeutic agent makes it easier for resistance to evolve; unlike antibiotic resistance, however, resistance to antimicrobial peptides mimicking those produced by humans can make the bacteria more resistant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body's</b> own immune system rather than just the antibiotic.|$|R

5|$|The {{mouth is}} inside {{the base of the}} crown of tentacles but to one side. The gut runs from the mouth {{to one side of the}} stomach, in the bottom of the ampulla. The {{intestine}} runs from the stomach, up the other side the body, and exits at the anus, outside and a little below the crown of tentacles. The gut and intestine are both supported by two mesenteries (partitions that run the length of the body) connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> wall, and another mesentery connects the gut to the intestine.|$|E
5|$|Type C is the {{smallest}} type and lives in larger groups than the others. Its eye patch is distinctively slanted forwards, rather than parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> axis. Like type B, it is primarily white and medium gray, with a dark gray dorsal cape and yellow-tinged patches. Its only observed prey is the Antarctic cod.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in ants, the hind-wings and fore-wings are {{of equal}} length. Most of the time, the alates are poor flyers; their {{technique}} is to launch {{themselves in the}} air and fly in a random direction. Studies show that in comparison to larger termites, smaller termites cannot fly long distances. When a termite is in flight, its wings remain at a right angle, and when the termite is at rest, its wings remain parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
