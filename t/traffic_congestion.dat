5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} pricing is a fee or tax paid by users {{to enter a}} restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to relieve <b>traffic</b> <b>congestion</b> within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of road transport, such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, and the extra costs and delays imposed by <b>traffic</b> <b>congestion</b> upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E

40|$|The left-turn of {{vehicles}} at intersections has significant impacts on urban <b>traffic</b> <b>congestions</b> and accidents, which have {{negative effect on}} vehicle emissions causing air pollution. Many urban traffic networks prohibit direct left-turns for transport planning to keep traffic moving efficiently on major roads. As such, this paper proposes a bi-level mathematical model for left-turn prohibition planning considering both travel times and traffic emissions. The lower-level and upper-level are respectively solved by using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and an improved genetic algorithm. By numerical examples, this paper shows that the improved algorithm can effectively enhance the speed and accuracy of the calculation, and the <b>traffic</b> <b>congestions</b> and emissions can be alleviated by implementing the left-turn prohibition at some carefully selected intersections. </p...|$|R

40|$|Most {{solution}} {{methods for}} the {{vehicle routing problem}} with time windows (VRPTW) develop routes from the earliest feasible departure time. In practice, however, temporal <b>traffic</b> <b>congestions</b> make such solutions non-optimal with respect to minimizing the total duty time. Furthermore, the VRPTW {{does not account for}} driving hours regulations, which restrict the available travel time for truck drivers. To deal with these problems, we consider the vehicle departure time optimization (VDO) problem. We propose an ILP-formulation that minimizes the total duty time. The results of a case study indicate that duty time reductions of 15 % can be achieved. Furthermore, computational experiments on VRPTW benchmarks indicate that ignoring <b>traffic</b> <b>congestions</b> or driving hours regulations leads to practically infeasible solutions. Therefore, new vehicle routing methods should be developed that account for these common restrictions...|$|R

5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on the bridge resulting in <b>traffic</b> <b>congestion,</b> and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours.

There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An electronic toll collection system was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across the bridge.|$|E
40|$|Intelligent Transportation Systems aim at facilitating {{transportation}} by utilizing {{technological advances}} in communications, computing and electronic sensors technologies.

Therefore, traffic management applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems, which can utilize more efficiently the existing infrastructures, have attracted attention from the research community. Most of the existing traffic management systems use a network of fixed sensors for monitoring vehicles. One major drawback, preventing their expansion throughout the road network, is their high cost of deployment and maintenance. ...|$|R
