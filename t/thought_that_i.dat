500|$|The protest {{attracted}} {{different classes}} of people, {{the majority of}} which were peaceful. According to Denham, a popular phrase amongst those protesting was [...] "I never <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would find myself doing something like this." [...] Stephen Ward, who {{had been involved in}} the original 1970s protest, decided in early 1993 that excessive force was being used against protesters, and started keeping a log of events. He used this log when defending other protesters in court, visited those who had been imprisoned, and offered them bail. He subsequently established a legal precedent of the right for protesters and demonstrators to have a witness while being questioned.|$|E

500|$|In 1994 Keating led a {{group of}} liberals in a failed coup to remove state Senate President William Bulger, a fellow Democrat, from his position. Keating, a staunch liberal {{relative}} to the more socially conservative Bulger, sought to reform the Senate rules to greatly reduce the president's power. Bulger, who had held the Senate gavel for 15 years, exerted strict control over the body's operations, but was gradually losing his power base with new crops of Democratic freshmen replacing his longtime allies. Keating's campaign failed, but he said during his 2010 election campaign: [...] "The <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> took on the most powerful person in Massachusetts, risking my whole career, a member of my own party, {{is something that is}} resonating in this campaign, that helps define me as independent." ...|$|E

Flower had already previously announced his retirement from international cricket, and had signed for Essex, and South Australia. Olonga, had not planned what to do after the protest, as he [...] "had in my own naivety <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could carry on in Zimbabwe – maybe my career would {{come to an end}} but I could still live there." [...] In the end, he was kicked off the team bus, and travelled to Johannesburg, where he stayed for a month, before being granted a work permit to play for Lashings Cricket Club in England. He was subsequently granted asylum in the United Kingdom. Neither player has since returned to Zimbabwe.|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{expressed}} excitement when {{approached to}} collaborate on the song, {{and she had}} contributed 32 bars to the track. Her main inspiration behind working on the track was the possibility of meeting Jay-Z, with whom she was obsessed since a young age. According to her, she literally couldn't have a conversation without quoting a line by him, {{and it was a}} dream come true to collaborate with the artist. Minaj had recorded her lines around four months before the lyrics finally appeared on the song. Minaj described both Jay-Z and West as [...] "icons", and stated that she was blessed to be working with them. In an interview with Rap-Up, Minaj mused [...] "never in a billion years would've <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would've not only been on a song with one of them but both them".|$|E

500|$|The {{mouth of}} the triptych's central figure was also {{inspired}} by the nurse's scream in film director Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in The Battleship Potemkin (1925). In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg confronted Bacon with a reproduction of the centre panel during the filming of a South Bank Show documentary, and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, [...] "I had always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would be able to}} make the mouth with all the beauty of a Monet landscape though I never succeeded in doing so." [...] When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed, Bacon admitted, [...] "It should be all much more colour, should have got more of the interior of the mouth, with all the colours of the interior of the mouth, but I didn't happen to get it." ...|$|E
500|$|A devout Catholic, and {{politically}} social democratic, Logiest decided {{early on to}} favour the Hutu in his decision making in the country. This was partly for security reasons, as Logiest claimed that the Hutu would continue the violence {{as long as the}} Tutsi remained in power, but he also strongly in favour of the revolution on democratic grounds; he saw it as the opportunity for the [...] "oppressed" [...] Hutu peasants to rise up against the Tutsi ruling class. He later wrote in his memoirs: [...] "Some among my assistants <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was wrong in being so partial against the Tutsi and that I was leading Rwanda on a road towards democratisation whose end was distant and uncertain"; but he defended his actions, saying [...] "it was probably the desire to put down the morgue and expose the duplicity of a basically oppressive and unjust aristocracy". After Kigeli and UNAR's retaliation against the Hutu, Logiest and his troops prioritised the protection of Hutu leaders (including Gitera).|$|E

"During {{many years}} I {{collected}} {{notes on the}} origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in {{the first edition of}} my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth." [...] In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: [...] "it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man." ...|$|E

She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be here, winning a Razzie.

500|$|Both Hollywood trade {{publications}} were positive: David Hunter of The Hollywood Reporter predicted {{it to be}} a sleeper hit {{and called}} it [...] "outstanding," [...] while Lael Loewenstein of Variety called it [...] "a visually appealing, well-crafted film [...] an unalloyed success." [...] Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly commented, [...] "I have long <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was born without the gene that would allow me to be emotionally drawn in by drawings. That is, until I saw The Iron Giant." [...] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed that the storytelling was far superior to other animated films, and cited the characters as plausible and noted the richness of moral themes. Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle agreed with the basic techniques as well, and concluded the voice cast excelled with a great script by Tim McCanlies. Amid the positive reviews, a mildly negative review came from The Washington Post Stephen Hunter, who opined, [...] "The movie — as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is — has the annoyance of incredible smugness." ...|$|E
500|$|The figure's {{mouth is}} opened wide as if screaming, an {{expression}} Bacon took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin. In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg asked Bacon about the still, and observed {{that in his}} earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, [...] "I had always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would be able to}} make the mouth with all the beauty of a Monet landscape though I never succeeded in doing so."

500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is set in common time and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. While it is played in the key of C major and has backing piano and guitar sounds, [...] "Alfie" [...] also uses a sample from Sandie Shaw's 1967 Eurovision Song Contest winning song [...] "Puppet on a String". In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I {{want him to do}} something with his life.

500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. I realized that it was a real accident. I mean I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] and [...] "Ramble On" [...] were pointers to the band's musical future. Plant has commented {{that it was only}} during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he started to feel at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for Uncut, he stated [...] "uring Led Zep I (1969) as far as I was concerned, I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to [...] anyway. I didn't feel that comfortable because {{there were a lot of}} demands on me vocally—which there were all the way through the Zeppelin thing.
