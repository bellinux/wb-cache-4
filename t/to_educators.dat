25|$|Studies of {{interventions}} have some methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy. Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that {{some form of}} treatment is preferable to no treatment, the systematic reviews have reported that the quality of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children with ASD acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often can improve functioning, and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. Available approaches include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy. Educational interventions have some effectiveness in children: intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children, and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated <b>to</b> <b>educators,</b> resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. The limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.|$|E

2500|$|Other ways to {{decrease}} youth exclusion include increased intergoup {{contact between the}} differing social positions of the excluders and the excluded. Benefits of inclusion have indeed been measured by sociologists. One such experiment researched elementary aged children to record their personal views on prejudice and social exclusion. The researchers found, [...] "In the present investigation, in accord with prior research (e.g., Crystal et al. 2008; Killen et al. 2007b), ethnic minority students reporting high levels of intergroup contact {{were more likely to}} rate race-based exclusion as wrong than were students with low levels of intergroup contact". Integration of peer groups helps lessen xenophobic reactions to others and fosters inclusion among all members of a society. This realization is helpful <b>to</b> <b>educators</b> who want to create inclusive environments so that youth will feel secure in their learning environments.|$|E

6000|$|The {{results of}} Professor Groos's {{original}} and acute [...] investigations are of peculiar value {{to those who}} are [...] interested in psychology and sociology, and they are of [...] great importance <b>to</b> <b>educators.</b> He presents the [...] anthropological aspects of the subject treated in his [...] psychological study of the Play of Animals, which has [...] already become a classic. Professor Groos, who agrees with [...] the followers of Weismann, develops the great importance of [...] the child's play as tending to strengthen his inheritance in [...] the acquisition of adaptations to his environment. The [...] influence of play on character, and its relation to [...] education, are suggestively indicated. The playful [...] manifestations affecting the child himself and those [...] affecting his relations to others have been carefully [...] classified, and the reader is led from the simpler exercises [...] of the sensory apparatus through a variety of divisions to [...] inner imitations and social play. The biological, æsthetic, [...] ethical, and pedagogical standpoints receive much attention [...] from the investigator. While this book is an illuminating [...] contribution to scientific literature, it is of eminently [...] practical value.
