5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{those who}} {{recovered}} from first-wave infections were now immune {{showed that it}} must have been the same strain of flu. This was most dramatically illustrated in Copenhagen, which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the first wave and 0.27% in the second wave) because of exposure to the less-lethal first wave.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} {{estimating}} the pressure (in lieu of direct measurements) is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these storms did not threaten land. As Kenna and Patricia were threatening land, their pressures were measured by Hurricane Hunters using dropsondes. While Hurricane Ava never threatened land, it too was flown into by Hurricane Hunters to test equipment and conduct research.|$|E
5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy {{before and after the}} first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) {{note that}} most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it {{to the fact that it}} was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland does not {{necessarily}} mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those that have the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixth}} century, Scotland {{experienced}} {{a process of}} Christianisation, traditionally seen as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, including St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. However, Gilbert Markus highlights <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in the historical record. This would have included trade, conquest and intermarriage.|$|E

5|$|Together {{with the}} other broad-minded Finns, the new {{partnership}} constructed a Finnish compromise which eventually delivered stable and broad parliamentary democracy. The compromise was based both on {{the defeat of the}} Reds in the 1918 war and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Whites' political goals had not been achieved. After the foreign forces left Finland, the militant factions of the Red and White lost their backup, while the pre-1918 cultural and national integrity, and the legacy of Fennomania, stood out among the Finns.|$|E
5|$|Rewrite {{marked the}} first time since Key's third game Clannad that Itaru Hinoue was staffed as the sole art {{director}} and character designer in a Key visual novel. The school uniforms for the heroines in the game are old designs that Hinoue created and used before in dōjinshi (self-published work). In particular, Hinoue spent much time on drawing the character art in Rewrite {{due in part to the}} design of the school uniforms, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the female characters have long hair, and because of the increased aspect ratio. Six more graphic artists worked on Rewrite: Torino headed the background art, Ryou Shigawa designed and illustrated the monsters, and the computer graphics in the game were done by Na-Ga, Shinory, Mochisuke, and Minimo Tayama. The game's soundtrack was composed by Key's signature composers Jun Maeda and Shinji Orito, in addition to Maiko Iuchi of I've Sound, Sōshi Hosoi, and Ryō Mizutsuki. Maeda also contributed on the quality control for the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the Natives left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard followed a week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, hoping {{to make more money}} that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds. The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total, including one in New South Wales, but won only three of them, all against relatively weak opposition.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} {{view of the}} Christianisation of Scotland {{has seen}} it as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. Historian Richard Fletcher argued that motivations for these missions may have included the example of St. Patrick, the idea of Peregrinatio and a growing interest in evangelism. Missionaries from Ireland were operating on the British mainland from at least the sixth century. This movement is traditionally associated with the figures of St. Ninian, St. Kentigern and St. Columba. However, historian Gilbert Markus highlights <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in the historical record. This would have included trade, conquest and intermarriage.|$|E
5|$|The unusual surface {{appearance}} of the cerebellum conceals <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its volume {{is made up of}} a very tightly folded layer of gray matter: the cerebellar cortex. Each ridge or gyrus in this layer is called a folium. It is estimated that, if the human cerebellar cortex were completely unfolded, it would give rise to a layer of neural tissue about 1meter long and averaging 5centimeters wide—a total surface area of about 500square cm, packed within a volume of dimensions 6cm × 5cm × 10cm. Underneath the gray matter of the cortex lies white matter, made up largely of myelinated nerve fibers running to and from the cortex. Embedded within the white matter—which is sometimes called the arbor vitae (tree of life) because of its branched, tree-like appearance in cross-section—are four deep cerebellar nuclei, composed of gray matter.|$|E
