This paper shows that the Georgian efforts of decentralization remain superficial, mainly because they are not backed by additional fiscal competences at the municipality level. Following an initial description of the pre-reform situation as of 2006 and based upon a detailed account of the structural changes since 2007, the author gives insight into the conflicts which arise from the lack of institutional congruency. Neither the extraordinary status of the capital Tbilisi nor the seeming autonomy of the Rebublic of Adjara are likely to sway the renegade territories of Abchasia and Ossetia towards a reintegration under Georgian centralized rule as it continues to exist today. Likewise, the success of the proposed and discussed fiscal equalization scheme depends on whether the President and his ruling party are willing <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> <b>powers</b> to the subodinate jurisdictions. decentralization, institutional reform, fiscal equalization, regional autonomy...|$|E

40|$|The {{delivery}} of {{labour market policies}} {{has been subjected to}} a reform processes in all the European Union. Since centralized top-down policies may be ineffective for implementing social policy programs and for fitting the needs of the local labour markets, many countries have started <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> <b>powers</b> and responsibilities to sub-national entities and private actors. Labour markets are now populated by a vast range of intermediaries. The involvement of a flexible network of different players that operate locally is deemed to implement actions that better fit the local labour markets. In principle, a networked model can combine public control over resources and efficiency of targeted actions by a mix of private and public labour services. However, there is the need to investigate its effectiveness and feasibility in detail by means of empirical investigations. The paper contributes to this analysis by examining the initiatives in a specific decentralized setting that represents a significant example of network model: the organization of public employment services in the province of Vicenza, Italy. In particular, this is a case of “networked decentralization” where the local government has a coordination role but, at the same time, specific functions are assigned or delegated to the various private or public players scattered in the territory. The case study is based on direct interviews with the main actors, on the analysis of support systems and services (e. g. databases, job placement portals, etc.), and of available documents. It allows to provide useful insights to researchers and policy-makers into {{the pros and cons of}} local networked models in employment services...|$|E
30|$|ASEAN is {{well-known}} for its informality, personalism {{as well as}} reluctance and discomfort towards the adoption of solid formal institutions and legally binding obligations. The internal dynamics of ASEAN institutions has been designed based on the principal values of the organisation. Accordingly, the avoidance of armed conflict, the non-interference {{in the internal affairs}} of other states, the consensus-based decision making and the non-legally binding agreements give plenty of space for member states to exercise their rights and powers freely as well as to pursue their regional agendas. To some extent, this helps to create a scene of equality in that the smaller member states feel comfortable when dealing with larger partners. The ASEAN’s norms are a strong commitment to the idea of state sovereignty which was ‘the most important protection against the internal and external weaknesses of the ASEAN states’ (Busse 1999 : 46). Collins (2007 : 212) posited that ‘ASEAN was therefore established to ensure sovereignty remained firmly located at the national level’ and clearly not intended to be a supranational institution, equivalent to the European Union. However, as a consequence of its members unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> <b>powers</b> to the institutional bodies, ASEAN lacks effective institutional mechanisms to support, pursue and deliver its objectives and policy initiatives as well as being unable to act against the will of a member state. With the absence of a strong central authority, policy delivery and forceful compliance mechanisms, ‘ASEAN continues to rely primarily on the collective will of its member states, their perceived national interests, and peer pressure to ensure compliance with its agreements and decisions’ (Asian Development Bank 2010 : 125). This situation has resulted in a poor record of implementation and a number of well-voiced criticisms. For instance, ASEAN is often referred to as “a talk shop”, “a toothless tiger” or “big on words but small on action”.|$|E

30|$|Above all, I am {{convinced}} that ASEAN decision-makers {{are aware of the}} institutional weaknesses in ASEAN and want to address. This is evidenced by the introduction of the ASEAN Charter, which was seen as an important step forward for institutional reform as it strengthened its implementation and dispute-settlement mechanisms as well as consolidating its decision-making structure. However, although the ASEAN Charter did empower the existing ASEAN institutions and provided the Association with a juridical foundation, it seems to have codified traditional norms and practices as well as reinforcing the idea of non-intervention (Narine 2008 : 425). Therefore, in the post-Charter era I doubt that ASEAN will become a more effective organisation and all the institutional problems discussed will be properly tackled any time soon. In essence, it would appear to me that all the complications arise from the fact that ASEAN integration does not involve like-minded states in that the members do not share similar political ideologies and values. Furthermore, this political dissimilarity is safeguarded by the association’s norms and the consensus-based decision making, which continue to limit the role of its institutions, thus allowing member countries to enjoy cooperation and exercise power without fear of their sovereignty being at stake. This situation has resulted in deadlock, which has prevented the Association from making any considerable progress and so it ‘remains robustly intergovernmental, with little delegation since it relies on “offshoots” rather than independent agencies to implement policy’ (Capannelli and Tan 2012 : 14). All in all, granting mandates and pouring resources into the central institution will not fully resolve the problems, because it would still lack {{some of the most important}} ingredients for deeper cooperation. That is, in order to maximum benefits from constructing a regional community, this would need centralised policies, some degrees of supranationalism as well as the national governments’ willingness to cooperate and <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|E
40|$|DECENTRALISATION TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN INDIA - A CASE STUDY FROM RAJASTHAN (Desentralisering til lokalstyrer i India - et {{case study}} fra Rajasthan) The {{research}} question "What are {{the powers of}} panchayats in Rajasthan in relation to decentralisation?" The background This thesis {{is based on a}} fieldwork in Rajasthan, more specifically in Jaipur district. The {{purpose of the study was}} to explore the powers of local government in Rajasthan in relation to decentralisation. The three-tiered system of local government in India is known as "panchayati raj", the rule of village councils. Rajasthan is a state which was one of India's princely states prior to Independence. It has feudal traditions, and has been the site of many wars through the centuries. Nowadays, it is among the lesser developed states in India. Average incomes are low and the rates of illiteracy and child mortality are high. Like many other states, Rajasthan has a tradition of village government in the form of a council of elders, but the present system of elected local government is very different in content from the traditional "panchayati raj", rule of the panchayats. The method The method used is a qualitative case study to describe the political process and decisionmaking in the panchayati raj institutions. In this case it means using unstandardized interviews with local politicians, officials and voters to illuminate how much influence these institutions have. This is presented as a case study. The case study can not be used to generalize about the universe of local government units - as a single sample it can only be used for theoretical generalisation. The theoretical perspective Two concepts were central in the exploration of this subject - decentralisation and power. Power may be defined as an actor's (or a unit's) ability to impose his will in a given situation. Decentralisation entails the subdivision of a states territory into smaller areas and the creation of political and administrative institutions in those areas. In this study, decentralisation refers to the territorial distribution of power. It is concerned with the extent to which power and authority are dispersed through the geographical hierarchy of the state, and the institutions and processes through which such dispersal occurs. Centralisation and decentralisation can be seen as two unachievable ideal types that represent opposite ends of a spectrum. The real situation in a system is usually somewhere in between these two extremes. Power relations are seen in the context of decentralisation. Here, the magnitude of panchayats' power in comparison to other organisations at local and other levels is emphasised. The scope of their activity is also regarded as an important factor in determining the power of panchayats in the context of decentralisation. Since power was viewed in the context of decentralisation, the dynamics of the power relationships within for example village panchayats, like which groups dominate the panchayats and who participate most actively is a secondary area of interest. The analysis At the core of my enquiry was an interest in what panchayats are all about, what they do, who participates in them and how much powers they actually have. The overall pattem of decentralisation is drawn by looking at the relationships between levels and between actors at local level. This is seen in terms of inter-level relations, i. e. the central-state-local axis, and intra level relations, i. e. power relations between the three-tiered system and between these political bodies and other actors at local level. How much does the state government affect the decisions made in panchayats? What impact does the central government have on local autonomy? Another interesting issue is the effect that the highly centralised union government has on the state government's desire and ability <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> <b>powers</b> to local institutions. At local level, what are the comparative powers of the three-tiers of the panchayats? What other officials or organisations exercise power at local level? It is important to have a clear picture of alternative holders of power in the areas examined so as to be able to find a tentative answer to the main research question: "What are the powers of panchayats in Rajasthan in relation to decentralisation?" After a skeletal answer to this question is outlined, a more detailed "fleshed out" analysis of various indicators of central-state-local relations follows. This includes a section on decisionmaking on service delivery, problems in the relationship with the administration, the degree of financial autonomy, political party involvement in local politics and institutionalisation...|$|E
