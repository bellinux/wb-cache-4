5|$|Dao: Daos are single-edged Chinese swords, {{primarily}} {{used for}} slashing and chopping. The {{most common form}} {{is also known as}} the Chinese sabre, although those with wider blades are sometimes referred to as Chinese broadswords. In China, the dao {{is considered one of the}} four traditional weapons, along with the gun (stick or staff), qiang (spear), and the jian (sword). The earliest dao date from the Shang Dynasty in China's Bronze Age, and are known as zhibeidao (直背刀)– straight backed knives. As the name implies, these were straight-bladed or slightly curved weapons with a single edge. Originally bronze, these weapons were made of iron or steel by the time of the late Warring States period as metallurgical knowledge became sufficiently advanced to control the carbon content. Originally less common as a military weapon than the jian– the straight, double-edged blade of China– the dao became popular with cavalry during the Han dynasty due to its sturdiness, superiority as a chopping weapon, and relative ease of use– it was generally said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> week to attain competence with a dao/saber, a month to attain competence with a qiang/spear, and a year to attain competence with a jian/straight sword. Soon after dao began to be issued to infantry, beginning the replacement of the jian as a standard-issue weapon. Late Han dynasty dao had round grips and ring-shaped pommels, and ranged between 85 and 114 centimeters in length. These weapons were used alongside rectangular shields.|$|E

25|$|Fluoxetine is a {{racemic mixture}} of (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine where both enantiomers {{contribute}} to its biological activity. Since mono-substitution in the 4-para {{position of the}} phenoxy group (figure 4) results in selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake, a disubstitution i.e. 2,3- or 2,4- substitution therefore results {{in a loss of}} SERT selectivity. Fluoxetine has the widest spectrum of activity since it is the least SERT selective of all the SSRIs. Fluoxetine also has a 5-HT2C antagonist activity where it blocks the 5-HT activity of 5-HT2C receptors enhancing the release of both NE and DA. A 5-HT2C antagonist do not only help out with therapeutic effects of fluoxetine but also the tolerability of the drug. The advantage of being 5-HT2C antagonist is that it has a stimulatory effect and many patients have experienced an increase in energy, concentration and focus and a decrease in fatigue from the very first dose. The stimulant activity of 5-HT2C antagonist can however, be a disadvantage for patients with agitation, insomnia and anxiety. Another feature of fluoxetine is a weak NE re-uptake inhibition which can have clinical effect in higher doses. Fluoxetine also has a long half-life which can reduce withdrawal symptoms which are characteristic for some SSRIs after abrupt discontinuation, but it also means <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> long time to clear the drug and its active metabolite after discontinuing fluoxetine treatment.|$|E

500|$|Dynamite Headdy {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with some}} believing {{it to be}} one of the best games on the Genesis. Journalists repeatedly highlighted the game's creativity as a strong point. Rik Skews of Computer and Video Games said it [...] "breathes new life" [...] into the action-platform genre and stood up to the likes of the Sonic series. The staff at Mean Machines Sega found the game innovative and liked how each stage introduced new concepts to keep gameplay fresh. Tim Tucker at GamesMaster believed that Treasure was doing more innovation in the genre than any of its rivals. In addition to the game's originality, critics praised Treasure's programming expertise and Dynamite Headdys technical prowess. The staff of Electronic Gaming Monthly complimented the game's visual effects and colorful stages. Tucker said [...] "Dynamite Headdy is full of classic Treasure overstatement" [...] and cited the impressive colors, big explosions, large sprites, and rapidly changing backgrounds—which all together were perhaps a little too overwhelming. The Mean Machines staff believed that Dynamite Headdy followed in the footsteps of Treasure's previous games and therefore confirmed the studio's technical expertise. The gameplay drew some criticism, with Tucker finding it somewhat disjointed and [...] "patchy" [...] and Mean Machines stating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> few stages to truly find its footing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{historian}} Nora Chadwick, in a categorization subsequently {{adopted by}} Piggott, divided the Classical {{accounts of the}} druids into two groups, distinguished by their approach to the subject {{as well as their}} chronological contexts.

[...] Finally, he felt that Filmage failed to place the Descendents and All in a wider context, saying [...] "it feels limited in its lack of social or historical context beyond the band’s personal story, with almost zero examination of underground hardcore rock as a reaction against mainstream pop culture in Reagan-era America. Even if Descendents had little personal interest in the politics of punk, {{they were part of a}} wider movement that deserves a more searching film than this." [...] Postmedia News reviewer Jay Stone felt similarly about the segments focusing on Stevenson, remarking that while he [...] "emerges as the key character in Filmage" [...] and forms the film's human interest story, [...] "his personal history, including problems with a distant father and some health issues, is slipped so casually into Filmage <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> while to realize what we’re seeing.
