The cycling is often preceded by a single <b>temperature</b> <b>step</b> at a very high temperature (>), and followed by one hold at the end for final product extension or brief storage. The temperatures used and the length of time they are applied in each cycle depend on a variety of parameters, including the enzyme used for DNA synthesis, the concentration of bivalent ions and dNTPs in the reaction, and the melting temperature (Tm) of the primers.

Due to the sensitivity of high-resolution melting analysis, {{it is necessary to}} carefully consider PCR cycling conditions, template DNA quality, and melting curve parameters. For accurate and repeatable results, PCR thermal cycling conditions must be optimized to ensure that the desired DNA region is amplified with high specificity and minimal bias between sequence variants. The melting curve is typically performed across a broad range of temperatures in small (~0.3 °C) increments that are long enough (~10 seconds) for the DNA to reach equilibrium at each <b>temperature</b> <b>step.</b>|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{are used}} to investigate the connection between thermal history and physical aging in polymer glasses, in particular {{the effects of a}} temperature square step. Measurements of two-time correlation functions show that a negative <b>temperature</b> <b>step</b> causes "rejuvenation" of the sample: the entire spectrum of relaxation times appears identical to a younger specimen that did not experience a <b>temperature</b> <b>step.</b> A positive <b>temperature</b> <b>step,</b> however, leads to significant changes in the relaxation times. At short times, the dynamics are accelerated (rejuvenation), whereas at long times the dynamics are slowed (over-aging). All findings are in excellent qualitative agreement with recent experiments. The two regimes {{can be explained by the}} competing contributions of dynamical heterogeneities and faster aging dynamics at higher temperatures. As a result of this competition, the transition between rejuvenation and over-aging depends on the length of the square step, with shorter steps causing more rejuvenation and longer steps causing more over-aging. Although the spectrum of relaxation times is greatly modified by a <b>temperature</b> <b>step,</b> the van Hove functions, which measure the distribution of particle displacements, exhibit complete superposition at times when the mean-squared displacements are equal.

40|$|Detection of flow {{transition}} on aircraft {{surfaces and}} models can be {{vital to the}} development of future vehicles and computational methods for evaluating vehicle concepts. In testing at ambient conditions, IR thermography is ideal for this measurement. However, for higher Reynolds number testing, cryogenic facilities are often used, in which IR thermography is difficult to employ. In these facilities, temperature sensitive paint is an alternative with a <b>temperature</b> <b>step</b> introduced to enhance the natural temperature change from transition. Traditional methods for inducing the <b>temperature</b> <b>step</b> by changing the liquid nitrogen injection rate often change the tunnel conditions. Recent work has shown that adding a layer consisting of carbon nanotubes to the surface can be used to impart a <b>temperature</b> <b>step</b> on the model surface with little change in the operating conditions. Unfortunately, this system physically degraded at 130 K and lost heating capability. This paper describes a modification of this technique enabling operation down to at least 77 K, well below the temperature reached in cryogenic facilities. This is possible because the CNT layer is in a polyurethane binder. This was tested on a Natural Laminar Flow model in a cryogenic facility and transition detection was successfully visualized at conditions from 200 K to 110 K. Results were also compared with the traditional <b>temperature</b> <b>step</b> method...|$|E

50|$|Cleanrooms provide passive {{cleanliness}} but the wafers {{are also}} actively cleaned before every critical step. RCA-1 clean in ammonia-peroxide solution removes organic contamination and particles; RCA-2 cleaning in hydrogen chloride-peroxide mixture removes metallic impurities. Sulfuric acid-peroxide mixture (a.k.a. Piranha) removes organics. Hydrogen fluoride removes native oxide from silicon surface. These are all wet cleaning steps in solutions. Dry cleaning methods include oxygen and argon plasma treatments to remove unwanted surface layers, or hydrogen bake at elevated temperature to remove native oxide before epitaxy. Pre-gate cleaning {{is the most}} critical cleaning step in CMOS fabrication: it ensures that the ca. 2 nm thick oxide of a MOS transistor can be grown in an orderly fashion. Oxidation, and all high <b>temperature</b> <b>steps</b> {{are very sensitive to}} contamination, and cleaning steps must precede high <b>temperature</b> <b>steps.</b>|$|R
