25|$|The FQPA {{requires}} that pesticide registration be reviewed periodically, {{with a goal}} of once every 15 years. The FQPA mandated changes {{in the collection of}} tolerance fee’s, increasing the amount of fee money from $14 million to $16 million to help with the reassessment of tolerances. The FQPA requires the EPA to specifically screen pesticides for disruption to the endocrine system. The FQPA requires the EPA to establish an integrated pest management education program and implement integrated pest management research and demonstration. The FQPA encourages the syncing of U.S. pesticide tolerances with those of international standards. Under the FQPA individual states are not allowed to set different pesticide tolerances than the EPA and <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> required to coordinate data requirements between the state and federal levels. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> required to develop and distribute a food safety brochure and create an annual report on the progress of its registration program.|$|E

25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or {{sometimes}} U.S. EPA) is an {{agency of the}} federal government of the United States which was created for the purpose of protecting {{human health and the environment}} by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by Congress. President Richard Nixon proposed the establishment of EPA and it began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order. The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate. The agency is led by its Administrator, who is appointed by the President and approved by Congress. The current Administrator is Scott Pruitt. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> not a Cabinet department, but the Administrator is normally given cabinet rank.|$|E

2500|$|The FQPA {{established}} a new safety standard (reasonable certainty of no harm) {{that must be}} applied to all food commodities. In addition to the new standard the EPA now has to consider the specific risks pesticides might have for infants and children. The FQPA required the re-testing of all existing pesticide tolerance levels within 10 years. [...] When assessing this risk <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> required {{to take into account}} the “aggregate risk” (the exposure to a pesticide from multiple sources) and the “cumulative exposure” to pesticides with similar mechanisms of toxicity. To do this <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> <b>is</b> required to establish new science polices to assess the risks. [...] The FQPA requires the EPA to set tolerances for pesticide uses that fall under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (emergency exemptions).|$|E
2500|$|The FQPA {{requires}} the EPA {{to establish a}} list of pests that are considered significant to public health and to give special consideration to pesticides with public health uses.

The EPA answers to various groups, competes for resources, and confronts a wide array of harms to the environment.
